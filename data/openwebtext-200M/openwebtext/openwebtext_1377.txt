SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) --
The case of one of four teens who were cited after rapping their order at a McDonald 's in a Utah city appears headed for trial .
American
Fork police cited the teens for disorderly conduct last month after the drive - through rap .
The teens have said they were imitating a popular video on YouTube .
They rapped their order , which begins with , " I need a double cheeseburger and hold the lettuce ... " once quickly before repeating it more slowly .
Spenser Dauwalder has said employees at the restaurant told him and his friends they were holding up the line and needed to order or leave .
He and his three 17 - year - old friends ended up not buying anything and later were cited .
The 18 - year - old Dauwalder is challenging the disorderly conduct infraction in a Utah County court and on Wednesday a trial was set for January .

I 've previously talked about how to make reverse lookups more efficient using a simple dictionary trick .
Today I want to write about how this can be extended to generic relations .
At its heart , a generic relationship is defined by two elements : a foreign key to the ContentType table , to determine the type of the related object , and an ID field , to identify the specific object to link to .
Django uses these two elements to provide a content_object pseudo - field which , to the user , works similarly to a real ForeignKey field .
And , again just like a ForeignKey , Django can helpfully provide a reverse relationship from the linked model back to the generic one , although you do need to explicitly define this using generic .
GenericRelation to make Django aware of it .
As usual , though , the real inefficiency arises when you are accessing reverse relationships for a whole lot of items - say , each item in a QuerySet .
As with reverse foreign keys , Django will attempt to resolve this relationship individually for each item , resulting in a whole lot of queries .
The solution is a little different , though , to take into account the added complexity of generic relations .
Assuming the list of items is all of one type , the first step is to get the content type ID for this model .
From that , we can get the object IDs , and then do the query in one go .
From there , we can use the dictionary trick described last time to associate each item with its particular related items .
In this example , we have an Asset model that is the generic model , holding assets for other models such as Article and Gallery .
articles = Article .
objects . all ( ) article_dict = dict ( [ ( article . id , article for article in articles ] ) article_ct = ContentType . objects .
get_for_model ( Article ) assets = Asset .
objects .
filter ( content_type = article_type , object_id__in = [ a .
id for a in all_articles ] ) asset_dict = {} for asset in assets : asset_dict .
setdefault ( asset . object_id , [ ] ) . append ( asset ) for id , related_items in asset_dict . items ( ) : article_dict [ id ] .
_assets = related_items
This is good as far as it goes , but what about when we have a heterogeneous list of items ?
That , after all , is the point of generic relations .
So what if our starting point is a collection of both Galleries and Articles , and we still want to get all the related Assets in one go ?
As it turns out , the solution is not massively different : we just need to change the way we key the items in the intermediate dictionary , to record the content type as well as the object ID .
article_ct = ContentType . objects .
get_for_model ( Article ) gallery_ct = ContentType . objects .
get_for_model ( Gallery assets = Asset .
objects . filter ( Q ( content_type = article_type , object_id__in = [ a . id for a in articles ] ) | Q ( content_type = gallery_ct , object_id__in = [ g . id for g in galleries ] ) ) asset_dict = {} for asset in assets : asset_dict .
setdefault ( " %s _ %s " % ( asset .
content_type_id , asset . object_id ) , [ ] ) . append ( asset ) for article in articles : article .
_assets = asset_dict .
get ( " %s _ %s " % ( article_ct .
id , article . id ) , None ) for gallery in galleries : gallery .
_assets = asset_dict .
get ( " %s _ %s " % ( gallery_ct .
id , gallery . id ) , None )

Most times , the mishaps for a distracted walker are minor , like the lightly dinged head and broken fingernail that Ms. Briggs suffered , a jammed digit or a sprained ankle , and , the befallen say , a nasty case of hurt pride .
Of course , the injuries can sometimes be serious  and they are on the rise .
Slightly more than 1,000 pedestrians visited emergency rooms in 2008 because they got distracted and tripped , fell or ran into something while using a cellphone to talk or text .
That was twice the number from 2007 , which had nearly doubled from 2006 , according to a study conducted by Ohio State University , which says it is the first to estimate such accidents .
“ It ’s the tip of the iceberg , ” said Jack L. Nasar , a professor of city and regional planning at Ohio State , noting that the number of mishaps is probably much higher considering that most of the injuries are not severe enough to require a hospital visit .
What is more , he said , texting is rising sharply and devices like the iPhone have thousands of new , engaging applications to preoccupy phone users .
Mr. Nasar supervised the statistical analysis , which was done by Derek Troyer , one of his graduate students .
He looked at records of emergency room visits compiled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission .

Examples of such visits include a 16 - year - old boy who walked into a telephone pole while texting and suffered a concussion ; a 28 - year - old man who tripped and fractured a finger on the hand gripping his cellphone ; and a 68 - year - old man who fell off the porch while talking on a cellphone , spraining a thumb and an ankle and causing dizziness .

DRBD and MySQL - Heartbeat Setup
By Sean Hull
Heartbeat automates all the moving parts and can work as well with the MySQL master - master active / passive solution as well as it can with the MySQL & DRBD solution .
It manages the virtual IP address used by the database , directs DRBD to become primary , or relinquish primary duties , mounts the / dev/drbd0 device , and starts / stops MySQL as needed .
DRBD provides an alternative high availability solution for MySQL .
By effectively putting a mirrored filesystem beneath the database , the Linux operating system is thus replicating all of your data without the database even knowing about it .
In our first two articles on the topic , we discussed some of the strengths and weaknesses of native MySQL statement based replication and then compared and contrasted those with the DRBD based solution .
The advantages are in simplification of management , and elimination of some of the anomalous behavior of MySQL replication .
The potential tradeoffs though are some performance impact , both in how your filesystem will then respond as it has to wait for acknowledgement of writes on remote destinations as well as a performance hit when you failover as the target MySQL database is starting up fresh , and has to warm its cache before performance will equal that on the former primary .
The last piece of the puzzle is the heartbeat software .
Heartbeat automates all the moving parts that we 've discussed so far .
What 's more , heartbeat can also be used with the native MySQL master - master active / passive replication solution , so it 's likely to be in the mix , whatever high availability solution you go with .
What is heartbeat ?
Heartbeat is a daemon that runs on all of the nodes in your cluster .
It communicates with other nodes in the cluster to decide who will be primary , and what that primary will do .
If one of the nodes becomes unresponsive , it will automatically remove it as primary , and make one of the other nodes take over .
It also exposes a virtual IP address for your primary MySQL database to run on .
How does it work with DRBD and MySQL ?
As you 'll recall from previous articles , when switching to an alternate primary , one must ( a ) stop the database ( b ) unmount / dev/drbd0 and ( c ) tell the drbd daemon to be secondary , that is relinquish primary duties .
On the alternate node , you must ( d ) tell drbd that it is now primary ( e ) mount / dev/drbd0 and finally ( f ) startup MySQL .
Heartbeat performs all of these steps , but further it exposes a virtual IP address upon which to run your MySQL database .
Each of the nodes in your cluster will have their my.cnf configured for an alternate virtual IP address of your choosing .
Heartbeat will notify , manage , and take over that virtual IP address for use of the primary server before starting MySQL for you .
What that means is that when your mysql client , be it the mysql shell , apache webserver , or what have you , connects to the database , it will do so through this virtual IP address .
When heartbeat moves that to a new machine , your application will transparently start hitting that alternate database without even knowing the rug was pulled out from under it .
Ingenious !
Setup and Configuration
There are three main files that control heartbeat and we 'll look at each of them in turn .
-- code section -- /etc/ha.d/ha.cf keepalive 1 # time between heartbeat packets deadtime 10 # How fast heartbeat notices dead node warntime 5 # alert about a late heartbeat initdead 120 # time for heartbeat to report dead node udpport 694 # UDP port for heartbeat ping 192.168.1.4 # virtualbox host ip address ( of your laptop ) bcast eth0 # interface to use for heartbeat packets # names of our node hostnames node adelie node african respawn hacluster / usr / lib / heartbeat / ipfail use_logd yes # send messages to / var / log / messages #use_logd no # send messages to / var / log / hb.log logfile / var / log / hb.log # various heartbeat system messages debugfile / var / log / heartbeat - debug.log # debug messages --
The above ha.cf file tells heartbeat how to startup and it's own default settings for pinging , noticing nodes are out , switching , switching back and the names of those nodes and ports .
It does n't tell heartbeat anything about the resources it will manage .
We 'll look at that next .
-- code section -- /etc/ha.d/haresources adelie IPaddr::192.168.1.30/24/eth0 drbddisk ::mysql \ Filesystem::/dev/drbd0::/mnt/mysql::ext2::defaults mysqld --
The above lines tell heartbeat ( a ) what virtual IP address to manage , ( b ) what device and filesystem to mount and / or unmount and how and then ( c ) what service to start , which for us is our database .
-- code section -- /etc/ha.d/authkeys auth 2 2 crc --
This snippet basically disables authentication .
Obviously if you are using this in production you 'll want to configure this , but for our purposes in the virtualbox demo , it wo n't be necessary .
Once you 've edited these three files on both of your nodes , you 'll want to stop MySQL and unmount the filesystem , then startup heartbeat as follows :
$ kill % 1 # assuming you 've run mysqld_safe & $ umount / mnt / mysql $ /etc/init.d / heartbeat start
You will then want to monitor / var / log / messages or hb.log to see what is happening .
$ tail -f / var / log / messages
Heartbeat will take a moment to startup , and you 'll see messages to that affect .
It will wait for a period of time , and decide who to make the primary , then start services on that node , and start MySQL on it's new virtual IP address .
Lastly verify that you can connect to MySQL on the virtual IP address :
$ mysql --host=192.168.1.30 -- port=3306
And that 's it , you 've done it !
Conclusion
Heartbeat brings together the last piece of the puzzle in setting up a high availability cluster for MySQL using DRBD .
What makes it even better is that it works as well with MySQL standard replication as it does with DRBD so you have options there as well .
Lastly , by exposing a virtual IP address and managing the starting and stopping of all the components , heartbeat nicely keeps everything seamless , thus providing a single target virtual database to hit , but multiple underlying server nodes to protect you , eliminating a single point of failure .

Just how deep is Google 's hold on the minds of the world 's netizens ?
So deep that if the web giant boosts a news story about Facebook and logins to the top of its search results , myriad net surfers will mistake the news story for the Facebook login page , wondering why they can't login to it and why it looks nothing like Facebook .
On Wednesday , ReadWriteWeb published a piece about a new Facebook - AOL partnership that will let users integrate their Facebook " friends " with AOL's Instant Messenger , allowing communication between the two services .
The story went on to wonder if Facebook was becoming a central point of web interaction , and in a nod to this bit of editorial , the headline read : " Facebook Wants to Be Your One True Login . "
Well , it would seem that this headline soon shot to the top of Google 's search results for " Facebook login , " and though we can only assume the link was grouped with the " news " results , comments posted the ReadWriteWeb story indicate that many Facebookers visited the story in an attempt to login to Facebook .
" Ok , cool .
Now can I get to facebook ? " one surfer posted .
" The new facebook sucks .
NOW LET ME IN , " wrote another .
" I WANT THE OLD FAFEBOOK [ sic ] BACK .
THIS SHIT IS WACK !!!!! " wailed a third .
" I just want to log in to Facebook - what with the red color and all ?
LOLLLOLOL !!!!! 111 " said a fourth .
And so on .
And so forth .
Ad infinitum .
" I am going to delete my account ( IF I CAN EVER LOG IN ) as this SUCKS BIG TIME !
If this does not get back to NORMAL you are going to lose a lot of folks who hate this and as you can see from all the comments they think it sucks too !!!
facebook was great for connecting with old friends ... now , NOT SO MUCH .
SO HOW DO I LOG IN ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? "
Eventually , ReadWriteWeb added a new paragraph to the middle of its story - in bold letters :
Dear visitors from Google .
This site is not Facebook .

We recommend that you then save Facebook as a bookmark in your browser .
Facebook does want to be the " one true login . "
But clearly , that will take some doing .
Google search is such a web focal point , it 's usurping the duties of the browser itself .
It 's not just that Google has become - literally - a synonym for search .
It 's not just that Google controls 60 to 70 per cent of the search market - and perhaps more .
For so many of the world 's ( rather clueless ) web surfers , Google is more than a search engine .
It 's a gateway to every page they ever visit .
In other words , those top - secret Google algorithms have a tighter grip on the world 's web traffic than you might think . ®
This is a summary of the recent RPS game of Solium Infernum that took place between the end of November and the start of January .
Quinns and KG are doing an admirable job of writing the thing up on RPS itself , but there seems to be some demand for different perspectives on the game and I ’d quite like to narrate things as I saw them anyway , so here we go .
Turn 1 .
This is my avatar , a lovely fellow I ’ve called Scrofula .
The game gives you thirty points to blow on your avatar as you see fit , but with five stats , an infernal rank and a hell of a lot of perks to consider they disappear really fast .
Nine points go to making Scrofula a Duke of Hell ; this is the second - highest infernal rank and should hopefully give me an edge in diplomatic actions .
My one playthrough of the singleplayer side of the game has left me with the charmingly naive impression that resource generation is everything , so the rest of the points go into the stat linked to resource generation – Charisma – along with the Infernal Cardinal perk , which gives me bonuses on my tribute rolls .
I have a couple of points left over after this , which are spent on raising my Martial attribute by a single point .
Building my avatar like this was my first mistake .
My first of many .
Let ’s meet the competition .
I ’ve been dropped on a plateau surrounded by chasms , and I immediately panic as I spot that the only exits from this plateau are – or at least , will very soon be – blocked by other players .
KG ( under the name Ada Lovelace ) has spawned directly in the western exit , so he ’s already blocking it .
Zah ’hak can easily cut off the east .
The south is blocked by a bloody great volcano along with Pandemonium , home of the Infernal Conclave , who are the arbiters of this contest to become next ruler of hell .
While I could theoretically take Pandemonium by force at some point during the game , it would have much the same effect on my chances of winning as killing the referee in a football match .
In other words , it is not a very good idea .
That makes the southern exit a no - go .
Which leaves only one point on the compass remaining .
The northern exit is much wider than the other three , and while Quinns has spawned in half of it I do n’t think he ’s going to waste his time cutting me off ; two Places of Power ( PoPs ) have spawned right next to him and if he goes after them they ’ll take his legion in the other direction .
Sponge ( Amplexeris Bestias ) is also fairly close to this exit and he ’s probably going to be moving that way because of a nearby PoP , the Gates of Hell , but there ’s a mountain range in the way .
I could conceivably beat him to it .
The sole saving grace of my starting position is the close proximity of this PoP .
This is the Temple of Lust .
When you make an avatar in Solium Infernum you need to give that avatar a public objective to fulfil during the game , each of which is based around one of the seven deadly sins .
For example , Gluttony requires you to hoard and consume a vast number of souls , while satisfying the conditions of Envy means stealing anything and everything that is n’t nailed down .
I picked Lust , and the objective of Lust is much simpler : hold the Temple of Lust at the end of the game .
As a bonus it ’s north of my stronghold and I ’m going that way anyway ; the Temple is a little too strong for my starting legion – the Slaves of Scrofula – to take on right now but I can at least stake out a claim around it to prevent any other bugger from doing so .
The Slaves set off northwards .
Turns 2 - 3
Somebody decides that since we ’ve played all of one turn into the game it ’s an excellent time to play the Infernal Crusade event .
Everybody has to contribute a legion to a crusade against the walls of Heaven .
If they do n’t , they lose prestige .
If they do , then that legion is unavailable for several turns and has a chance of being totally destroyed depending on how many other players contributed legions .
Since we ’re only one turn in everybody ’s still stuck with their starting legion , and it would be extremely risky to send that on the crusade because a ) almost nobody else will , increasing the chances of it being killed outright , and b ) it ’ll leave me totally legionless , which is n’t exactly what I want when I ’m desperately trying to break out of this little oubliette .
I ’ve got one chance : the event does make allowances for people who might not have any legions at all , and so it gives you a turn ’s grace to grab one from the Infernal Bazaar and shove it into the ranks of the crusade .
I find the cheapest legion in the Bazaar and bid on it .
Unfortunately Quinns has exactly the same idea .
It later transpires that he and I both bid the exact same amount of resources , overbidding by a soul each .
However , Quinns is a Prince of Hell , the highest Infernal Rank , whereas I ’m merely a Duke .
This is a tiebreaker in Bazaar bidding so the Plague Bearers go to him and I ’m out of luck .
Since I ’m not about to send the Slaves off to the wars I ’m going to have to send nothing at all .
This knocks my prestige down from its starting value of ten down to zero .
The only positive side to this is that Quinns and Sponge were the only ones who did bother to send legions , so KG , Zah ’hak and Speedo Demon have all taken a similar prestige hit .
Turns 4 - 5
I at least get the resources from the failed bid on the Plague Bearers back , so the next turn I make a bid on a Praetor , Zuul .
Praetors are the generals and champions of Hell ; they can be attached to your armies , giving them a stat bonus , and they also fight on your behalf in single combat in the Grand Arena of Pandemonium .
Zuul has some fairly good legion bonuses and she ’s also pretty good in a scrap , so she gets attached to the Slaves of Scrofula .
Who are making good time on their march through the northern gap ; by turn 5 they ’ve reached the Gates of Hell .
With the boost to their fighting strength provided by Zuul ’s leadership they might even have a chance of taking it .
Hooray !
Not only do I get a lump sum of prestige for winning the battle , but holding the Gates gives me a prestige income every turn .
Since prestige is needed to initiate diplomatic actions getting myself out of prestige - bankruptcy is a pretty big deal .
Turn 7 : Good things happen for everyone who is n’t me .
The Black Ring in particular boosts Quinns ’ starting legion , which was already overpowered , to absolutely sickening levels of badassery .
He ’s going to need watching .
Also Zah ’hak attempts to engage in a spot of blackmail by threatening to cut off
Hell ’s resource supply , much like a fairly inept Putin .
I tell him where to shove it .
He carries out his threat next turn , and all hell immediately breaks loose .
Or rather , looser .
Since it ’s no longer possible to get resources through the conventional “ Demand Tribute ” action the only way to obtain them is through threatening other players with diplomatic demands .
Failure to concede to the demand of another archfiend gives them a casus belli , so if Quinns makes a demand of me at this point it ’s probably not a very good idea to say no .
I at least amuse myself by extorting some cards out of Zah ’hak , the architect of our misfortune .
We eventually stagger on to turn 10 .
While Quinns ’ legion was destroyed during the Infernal Crusade , Sponge ’s bodyguard survived very much against the odds and came back with the Infernal Crusade promotion , which – similarly to the Order of the Black Ring – makes them uncomfortably tough .
That ’s two burgeoning military powers I have on my northern doorstep now .
Thankfully Quinns ’ super - legion is a very long way away from me .
He and KG have each grabbed two PoPs apiece – although KG ’s are worse – and are now facing off over the Tree of Woe on the other side of the map , so I do n’t need to worry about either of them for now .
Zah ’hak is laughably weak at the moment , and I do n’t even share a border with Speedo Demon .
This just leaves Sponge .
I ’ve moved the Slaves back down south into my main territory so that they could take the Temple of Lust , but what ’s that next to the Gates of Hell in the north ?
It ’s one of Sponge ’s legions .
Luckily it ’s not the one from the Crusade .
I take a gander at its stats , and it ’s nowhere near powerful enough to take the Gates of Hell from me on its own , but nevertheless …
Sponge insists on making a demand as a pretext to starting a vendetta .
Tune in next time to find out what happens when I tell him to sod off .
Text4Baby , a free mHealth service that " provides timely and expert health information through SMS text messages to pregnant women and new moms through their babies ' first year , " has officially launched today , White House Federal Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra announced during a plenary session at the National Health IT Summit in Washington , D.C .
" I am very proud to announce that the US government is formally announcing the launch of Text4Baby , [ a free health service ] designed to take advantage of the capabilities of cell phones , which have 90 percent penetration in the US .
Starting today , women can text the word " BABY " or in spanish " BEBE " to 511411 and be automatically enrolled at no charge .
The service provides at least three free text messages each week and [ lasts during and shortly after the pregnancy ] .
The messages explain some of the experiences they may be going through and suggests ways for them to " [ keep themselves and their baby healthy ] , Chopra said .
One of the earliest adopters of Text4Baby was a physician working in a small practice in Virginia who wanted to offer the service to her patients .
Every pregnant woman ( less than 34 weeks pregnant ) who visits the doctor 's office is invited to sign up for Text4Baby free of charge , regardless of insurance or financial status , Chopra said .
During the first month 80 patients subscribed to the service from this particular physician 's office .
Chopra reported that soon after offering Text4Baby , a teenage woman visited the doctor 's office for a follow - up visit and admitted that she was n't planning on coming to the visit , but her Text4Baby reminder convinced her and reminded her that she should .

Text4Baby aims to address the U.S. infant mortality public health crisis :
More than 500,000 babies are born prematurely every year in the U.S. , and an estimated 28,000 children die before their first birthday , according to the Text4Baby press release .
" Last night Dr. Drew talked about [ Text4Baby ] on his TV show on MTV , called ' Teen Mom . '
Following the program some 1,200 people signed up , " Chopra told the audience in DC .
" This morning I heard that 3,400 have signed up , " he said .
Text4Baby 's launch is remarkable for a number of reasons , including its impressive list of collaborators : National Healthy Mothers , Healthy Babies Coalition ( HMHB ) , Voxiva , MTV Networks , CTIA , Grey Healthcare Group ( a WPP company ) , Johnson & Johnson , WellPoint , Pfizer , CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield , the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , HHS , Department of Defense Military Health System , BabyCenter , Danya International , Syniverse Technologies , Keynote Systems and The George Washington University .
Fifteen U.S. carriers have agreed to carry the program 's text messages at no cost for two full years .
The participating carriers are : Alltel , Assurance Wireless , AT&T , Boost Mobile , Cellular South , Cellcom , Centennial Cellular , Cincinnati Bell , Metro PCS , N - Telos , Sprint Nextel , T - Mobile , U.S. Cellular , Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile USA .
" I specifically want to thank Paul Meyer from Voxiva ... for organizing and pulling together the different groups and resources for Text4Baby .
Tax dollars did not participate [ in the funding of Text4Baby ] , " Chopra said .
" It would have taken three years to procure the funding , " he joked .
Voxiva founder Paul Meyer told MobiHealthNews following Chopra 's presentation that General Mills has agreed to promote Text4Baby on the back of some of its cereal boxes , including Cheerios , in the coming months .
Meyer also noted that the list of collaborators has grown to well over 100 partners at the state and local level , too .
Some state health departments will being inserting Text4Baby promotional materials and invitations in the birth certificates they mail out to new mothers .
For many state health departments , payers groups and government organizations , Text4Baby is a way to try out mobile health and see if it works , Meyer said .
" From Voxiva 's perspective : Text4Baby will hopefully open up people 's eyes and help them realize that we can do this for others health - related conditions like asthma , diabetes and so on .
What we have really done with Text4Baby is created a massive distribution network for mHealth services .
Take a look at our list of partners -- most of them are not wholly focused on pregnancy issues .
When people ask us :
If we can do this for pregnancy , can we do this for ' XYZ ' ?
Our answer is : Yes , we can . "
Text4Baby could become one of the biggest mHealth launches ever , according to Meyer .
After reviewing the long list of partners , ( which is growing virally now without a lot of input from Voxiva , Meyer said ) , it 's hard to disagree .
MobiHealthNews has written a number of stories about Text4Baby over the past year :
Voxiva , White House to launch Text4Baby

We are excited about mHealth
Text4Baby to launch soon ?

Berlin , 8.1.2010 – Die Berliner Piratenpartei kritisiert scharf den Beschluss der Gewerkschaft der Polizei ( GdP ) , die geplanten Namens - oder Nummernschilder für Polizisten abzulehnen .
Sie fordert Polizeipräsident Dieter Glietsch auf , an der für dieses Jahr geplanten Einführung der Schilder festzuhalten .
Informationelle Selbstbestimmung und den Schutz der Privatsphäre halten die Piraten jedoch auch im öffentlichen Dienst für wichtig .
Statt Namensschildern fordern sie daher eine Nummernkennzeichnung .
„ Auch Polizisten haben ein Recht auf Privatsphäre , polizeiliches Handeln muss aber transparent und verfolgbar werden “ , fordert Florian Bischof , Vorstandsmitglied der Berliner Piratenpartei .
„ Der Vorfall auf der von der Piratenpartei unterstützten Demonstration „ Freiheit statt Angst “ , auf der ein Polizist einem Demonstranten grundlos und brutal ins Gesicht schlug , zeigt :
In einem Rechtsstaat muss es möglich sein , sich gegen ungerechtfertigte polizeiliche Eingriffe zu wehren .
Dafür müssen Polizisten aber eindeutig identifiziert werden können .
Als Datenschutzpartei nehmen wir aber natürlich die Bedenken der Gewerkschafter sehr ernst .
Die informationelle Selbstbestimmung der Polizisten muss berücksichtigt und ihre Privatsphäre geschützt werden , damit ihnen und ihren Familien ein anonymes Privatleben möglich ist .
Die Berliner Piratenpartei fordert daher : Nummern ja , Klarnamen nein .
Nummernschilder reichen aus , um im Konfliktfall die Rechte der Opfer polizeilicher Gewalt durchsetzen zu können .
Sie erlauben eine eindeutige Zuordnung – aber eben nicht für jeden . “
Der Personalrat der Polizei hat in seiner heutigen Sitzung die von Polizeipräsident Dieter Glietsch geplanten Nummern - oder Namensschilder abgelehnt .
Glietsch hatte die Schilder gemeinsam mit den neuen blauen Uniformen noch 2010 einführen wollen .
In vielen europäischen Ländern tragen Polizisten bereits vergleichbare Schilder .
Auch mit tausenden freiwillig getragenen Schildern hat es bislang keine Schwierigkeiten gegeben .

Thailand 's former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh recently ignited a furore when he proposed that the separatist campaign in his country 's Muslim - majority southern provinces might be solved politically , with a form of self - rule .
Thailand 's ruling Democrat party immediately called Chavalit 's remarks " traitorous " .
But recent developments surrounding Afghanistan 's elections have highlighted the shortcomings of using military force alone to resolve a civil war .
This precedent offers an important lesson for Thailand and other countries facing intractable insurgencies .
As Aristotle put it , " politics is the master science in the realm of action " .
In June 2006 , I sat in a village in southern Thailand 's Yala province with several ordinary - looking young men who had taken part in extraordinary events .
They had joined the militants who had attacked a dozen security checkpoints across three southern provinces on 28 April , 2004 .
Armed mainly with machetes and kitchen knives , 106 attackers perished that day , 32 of them inside Pattani 's historic Krue - Se mosque , where they had taken refuge .
Five members of the Thai security forces were also killed .
None of the youths I talked to could give any clear explanation for their actions , except to say that an Islamic schoolteacher known as Ustadz So had recruited them into a shadowy militant movement .
Ustadz had taught them that Thai rule over this historically Malay region was illegitimate , that Thai officials were cruel and heartless , and that the time had come for the Muslim population to rise up and expel the Buddhist infidels .
According to counter - insurgency expert David Kilcullen , the violence in Thailand 's deep south – which has now claimed more than 3,500 lives – was some of the most intense in the world between 2004 and 2007 , " second only to Iraq and Afghanistan during this period . "
Yet , despite such alarming levels of bloodshed , the insurgency has been under - reported and under - researched , barely registering on the international community 's radar screen , largely because the conflict cannot be reduced to a sound - bite - friendly narrative of identifiable bad guys and good guys .
First , the militant movement itself has no name , operating in a highly decentralised manner through small local cells that operate relatively independently – what might be described as self - managed violence franchises .
Thai political expert Chaiwat Satha - Anand has called the movement a " network without a core " .
The lack of a defined enemy makes reporting on and understanding the conflict difficult for journalists , diplomats , and government officials .
Second , outcomes are not predictable .
On 28 April , 2004 the insurgents ' primary targets were Buddhist members of the security forces , but most of those who died were Malay Muslims .
The would - be perpetrators also became the primary victims .
Some victims have been killed extra-judicially .
The one group not targeted by anyone has been westerners .
Again , reporting such a messy story is a challenge ; most western news editors have preferred to highlight Iraq and Afghanistan .
A third factor is that the violence has become a marginal issue even within Thailand .
The breaking news teams returned to Bangkok long ago , where a military coup , ongoing mass protests , and other big political stories have kept them busy ever since .
And , because the violence tends to come in dribs and drabs – rarely since 2004 has any one day 's casualties reached double figures – the south has never risen back up the news agenda .
Many
Thai military and police officials now privately admit that the insurgency cannot be defeated through security measures .
After a dip in the number of incidents during late 2007 and 2008 , violence once again increased in 2009 .
The military 's belief that Malay Muslims could be re-educated and re-socialised into accepting a Thai identity has proved untenable .
The same goes for earlier hardline rhetoric about rooting out the militants and destroying their organisation .
The current government under prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva misses the point with rhetoric about creating peace simply through promoting justice , or by funding large - scale socio-economic development projects .
Malay Muslims in Thailand 's southern provinces are demanding their own political space .
Few of them seriously believe that a tiny separate Patani state , wedged between Thailand and Malaysia , would be viable .
What many are seeking is some form of special status within Thailand , enabling them to pursue their own cultural and religious traditions without interference from Bangkok .
Until the Thai government grasps this simple point , young men like those I met in Yala will still be recruited into militant activity .
As Chavalit understands , the southern
Thai conflict is a political problem in need of a political solution – just like Afghanistan and other more familiar wars .

Not much time to write today , so even more plain - spoken than usual — which means all 14 of you out there will even be appalled .
There ’s a lot of bloviation about collapse going on , and people like it , because it implies an easy answer .
The old stuff just explodes ; we then build something new .
It sounds so easy , starting at square one .
Two big problems :
Nothing happens slowly .
With big things like nation , it ’s a long slow slope of several hundred years .
In fact , we ’re in the middle of such a process and a larger one by which our parent culture has been falling apart steadily .
There are no new ideas .
We know the basic types of government ; we can fine - tune these , but calling any idea “ new ” is really dubious .
Historically , statistically , most revolutions and explode - build - new situations end with rebuilding of the old order .
These are super - radical and offensive ideas right now because they ’re super - radical and offensive ideas in every age .
Let ’s do an illusion / reality chart :
Illusion Reality
Free will : we are autonomous beings who choose our futures Biology : we are a collection of nerve impulses and chemical needs that believes in free will to explain its actions as “ decisions ” not impulses .
Open - minded : we ’re open to any idea and have a good idea how to pick the ones that will work out .
Cloaking : we like things that appear new , aesthetically , but really we ’ll endorse anything that weakens the demands of the world on us , and we have no idea how it will work out .
Victims : this world is divided between victim and oppressor , and we are usually the victims , so we must fight back against large governments , corporations and religions .
Competition : many ideas / designs compete through their avatars , meaning that a particular DNA sequence or corporate charter and product design is going to fight it out with all others , and whatever prevails is our new working design .
People power : if we all just band together , unite as equals , and work together , we ’ll make things happen Inequality : actually , that ’s what we have been doing , but it does n’t always work , mainly because not everyone has the same brains so some can see farther than others , and the others then oppose them Separation : government and people are separate , and government should work for its people Unity : government should work for an abstract ideal that benefits its people , and will use — and sacrifice some of — its people toward that end .
Benevolence : we all try to be nice to others because we love others .
Status : we try to be nice to others so we can be seen being nice to others so we can compete on the moral / popularity level of appearance .
Altruism does n’t exist .
As you can see , the people bloviating about collapse are about fifteen steps behind accepting reality , so they concoct a nice Disney teen movie narrative :
In A.D. 2014 , the evil nexus of large corporations , the Church and Republican politicians finally pushed its luck too far .
The people rose up and instead of being guided by fear , joined hands and overthrew their oppressors , ushering in a new time when peace , love and happiness ruled the land .
You ’ll believe that crap when you ’re 18 - 32 and have few responsibilities in life , therefore have become unacquainted with how hard you have to work — mentally — in order to get anything to really succeed .
Entry level jobs , school , early disposable relationships , social success … these all follow a linear course by which you succeed by doing more of and better of whatever others have done .
The world beyond this stage : you must conceptualize what it is you want to do , and there ’s no archetype to follow .
Of course , the astute among you are going to ask : but what about people who never progress beyond entry - level jobs , apartment - renting , irresponsible family life living ?
Answer : they remain children for life , and their opinions are those of children and should be ignored .
What I ’ve said so far works toward a single point : the “ collapse mentality ” people are living in a dream .
Our society is n’t going to suddenly explode and be re-made in a future world where we use logarithmic coefficients of our inner peace to determine who gets fed and who does n’t .
It ’s still competition .
Even more , we ’re not going to explode suddenly , but transition gradually — think of how mountains become beaches — into a different stage of the process .
Briefly : how Plato outline the process of civilization was a life cycle .
Civilizations have reckless youths , moderate maturities , and in their old age and dying time , become detached from reality itself .
A simplification : aristocracy and competition is our youth ; democracy and equal rights our maturity ; insane oligarchs and tyrants our old age .
But his bigger point was that each leads to the other , unless of course we intervene with forceful leadership .
In other words , our maturity of democracy is already a path to decline unless we reverse it .
One of the great illusions people like to have is that history just happens to us , and we should lie back and think of England , but the historical record shows that it does n’t happen on the same time frame universally .
Rather , intervention by strong centralized forces can save the day — while we can observe that nature operates in a decentralized way , we can also see how for us to succeed , we always must change how nature is acting on us , and in groups we do this with strong centralized authority .
Think about camping : you need to make a fire , so you gather wood and burn it — not natural .
When you ’re camping in a group and need a big fire , you tell other people to conform to a standard , bring back wood and collaborate to light it .
Otherwise , you get lots of little fires that burn out quickly because it ’s hard work , this gathering wood thing .
People in democracies head toward slow collapse because they are dependent on illusions .
When your politicians win election by saying things people like to hear , consequences become secondary to feelings and image .
As a result , the way we think splits from “ how will this turn out ? ” to “ how does this make me feel ? ”
That ’s a fundamental bias against reality and is why we end up ruled by tyrants : a huge mass of selfish people pursue what is convenient and easy , ignoring consequences , until the problems they create pile up so much they demand an easy solution , which is always strong central authority .
Of course , they pick that strong authority from their existing elites , who are corrupt like the rest of the citizens , and so they get a tyrant .
You can imagine an axis of civilizations , with the Vikings on one end and Brazil or Africa on the other .
The Vikings were highly competent , intelligent people ruled by wise kings , who extended a quality of life to their citizens rarely seen in our world — and also had citizens of high intelligence and knowledge , on the whole .
Brazil , on the other hand , is a third - world country ruled by cruel oligarchs who manipulate an illiterate population for their own ends .
In pollution , deforestation , murder , rape and dysfunction it leads the world .
Lest you think this is a rant against Brazil : there have been many Brazils , like there have been many USAs , because if you organize your nation a certain way , you end up at Brazil status .
Certainly ancient Greece , Rome and India ended up being Brazils after their collapses .
I predict the same for the USA .
Third world countries are interesting because there are smart people there — but they ’re a tiny minority , and tend to be either part of the elites or are totally marginalized and live in isolation .
Look at Mexico or Argentina ; a lot of smart people there .
But they ’re prisoners in their own country , and their low numbers and disunity mean they do not rule it but are ruled by the masses and their manipulators , which leaves them no choice but to get rich , get that gated community and get out of the game — which works until the masses really organize , get an extreme Socialist in power , and seize the wealth from those who earned it .
This pattern repeats again and again , and one consequence is that many of these elites get killed — the rich for being rich , the isolated for not being all gung - ho about the new dogma — which reduces the average population IQ and the number of smart people there .
So what ’s our collapse , now that we know it ’s a slow decline into Brazil and not a fast drop into Mad Max , look like ?
A lot like how science fiction told us it would be — notably , Have Space Suit , Will Travel ; Blade Runner ( Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? ) ;
Neuromancer : a polluted industrial urban landscape in which much is ruined enough to not succeed , but never enough to stop working , and in which the ueber - wealthy few rule over masses of people living in squalor , addicted to entertainment and intoxicants , and joining political movements based on the It ’s Someone Else ’s Fault ( ISEF ) principle .
Part of the decline is that ISEF becomes our standard response , and we start expecting it — and only accepting solutions that involve some large governmental structure or economic system having “ failed us ” and dying :
1. Collapse is now inevitable Capitalism has been the engine driving America and the global economies for over two centuries .
Faber predicts its collapse will trigger global “ wars , massive government - debt defaults , and the impoverishment of large segments of Western society . ”
Faber knows that capitalism is not working , capitalism has peaked , and the collapse of capitalism is “ inevitable . ”
When ?
He hesitates : “ But what I do n’t know is whether this final collapse , which is inevitable , will occur tomorrow , or in five or 10 years , and whether it will occur with the Dow at 100,000 and gold at $ 50,000 per ounce or even confiscated , or with the Dow at 3,000 and gold at $ 1,000 . ”
But the end is inevitable , a historical imperative .
MarketWatch
Capitalism is n’t the problem ; civilization decay is .
We confuse capitalism the advanced system of shuffling paper around — what Kevin Phillips calls “ re-financialization , ” or the selling of existing wealth in new forms instead of the creation of new wealth through manufacturing , invention and agriculture — with capitalism the process by which we buy and sell and compete .
Money is n’t going away , nor is this essential decentralized process by which in a healthy society , better products win out over lesser ones .
But what if the audience can’t tell the difference ?
That ’s the origin of the problem with “ capitalism , ” in that people would rather spend $ 300 on video games and movies instead of $ 300 on stocks or tools , and it ’s a symptom of the decline , not its cause .
That article redeems itself a paragraph later :
A crisis hits .
We act surprised .
Should n’t .
But it ’s too late : “ Civilizations share a sharp curve of decline .
Indeed , a society ’s demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak population , wealth and power . ”
Warnings are everywhere .
Why not prepare ?
Why sabotage our power , our future ?
Why set up an entire nation to fail ?
Diamond says : Unfortunately “ one of the choices has depended on the courage to practice long - term thinking , and to make bold , courageous , anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they reach crisis proportions . ”
Indeed .
And even more : what if we look in the wrong areas , and are trying to blame government , economics and religion for our problems , instead of looking to the cause ?
Why do we seem to be plagued with 3rd - world country problems when we should be , by all rights , near ( or at ) the very top of the quality - of - life index ?
I ’ve been mulling this over for quite a while , and here ’s where I ’m at .
I ’m curious to get feedback .
Why do we allow ourselves to be taken advantage of ?
Wall Street bailout , wildly unpopular wars , no universal healthcare , we basically just roll over and take it .
In France , the entire country came to a standstill because of protests and whatnot over some relatively small changes to the eduction system .
Could you ever imagine anything happening like that here ?
Look back at the 60s and the anti-vietnam war movement .
Aside from some mostly symbolic marches in major cities , what have we done to show our discontent with the whole Iraq / Afghanistan thing ?
The problem is us .
We do n’t give a fuck .
I ’d like to say the education system is to blame , but the reality of it is that people in the US have never really valued education .
We deride people who are academically - inclined or educated , we praise the “ self - made man ” who made something of himself without the need for formal training , we call them nerds , book - worms .
No , we do n’t value education , we do n’t value culture , we rejected everything the “ old world ” taught us – threw the baby out with the bath - water , so now all we have left is an obscene culture of self - indulgence , self - gratification and self - obsession .
We ’d be off oil in a month if we wanted , if we really truly wanted .
But instead we watch our blu - ray DVDs in front of our nice new black friday purchased plasma screen TV ( pointing the finger squarely at myself here ) , maybe throw $ 10 at some charity so we can look ourselves in the mirror and not want to vomit from disgust .
But in the end , it all falls squarely on our shoulder .
The reason this country is going to shit is because you and I , we ’re not willing to give up our creature comforts , not willing to get off our asses and do something about it .
Reddit
While the author of that comment goes on to endorse the fallacy that if we all just get involved , unite and people power and all that , the problem will end — unlikely , since most are clueless about the means and demands of power ; a workable solution is to pick better leadership and not “ hold them accountable ” on the basis of image and not long - term , meaning 50 or 100 years , performance — the portion quoted above is the vital question .
If a civilization is declining , its people are declining .
They have become detached from reality , and asserting reality is unpopular because it clashes with the happy image of this form :
We should all unite
We ’re all equal in ability
We need more compassion and empathy
We need to protect victims
We must raise up the poor
All of these are social sentiments , more appropriate to polite cocktail party conversation or advertising , but not political sentiments .
They have nothing to do with the problem and are the sort of idle chatter we make about situations we cannot fix and have no hope of trying .
With that attitude , no wonder we ’re in decline .
I offer a competing wisdom :
Until we make truth and not image a priority , our decline will continue .
As long as we keep electing leaders who give us warm fuzzies instead of cold - hearted clear - eyed warriors for making things work , our decline will continue .
To lead is not just to make people happy ; it ’s to make some unhappy so that civilization , as an organic whole , can survive .
It ’s similar to how we let some cells in our body die so that the whole can live on .
Keeping the individual pacified is a means to control , not the replacement of control .
Control is always going to exist , because without centralized authority , we cannot make decisions as a civilization , and so are bound to a lowest common denominator lack of decision which results in high socialized cost , bad behavior going unpunished , good behavior going unrewarded , and as a result , a breakdown of social order .
Modern authoritarian states have eagerly ( but selectively ) embraced globalisation to provide their citizens with at least a modicum of self - actualisation without ever abandoning their authoritarianism .
Their young people travel the world , learn English , use Skype and poke each other on Facebook â€ “ all while competing for comfortable jobs with state - owned companies .
We are entering the age of â€œaccommodating authoritarianismâ€ â€ “ and the internet has played a crucial ( though hardly the only ) role in providing many of the accommodations .
The reason why the Chinese can download Weeds or Mad Men from peer - to - peer networks is not because the Chinese government can no longer police the web .
Itâ€™s because watching Weeds and Mad Men is what young people living under contemporary authoritarians are supposed to do .
These societies no longer operate in the world of cultural scarcity ; itâ€™s hard to nudge them towards dissent with the promise of blue jeans or prohibited vinyl records .
For every Chinese blogger that the techno - utopians expect to fight their government via Twitter , there are a hundred others who feel content with the status quo .
In one respect , then , authoritarian states and modern democracies are very much alike : both have embraced hedonism as their main and only political ideology .
The recent outburst of techno- utopianism in the West may thus be just another futile attempt to imagine a world where the purest ideal of Athenian democracy , uncorrupted by special interests and popular culture , is not only possible but could actually be facilitated by its more corrupt , frivolous , and somewhat culpable western sibling .
This , of course , is an illusion .
Citizens of modern authoritarian states face a choice between hedonism with stable prosperity ( their status quo ) and hedonism with unstable prosperity â€ “ the hedonism that may follow a tumultuous transition to democracy .
The National
Hedonism keeps the people inert .
If their main goal is self - pleasure , all political activity is an afterthought — and if we all have enough food and entertainment , why agitate ?
We are immobilized by our comfort , and it divides us into 300 million individuals instead of an organic whole that can make decisions .
So our leaders remain in power and benefit at the expense of the others .
Our apathy as individuals , and their decision to profit at the expense of the rest , are part of the same disease : the individualism that insists on comfort , convenience and personal status as more important than the health of our civilization .
In exchange , we develop what are called “ surrogate activities ” which generally consist of talking with others , writing insignificant blog pots , and agitating among those who agree .
We use this narrative :
We the people who are n’t rich are going to destroy the rich , overthrow governments , and burn down religion , so we can be 100 % free .
( At that point , we ’ll encounter the same problems that caused our ancestors to create government , religion and wealth , and we ’ll then collapse in infighting . )
But until then , our friends like to hear how we ’re going to beat back the bastards , so join up !
It ’s fun !
It ’s not a lynch mob if you mean well !
This is the real modern paralysis : we seek selfish individualism , deny reality as a result , and then are manipulated by image because that ’s all that counts — mainly because of our dishonesty and urge to keep pursuing our individualistic ends and ignoring the consequences .
Divided we fall .
United … well , how can you unite when most people are repeating chaotic dogmas for their own benefit ?
We flatter ourselves that we ’re becoming more tolerant and more gentle , but really , we ’re just allowing ourselves to be walked all over :
“ My hair was down to my waist for 20 years , ” she said .
“ I woke up bald — no teeth , 85 staples in my head — out of a drug - induced coma . ”
Two hours after the photo was taken , Hall and Hoffman were attacked by a homeless man , Derrick King , near Wabash Avenue and Roosevelt Road , after telling him they did n’t have any cigarettes .
King and a second person then beat , stomped and kicked Hall unconscious , she said .
When King , 48 , pleaded guilty this October to two criminal charges in the attack and was sentenced to three years in prison , Hall and Hoffman thought he would n’t be able to harm anyone else — at least for a while .
But just 18 days after that plea , state records show , King was paroled as part of the early - release program that Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday called “ a big mistake . ”
And the next day , King allegedly threatened another woman , near the same place he attacked Hall , yelling , “ Remember the couple who got beat real bad for not giving a cigarette ?
That was me , ” police said .
Chicago Tribune
Because we cannot face our problems , they rule us .
We cannot admit — for the sake of social image and seeming like nice people — that some people are born bad , or become bad , but either way they ’ll do nothing but victimize good people until we destroy them .
Our education and rehab programs do n’t work , and a century of intense psychological analysis has produced more neurotic people , not fewer .
We are even more forever caught up in an obsession with “ helping the unfortunate , ” but that itself is a replacement activity for fixing a civilization — an activity which would benefit us all , rich or poor .
We do n’t like to think that we are not autonomous free will beings of a godlike intellect , and that in fact , our abilities are determined at birth and our ability to act limited by those .
As our society goes into another paroxysm of battling for gay rights , immigration rights , diversity , class warfare , mental health for the criminal , and so on , remember that these three issues converge :
Ethnicity ( “ Race ” )
Class
Economic inequality
As we showed above , if you ’re from a failed civilization you are most likely to have a lower IQ and have had the impulse to fix problems bred out of you .
Further , different groups evolved for different climates and cultural / social needs , meaning that inequality is inherent to ethnicity .
We cannot say that a given individual has certain abilities because they are of x ethnicity , but we can say that as a whole , x ethnicity is positioned relative but not equally to others .
Even more , we can say that mixing different groups will produce an averaging effect because they are so different , not a refinement .
Best of all , as shown above , we can see that the mania for “ diversity ” is just another form of class / inequality warfare that we ’re engaging in as a substitute for fixing our problems .
We ’re using these people to avoid our own problems .
Class is a similar issue .
What ’s your IQ ?
This determines what jobs you are going to do and how well you will do them .
If your IQ is below 100 , you are an unskilled laborer for life .
If your IQ is above 100 but not above 115 , you ’re going to have a simple job with minimal specialization .
Starting at 115 , which is where the middle classes of the world occur , you ’ll see specialization and higher performance .
125 and above are the elites .
Can you think of any exceptions ?
Economic inequality is the result of this IQ inequality .
Some people are born to be poor , others to be rich , and most in the middle somewhere .
Some civilizations , having failed , produce a vast majority of lower IQ people and a few smarter ones .
Class war , ethnic conflict , and economic inequality have a common origin : biological inequality .
We like to pretend this does n’t exist and flatter each other , but it ’s the real stumbling point to our future — not everyone can unite , be happy and work together , because most cannot understand what needs to be done even if told in plain language .
At this blog , we spin it as we see it — meaning zero spin — so that those who are n’t yet brain - dead can see what the future requires : taking control from the masses , implementing a government based on results and not image , and tossing all this manipulation of feelings , popularity and advertising into the trash bin of history where it belongs .

Among others who were lent money , Mr. Giannoulias ’s opponents noted , was Antoin Rezko , a real estate developer and political fund - raiser whose ties to them  and whose conviction for fraud and bribery  have embarrassed more than a few Illinois politicians .
And the notion that Republicans may lump in Mr. Giannoulias as part of this state ’s Democratic troubled political establishment , given the embarrassments involving Mr. Blagojevich ( whose corruption trial will begin right in the middle of this campaign season ) and others , worries some Democrats as they think ahead to November .
In an interview on Wednesday , Mr. Giannoulias said that he had not worked at his family ’s bank for four years and that , like thousands of American family businesses , his was “ not immune ” to challenges created by “ bad decisions in Washington , D.C. , and lax oversight on Wall Street . ”
“ It ’s telling , ” Mr. Giannoulias said of Mr. Kirk , “ that while I ’m talking about ideas and creating jobs in Illinois , he ’s focused on ridiculous political attacks .
What people are looking for is someone who is talking about ideas . ”
At a time when bankers and Illinois politicians hardly seem popular , Mr. Giannoulias has already begun portraying Mr. Kirk as a different stereotype that has faced backlash in recent elections  a Washington insider .
Mr. Kirk , who is 50 and has served five terms in Congress , “ is steeped in Washington , D.C. , politics , ” Mr. Giannoulias said .
Without doubt , political analysts here said , Mr. Kirk , like all Republicans , faces an uphill challenge in a general election in Illinois .
Though each campaign claimed Wednesday that it had polls showing its candidate ahead , the clear trend over the past decade shows that more of the state ’s 7.5 million registered voters consider themselves Democrats than Republicans .
( Illinois voters do not formally register with a party . )
Mr. Kirk , who has favored abortion rights and cap - and - trade legislation intended to reduce carbon emissions , irks some of the most conservative Republicans in this state , including some who describe themselves as supporters of a Tea Party movement .
He has since said he would oppose the cap - and - trade bill , a switch some saw as an effort to appeal more to conservatives .
But political analysts believe his best chances of success may actually depend on him seizing independents and fed - up Democrats  segments that may have helped moderate Republicans , like James Edgar and James R. Thompson , former governors , win in this state years ago .

Both the United States and the United Kingdom have had a coordinated non-response to financial reform .
If a drunk driver killed your neighbors and crashed the car into your house , you would n't expect a police officer to hand the offender a bottle of whiskey and the keys to a bigger , faster , and more powerful car .
You would be outraged if the officer said he would only impose a fine , and then made you lend the drunk the money to pay the fine .
Yet this is the modus operandi of our financial system , and now financial drunk drivers refuse blood tests and huff that their seat belts were fastened .
Both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner missed the critical warning signs of our recent financial crisis .
In April of 2009 , Steve Forbes called Geithner " the most formidable impediment to an economic recovery . "
Ben Bernanke repeats past mistakes and hands out cheap money with insufficient conditions or regulation .
Both economists have been economical with the truth .
There were alternatives to their actions during the crisis that are based on sound financial principles and do not violate the spirit of democracy .
President Obama has proposed a baby step towards financial reform .
He proposes to limit ill - defined proprietary trading , limit banks ' borrowings , and prevent banks from investing in hedge funds and private equity funds .
Banks ' lobbyists and PR spin-doctors are already working overtime to thwart him .
Mainstream financial media got it badly wrong when it said that the proposal was based on populist anger .
It may have motivated President Obama to ( only partly take ) Paul Volcker 's advice , but sound financial principles back that advice .
Some bank stocks fell in price after the President 's remarks yesterday .
That was because savvy investors knew that speculators might no longer be able to report high risk - based earnings subsidized with taxpayer dollars .
In this case , a fall in stock prices for banks driving down Wall Street should be viewed as a healthy sign .
A few bank stocks rose , because they rely on traditional banking backed by sound financial principles .
Goldman Sachs 's stock went down a few percentage points .
It became a newly created " bank , " to get on the taxpayer give - away gravy train .
JPMorgan
Chase claims only 1 % of its revenue comes from proprietary trading , yet even before its merger with Bear Stearns , JPMorgan 's market share of credit derivatives was greater than 50 % for U.S. banks .
That meant you could combine the credit derivatives of all other domestic banks , and JPMorgan 's positions were greater .
Those are just two examples .
Banks ' " non-proprietary " trading desks are often invisible hedge funds .
Taxpayers currently subsidize banks with cheap money supplied by the Federal Reserve .
Even banks that nearly crashed our economy borrow at nearly zero interest rates , while some consumers pay nearly 30 % on credit card debt .
Banks enjoy a Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TASLF ) that allows them to borrow against problem assets .
New banks have each issued tens of billions in FDIC guaranteed debt through the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ( TLGP ) .
Banks get interest payments on the excess reserves they keep with the Fed .
Accounting rules were changed in March 2009 , so banks make up their own prices for assets and more easily hide losses .
These are only a few of many newly - created hidden subsidies .
Taxpayers are paid only peanuts in fees for these massive subsidies while being squeezed with high interest rates and mortgage foreclosures -- after our economy was devastated chiefly by several banks ' malicious mischief .
What has the financial crisis taught us ?
Among other things , we should show Bernanke and Geithner , enablers from the previous administration , the door .
Paul Volcker is right to ask for a return to Glass - Steagall .
It worked until it was eroded over several decades by bank lobbying .
Banking and speculative trading activities -- even when done for " customers " -- do n't mix .
" Financial innovation " must be limited , since much of it in recent years was the financial equivalent of card cheating .
Banks should not be allowed to sponsor hedge funds and private equity funds , and furthermore , they should not be allowed to lend to them through prime brokerage units or other means .
Financial institutions must be allowed to fail .
Hedge funds require regulation .
Malfeasance should be investigated and prosecuted .
Credit derivatives should be traded and cleared through exchanges and made transparent .
Compensation and financial incentives at banks must change .
Bank employees cannot continue to reap huge rewards at no personal risk while shoving risk into the global financial system .
President Obama promised us change , and he should seize this opportunity to demand sweeping financial reform .
CIA Assassinations & Depopulation Using Vaccinations :
A Conspiracy Reality Underlies the Swine Flu Black Op
Los Angeles --CIA assassinations and paramilitary operations secreted from congressional overseers and the American people have extended into the realm of swine flu bioterrorism and vaccinations for profitable depopulation according to medical journalist and CIA analyst , Dr. Leonard Horowitz .
The CIA spent years advancing secret squads to blow things up and kill humans according to U.S. intelligence officials interviewed by Greg Miller of the Los Angeles Times .
( July 16 , 2009 ) What the Times failed to report was current connections between drug industrialists and CIA officials that best explain the mysterious emergence of the swine flu virus in Mexico , and the international media 's curious response to the planned pandemic , according to Dr. Horowitz -- a Harvard - trained investigator and award - winning author of several books on this subject .
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials disclosed a broader effort than media coverage has portrayed , including black - ops about which congressional oversight committees and Americans knew nothing , the Times published .
The " broader dimensions " of this program , Miller wrote , " may account for why some lawmakers , particularly Republicans , have been critical of CIA Director Leon E. Panetta 's decision last month to kill " funding for the operation that trained America 's deadliest assassins .
Some house Democrats are calling for an investigation to help explain why top counter - terrorism officials , with close ties to Bush Administration Vice President , Dick Cheney , " saw a need for the CIA to develop its own elite paramilitary teams , rather than relying on U.S. military special operations troops . "
In particular , officials said , ambitions for the program expanded to include creating teams that were made up not only of CIA personnel , but counterparts from other countries , presumably Pakistan ; and to be capable not just of killing high - value targets , but also executing raids and other operations to gather evidence and intelligence that might lead to " CIA - trained Holy War assassin , Osama bin Laden .
In 1986 , William Casey , CIA chief under Reagan , approved a Pakistani intelligence proposal to recruit Islamic fundamentalists worldwide to conduct covert operations .
When the Pakistanis recruited , and the bin Ladens and Saudis financed , the Afghanistan black - operatives at that time , American officials , including previous CIA director , George H.W. Bush , " funneled more than $ 2 billion in guns and money " during the 1980s in the " largest covert action program since World War II , " the Washington Post , reported ( 7/19/92 ) .
The CIA , often referred to as " the Company , " maintained ties to wealthy financiers , including Carlyle Group investors Mohammed bin Laden and George H.W. Bush , co-investors in this mega defense contractor along with James Baker III , who oversaw the Florida vote recount in Bush , Jr's contested 2000 election .
In addition , Donald Rumsfeld , Defense Secretary under Gerald Ford and George W. Bush , whose connections to the global drug - cartel include his launching of the Tamiflu - manufacturing company Gilead Sciences , conducted business dealings with Carlyle Group executive , Frank C. Carlucci .( JudicialWatch.org,11-30-2001 )
In November 2005 , George W. Bush urged Congress to pass $ 7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic , of which one billion was solely dedicated to the purchase and distribution of Tamiflu .
Earlier , in June 1996 , Gilead launched its first commercial product , Vistide ( cidofovir injection ) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) in AIDS patients .
" If you want to know where the herpes virus pandemic mostly comes from , " Dr. Horowitz wrote , " think of contaminated vaccines spread to produce cancer for profit by the Carlyle - CIA - backed cartel . "
Cytomegalovirus is one of three herpes type viruses , including herpes B , simian cytomegalo from monkeys used in vaccine development , and Epstein Barr , another vaccination infection .
Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) , now known to cause AIDS - like immune deficiency , and one of the three AIDS - linked cancers called lymphomas , was first cultured from a Burkitt 's lymphoma cell line in 1964 that Dr. Horowitz traced to CIA - directed vaccine experiments conducted by the American biological weapons lab called Litton Bionetics .
Bionetics operated in Maryland , Virginia , Eastern Zaire and Northwest Uganda during the 1960s according to National Cancer Institute documents discovered by Horowitz .
The covert African operation was conducted under the supervision of Frank Carlucci .
Carlucci has been a Managing Director of Carlyle since 1989 and its Chairman since 1993 .
Carlucci became the point man for CIA - directed " health care " programs in various parts of Africa during the early 1960s .
He became the deputy director of the CIA in 1978 , deputy secretary of defense in 1980 , and national security adviser during the Iran - contra scandal .
Carlucci also served as chief " political officer " in the African Congo 's American Embassy at the time Burkett 's lymphoma was allegedly discovered , and obviously distributed in this region of Africa by way of contaminated vaccines , according to substantial evidence compiled by Dr. Horowitz including an interview with one of the doctors engaged in the vaccination operation .
All of this is published , and meticulously evidenced using reprinted scientific and government documents in Dr. Horowitz 's best of three national bestselling books , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola -- Nature , Accident or Intentional ?
( Tetrahedron Press , 1998 ) Barack Obama 's minister , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , recommended reading this book , in defense of harsh criticism he received for his sermon condemning the US Government for creating HIV .
For those who do not believe our government would conduct such hideous atrocities , technically called genocide , Barack Obama disavowed his minister .
Under CIA supervision and covert actions by government officials linked to Carlyle on behalf of the global petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel , new diseases have emerged .
Dr. Horowitz evidences these including Burkitt 's lymphoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , infectious mononucleosis , AIDS and today , the circulating swine flu , and avian flu threats .
While the Carlyle - Bush - Baker - Carlucci - Rumsfeld connections are troubling enough in their own right , they look even worse when you consider how many different ways Carlyle is profiting from the war on terrorism and bioterrorism .
Speaking in particular about Carlucci , and his three main partners at Carlyle , Dan Broidy , author of The Iron Triangle , an illuminating history of the Carlyle Group , wrote , " It 's not an exaggeration to say that September 11 " made these " Carlyle investors very , very rich men . "
This is also the case for Dick Cheney , tied to the Halliburton Co. that administers converted military bases to serve as quarantine camps planned by FEMA to be used this fall when the World Health Organization may call for such drastic measures .
Recall also that Donald Rumsfeld was replaced as Defense Secretary because of his administration of the Iraqi war and human rights violations in torturing prisoners , state enemies , and suspected terrorists .
" I pray this does n't foreshadow how quarantined Americans who refuse vaccinations will be treated in these FEMA camps administered by Halliburton , " Dr. Horowitz said .
Alleging CIA operations to administer assassinations had been generally disappointing , according to the Los Angeles Times interviewed CIA spokesman , George Little , one wonders who was behind the suspicious deaths of John and Bobby Kennedy , Martin Luther King , Vince Foster , Democratic Senate candidate Mel Carnahan , who went on to win the race as a dead man against his rival John Ashcroft ( whose campaign was largely funded by Enron , and who went on to become appointed the U.S. Attorney General ) ; Democratic Senate incumbent Paul Wellstone , whose reelection would have shifted the entire balance of power in the Senate during pivotal Bush administration projects fundamental to where we are today regarding " national security , " " biodefense , " and forced vaccinations and quarantines impacting every American .
" Keeping CIA activities like this secret is the biggest challenge , " another former U.S. intelligence official told the LA Times .
Most recently , the program 's focus had shifted toward intelligence collection , officials said .
According to past CIA Director , William Colby , since the end of the cold war , the primary function of The Company has been to act as industrial espionage agents on behalf of multi-national corporations , the largest financially engaged with Carlyle .
In 2001 , Dr. Horowitz exposed the anthrax mailings as sourcing from the CIA 's " Project Clearvision . "
The anthrax was mailed to enemies of Carlyle , including democratic drug legislation opponents , Senators Patrick Leahy and Tom Dashle .
The hyper - weaponized germ sourced from the Battelle Memorial Institute in West Jefferson , Ohio , under the direction of CIA - anthrax ace , William Patrick , III , who assayed the mailed virus 's spreading capacity two years before the attacks .
According to Dr. Horowitz , and many other experts , this was done to promote sales of Bayer 's CIPRO ; and stockpiles of BioPort , LLC 's congressionally - certified deadly anthrax vaccine .
US military leaders reported finding a BioPort annual prospectus in a cave allegedly used to shelter Osama bin Laden in 2002 , probably because Carlyle clients , including Mohammad bin Laden , had invested in the company .
Today , BioPort , renamed BioThrax , is allied with drug cartel giants Acambis , Sanofi Pasteur , and other companies that make money from people sustaining side effects from their drugs and vaccines ; especially the ones exclusively stockpiled by our federal officials .
Regarding company assassins carrying out close - range killings , a former CIA official told Greg Miller from the LA Times , " This is something they do n't really have a capacity for . "
" But long - range killings through manufactured frights , forced vaccinations , mass quarantines , and compelled druggings , " Dr. Horowitz wrote , " is obviously central to their genocidal operations on behalf of Carlyle and Halliburton investors . "
On July 16 , 2009 , it was announced that by fall , government health officials and social service workers will be canvassing every American household , carrying four required flu vaccines , that shall be given to those persuaded to take them .
The campaign is mostly " targeting " children and the elderly .
In response , there are now many reasonable , responsible , intelligent , and patriotic Americans , including many health professionals , who have decided to leave the United States before flu season .

The text of the letter , which was originally signed by Senators Michael Bennet , Kirsten Gillibrand , Jeff Merkley , and Sherrod Brown :
Dear Leader Reid :
We respectfully ask that you bring for a vote before the full Senate a public health insurance option under budget reconciliation rules .
There are four fundamental reasons why we support this approach – its potential for billions of dollars in cost savings ; the growing need to increase competition and lower costs for the consumer ; the history of using reconciliation for significant pieces of health care legislation ; and the continued public support for a public option .
A Public Option Is an Important Tool for Restoring Fiscal Discipline .
As Democrats , we pledged that the Senate health care reform package would address skyrocketing health care costs and relieve overburdened American families and small businesses from annual double - digit health care cost increases .
And that it would do so without adding a dime to the national debt .
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) determined that the Senate health reform bill is actually better than deficit neutral .
It would reduce the deficit by over $ 130 billion in the first ten years and up to $ 1 trillion in the first 20 years .
These cost savings are an important start .
But a strong public option can be the centerpiece of an even better package of cost saving measures .
CBO estimated that various public option proposals in the House save at least $ 25 billion .
Even $ 1 billion in savings would qualify it for consideration under reconciliation .
Put simply , including a strong public option is one of the best , most fiscally responsible ways to reform our health insurance system .
A Public Option Would Provide Americans with a Low - Cost Alternative and Improve Market Competitiveness .
A strong public option would create better competition in our health insurance markets .
Many Americans have no or little real choice of health insurance provider .
Far too often , it ’s " take it or leave it " for families and small businesses .
This lack of competition drives up costs and leaves private health insurance companies with little incentive to provide quality customer service .
A recent Health Care for America
Now report on private insurance companies found that the largest five for - profit health insurance providers made $ 12 billion in profits last year , yet they actually dropped 2.7 million people from coverage .
Private insurance – by gouging the public even during a severe economic recession – has shown it cannot function in the public ’s interest without a public alternative .
Americans have nowhere to turn .
That is not healthy market competition , and it is not good for the public .
If families or individuals like their current coverage through a private insurance company , then they can keep that coverage .
And in some markets where consumers have many alternatives , a public option may be less necessary .
But many local markets have broken down , with only one or two insurance providers available to consumers .
Each and every health insurance market should have real choices for consumers .
There is a history of using reconciliation for significant pieces of health care legislation .
There is substantial Senate precedent for using reconciliation to enact important health care policies .
The Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) , Medicare Advantage , and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( COBRA ) , which actually contains the term ‘ reconciliation ’ in its title , were all enacted under reconciliation .
The American Enterprise Institute ’s Norman Ornstein and Brookings ’ Thomas Mann and Molly Reynolds jointly wrote , " Are Democrats making an egregious power grab by sidestepping the filibuster ?
Hardly . "
They continued that the precedent for using reconciliation to enact major policy changes is " much more extensive . . . than Senate Republicans are willing to admit these days . "
There is strong public support for a public option , across party lines .
The overwhelming majority of Americans want a public option .
The latest New York Times poll on this issue , in December , shows that despite the attacks of recent months Americans support the public option 59 % to 29 % .
Support includes 80 % of Democrats , 59 % of Independents , and even 33 % of Republicans .
Much of the public identifies a public option as the key component of health care reform -- and as the best thing we can do to stand up for regular people against big insurance companies .
In fact , overall support for health care reform declined steadily as the public option was removed from reform legislation .
Although we strongly support the important reforms made by the Senate - passed health reform package , including a strong public option would improve both its substance and the public ’s perception of it .
The Senate has an obligation to reform our unworkable health insurance market -- both to reduce costs and to give consumers more choices .
A strong public option is the best way to deliver on both of these goals , and we urge its consideration under reconciliation rules .
Simply put : housing costs have far outpaced household incomes over the past 35 years , making the high cost of housing the primary driver of declining discretionary income : what 's left after paying taxes and housing .
You might want to refill your coffee or tea cup because we have to slog through some potentially confusing numbers to root out the truth .
There is information in the difference between median income and mean / average income .
Median is the number at the 50 % line , e.g. first half of households earning less than the median household income and the other half earning more .
( wikipedia on median / mean )
Mean income ( average ) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of U.S. households by the number of households .
Consider that the median income of U.S. households in 2008 was $ 50,303 while the average income was $ 68,424 .
( Source : U.S. Census Bureau Table H - 6 .
You have to download the h06AR Excel file to obtain 2008 data . )
Why the big difference ?
The higher income households earn a much greater income that the lower 4/5 of households .
That preponderance of income in the top 5 % and top 20 % causes the average income to be much higher than the median .
We need to ask not just much more do higher - income households earn that middle - income households , but how much has each group 's income risen in the past 35 years ?
In other words : has income risen equally across all incomes , or has it risen more in one group or another ?
The Census Bureau divides the households into quintiles - - 20 % each , with a special category for the top 5 % . ( income by quintile . )
The numbers are remarkable .
I am not making a judgment here , i.e. that incomes " should be " different from these facts ; we all know wages for low - skill jobs have stagnated while high - pay , low - skill factory positions have declined due to global wage arbitrage and broad post - industrial trends .
Nonetheless , it is clear that the vast majority of income increases have accrued to the top 20 % and top 5 % .
Here are the numbers , adjusted into 2001 dollars ( data ends at 2001 ) :
Bottom 20 %
1975 : $ 12,664
2001 : $ 14,021
increase : $ 1,357
percentage increase from 1975 : 10.7 %
Middle 20 % a.k.a. " the middle class "
1975 : $ 39,807
2001 : $ 51,538
increase : $ 11,731
percentage increase from 1975 : 29.4 %
Top 20 %
1975 : $ 91,848
2001 : $ 159,644
increase : $ 67,796
percentage increase from 1975 : 73.8 %
Top 5 % a.k.a. " the wealthy "
1975 : $ 134,735
2001 : $ 280,312
increase : $ 145,577
percentage increase from 1975 : 108 %
Now let 's move on to look at housing .
Our statistics are once again drawn directly from U.S. Census Bureau data : median house prices 1975 - 2009 .
The average house price in 1975 was $ 39,500 .
Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator , we find that comes to $ 158,000 in 2008 dollars .
The average ( mean ) house price in December 2008 was $ 301,200 - - almost twice the 1975 cost .
To be exact , 90.7 % higher .
Thus we can see that only the top 5 % of households actually gained enough income to match the rise in housing costs .
Even the " upper middle class " in the top 20 % of households only gained 74 % , substantially less than the 90 % rise in housing .
The lower 3/5 of the households were completely blown out of the water by housing 's 90 % rise ; obviously , their ability to afford a house was essentially destroyed by this asymmetric rise in the cost of housing .
I want to note that all these numbers are adjusted for inflation ; they are all " apples to apples . "
Now let 's consider a popular metric of housing affordability : gross income to the cost of a house .
According to mybudget360.com , the home price / income in 1950 was 2.21 and 2.11 in 1960 .
In other words , a house cost 2.1 years of income in 1960 .
Here is my analysis of the Census data median house prices 1975 - 2009 .
1975 : median income $ 42,936 , median house price $ 148,800
Home price / income ratio : 3.46
1975 : average income $ 50,137 , average house price $ 158,000
Home price / income ratio : 3.15
Clearly , housing affordability had already dropped substantially from 1960 to 1975 .
2008 : median income $ 50,303 , median house price $ 245,300
Home price / income ratio : 4.87
2008 : average income $ 68,424 , average house price $ 301,200
Home price / income ratio : 4.4
However you want to slice it , housing costs substantially more in terms of income than it did 35 years ago .
While the final Census Bureau numbers are not yet available , private data suggests median income dropped in 2009 as the recession took hold , returning household incomes to 1997 levels .
( Source : davemanuel.com )
Meanwhile , according to Census data , the average house price in December 2009 was $ 290,000 - - a mere 3.7 % decline from the 2008 price of $ 301,200 .
As income drops and Federal tax credits and Federal Reserve support of the mortgage markets continue propping up historically asymmetric housing prices , affordability will continue to decline .
If average house prices were to return to the 1975 ratio of approximately 3 times average household income , than would require the average price to drop from $ 290,000 to around $ 195,000 .
( Assuming real average household income has declined to around $ 65,000 , a number which may well be optimistic . )
To all those who believe demand for housing will soon exceed supply , recall that the Census Bureau counts almost 19 million empty dwellings in the U.S. even as foreclosures are slated to reach 4 million in 2010 .
A decline to the 3 - to - 1 ratio of income to price fits in with my projection for housing bubble symmetry :

Children 's author Philip Pullman says Jesus was n't the Son of God
Controversial author Philip Pullman has provoked anger amongst Christians again
Bestselling children 's author Philip Pullman has provoked more anger from Christians with a new book denying that Jesus was the son of God .
The book , due to be published next Easter , accepts there was a holy man called Jesus but says the idea of such a divine link came from the ' fervid imagination ' of the apostle St Paul .
Pullman has already been condemned by the Vatican for the allegorical trilogy His Dark Materials , which has been described as anti-Christian .
His new book , The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ , is a retelling of the story of Jesus .
It draws on the Bible for characters , locations and events , but the author says it reads like a mix between a novel , a history and a fairy tale .
Pullman said : ' I wanted it to be like that because it is , among other things , a story about how stories become stories .
' By the time the gospels were being written , Paul had already begun to transform the story of Jesus into something altogether new and extraordinary , and some of his version influenced what the gospel writers put in theirs .
' Paul was a literary and imaginative genius of the first order who has probably had more influence on the history of the world than any other human being , Jesus certainly included .
I believe this is a pity . '
But David McGough , the Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop of Birmingham , said : ' There is no evidence that Paul influenced the Gospels .
No respectable scriptural scholar would have anything to do with [ Pullman 's ] theory . '
Earlier this year Pullman sparked controversy when he announced a boycott of school visits in protest at ' sinister '
Government checks to ensure that authors are not paedophiles .
He claimed the Vetting and Barring Scheme register , which starts in October , will encourage youngsters to view everyone as potential rapists or murderers .
His Dark Materials , on which the film The Golden Compass was based , attracted criticism for promoting atheism .
The film was attacked by the Vatican for portraying ' a cold and hopeless world without God ' .
Society versus the State
In trying to explain how things might work in a stateless society , anarchists usually point out that opposition to the state does not mean opposition to cooperation or organization .
In trying to explain anarchism to non-anarchists , anarchists describe the ways that people can cooperate voluntarily to defend themselves against aggression and achieve positive common goals .
The non-anarchist ’s first response , in most cases , is “ But are n’t you just reinventing the wheel ?
If lots of people organize themselves into a cooperative organization to restrain aggressors and carry out social projects , is n’t that just government by another name ? ”
Well , no , it really is n’t .
The main principle that distinguishes voluntary organization under anarchy from the state is that anarchists regard cooperative groupings , including groupings of a majority of people in a community , as being bound by the same moral principles that govern individuals .
An individual has the right to defend himself against aggression , and to use what rightfully belongs to him in service to his goals .
Groups of more than one person have the right to associate voluntarily to defend one another against violence , when their neighbors request it , and to associate voluntarily to use their resources to promote common ends .
But such group actions are simply extensions of the individual ’s right , and claim no rights , powers or moral authority over and above what the individual possesses — even when the group constitutes most members of a community .
Anarchists believe that groups of people can rightfully exercise only those powers that are delegated to them by individuals ; and individuals cannot delegate to any group , including the community , powers and rights which they do not themselves possess as individuals .
The state , on the other hand , claims moral authority on behalf of the community , over and above the moral basis on which individuals exercise their rights , and claims powers as representative of the community that are beyond the lawful right of any individual or private grouping of individuals .
The state claims , in particular , a police power to initiate force — to coerce peaceful non-aggressors — when it ’s necessary to promote the “ general welfare ” or “ public good . ”
Many of the state ’s present functions are things that would have to be done in a peaceful , free society , on the basis of voluntary cooperation .
When postal carriers deliver the mail , or cops prevent murder and robbery , they ’re doing things that would be done in a free society .
And when this society is transformed into a free society , there may well be some organizational continuity between the present institutional arrangements for doing such things and the arrangements of the anarchist society .
So what would be necessary to transform government institutions into free ones ??
Eliminate their powers to initiate force against non-aggressors .
First , eliminate the funding of their operations by compulsory taxation , and second , eliminate their power to compel people to consume their services .
With those criteria met , the “ organization formerly known as the state ” might continue to provide protection and fire service , and to organize voluntary sick and unemployment benefits , old age pensions , and the like .
It might even continue to provide services to a majority of the community on a voluntary basis , as a consumer cooperative , and be governed by a “ town meeting ” of subscribers and a board of selectmen .
That makes sense , in fact , because services like police and fire protection are arguably private monopolies : given the capital outlays required for dissatisfied customers to start a competing service , it might well be cost - effective instead to stage a “ hostile takeover ” and install new management on the board of selectmen .

How bad - ass is that ?
Steel shipping containers are the temporary homes of countless consumer items being transported all around the world .
Items are packed into the cargo containers in their country of origin , then shipped to wherever they ’re destined to be sold .
Once they ’re emptied at the appropriate port , many of these cargo containers simply sit around empty or get melted down for re-use .
But recently , they ’ve found new lives as homes and other types of buildings .
Perhaps the two most appealing aspects of building with shipping containers are the affordability and the green construction factor : shipping container homes are far less expensive than new - material traditional homes , and reusing them rather than melting them down significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the steel containers .
But how does it feel to live in a shipping container ?
Most people who have built this type of home say that they ’re sturdy and modern , and when several containers are connected the building can be just about any size , from a single - container loft to a multi- container family home .
Some residents of shipping container homes and offices choose to display the origins of their buildings by leaving the facades alone .
Others disguise the shipping containers by applying exteriors that make the recycled buildings look just like any other .
Whether they ’re rough around the edges or covered in cutting - edge design , shipping container homes are definitely going places .

BY midafternoon on a recent Saturday , Bierkraft , the beer emporium and grocery on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope , Brooklyn , was half - filled with customers , many of them parents with babies or toddlers in tow .
They were browsing the more than 1,000 varieties of bottled beer or surveying the listing of selections available on the 13 taps and 3 cask lines .
Some carried a good - sized satchel .
Diaper bag ?
Gym clothes ?
No .
It was a tote for their growlers .
Growlers  64 - ounce glass vessels that look like a moonshine jug  have become the beer accessory of the moment .
And the jugs , filled at taps in bars and stores , are not just the toys of the bearded , flannel - shirt , beer - geek set .
“ In the beginning we tried to figure out , ‘ Who ’s going to be our market ? ’ ” said Ben Granger , 32 , an owner of Bierkraft , which began filling growlers in spring 2006 .
“ We thought , mullet - heads and beer - bellied dudes .
But the first run was ladies with strollers .
They will tell you they ’re buying them for their husbands .
Three weeks later , they ’ve got two .
One ’s his and one ’s hers .
The next one that caught me by surprise was dads coming in with their kids .
Then there ’s the beer crowd who ’ll rush in to get on this or that before it ’s gone .
There ’s no age limit . ”
Michael Endelman , a journalist at Rolling Stone , is one of those growler - loving fathers .
“ I do n’t go to bars too much anymore , ” he said , gesturing to his baby daughter Mimi .
“ It just seems like a great way to be a beer geek without going out . ”
Why hire a personal injury lawyer ?
Hiring a personal injury lawyer for a construction injury is an integral part of pursuing your case .
In these circumstances , you are n’t responsible for proving negligence on the part of another individual in order to receive compensation .
You ’re responsible for establishing that you suffered a construction injury and must also prove that this incident occurred while you were on the job .
This compensation covers the cost of medical bills , disability , and lost wages .
This does , however , negate the possibility of seeking damages related to pain and suffering .
In the event that you ’re involved in a construction injury , it ’s absolutely critical that you file an incident report with your supervisor , especially if the extent of the injury does n’t become apparent until shortly after the fact .
This ensures that you have the necessary documentation to pursue compensation .
Consulting with a trained personal injury lawyer becomes a crucial component in this process , because they can analyze your unique case and provide you with expert advice regarding all of your legal options .

Well , I promised to do something amazing with that vegetable broth I cooked up yesterday , and I did !
I had a nice stash of local red potatoes and kale , so I figured I would make a soup out of them .
I added a little red pepper flakes , and the soup was perfectly spicy and hearty .
I have to say that the thing that makes this soup is the homemade broth .
If you do n't have homemade broth , do n't bother .
Also , I put a lot more potato in this soup than soups like this usually call for .
I found this to be more pleasant than some " green soups " that are really heavy on the greens .
Since this soup has a good amount of kale ( on of the healthiest foods around ) , it 's really good for you .
Serve it with some toasted sprouted bread or a green salad .
Spicy Potato Kale Soup
6 cups homemade vegetable broth
6 cups chopped red potato
1 bunch kale , leaves and stems chopped
salt to taste
red pepper flakes to taste
Put the broth and potatoes in a pot together .

Javad Larijani uses racial slur in reference to Obama
Asr Iran | Peykeiran | Jan. 23 , 2010
Mohammad Javad Larijani criticized the policies adopted by U.S. President Barack Obama and referred to him using a racial epithet .
" When Barack Obama was sworn into office he talked of verbally engaging Iran , " the U.C. Berkeley graduate was quoted as saying .
" What has changed is that today this [ the equivalent of the N - word in Farsi ] talks of regime change in Iran . "
In a Saturday meeting at the Islamic Engineers Society , Larijani said , " I am not a racist , but I must respond to this man [ Obama ] in some way . "
Larijani's brother , Ali , is the speaker of Majles ( Parliament ) .
Another brother , Sadegh , is head of the judiciary .
Plane catches fire in Iran , injures 42
Reuters | Photos | Jan. 24 , 2010
Some 42 Iranians were injured when a Russian - made Tupolev aircraft caught fire as it landed in northeastern Iran on Sunday , state radio said .
" About 42 passengers , out of 157 aboard , were injured when the plane was landing at Mashhad city 's airport , " said Gholamreza Massoumi , head of Iran 's emergency medical services .
There were no fatalities , said Iran 's civil aviation spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh .
A senior local official said the wounded were not in a critical condition , state television said .
The official IRNA news agency said the incident occurred when the rear end of the plane , which belonged to Iran 's domestic Taban Airliner , caught fire while landing .
The cause of the incident was being investigated , IRNA said .
Russia 's Federal Air Transport Agency said on Sunday it will investigate the reasons behind the fire and said " weather conditions and visibility problems were most likely behind the incident , " state - run news agency RIA - Novosti reported .
In the worst plane crash in Iran in the past six years , a Tupolev aircraft crashed in 2009 in Iran on its way to Armenia , after catching fire mid-air and crashing into farmland killing all 168 people on board .
Iran has suffered a string of crashes in the past few decades , many involving Russian - made aircraft .
U.S. sanctions against Iran have prevented it from buying new aircraft or spare parts from the West , forcing it to add to its aging fleet of Boeing and Airbus planes with aircraft from Russia and other former Soviet Union states .
Train crash in Iran kills at least 8
LAT | Jan. 23 , 2010
A train accident in northeastern Iran killed at least eight people this morning and injured dozens , underscoring problems in Iran 's transportation sector .
Four wagons of a five - car passenger train traveling between the capital , Tehran , and the eastern city of Mashhad derailed near the town of Joghatay , 420 miles from the capital , shortly before 10:30 a.m. local time , Iranian news outlets reported .
A medical helicopter and 12 ambulances have been dispatched to the scene , and several of those injured remain in grave condition , Iranian news sources reported .
Gholam - Reza Masoumi , head of State Emergency Center , told the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency , ILNA , that the death toll from the train accident is likely to rise " in view of the critical conditions of some casualties and the type of incident . "
News agencies said the four cars flipped over near a train station .
A photograph posted to the website of Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency showed rescue workers climbing an overturned rail car on a field .
Officials cited by Iranian news agencies variously attributed the accident to a switch failure , the breaking of a pin , an obstacle on the tracks or the train traveling at too high a speed .
But an official described as the deputy director of the state - owned rail company told ILNA no conclusions had yet been drawn .
Iran budgets $ 60 for crude oil
AP | Reuters | Photos Jan. 24 , 2010
Iran planned next year 's budget based on an oil price of $ 60 per barrel , nearly double the price from the last year , the official news agency reported on Sunday , indicating rising optimism over energy prices .
Last year , the parliament approved a budget based on $ 37.5 per barrel for the fiscal year ending in March , reflecting the steep drop in prices that severely impacted the economy .
About 80 percent of Iran 's foreign revenue comes from oil exports .
Earlier on Sunday President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad submitted the budget to the Iranian parliament for approval , saying more money would be allocated to agriculture , education and research , as well as to the poor .
He did not give the size of the budget only saying there was " nothing complicated or nontransparent " in it .
The budget requires approval of the parliament and the Guardian Council , a constitutional watchdog .
Mehr News Agency said the amount of the budget was about $ 368 billion , some $ 89 billion more than the current Iranian year .
Ahmadinejad said on Sunday the national budget for 2010 / 11 would lessen reliance on oil revenues , a move aimed at making the Islamic state less vulnerable to any Western sanctions .
Ahmadinejad , who faces opposition protests seven months after his re-election , also said Iran " will have good news over production of 20 percent enriched fuel in February . "
" This news will make the Iranian nation and other independent nations happy , " he told reporters in parliament after presenting the budget to parliament .
Critics accuse Ahmadinejad of squandering the windfall oil revenue Iran earned when crude prices soared in the first half of 2008 , leaving it more vulnerable now that it faces possible U.N. sanctions over its nuclear work .
Corruption , profiteering rage under Ahmadinejad
SF Chronicle | Jan. 23 , 2010
Since the fraudulent elections last June that returned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power , the government has been unstintingly harsh , even deadly , in trying to put down a national uprising .
Iran is a theocracy , and the state is charging its opponents with religious crimes .
So perhaps spiritual fervor is driving the government to attack its own people .
If not that , then maybe it is simply the typical dictator 's determination to hold onto power at any cost .
Certainly those are important motivators .
But another little - discussed feature of Iranian society is at least as important to the state 's overlords .
They are standing astride a river of cash that flows up to them , nonstop , in one of the most corrupt states in the world .
Religion is important , power is wonderful , but how marvelous must it feel to have $ 1 billion or more in a secret , offshore bank account ?
Corruption " is very widespread , and everyone is in on the action , everyone at the top , " said Gary Sick , an Iran expert at Columbia University who served on the National Security Council under three presidents .
" It 's a very , very ugly situation . "
Basij responsible for confronting soft threats
Etemad | Jan. 10 , 2010
The deputy commander of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps ' ground force said Basij was the most elite and best trained force and effective in ensuring security .
In an interview with Fars News Agency , Sardar Abdollah Iraqi , deputy commander of the IRGC 's ground forces , pointed out some recent changes to the structure of the force .
" After the recent changes in the Basij force on the instruction of the supreme leader of the Revolution [ Ali Khamenei ] , the force is now taking more responsibilities in the area of rehabilitation , tackling soft threats and showing presence in social and cultural debates , rather than focusing on military issues , " he said .
In calling Basij a non-military force , he said : " In the transformations the military tasks of the Basij have been assigned to the ground forces and all the training , actions against powerful and moderate threats will be the responsibility of the ground forces , and the Basij organization will only tackle the soft threats . "
Referring to the issue that using the Basij force was the only reason of decisive successes during last 30 years , especially during the sacred period [ Iran - Iraq war ] of defending the nation , he said " if the commander in chief of the forces [ supreme leader ] agrees and we are informed about it , we will fully support the involvement of the Imam Hossein Battalion in security - related debates and gatherings as we can see that local forces and the Basij are primarily involved in ensuring security in particular areas of the northwest and southeast of the country . "
Referring to the intelligence reporting by the elite Guard Corps in the region , Iraqi said that major incidents could have taken place if it were not for the intelligence gathering of the elite Guard Corps .
He said the recent minor incidents in some of the areas did not take place due to weakness of the intelligence system , rather it indicates that the enemy was active more extensively and the Guard Corps and security forces are neutralizing their efforts and even sometimes countering their unavoidable actions through suitable means .
IRIB host believes sexual frustration behind protests
Tabnak | Jan. 23 , 2010
The Rou beh Farda ( Toward Tomorrow ) host Vahid Yaminpour wrote in a blog that sexual repression was the cause of violent youth protests .
According to Tehran Emrouz , Yaminpour wrote in his blog that despite Q&A sessions about the post-election incidents in Iran , which answered all outstanding questions about the election , young boys and girls continue to reject the valid explanations given to them , resort to violence and insist on disagreeing even after their defeat .
He went on to say the social interaction of students ( of both sexes ) in universities and their inability to meet their sexual needs causes a frustration .
Yaminpour said these youths , who are unaware of basic political concepts and driven by sexual frustration , should not be labeled as seditionists and counter revolutionaries ; instead , they should be given the opportunity to marry -- even temporary marriages were appropriate -- in order to do away with protests .

Rafsanjani : ' Leader most competent figure to resolve Iran woes '
Press TV | Jan. 23 , 2010
Chairman of the Expediency Council Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said the Leader of the Islamic Revolution is the " most competent " person to resolve the problems that the country is currently faced with .
" I am confident that the ongoing problems can be settled with the help of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution [ Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei ] in cooperation with moderate figures of both [ political ] parties in the country , " the Iranian Labor News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying on Saturday .
Rafsanjani added that his " thought , words and action " have always been based on " moderation and avoidance of extremes . "
" In expressing my stance [ on various issues ] , I have always attached importance to the interests of Islam , the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian nation , " the chairman of the Assembly of Experts added .
" At particular times , I stay silent due to certain inappropriate conditions , " he said .

Iran may release AIDS doctors with ties to Boston
Boston Globe | Jan. 22 , 2010
Two celebrated Iranian AIDS doctors with ties to Boston who were convicted in Iran of trying to overthrow the regime could soon be released from prison on appeal , according to their lawyer , Masoud Shafie .
" Their case is very hopeful , " he said in a recent telephone interview from Iran .
Kamiar Alaei , who earned a master 's degree from Harvard School of Public Health , and his brother , Arash Alaei , started a string of successful AIDS clinics in Iran and participated in the first State Department - funded exchange program with Revolutionary Iran in 2006 , which included tours of medical facilities in Boston and meetings with Boston - area doctors .
Initially , the Iranian government appeared to support their work .
But in June 2008 , they were arrested and accused of " communications with an enemy government " and " seeking to overthrow the Iranian government . "
Last January , after a one - day trial , Kamiar was sentenced to three years in prison and Arash was sentenced to six , according to Physicians for Human Rights , a Cambridge - based organization that has been petitioning for their release .
' You 're in big trouble ' : A brush with the Revolutionary Guard
Globe & Mail | Jan. 23 , 2010
In an exclusive excerpt from Our Man in Tehran , author Robert Wright reveals Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor 's top- secret -- and highly risky -- work for the CIA during the American hostage crisis in Iran
The Canadians ' mission in Tehran had three components : monitoring the activities of the U.S. embassy compound , where the Americans were being held hostage ; finding a suitable " hide site " for the Delta Force commandos planning to storm in and rescue the captives ; and helping to plan the logistics of the escape - dubbed Operation Eagle Claw by the Pentagon .
Working closely with Mr. Taylor were Sgt. Jim Edward , head of security at the Canadian embassy , and " Bob , " a Cold War spy who was called out of retirement to become the CIA 's only undercover officer in Tehran .
Tsunami of US army hit Haiti in form of earthquake
Javan | Jan. 23 , 2010
Many people may find remarks by the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez that U.S. underground military tests had been the main reason for the earthquake and the death of thousands of people in Haiti strange and unbelievable .
However , instead of humanitarian aid , sending 15,000 American military forces to that country in less than ten days after the earthquake may be the strangest part of all .
Two days after the earthquake that measured 7.2 on the Richter Scale , 11,000 American forces were sent to Haiti on the basis of a pre-planned operation so that in addition to occupying the presidential palace they could also seize control of that country and put it in their hands .
An interesting point is that in order to send military forces to other countries such as Afghanistan , America has had to try for many months to get the approval of the Congress .
However , in this case , apparently in less than one day , it was able to send 11,000 forces to Haiti , and in the near future that number is going to rise to 20,000 .
The Russians were aware of American tests
On Wednesday , Chavez spoke about a secret Russian document on " earthquake - inducing [ larze saz ] weapons , " which had been prepared by the Russian Navy .
He has stressed that the testing of that weapon by the U.S. Navy had resulted in the earthquake in Haiti .
" Since 2008 , Russia 's North Sea navy has been carefully tracking the activities of American forces in the Caribbean , because the announcement of the resumption of the activities of the American Fourth Fleet in that region had aroused the sensitivity of the Russians , " Chavez said in an interview with the Spanish ABC newspaper .
It is important to point out that that naval unit had been disbanded in 1950 .
In that report [ presumably by the Russian Navy ] it has been pointed out that earlier on the testing of that earthquake - inducing weapon had produced an earthquake in Eureka City in California with the force of 6.5 on the Richter Scale , but it had not resulted in any casualties .
In the secret Russian report it has also been pointed out : " Washington had some comprehensive information about the possible damage caused by that weapon before the earthquake had occurred .
As a result , before the earthquake took place , General Keane [ phon. ] , the commander of the American military 's Southern Command had been sent to Haiti , so that he could announce the need for help if necessary . "
The Arabs faced with the possibility of an American tsunami
The Arabic - language newspaper The Latest News published in the United States of America , quoting some informed sources , has written that the tsunami that took place a few years ago in South Asia was due to American nuclear tests in the depth of the oceans .
That newspaper added : " At the moment , Washington is trying to persuade the world that what happened in Haiti had been a natural disaster .
However , geologists believe that the earthquake in Haiti could not be due to the movement of the earth 's crust .
It is clear that it has been due to the tests that have affected in an unnatural way both the earth and the sea . "
That newspaper has added : " Haiti 's earthquake has been the result of a successful American test in the depth of the sea . "
That newspaper has warned that Arab countries , Afghanistan , Somalia , Yemen and Palestine will be the next targets for those tests .
Hugo Chavez , the Venezuelan president , has also warned that his country and Russia believe that in future such tests could also be used in order to weaken the Islamic system in Iran .
Iran nuclear dispute ' fabricated by the West '
Mehr | Jan. 22 , 2010
The director of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi says that there are two lines of thought in the West on the dispute over Iran 's nuclear program .
" One of these camps is acting with a little more wisdom and has understood that they should pursue an interactive policy towards Iran , and the other camp is influenced by international Zionism and ( they ) are trying to implement a confrontational policy and to make problems for everyone , " Salehi told the ISNA news agency on Thursday .
His remarks came in response to the recent meeting of the 5+1 group ( the United States , Britain , France , Russia , China , and Germany ) on Iran 's nuclear issue .
Diplomats from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany held a meeting last Saturday , January 16 over Iran 's nuclear program but could not reach an agreement .
" We had a very sober assessment , " Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters .
" It is inconclusive in the sense that we did not make any decisions right away , " he added , AFP reported .
Salehi predicted that the wise group will prevail in the end , and the nuclear dispute , which has been fabricated by the West , will be resolved over time .
" Our policy is a policy of interaction , " he stated .
He went on to say that Iran has asked foreign countries to provide the nuclear fuel for the Tehran research reactor , although the country is capable of producing the fuel itself .
Iran has offered to swap its low enriched nuclear fuel for 20 per cent enriched nuclear fuel for the Tehran research reactor in stages on the southern Iranian island of Kish .
Elsewhere in his remarks , Salehi said that bringing the Bushehr nuclear plant on stream is a priority for Iran and expressed hope that it would become operational in late March .
Meanwhile , the director of Russia 's state nuclear corporation announced on Thursday that Moscow would start up Iran 's Bushehr nuclear power plant this year .
" 2010 is the year of Bushehr , " Rosatom director Sergei Kiriyenko told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Moscow .
Salehi also announced that over the past month , Irans nuclear research institution has manufactured two important machines , namely the CAT scanner and the body scanner .
He also said that there is some other news that he will announce at the proper time .
Iran ready to share nuclear know - how with regional nations
IRIB | Jan. 20 , 2010
The interior minister has said , " Iran is a country that keeps its doors open for entering security pacts .
So , how can such a country be a source of intimidation among the regional countries ? "
Brig -General Ahmad Vahidi was speaking at a continuing session of the international gathering on the Persian Gulf .
He further said , " Another subject that the Westerners have propounded are our nuclear issues .
This is even in the situation when we have announced that we are willing to place our nuclear know - how at the disposal of the countries in the region , and are even prepared to collaborate in setting up of a nuclear power plant in the region .
" The enemies of people of this region are the ones who are seeking to project Iran 's nuclear capabilities as a threat to the area .
Another element that they are trying to create is a massive uproar that Iran is seeking to gain access to nuclear weapons , even though we have reiterated that we do not believe in doing so as it is contrary not only to our beliefs but also to our ethics . "
Vahidi continued , " The ' Iran phobia ' and the fact the Zionist regime has declared that in order to combat Iran 's threat , ' it would side with the Arabs ' , are the most hilarious occurrences of our time .
With such efforts , at certain junctures -- even though temporary -- they achieve some relative success ; however , nothing concrete will happen , due to the vigilance of the regional countries .
These efforts are most certainly aimed at strengthening their own security and presence in the region , as well as taking over the security of the region . "
Iran official warns against migration of oil industry employees
Iran Tejarat | Jan. 20 , 2010
Deputy Oil Minister Seyfollah Jashnsaz has said that at present the oil industry employees receive lower salaries than their counterparts in other countries and issued a warning saying , " If these employees are not financially provided for , some of them may migrate to other countries . "

He added , " According to analysts ' views , this self - reliance on oil income is considered a weak point .
However , by experiencing many ups and downs , the oil industry employees prevented Iran 's oil exports every moment following the Revolution . "

Iran FM sets attendance conditions for London Afghan Conference
Mehr | Jan. 23 , 2010
Iran has set conditions for participating in a conference on Afghanistan in London on January 28 .
In an interview with the Islamic Republic of Broadcasting on Wednesday night , Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki said if Iran 's views are considered at the conference , Tehran will study the invitation to attend the conference with a positive view ; otherwise there will be no reason to attend the conference .
" After eight years of occupation , Britain 's record in Afghanistan is indefensible , " the foreign minister said .
" The British government has no convincing answer to the world for its actions in Afghanistan , and its policies have been totally wrong , " he noted .
He said even schoolchildren know that the occupiers have not been successful in Afghanistan .
He stated that the occupiers have not been sincere in their approach to resolving the crisis .
" Either these countries did not have the capability to resolve the crisis in the first place , or they have lost the ability to lead the world , " he added .
" Despite eight years of occupation , extremism and insecurity have increased , opium production has skyrocketed , and even parts of Pakistan are also being dragged into the conflict , " Mottaki said .

The release of James Cameron ’s cinematic juggernaut Avatar in December 2009 , focused attention on fictional languages – specifically on Na’vi , the artificial language created for the film .
Dozens of fictional languages have appeared in literature and movies , but only a handful of these artificial languages are developed enough to be spoken day - to - day .
Unsurprisingly , these languages were created by trained linguists who collaborated with authors – or happened to be authors themselves .
Na ’vi is among a select few fictional languages that has a fully - realized grammatical and syntactical structure .
Created by linguist Paul Frommer at the University of Southern California , it has 7 vowels , 20 consonants , and an unusual system of “ infixes ” – suffixes placed in the middle of the word .
Frommer has said that he was inspired by Xhosa , Bantu , and Japanese – but he might have also taken a hint from these two famous artificial languages that have also attracted thousands of speakers :
Klingon
Although its first few words and general sound were created for Star Trek by James Doohan , who played Scotty on the series and in the early films , Klingon was developed into a fully realized artificial language by linguist Marc Okrand for future installments .
Spoken by an enemy alien race of the same name on the TV series , Klingon features a diverse array of consonants and phonemes that gives the artificial language its otherworldly sound .
It is also unusual in its object - verb - subject construction ; “ I am eating french fries ” would be “ French fries are eating I . ”
Sindarin
Developed by J. R. R. Tolkien for the Lord of the Rings series , Sindarin ( often called Elven ) is the language of the Elvish people of Middle - earth .
Tolkien developed the phonology and grammar from a mix of Welsh , Icelandic , Old English and Old Norse .
Tolkien even outlined a series of dialects of the artificial language , and traced their development and shared roots in other languages .
Although Sindarin is usually written in the Latin alphabet by contemporary speakers , some have mastered the original script , known as Cirth or Tengwar .
Other Popular Artificial Languages
Dothraki & High Valyrian
When George R. R. Martin ’s fantasy epic A Song of Ice and Fire was adapted into a television series , the producers hired an expert to bring the language of the Dothraki people to life .
Developed by David Peterson , the Dothraki language reflects the lifestyle of those who use it : as a nomadic people in an unforgiving environment , they have an extensive vocabulary relating to the horses they rely on for mobility , but no word for “ thank you . ”
As the series has progressed , Peterson has also been tapped to create a language called “ High Valyrian , ” which serves as a sort of lingua franca for several nations .
Using a handful of words and phrases from Martin ’s novels , Peterson fleshed out High Valyrian into a commanding , lyrical tongue .
R’lyehian
H. P. Lovecraft introduced this artificial language in the short story “ The Call of Cthulhu . ”
The story revolves around an otherworldly cult that repeatedly chants in R’lyehian .
Although Lovecraft did n’t specify a grammar for this fictional language , you can learn one classic phrase : “ Ph’nglui mglw ’ nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah ’nagl fhtagn . ”
Need a translation ?
In English , that ’s : “ In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu lies dreaming . ”
City Speak
The futuristic language in Blade Runner , City Speak is described as “ a mishmash of Japanese , Spanish , German , what have you . ”
In a post - apocalyptic world , the movie imagines a time when all spoken languages will be combined into one common language .
Newspeak
Another imagining of language in the future , Newspeak comes from George Orwell ’s novel 1984 .
Orwell published an essay that described the artificial language in greater detail : it features short words and a marked lack of synonyms .
Fewer words meant fewer alternative thoughts – Newspeak limited characters ’ abilities to deviate from the norm .
Fremen
Readers of the sci - fi classic
Dune might recognize a few words in this language , created by author Frank Herbert .
Herbert designed this artificial language of the Fremen , a population that lives on a harsh desert planet , as a distant relative of Arabic .
Kryptonian
Although it ’s never heard as spoken dialogue , 2013 ’s Superman movie Man of Steel created a language from the doomed planet of Krypton .
Linguist Christine Schreyer worked with graphic designer Kirsten Franson to construct vocabulary and syntax , as well as a written script for the language , based on the writing system used by the Cree .
This writing can be seen throughout the scenes that take place on Krypton , lending some authenticity to the fictional planet .
And with this new script , the symbol on Superman ’s chest is n’t just the English letter S – it ’s also the Kryptonian symbol for “ Hope . ”
Last week 's flooding that left more than 100 people dead in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia 's second - largest city , has sparked an unusual wave of citizen outrage on Facebook and in the state - run local press .
The outburst of public fury includes calls for some royal princes and government officials to resign , calling to mind the widespread anger in the US over the Bush administration 's ineffective response to hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
" This anger has never happened before , " says Waleed Abu Al Khair , a human rights lawyer in Jeddah and one of the creators of a Facebook page that has drawn more than 20,000 comments in four days .
The exasperation evident in the comments and in the columns of Saudi newspapers is propelled by widespread Saudi belief that mismanagement and corruption are to blame for Jeddah 's lack of adequate storm drainage and sewage systems .
" Good job , mayor ! " said a sarcastic comment on the Facebook page titled " Popular Campaign to Save the City of Jeddah . "
" All these billions , all these contracts ....
You have betrayed our trust ! "
Other angry citizens , many of them using their real names , posted links to old official announcements of multimillion - dollar spending plans to update Jeddah 's infrastructure .
Some demanded that officials be put on trial .
" People have been very vocal ... and unafraid because they 've seen the worst .
They have reached their breaking point , " said Reem Asaad , a Jeddah lecturer on finance .
" We 're fed up living in a city like Jeddah ... where services and infrastructure are poor .
We deserve much better . "
The city 's drainage system was overwhelmed this past Wednesday when a five - hour downpour dumped 3.7 inches of rain on the Red Sea port .
Many people were drowned as their cars were swept away and Saudis have asked why police were not on the streets to warn drivers away from dangerously flooded areas .
In addition to the deaths , the floods displaced more than 1,200 families , destroyed an estimated 4,000 vehicles , and caused millions of dollars in property damage , according to local papers .
Surprised officials
The floods occurred on the first day of the hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca that draws up to 2 million Muslims from around the world .
The entire government , from King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz on down , was preoccupied with making sure that the pilgrimage went off without a hitch .
It did , and early concerns about security disruptions and swine flu outbreaks did not occur , largely because officials had put in months of preparation prior to the hajj .
The unelected Saudi government does sometimes respond to public opinion , especially if it involves basic services .
How it will react to the public clamor to uproot official mismanagement and corruption is another matter .
In the past , such complaints have not led to any type of public punishment or prosecution .
King Abdullah has ordered monetary compensation and free medical care for displaced families , and the government will also compensate owners of damaged property .
The National Guard has been ordered into some neighborhoods to maintain security and assist local civil defense authorities .
Provincial governor Prince Khalid bin Faisal has ordered " an immediate investigation into the drainage network " of Jeddah and a report on the municipality 's plans for preventing future floods , the Saudi Gazette reported .
Rasha N. Heszi , spokeswoman for a civic society group called Mwatana , or Citizenship , says she believes the public outcry has " opened the eye of the government " to the fact that " people need to see quick wins " instead of being promised benefits in the long term .
Ms. Heszi's group has been organizing volunteers and distributing donated goods to people in areas hit by the floods .
People in one neighborhood were upset , she says , because no relief or rescue officials had yet appeared , probably because most were still working on the pilgrimage .
Mr. Khair , the lawyer , says he intends to file a class action suit against Jeddah 's municipality .
He does not think any official will be forced to resign , he adds .
" In Saudi Arabia , we did n't hear about someone leaving his office . "
The attorney says that the Facebook page was a useful alternative because street protests are illegal in the kingdom .
The Internet " is the only way .
We do n't have another way , " he says .
The episode has demonstrated " how technology allows people to shout out loud .
I have never seen this before in Saudi , " says Asaad , the lecturer .
Even if people commenting on Facebook " use pseudonyms , it 's a start , " she adds .
" But nowadays , people are using their real names . "
Anger has also surfaced in the print media , which has been given more latitude under King Abdullah but remains controlled by the state .
For example , the Saudi Gazette carried a hard - hitting interview with Jeddah 's Mayor Adel Faqih that included an unusual display of sarcasm from journalist Abdulaziz Ghazzawi .
When Mr. Faqih was asked why a brand - new underpass at a crucial intersection had filled with water , he replied that the city was " surprised by the floods . "
" Surprised ? " replied Mr. Ghazzawi .
" This is a new project that cost about [ $ 80 ] million .
What surprise are you talking about ? "
At the end of the interview , Faqih acknowledged that " at least 70 percent of the city lacks a proper drainage system . "
CRU to have old papers peer reviewed again
When you ’ve worked in radio and television news for 30 years as I have , you get an eye for spotting rubbish .
My rubbish detector went full tilt when I read this press release ( see below ) from UEA announcing they were going to have an “ independent external reappraisal ” of their peer reviewed publications .
I suppose that they think this move will be a “ double plus good ” public relations win for their work and for the organization .
Perhaps it will be seen that way by a select few .
But , review by the Royal Society , which has in the past done little if any significant questioning of its own about climate research , and in fact has a web page full of statements that are in line with the findings of many CRU papers , suggests that the Royal Society cannot be objective in this matter .
It suggests that the investigation ’s outcome is predetermined and only an exercise for the benefit of bolstering the appearance of high scientific standards via name dropping .
It suggests a whitewash .
I hope I ’m wrong .
UEA / CRU would have gained much more public trust and avoided criticsms like this by choosing a truly independent review organization that has not made any public statements about their position on climate change .
Here ’s what the Royal Society Climate Change web page has on it :
Debunking climate change myths
Scientists give their personal opinions on climate change
For example , the Royal Society has this on their web page under the heading : Misleading Arguments .
Misleading argument 4 : ’ Temperature observations do n’t support the theory ’
The central issue about CRU which led to the Climategate affair , which has led to this supposedly independent investigation , is that CRU would n’t share the temperature data and took illegal steps to suppress FOI requests from those who wanted to replicate the work to determine whether or not “ Temperature observations do n’t support the theory ” .
In fact if you follow that link at the Royal Society , they do n’t question surface measurements at all , but discuss instead why satellite measurements do n’t agree with surface measurements .
The message is that the Royal Society does not question the surface record .
With Royal Society having statements like that on their web page which already do n’t question the central issue from which the investigation arose , I suspect the outcome statement will be something like this :
“ While it is clear that requests for data sharing and FOI requests were handled improperly , our independent review team found that the research conducted by CRU has been done properly , within correct standards consistent with the scientific practices recognized by the Royal Society , and the conclusions are robust ” .
Meanwhile , we still do n’t have what has been asked for in the first place : full data , procedures , and code .
You wo n’t find a release like that on the UEA press page .
From the University of East Anglia press office :
New scientific assessment of climatic research publications announced
Thu , 11 Feb 2010
An independent external reappraisal of the science in the Climatic Research Unit ’s ( CRU ) key publications has been announced by the University of East Anglia .
The Royal Society will assist the University in identifying assessors with the requisite expertise , standing and independence .
“ Published papers from CRU have gone through the rigorous and intensive peer review process which is the keystone for maintaining the integrity of scientific research , ” said Professor Trevor Davies , the University ’s Pro-Vice - Chancellor for Research , Enterprise and Engagement .
“ That process and the findings of our researchers have been the subject of significant debate in recent months .
Colleagues in CRU have strenuously defended their conduct and the published work and we believe it is in the interests of all concerned that there should be an additional assessment considering the science itself . ”
The independent reassessment will complement Sir Muir Russell ’s Review of the key allegations about the handling of data arising from the publication of a series of e-mails hacked from CRU .
Sir Muir ’s Review is expected to announce its finding in Spring 2010 .
The reassessment of CRU ’s key publications will be completed at the earliest date the assessors can manage .
The findings will be made public

Euclid would map the distribution of dark matter
The competition to find the next great European space mission has seen three ideas move to the front of the field .
The European Space Agency's ( Esa ) Science Programme Committee ( SPC ) will meet next month to consider the current status of the candidates .
The committee members will have in front of them a report from an advisory group that has done a ranking on science .
A final decision is unlikely to be made for a year or so .
And to secure the opportunities available , the various competitors will have to show not only that their science is compelling but that their technological ambition is realistic and affordable .
Even then , only two missions can be afforded out of the three .
The concepts include a satellite that would map the " dark Universe " ( called Euclid ) , a probe to study the Sun up - close ( Solar Orbiter ) , and a telescope to find distant planets ( Plato ) .
At the moment , the trio are in the lead , jockeying for position for the earliest launch opportunities in Esa 's Cosmic Vision programme .
The first launch could come in 2017 .
However , the missions still have much to prove if they are ever to be flown by the agency .
Costs division A further concept known as Spica ( a contribution to a Japanese - led infrared telescope that builds on Europe 's heritage with its Herschel observatory ) is relatively low budget , and again has compelling science .
However , its special nature means it may now be treated in a separate way , depending on how the partner state 's side of the project evolves and the budget that ultimately becomes available .
The scientific community ran the rule over the concepts in December Two other ideas put forward for consideration in the competition have not been put out of the long - term picture .
They seem though to be too far from the SPC 's budget constraints to progress in this round .
They are Marco Polo ( an asteroid sample - return mission ) and Cross - Scale ( to study space plasmas ) .
Again , these concepts were considered to have excellent science credentials , according to the Space Science Advisory Committee .
But the high prospective cost of implementing these concepts means they would have to acquire additional partners to bring their foreseen budgets back into contention .
Very similar ideas to Marco Polo and Cross - Scale could well return to run in future competitions if the right international cooperation can be found .
Esa has budgeted up to 475 million euros ( £ 430 m ) ( at 2010 prices ) for its contribution to the Cosmic Vision winners .
The expectation is that the cost of the instruments that fly on the spacecraft will be borne directly by the member - states that provide them .
All the concepts were presented to the scientific community in December in what amounted to a kind of space " beauty contest " .
The six concepts in more detail : EUCLID - MAPPING THE 'DARK UNIVERSE '
Euclid would map the distribution of " dark matter " , the matter that cannot be detected directly but which astronomers know is there because of its gravitational effects on the matter we can see .
Hubble has done this for a tiny portion of sky measuring two square degrees .
Euclid would do it across 20,000 square degrees of sky .
The study would yield information also on " dark energy " , the mysterious phenomenon thought to be accelerating the expansion of the cosmos .
SOLAR ORBITER - GETTING UP CLOSE TO THE SUN'S ' ENGINE '
This would be a joint venture with the US .
Solar Orbiter would circle the Sun , flying to within 35 million km of our star to make detailed measurements of the activity from the equator to the poles .
The multi-instrumented probe would both observe the Sun and take in - situ measurements of its environment .
PLATO - SEARCHING FOR PLANETS LIKE OURS
A spacecraft incorporating a suite of telescopes to hunt for planets around nearby bright stars .
Crucially , these would include many rocky planets in the " habitable zone " - the region around a star where water can keep a liquid state .
Plato would find these worlds by monitoring stars for the tiny dips in light that occur when planets move across their faces .
SPICA - TO FILL THE 'INFRARED GAP '
A joint mission with the Japanese space agency ( Jaxa ) to send the next generation of infrared telescope into orbit .
Europe 's contribution would include the 3.5 m primary mirror and an instrument .
Spica would see targets beyond the vision of the current state - of - the art infrared observatories - Esa 's new Herschel telescope and Nasa 's soon - to - launch James Webb telescope .
CROSS - SCALE - SAMPLING THE SPACE AROUND US
A constellation of spacecraft that would fly around Earth to sample the charged gas , or plasma , that envelops our world .
Esa would provide seven spacecraft ; Japan and Canada are considering their own mission ( Scope ) which could bring an additional five satellites .
Together they would sample the plasma and detail its behaviour in three dimensions .
MARCO POLO - GRABBING SAMPLES FROM AN ASTEROID
A mission to a near - Earth asteroid to grab a handful of dust and pebbles off its surface to bring back to Earth labs for study .
Marco Polo is a spacecraft that would land on the asteroid to try to drill or scoop up what would be perhaps just tens of grams of material .
But even this small sample could give scientists invaluable insight into the formation of the Solar System .

“ I DID not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat - cat bankers , ” Barack Obama recently declared .
On Thursday January 14th he drove the point home , unveiling a special levy on large financial institutions to cover losses by taxpayers on the Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( TARP ) .
The “ Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee ” will snare around 50 banks and insurers with assets of more than $ 50 billion — 35 American institutions and 15 or so domestic subsidiaries of foreign firms .
Each will pay 0.15 % of its eligible liabilities , measured as total assets minus capital and deposits ( or , for insurers , policy reserves ) .
Investment banks with few deposits , such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , will be hit much harder than commercial banks .
The fee will last a minimum of ten years , and longer if that is necessary to recoup the full cost of TARP .
In a statement Mr Obama promised to “ recover every single dime the American people are owed " .
In fact The Treasury expects the fee to raise $ 90 billion over that period , and that this will be sufficient to cover the final bill — though its most conservative estimate is a loss of $ 120 billion .
Officials argue that , far from springing a surprise on banks , they are following the letter of the law that created the TARP , which called for the bail - out 's costs to be recouped from the financial sector by 2013 .
The politics of the levy are clear .
As banks ' pockets bulge again , they grow less popular .
According to a Bloomberg National Poll conducted in December , 64 % of Americans think bailing them out was a mistake .
Legislators are under pressure to respond to this anger , especially those facing mid-term elections in November .
Politics is not the only motive .
Hitting the giants addresses a genuine worry about banks whose size poses systemic dangers .
Some , however , worry that the banks will simply pass the extra costs to customers .
Another concern is that the levy will strip banks of funds that could otherwise be used to bolster their capital .
The timing of the fee is not coincidental .
Bonus season is looming on Wall Street .
America 's big banks are girding themselves for a storm of abuse when they unveil their annual results and compensation , starting on Friday with JPMorgan Chase .
They were vilified for vast losses in 2007 - 08 but the problem now for the pace - setters is voluminous profits .
The rebound in capital markets has pushed revenues back towards pre-crisis levels , and compensation pools with them .
Goldman Sachs is expected to fork out $ 18 billion for 2009 , not much less than its record payout in 2007 .
This is awkward , given the helping hand - outs banks got from the taxpayer .
Banks are not taking the issue lightly .
They are addressing skewed incentives by , for instance , paying a bigger share of bonuses as deferred shares , with a greater opportunity to claw this back if trades go wrong .
More importantly for their public image , banks are lowering their “ compensation ratios ” .
Investment banks used to give half their net revenues to employees .
This year it will be closer to 40 % .
Even so , the absolute numbers will still look indefensible , especially to the one in ten Americans workers without a job .
That leaves the banks destined to please no one : the public will see the pay numbers as disgracefully large and employees as disappointingly low .
The mood on Wall Street is part frustration ( that the cut in compensation ratios has failed to soften hearts ) ; part fear ( over possible defections to hedge funds ) ; and part anger ( over what financiers see as the Obama administration 's fanning of anti-bank sentiment ) .
All three emotions were heightened this week when Andrew Cuomo , New York 's attorney - general , demanded detailed information on pay policies from big banks .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , meanwhile , said it would use pay structures in calculating contributions to its deposit - insurance fund .
And compensation featured heavily when bosses of four big banks testified to the first hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission .
But it is the new tax that really has bankers foaming at the mouth ( in private , of course ; they have learned not to slam such things in public ) .
They complain that its design is fundamentally unfair , since it hits institutions that have settled their debt to the taxpayer : most big banks have already repaid their TARP funds , with interest .
The bulk of the losses will come at American International Group ( which is covered by the fee ) and carmakers ( which are not ) , along with spending for mortgage - modification programmes .
Such bleating rings hollow .
With banks paying fat bonuses so soon after a gut - wrenching rescue of the financial system , they themselves are largely to blame for the yawning disconnect with the beleaguered taxpayer .
Like him , they are set to get a taste of what it is like to cover someone else 's losses .
Tony G wrote his latest blog entry lately and tells about his plans to stake Isildur1 to some high stakes games .
Tony G writes about how he was in contact with Isildur1 by phone and knows who he is .
This time he just tells that he was only speculating who Isildur1 is ( Viktor Blom ) before , but now he has 100 % certainty about his identity and he is not going to reveal him .
He thinks it ’s better that Isildur1 maintains his “ mystical ” status .
Tony G’s trust to Isildur1 ’s skills is huge and he is planning to stake him in the biggest games :
“ I have had a few conversations over the phone with him and I really love the kid .
He is like me 15 years ago .
I just wish I had as much talent as he does .
He can play the world ’s best on eight tables and he only learned PLO about eight months ago .
Anyway , it is likely I will stake him in some big cash games in the future , this is what I do after all .
I like to give people a chance in life to do well . ”
Tony G adds that Isildur1 is not sueing Full Tilt Poker :
“ I can see how people attacked Full Tilt Poker on 2+2 – calling for lawsuits , etc. , but this is not what Isildur1 really wants .
He wants to enjoy his life and move on .
This is what he needs to do .
He is a brilliant player and with a little bit of hard work , he will build back up to a multimillion roll . ”
Tony G reveals about his personal deal a bit as well .
He is going to make an announcement soon and the deal is ready to be signed .
He ’s still not saying anything , but you can gather some bits and pieces from his talk that he might sign a deal with PartyPoker .
Tony says he ’s going to play more WPT tournaments next year and WPT is owned by PartyGaming .

The underwear bomber 's Christmas Day attack has prompted calls for the increased use of full - body scanners at airports that would strip - search passengers down to their naked bodies .
So to protest the use of the so - called Nacktscanner ( naked scanner ) , members of the Pirate Party in Germany organized a " fleshmob " of people who stripped down to their skivvies last Sunday and converged on the Berlin - Tegel airport .
They posted a video of their protest to YouTube , with soundtrack provided by Muse 's song " Uprising . "
The lyrics articulated their protest : " They will not force us .
They will stop degrading us .
They will not control us .
We will be victorious ! "
Warning :
The video above has mild nudity so may not be safe for work .
The protesters marked their bodies with a number of messages such as , " Something to hide ? " and " Be a good citizen – drop your pants . "
One woman has the word " diaper " scrawled on her lower back with an arrow pointing to her underwear and the word " prosthetic " printed on her leg .
The word " piercing " and an arrow point to one of her breasts .
Another woman dressed in a beige sweater and flesh - colored tights wears a sign reading " pixelated . "
( To address privacy concerns , security officials say the scanners can be programed to produce a blurred , pixelated image of passengers to protect their modesty . )
The full - body scanners use high - frequency radio waves to produce an image of a passenger 's naked body beneath clothes .
Anything a passenger is carrying against the body – weapons , drugs or explosives – would be exposed .
The scanners would also reveal the presence of prosthetic devices and breast implants .
As such , there have been privacy and legal concerns raised about the invasive equipment , particularly because it 's unclear if the scanners would be able to detect explosives hidden in body cavities and would therefore likely provide only minimal security .
German and Dutch authorities announced this week that they would be working together to test and possibly deploy full - body scanners in the two countries over the next year .
The move comes in the wake of concerns that a would - be bomber was able to board a flight from Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport on Dec. 25 wearing packs of chemical explosives concealed in his underwear .
Although Amsterdam has been conducting a test pilot of full - body scanners since 2006 , the armed passenger was not scanned by one of the devices before boarding his flight to Detroit .
European Union regulations do not currently allow mandatory use of the equipment .
The scanners are currently being used in about 19 U.S. airports , though the Transportation Security Administration has plans to deploy about 300 more .
The machines are used on a voluntary basis only ; passengers can opt to have a full - body pat down instead of being scanned .

It is a busy afternoon for the 20 or so teenagers gathered at the offices of Spiritus Mundi in Malmö , Sweden .
Some are singing in the recording studio while others are writing lyrics .
In the spring , they will ­perform their own musical , a play on how children take over their school .
Most of the 16 - to 19 - year - olds did n't know one another before the project started .
They come from different parts of town – some richer , some poorer .
The aim is to bring everybody together , in order to increase social cohesion in a city – the third largest in Sweden – where housing segregation is a big issue .
" Our purpose is to promote cultural exchange and understanding , " says Susanne Brannebo , Spiritus Mundi 's managing director .
Spiritus Mundi is an independent charity but the musical could not have happened without state support , says Brannebo .
Funding comes from the Swedish Inheritance Fund – a state - managed programme in which if someone dies without a written will and no living spouse or close family their property is pooled and redistributed to charities .
Britain's Conservative leader , David Cameron , argues that " rolling back the state will serve to roll forward society " and that " a strong society will solve our problems more effectively than big governments has or ever will " .
But Sweden offers a good example of an alternative view : a society with a strong public sector and a vibrant civil society .
Cameron 's statements are puzzling to the people at Spiritus Mundi .
" The government should not get out of the way by stopping to give funds , " says Henrik Melius , the organisation 's founder and chairman .
" It should be ready to support NGOs . "
A strong state has certainly not prevented Swedes from volunteering .
Around 48 % of the adult population is regularly engaged in the activity , according to a 2009 study by Ersta Sköndal University College .
The average volunteer does around 16 hours of work a month , up from 14 hours in 2005 .
" This is the equivalent of 400,000 full - time jobs , " says Professor Lars Svedberg , one of the authors of the research .
" Swedes are exceptionally active by international standards .
It is only in the US , Norway and the Netherlands that you find a similar proportion of the population volunteering . "
In England , just 26 % of people formally volunteered at least once a month in 2008 - 09 , according to the Citizenship survey , and the average volunteer gave up just over seven hours of their time a month in 2007 - 08 , the latest figures available .
Sweden 's vibrant civil society exists in a country with one of the world 's most interventionist welfare states .
Swedes ' personal income tax can be as little as 29 % of pay , but anyone earning over £ 32,000 will pay between 49 % and 60 % through a combination of local government and state income tax .
The country 's tax burden , at 47.1 % of GDP , is the world 's second largest , after Denmark .
In exchange , Swedes enjoy the benefits of arguably the world 's most generous welfare state .
Parents get universal nursery coverage capped at £ 130 a month , free schools , free health and dental care for under - 18s , as well as generous personal benefits such as a child allowance of £ 1,070 a year per child .
Most jobseekers can expect to receive 80 % of their previous salary for the first 200 days of inactivity ( dropping to 70 % for the next 100 days ) .
Couples can have joint parental leave lasting 480 days , which they can divide as they want , most of the time paid at 80 % of their income .
By and large , people are well taken care of .
Sweden 's expansive welfare state helps to explain the vitality of the volunteer organisations in the country , says Svedberg .
" The welfare state plays a very important part by giving people the practical and mental space necessary to be able to be active .
It creates possibilities for citizens . "
Strikingly , the people who volunteer the most are those you might think have the least time available .
" Most volunteers are working full time and have one or two children , " he says .
" They tend to be well educated and well connected .
If you are connected to different social arenas , you are more likely to be recruited into volunteering activities . "
However , the welfare state is not the only reason volunteering bodies do well .
Sweden has a long tradition of volunteering , dating back to the early 20th century , which rose out of popular movements fighting for temperance , free churches or labour rights .
While the welfare state developed into what it is today , volunteer groups also continued to grow .
" There 's always been a lively civil society living side by side with the strong welfare state , " says Svedberg .
" We do n't have a problem finding volunteers for our programmes , " says Annica Marktröm , who co-runs the office of Individual Human Help ( IM ) in Malmö , which focuses on tackling poverty and exclusion in the city .
She has 120 or so volunteers on her books , who run programmes such as social activities for youngsters and homework help in Rosengård , a disadvantaged district of the city .
Volunteers tend to be older people or students , she says .
" Usually they do it for a year , and when we need new people we always find enough , " she explains as we make our way to a " language cafe " in the southern district of Möllevången where immigrants can practise their Swedish with native speakers .
The event takes place every Monday night in the basement of a local church .
When we walk in , the room is packed : over coffee and cookies , a dozen or so Swedes are chatting away with about the same number of new arrivals , including a Vietnamese waiter and a Spanish student .
" It 's more or less those numbers every week , " says Louisa Torstensson , 28 , a production planner for a telecom company who has been volunteering at the cafe for two - and - a - half years .
" I work regular hours so it 's no big deal to be here every week , " she says .
" It is such an easy way to help someone , " says Eva Malmros , 28 , after chatting with a 13 - year - old Iraqi girl about her school lessons .
" You see how happy people are afterwards . "
For Marktröm , the work that IM does in Malmö cannot take the place of that done by the public sector .
" We are a complement to what it does , " she says .
" It is important to be involved in your society and show that people care .
If you are involved , you understand that you can influence society . "
Homework help
For this reason Marktröm disagrees with the state contracting out services to charities and has refused a recent request from Malmö city authorities for IM to run all the homework help provided to pupils in Rosengård – the city currently does some projects , while IM does others .
" We said no , " says Marktröm .
" We do n't want unpaid people to do something that the state should provide .
It is the city 's responsibility , and it 's important that they are present .
Our role is to be here as a complement . "
According to Ludvig Sandberg , a political adviser at the Forum for Voluntary Social Work , an umbrella organisation representing Swedish charities , most Swedes think that an active public sector is good for civil society .
" If there is less government , the risks of inequality and poverty are much larger and the risks of clashes on ethnic or cultural grounds would grow a lot , " he points out .
" This would be a quite different environment for civil society to operate in . "
Yet the debate in Sweden on this question is far from static .
Fredrik Reinfeldt , the country 's centre - right prime minister – often labelled the Swedish David Cameron – has been describing the idea that civil society , not the welfare state , is the basis of society and that the public sector is there to assist .
This runs contrary to the classic Swedish social - democratic concept of the " strong society " , where the public sector provides the welfare that the citizens need and is the basis for society as a whole .
But what comes back again and again from Sweden 's experience is that collaboration between the voluntary and public sectors is what matters .
" We are not afraid of government , " says Melius .
" We are able to survive and grow by , for instance , getting commissions from the city of Malmö , or when they help us with our application for EU funding . . .
Government should not get out of the way . "
Brannebo adds : " The public sector can learn from our experience and we can learn from theirs .
There is room for both . "
An attempt to create an all - white basketball league in the southern United States is being heavily criticized .
According to a statement from the league , the All - American Basketball Alliance , " Only players that are natural born United States citizens with both parents of Caucasian race are eligible to play in the league . "
The league hopes to form twelve teams in twelve different cities .
The commissioner of the league , Don " Moose " Lewis , claims he hopes to emphasize fundamental basketball , instead of the " street ball " played by " people of color . "
Lewis cited the recent incident with Gilbert Arenas as one reason why fans are dissatisfied with current professional sports teams .
Lewis outright denies the motivation behind the league is racism , and says there is no motive of hate .
Unsurprisingly , Lewis has already received threats and several cities have told him to stay out of their city .

Enlarge By Charles Krupa , AP Republican Scott Brown 's triumph over Democrat Martha Coakley in Tuesday 's special Senate race marks the third statewide loss in a row for the president 's party .
Brown supporters react to his election win in Boston , Mass . , on Tuesday .
QUICK QUESTION QUICK QUESTION
WASHINGTON  Sen.-elect Scott Brown , R - Mass. , held his first press conference Wednesday saying he should be seated immediately and that his win signified that people are " tired of business as usual . "
Brown 's triumph over Democrat Martha Coakley in Tuesday 's special Senate race marks the third statewide loss in a row for President Obama 's party and the one most fraught with political and policy implications .
Brown gives the Republicans the 41st vote they need to block legislation in the Senate .
The vote came one year to the day after Obama 's euphoric inauguration and as the president is trying to rescue his legislative agenda and his top domestic priority , health care .
As he did throughout the campaign , Brown on Wednesday stressed his independence and said " I 'm going to be a Scott Brown Republican .
Maybe there is a new breed of Republican coming to Washington . "
He said he would n't be " beholden to anybody .
I 've made that very clear . "
On health care , Brown said people are tired of business as usual , citing the example of Sen. Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , who cut a deal on Medicaid for his home state of Nebraska before he would vote for health care .
Nelson has since asked that the deal be removed from the bill — unless it is expanded to all states .
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS : Health care will move forward
Brown , one of only five Republicans in the 40 - member state Senate , is the first Republican to win a Massachusetts Senate race since 1972 .
He will be stepping into a seat occupied for 47 years by Sen.
Edward Kennedy , a liberal icon and chief advocate for expanding the nation 's health care coverage .
Some party rank - and - filers are calling for a new message .
" It 's another wake - up call , " said Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia , who is one of about 40 House Democrats facing tough re-election battles this year .
" We 've got to be about jobs , jobs , jobs . "
But Sen. Tom Harkin , D - Iowa. , said Wednesday he had " two words : Do n't panic .
Two more words : Resist chaos . "
Democratic leaders now must consider whether to push for final approval of the health care bill .
They have been trying to negotiate a compromise bill that would reconcile the differences between bills approved in the House and Senate .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , said Wednesday the election was " in many ways a national referendum . "
He said he did not expect Democratic Senate leaders would try to pass a revised bill before Brown is seated .
" I think the majority has gotten the message :
No more gamesmanship here , " he said .
" If you do it all by yourself , the public probably ai n't gonna buy it . "
President Obama told ABC News Wednesday that Congress should not " jam " through a health care bill until Brown is seated .
" Here 's one thing I know and I just want to make sure that this is off the table :
The Senate certainly should n't try to jam anything through until Scott Brown is seated , " Obama said .
" The people of Massachusetts spoke .
He 's got to be part of that process . "
Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D - W.Va. , said the easiest route would be for the House to pass the Senate bill but he acknowledged that might not be easy at all .
" That 's a hard thing to put on the House ... it 's easy for a senator to say , ' Oh , well , we 'll have the House pass it . ' "
Sen . Susan Collins , R - Maine , said the best way to proceed is to start over : " There are many provisions in this bill that have bipartisan support .
The way to proceed is to start from scratch . "
Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank , a Democrat and strong supporter of the health care legislation , agreed .
He said Brown 's victory means Congress will have to " start over on health care " and said he will vote against any bill rushed to the floor before Brown can be sworn in .
Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe , one of two Republicans in Congress to vote in favor of any version of President Obama 's health care legislation , said she remains opposed to the current version of the bill .
Her comments appeared to close the door on one route Democrats had considered for passing the bill in the wake of Brown 's victory .
" I never say anything is dead , but I think that clearly they 're going to have to revisit the entire issue , " said Snowe , who voted for an early version of the bill passed last year by the Senate Finance Committee .
" I think that was true from the outset ...
I think there were a lot of concerns that ultimately , collectively manifested themselves in yesterday 's vote . "
Brown , touted his come - from - behind Senate bid as a chance to put the brakes on the Obama agenda , pleading with voters to make him the Republicans ' " 41st senator . "
The president also saw the race as a referendum on his program .
In taped calls , he told Massachusetts voters that his efforts to pass health care legislation , regulate the financial industry and promote a green economy " will probably rest on one vote in the United States Senate . "
Members of the Obama administration said Wednesday they may change tactics after Brown 's victory , but their goals remain the same — and that includes health care .
" Our job is to fight every day for the economic interests of everyday people , not for the special interests here in Washington , " said senior adviser David Axelrod .
That includes the rising cost of health care and health care insurance , he said .
Obama " is not going to walk away from that , " Axelrod said .
" We want to finish the job on that . "
Brown said he had a nice conversation with the president .
" He called .
He called right away , " he said , adding that they talked about their families , basketball and , of course , the pickup that Brown famously campaigned in around the state and Obama commented on during a rally Sunday for Coakley .
" I asked him him , ' Do you want me to bring the truck ? ' "
Brown said Wednesday , adding " you have to have a sense of humor in politics . "

REALITY : Lady Gaga ’s bizarre getups only distract from the fact that she ’s a brilliant songwriter .
Lady Gaga ’s purportedly transgressive persona — wearing doilies over her head in lieu of pants , possibly having a secret penis — relentlessly dares you to despise her , and it ’s no surprise so many have taken the bait .
The press focuses on her performance - art shtick in lieu of her songs , so even though The Fame has been one of 2009 ’s biggest - selling albums , nobody seems to have pointed out that it ’s also one of the best .
Partly it ’s the sound — an unabashedly bonkers , rubbery synth - loop boogie that manages to sell back 35 years of esoteric Eurotrash as something unmistakably in - your - face and American , without ever branding itself as retro .
If you ’re tuned in to them , blatantly uncool references abound : Ace of Base ’s Swedish reggae , Aqua ’s Danish Barbie twirl , Boney M. ’s Teutonic West Indies world disco ; her single “ Paparazzi ” has the ominous minor - key fragility of ’ 80s Italo - pop .
Gaga ropes in distorted rhythms from KMFDM sprocket - rock to Peaches electroclash .
But she also croons a cascading Latin freestyle ballad called “ Brown Eyes , ” heartfelt enough to be Lisa Lisa in 1987 .
And in her flirtiest tracks , “ Boys Boys Boys ” and “ Summerboy , ” she ’s a California girl on Echo Beach , bopping along to Blondie in her new - wave bikini .
All of which would already be wonderful if Gaga ’s songwriting was n’t just as inventive .
But on The Fame , she leaves no doubt that word games are as much her idea of a good time as love games .
“ Poker Face ” extends a gambling metaphor through several verses as cleverly as any country outlaw .
Over the hard thump of “ Just Dance , ” a celebratory night out implodes into fright and confusion in ways so mundane it ’s a shock no lyricist thought to detail them before :
A boozed - up girl misplaces her keys and phone , turns her shirt inside out , forgets what club she ’s in and what song is playing .
Gaga ’s most inescapable obsession albumwide , though , is kinky sex , which she ’s sane enough to depict as not so much decadent as funny .
And through it all , she ’s tossing off nonsense syllables and phrasing pirouettes and juvenile side chants and martial Marine grunts and cherry - cherry - boom - booms just to throw you off balance , preferably without losing her own footing .
If you play along with her bag of tricks and disco sticks , accept her pretensions as a new twist on club music ’s costumed tradition , and refuse to be blindsided by her backstory , it ’s as delirious a dance as you ’ve witnessed all year .

Phishing fraudsters have extended their net beyond harvesting e-banking credentials via a scam that resulted in the theft of 250,000 carbon permits worth over € 3 m .
The outbreak of fraud resulted in the suspension of trading in several EU registries on 2 February .
The crooks are thought to have created fake emission registries , promoted via spam emails , before using identity details submitted on these sites to trade rights to blow - off greenhouse gases on the legitimate sites .
Six unnamed German firms were among the victims of the scam , a new form of corporate identity theft .
Illegal transactions have also happened in the Czech Republic .
German police have begun investigating the fraud .
The EU Commission may also become involved , the BBC reports .
Meanwhile the United Nations ' Framework on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) is working with national registries to boost the security of registries and to help develop policies to frustrate similar attacks in future .
Short term measures reportedly include warning users and resetting passwords .
Emissions trading continued via the European Emissions Exchange but exchanges in Belgium , Denmark , Hungary , Italy , Greece , Romania , Bulgaria , Spain and Germany were badly affected .
Registries in Austria , the Netherlands and Norway were temporarily suspended but began trading again after minimal disruption .
" We have to be careful not to blow this out of proportion , " EU environment spokeswoman Barbara Helfferich told EUobserver .
" This happens to banks , Visa , Mastercard about once or twice a month .
And this is the same sort of thing .
" It 's not something intrinsic to the ETS ( Emissions Trading Scheme ) .
This could happen to anyone , " she added .
Net security firm McAfee adds that a phishing attack targeting the Danish quota - market occurred in 12 January , leading to its temporary suspension , prior to a much wider attack two weeks later around the turn of the month .
McAfee analyst Francois Paget suggested that " [ the ] people behind these attacks cannot be simple hackers " , but are instead " likely [ to be ] in the pay of rogue states that reject rules - based international trade " .
Crikey .
A graphic from McAfee suggests that cordon permits were raided via a network of corrupt brokers and intermediaries via a scheme akin to VAT carousel fraud , where crooks collect the tax on easy to trade goods such as mobile phones before disappearing before a tax bill becomes due .
McAfee 's explanation is the best stab we 've seen at explaining how fraudsters laundered stolen carbon permits which , unlike credit card details or even webmail accounts , are not the sort of thing you are likely to be able to sell in underground hacking forums .
Use of carbon permit " money mules " and cash transfers via Western Union also seems a bit unlikely . ®

“ Do the parents value his education more than they value a 4 - year - old ’s decision to make his own grooming choices ? ”

The boy ’s parents , Delton Pugh and Elizabeth Taylor , have argued that it is unfair to punish Taylor for his longish locks ; it suggests , they say , that the district cares more about appearances than education .
“ I do n’t think it ’s right to hold a child down and force him to do something , ” Mr. Pugh , a tattoo artist , told The Associated Press .
“ It ’s not hurting him or affecting his education . ”
The parents rejected a compromise proposed by the board under which they would braid his hair and pin it up .
Since Nov. 24 , when his principal decreed that Taylor ’s hair had grown too long , the boy has been sent to the library to study alone with a teacher ’s aide .
“ They kicked me out of that place , ” Taylor told a reporter on Dec. 17 .
“ I miss my friends . ”
Climate - gate part I occurred in early December when a still - unknown person posted thousands of e-mails and documents on a scientific website .
The e-mails showed that scientists at the leading " global warming " research institute in the world , East Anglia University 's Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) had " changed " weather data to prove their climate - warming theories , and squelched dissenting opinions from skeptical scientists to maintain credibility for their fraud .
Climate - gate part II begins now :
The scientists with Icecap.us website announced findings late last week that not only was the CRU involved in producing fraudulent weather data , but two United States agencies , National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , have also been falsifying climate reports for years .
NOAA , the report concludes , is actually " ground - zero " for the fraud of global warming , not the East Anglia Institute .
Climate researchers have discovered that government researchers improperly manipulated data in order to claim 2005 as " THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD . "
In a new report supported by SPPI , computer expert E. Michael Smith and Certified Consulting Meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo discovered extensive manipulation of the temperature data by the U.S. Government 's National Climate Data Center ( NCDC ) in Asheville , North Carolina Smith and D'Aleo accuse these centers of manipulating temperature data to give the appearance of warmer temperatures than actually occurred by trimming the number and location of weather observation stations and then ‘ adjuting the data in ways that increase the apparent warming .
The results of Smith and D'Aleo 's findings were aired in a special on KUSI - TV hosted by founder of the Weather Channel and long - time meteorologist and climate " realist " , John Coleman .
D'Aleo 's preliminary report is HERE .
Segments of the KUSI - TV report are HERE .
SPPI 's website will print the final report soon .
Not related directly to the investigation by the climate - gate scientists , but related nonetheless was another new report :
Polar bears are not dying or drowning due to melting icebergs caused by climate change .
There are so many polars bears in Canada , they are causing problems .
This news is coming from Canadian wildlife agencies that have real live Inuit Indian hunters who count the real , live polar bears on the ground and in the water .
The United States Geologic Survey ( USGS ) , which has made the alarming findings about polar bear populations being extinct in 20 years , fly over in helicopters and make reports based on " analysis " of weather predictions .
Gabriel Nirlungayuk , director of wildlife for Nunavut Tuungavik Inc . says it is getting " beary " scary in many Canadian towns :
During the summer and fall , families enjoying outdoor activities must be on the look - out for bears .
Many locals invite along other hunters for protection .
Last year , in Pelly Bay , all the bears that were captured were caught in town , Nirlungayuk says .
" You now have polar bears coming into towns , getting into cabins , breaking property and just creating havoc for people up here , " he says .
In the Western Hudson Bay area , where harvest quotas were reduced by 80 percent four years ago , communities are complaining about the number of polar bears .
" Now people can look out the window and see as many as 20 polar bears at the ice - flow edge . "
Here is my dream : I go to the Verizon Wireless store with Franz Kafka .
I tell the friendly salesperson that I want to upgrade my wife 's cellphone .
She looks up my information .
Kafka follows the exchange intently .
She explains to me that there are three numbers on my account , two of them phones and one of them a mobile broadband line .
Each one has a contract with different termination time .
My wife 's phone is not yet eligible for a discounted price on a new phone .
But we can get a discount on a phone .
if we extend the contract of the broadband line for two more years .
Depending on the phone I choose , the prices vary , but all of them require the filing of baffling rebate forms .
If I do n't like this I can end the contract .
But ending a contract before the term expires will invoke a penalty that wipes out all discounts and puts me deep in the red .
At the rate our phones either die or need upgrading , my family will be bound to Verizon until well after the heat death of the universe .
" What if I buy the phone full - price ? " I ask .
" Do I pay the same rates , even though I 'm not getting a discount for the phone ? "
Yes .
Same rates , even though I 'm no longer amortizing a phone .
By the way , she adds , the terms of the contract have changed , and my data charges have gone up .
And Kafka says : " This sucks . "
The sad part of this dream is that I did n't make it up , except for the Kafka part .
Cellphone carrier contracts are beyond broken – they 're breaking us .
Even as Apple has helped open up our smartphones to outside software providers , we are still prisoners of a business model that keeps us indentured to Verizon , chained to AT&T , shackled to Sprint every time we buy a phone that seems cheap on the day we buy it , but costs us much more over time .
Enter Google .
When the company first announced it was making a mobile operating system called Android , the idea was that it would supply the system to manufacturers and networks , just like Microsoft does with Windows and computers .
But now Google is selling its own phone , called Nexus One .
Andy Rubin , who heads up Android , says that the big reason Google is doing this is that the search giant is just as unhappy as we are with the way phones are sold .
So Google is selling the Nexus unlocked , direct on its website .
It costs $ 520 without a contract .
It works on any network that takes a GSM SIM card .
You find your carrier after the purchase .
As Kafka would have said , " Wunderbar ! "
But hold on .
At launch , the only carrier supporting the Nexus was T - Mobile , which was offering a two - year contract in exchange for a discount on the phone .
Gee , that sounds familiar .
For Google 's idea to work , the Verizons , T - Mobiles , Sprints and AT&Ts of the would have to compete vigorously to sign up the people who buy unlocked Nexus Ones and are looking for a carrier .
This assumes that those carriers will want anything to do with customers who refuse to enter into contracts that are – to put it plainly – Kafkaesque .
I hope that they do want that business , and that they offer dirt - cheap , no -obligation plans for people who buy expensive , unsubsidized phones .
Does the Google gambit have the carriers shaking in their spectrums ?
My guess is no .
Verizon and the rest do n't have to worry about a mass exodus to Google 's unlocked phones , because they have already locked their customers into those virtually perpetual contracts – the same endless contracts that Google wants to put an end to .
In my dream , Franz Kafka is laughing .

Even as popular culture makes space for gay and lesbian lives , the sports world remains cloistered in its own heterosexist silo , says former Canadian Olympian Mark Tewksbury .
“ It ’s incredible that sport has remained the last bastion of 18th - century thinking , ” says Tewksbury , who brought home a gold medal for the 100 meters backstroke at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona while still closeted .
Everything else has progressed , he says , but the sports world stands out as the exception , as a large closet on an increasingly open horizon .
“ It ’s a very difficult place to be if you ’re not straight , ” Tewksbury said at Vancouver ’s Q Hall of Fame launch last September .
“ Sport is still top down from policy makers , ” he explained to Xtra in 2006 , after the release of his book , Inside Out .
“ It ’s very dogmatic and rule - bound .
People do n’t want to change rule structures .
It ’s by nature highly conservative .
It ’s pretty much the last machinations of the old - boys club . ”
No surprise then that Tewksbury waited until after he retired to come out .
“ I was n’t ready , ” he says when asked why he did n’t come out during competition .
“ It ’s a complicated issue .
There was a lot of fear — fear of losing my coach , my teammates and my livelihood . ”
If the average private gay citizen is afraid to come out , think how professional athletes feel , he said in 2006 .
“ Think about that amplified exponentially because you ’re in the public eye , part of this macho image world .
You ’re maybe physically putting yourself at risk .
That ’s what probably keeps a gay male professional team player in the closet . ”
It ’s fear of the unknown public response that keeps athletes in the closet today , Tewksbury says .
Jim Buzinski agrees .
Buzinski is co-founder of Outsports.com , a US - based online publication dedicated to gay athletes and sport .
He , too , thinks athletes do n’t come out because they ’re afraid of how the public , their coaches and their teammates will respond .
“ [ Athletes ] need some assurance that nothing will change and they will be treated the same , ” he says , “ and until they get that they will stay in the closet . ”
The coaches , administration and straight athletes need to create an environment more conducive to coming out , Buzinski says .
“ There has to be more acceptance . ”
“ We need more people to come out in all areas of society and sport is no different , ” he notes .
“ We are still waiting for people to come out and tell their stories so people do n’t feel they are alone , [ but ] people do n’t want to be the one out there by themselves .
They do n’t want to be the pioneer . ”
Some surveys suggest that the highest - profile professional men ’s sports leagues may be more welcoming than many gays and lesbians believe .
A 2006 Sports Illustrated survey asked pro basketball , football and hockey players whether they would “ welcome an openly gay teammate ? ”
Over half the athletes polled from the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , National Football League ( NFL ) and National Hockey League ( NHL ) said yes .
The NHL was the least homophobic , with 80 percent of the 346 players polled saying they would have no problem with a gay member on their team .
The Sports Illustrated findings sound positive , Buzinski says , but the theory must be tested .
“ It ’s nice to hear and it ’s a positive step , but until someone active in the sport comes out and says , ‘ I ’m gay , ’ no one will ever know how accurate the survey is . ”
In another poll , conducted in 2005 by the market research firm Penn , Schoen & Berland Associates and released by Sports Illustrated , NBC and the USA Network , 78 percent of the 979 randomly surveyed Americans agreed that it is “ okay for gay athletes to participate in sports , even if they are open about their sexuality . ”
However , 68 percent of the respondents thought coming out would hurt an athlete ’s career .
And 62 percent agreed that “ the reason there is so little coverage of gays in sports is because America is not ready to accept gay athletes . ”
“ There are seeds of change , ” says former professional snowboarder Ryan Miller .
“ But there is still that dichotomy where people will come and say they do n’t have a problem with [ gay athletes ] as long as they are not in [ their ] locker room . ”
“ I do n’t know if it [ professional sports ] is the last closet , ” muses Miller .
“ But it is one of the last . ”
Miller speaks from personal experience .
Ten years ago he was competing in Vancouver in one of his first professional snowboard competitions when he suddenly came out — a move prompted by taunts from teammates to go to a straight strip club .
The move transformed his career .
He eventually had to seek another team and coach .
“ I had had enough of it , ” he says of his impromptu decision to come out at age 24 .
“ I was so over the double life .
I was trying to put on a second life for sponsors , teams and personal appearances .
It was way too much energy and way too much stress . ”
That night , dodging yet another round of testosterone - fuelled locker - room banter and uninterested in watching scantily clad women pole dance , he made an announcement .
“ I ’m gay and I ’m going to dinner ! ” he told his teammates .
“ There were only two or three teammates who would share a condo with me after that , ” Miller says .
“ Even though I was n’t living a double life anymore it was almost as though I had to work harder in my profession , ” he admits .
“ There are still a vast majority of corporations that do n’t want to engage [ with gay athletes ] , ” he adds .
Tewksbury does n’t buy the sponsorship pressure argument .
“ That was the argument that kept me in the closet .
‘ Oh you ’ll lose everything , you ca n’t tell anyone . ’
Let ’s face it : there are so many gay characters in mainstream entertainment .
There is an openness to it .
It ’s not like the public en masse has shunned this , ” he told Xtra in 2006 .
“ Why ca n’t that translate into support for a real person ? ”
“ There ’s probably an entire queer gamut of professional athletes , ” says Betty Baxter , former head coach of the Canadian National Volleyball Team who was fired in 1982 for being a lesbian .
“ But they ca n’t come out , ” she maintains .
“ Queer people in sport are not going to talk .
Not if the sport is important to them … .
Not at the risk of losing your professional career . ”
With a handful of championship titles under his belt , Johnny Weir won bronze at the US Figure Skating Championships in Spokane in January and set commentators ’ tongues a - wagging with his exhibition skate to “ Poker Face ” by Lady Gaga .
The 25 - year - old is generating a lot of buzz these days and is often described as flamboyant , colourful , eccentric and a diva .
In September , Outsports.com asked Weir about his sexual orientation .
“ I think everyone has the right to ask people anything .
But the way I see things like coming - out parties and being very theatrical and making such a big spectacle of things , I just do n’t agree with making it a big spectacle , ” Weir replied .
“ I was born Johnny Weir , whatever that entails .
People can make their own assumptions and people can talk and people can chat , but it does n’t change who I am and all of these things that contribute to my life .
“ Being gay ?
I ’m all for it .
I love gay people , I love African - American people , I love lesbians , I love Asians .
To me , there ’s no importance to making a show out of something that ’s just you .
I promote Johnny Weir and I ’m as ridiculous as they come , but that ’s what I want people to see is that I ’m Johnny Weir . ”
Despite numerous requests ,
Weir ’s press team would not grant Xtra an interview .
“ People talk , ” Weir writes on his website .
“ Figure skating is thought of as a female sport , something that only girly men compete in .
I do n’t feel the need to express my sexual being because it ’s not part of my sport and it ’s private .
I can sleep with whomever I choose and it does n’t affect what I ’m doing on the ice , so speculation is speculation . ”
“ If sexuality had no bearing [ on sport ] then people would n’t feel the need to talk about it , ” Tewksbury counters .
Despite the apparent pressure on gay athletes to keep their sexuality quiet , the 2010 Games will see a groundbreaking flash of pink this month when the first - ever Pride House opens its doors to Olympians .
Conceived as an open and welcoming venue for all gay athletes and their allies , Pride Houses in Whistler and Vancouver will celebrate authenticity in sport — though organizers do n’t know how many Olympians will venture inside .
“ The primary rule of Pride House is really to create conversation .
To create that dialogue and raise awareness of homophobia , ” says organizer Dean Nelson .
“ If athletes choose to come and visit us and they ’re ready to share their story as part of their personal journey , then we welcome them .
“ But everybody is on their own journey , ” he says , adding , “ we ’re creating a platform that people can utilize if they want to . ”
Anne Frank ’s adolescent curiosity about sexuality is too much for a Virginia school district that has pulled the complete version of the young Jewish girl ’s diary off its curriculum and off its shelves over a parent ’s complaint about sexually explicit passages .
Culpeper County Public Schools has pulled Anne Frank ’s The Diary of a Young Girl : The Definitive Edition off the shelves because parents complained “ over the sexual nature of the vagina passage in the definitive edition , ” reports the Culpeper , Virginia , Star - Exponent .

The complaint has to do specifically with an expanded version of the diary published in 1995 .
Frank ’s father , Otto , had excised large parts of his daughter ’s diary prior to publication in the late 1940s .
Anne died of typhus while being held at the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp in March , 1945 .
Her diary has made her arguably the most famous Holocaust victim .
According to Valerie Strauss at the Washington Post , the offending passage is a description of female genitalia :
There are little folds of skin all over the place , you can hardly find it .
The little hole underneath is so terribly small that I simply can’t imagine how a man can get in there , let alone how a whole baby can get out !
The decision to pull the book appears to have been made quickly , last November , on the basis of one complaint from a parent .
The Star - Exponent reports :
Citing a parent ’s concern over the sexual nature of the vagina passage in the definitive edition , Allen said school officials immediately chose to pull this version and use an alternative copy .
“ What we have asked is that this particular edition will not be taught , ” Allen said from his office Wednesday morning .
“ I ’m happy when parents get involved with these things because it lets me know that they are really looking and have their kids ’ best interest ( in mind ) .
And that ’s where good parenting and good teaching comes in . ”

Amazon.com lists Anne Frank ’s diary as one of the most banned children ’s books , “ for being too depressing for students . ”
The diary chronicles some two years of Frank ’s life as she hid out with her family in Nazi- occupied Amsterdam during World War II .
It is considered one of the most famous and vivid accounts of the war .
But the American Library Association says it has documented only six challenges to the book since 1990 .
( Editor ’s Note : Article originally wrongly stated that Frank died in Auschwitz . )
Dolby Laboratories , the company behind theater sound systems , makes glasses that filter out different frequencies of red , green and blue .
They cost about $ 28 each .
The glasses of the third company , XpanD , use battery - powered LCD shutters that open and shut so each eye sees the appropriate frame of the movie .
Those cost as much as $ 50 each .

Each company claims its glasses and projection - system technology is better .
Because glasses using one technology are useless in a theater using a different digital projection system , the companies backing the three technologies are scrambling for the upper hand while the 3 - D industry is still in its infancy .
James Cameron , the director of “ Avatar , ” is more often than not the main marketing tool .
He has endorsed RealD , says the company , which has about 5,000 screens using its system .
But he , his wife and his production partner were photographed at the premiere in Japan wearing XpanD glasses , which work on 2,000 screens worldwide .
Dolby says its glasses work with 2,200 screens , but it has no Cameron connection .
The company helpfully points out instead how a malfunction in the RealD system spoiled a press preview of “ Avatar . ”
The battle over what glasses patrons wear is a big deal because exhibitors are convinced that 3 - D , while seeming like a gimmick now , will lure movie lovers away from their crisp high - definition widescreen TVs at home and back to the theater .
But Maria Costeira , the chief executive of XpanD , believes the sky ’s the limit : “ Eventually , we ’ll see 3 - D movies on airplanes as well . ”
The fight over the glasses may well intensify because TV makers are now pushing 3 - D TVs for the home as a way to increase their sales of more expensive sets .
Think Avatar for military spies .
Pentagon far - out research arm Darpa wants to turn surveillance into a 3 - D experience for troops .
It has launched the Fine Detail Optical Surveillance ( FDOS ) Program , and are requesting proposals for prototypes of optical imaging systems that would use " advanced high - resolution 3 - D imaging technology . "
Darpa wants two kinds of surveillance systems : portable units for active battle and drone - ready systems for unmanned planes .
The agency wants proposals that start from scratch , using a fundamentally new model for obtaining video footage .
The 3 - D surveillance should be able to monitor moving targets with high resolution , from different ranges , and without the need for users to do much legwork , like scanning or refocusing on a target .
Darpa anticipates that 3 - D surveillance would boost field of vision and depth of vision " by over 100X " compared to existing systems .
That 's a big step up from the best drone surveillance in use right now .
According to Darpa , current spy-cam systems with 3 - D capabilities are big and unwieldy , and can only handle a small surveillance zone without user input .
The new 3 - D models , by comparison , should rapidly identify targets that are as tough to spot as " a needle moving along the surface of a haystack . "
Plus , they 'd solve one of the biggest complaints about Predator video feeds :
Depth perception is often lost in grainy footage , and the view is so narrow that it 's been likened to " looking through a soda straw . "
This new project holds the possibility of changing that .
Next step is doing something about the motion sickness that goes along with swooping in the air .
The military 's already working on other out - there video systems , like Gorgon Stare : a sensor that can film an area two - and - a - half miles around from 12 different angles .
But even the most impressive UAV sensors still operate with camera lenses , whereas the 3 - D systems would n't : Darpa anticipates the use of advances in focal - plane arrays , laser technology and image processing algorithms .
Exactly how they want the 3 - D systems to work is still under wraps : part of the solicitation remains classified .
Of course , going 3 - D is n't without its challenges .
Much like the downsides of new 3 - D television sets , the surveillance would require a specific degree of dim lighting to get optimal footage .
Three - dimensional TVs are also being derided for causing eyestrain and headaches , but Darpa 's current solicitation seems more concerned with out - of - this - world surveillance than troops ' ocular health .
If Darpa 's really interested in following Hollywood trends , they might want to take note of the progress among Australian researchers .
Last month , an Aussie company debuted a hovering drone that was right out of Avatar , and the federal government just handed out $ 1.01 million for the development of a 3 - D surveillance system that 's being compared to " a game of Doom . "

Linda Harvey is the founder of Mission : America , an organization “ whose objective is to equip Christians with current , accurate information about cultural issues such as feminism , homosexuality , education and New Age influences . ”
And when someone like her says she ’s spreading “ current , accurate information , ” that ’s just code for “ I ’m going to tell you lies and say it ’s in the name of Jesus so you wo n’t call me out on it . ”
She ’s like an Ohio version of Laurie Higgins .
Harvey has a list of The Top 10 Ways to Make Kids Truly Safe in 2010 .
This ought to be good …
2 . Get all pro-homosexual and pro-promiscuity programs , literature , teachers , and counselors out of every school now .
Remove “ gay ” clubs , Planned Parenthood at health fairs , and GLSEN - PFLAG - SIECUS activists .
Cease all condom demonstrations , abortion referrals , on - site birth control dispensing , sexual orientation affirmation , and messing with children ’s hearts , minds and bodies .
Demand that schools uphold the traditional value of heterosexual identities , teach abstinence - until - marriage , and celebrate male / female gender differences .
1 . Allow — no , welcome — Christianity back into the American public square … in schools , in community groups , in city council meetings , in the Senate , on city streets , in the courthouse square , in the media , in college lectures .
Laugh at the ACLU .
Elect judges who agree .
Do n’t elect presidents who think we are no longer a Christian nation .
This goes way beyond anti-gay religious beliefs .
Harvey wants any teacher who believes in equal rights for gay people fired .
Remove “ gay ” clubs ?
What does that mean ( with the quotation marks ) ?
Get rid of the Drama Club ?
Presumably , she means groups like the Gay - Straight Alliance … how dare students voluntarily support other students regardless of sexual orientation !
They should be killing them like the Bible says .
And I think she wants to remove the birth control vending machine from our schools (?!? )…
# 1 is just a bad idea and no Christian should be supporting it , either .
It ’s the type of idea that only comes from people who have no regard for the rights of other people and minds small enough to think they know what ’s best for every other human being on the planet .
Separation of church and state is as good for Christians as it is for the rest of us .
The rest of her list is just a collection of GOP talking points and anti-Islamic sentiment .
You know what I ’d like to see in 2010 ?
I want to see Christians openly , vocally , and frequently going after people like Harvey who bastardize their faith .
Do it in church , do it on your blogs , talk about it with your family .
Do n’t just sit back and let your friends , family , and congregations get swayed by these ideas .

Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
The steeple clock at Port - au - Prince 's St. Pierre Catholic Church is stopped at 4:53 , the hour at which a devastating earthquake struck Haiti nearly one week ago .
The church gates were closed Sunday .
The doors shuttered .
But it seems Tuesday 's quake has only strengthened the religious fervor many Haitians carry in their souls .
" A lot of people who never prayed or believed -- now they believe , " said Cristina Bailey , a 24 - year - old clerk .
In parks and backyards , anywhere a group gathers , the prayers of the Haitians can be heard .
Last week , the call - and - response chanting and clapping that accompany those prayers pierced the darkness of night and the pre-dawn hours -- sometimes as early as 4 a .m .
The singing and praying was particularly intense in Champs de Mars plaza , where hundreds of people have taken refuge .
But the scene was repeated throughout the city , with preachers on megaphones exhorting the faithful , who responded with lyrics like " O Lord , keep me close to you " and " Forgive me , Jesus . "
Many preachers are telling followers not to lose faith , that God remains with them regardless of what 's happened .
Most Haitians do n't feel abandoned , Bailey said .
" People do n't blame Jesus for all these things , " she said .
" They have faith .
They believe that Jesus saved them and are thankful for that . "
Are you in Haiti and safe ?

Perhaps few personified that deep belief better than 11 - year - old Anaika Saint Louis , who was pulled from the rubble Thursday night and later died .
Her leg had been crushed , and doctors thought they might have to amputate her feet .
She said she did n't care .
" Thank you , God , because he saved my life , " she said .
" If I lose my feet , I always had my life . "
She was rescued too late .
She died .
Jean Mackenle Verpre also suffered a crushing leg injury and was freed after 48 hours underground .
Asked what kept him going , he answered without hesitation :
He believes in Jesus Christ and put his life in God 's hands .
Colonized by France , Haiti is a strongly Catholic country .
Christian motifs are everywhere in Port - au - Prince .
Many vehicles bear signs like the one painted on the windshield of a truck on Rue Delmar : " Merci Jesus , " it said .
A woman passing by on Avenue Christophe chanted softly : " Accept Jesus . "
" In Haiti , you have Protestants and Catholics , and you have your percentage of each , " said J.B. Diederich , a native - born Haitian who now lives in Miami , Florida , but returned to the Caribbean for several days after the earthquake .
" But everybody is 100 percent voodoo . "
Voodoo is widely acknowledged but practiced only behind closed doors , with practitioners often placing candles and icons on the floor of a home and dancing to music and drums .
Followers believe the world is under the power of loas -- spirits and deities who act as intermediaries between humans and God .
In voodoo , disasters like Tuesday 's quake are not the result of natural forces , but displeasure by a loa .

" It 's in every apartment .
The voodoo is our culture , " 25 - year - old Alex Gassan said .
" It 's like the folklore . "
Gassan proudly calls himself a Catholic , pulling out a crucifix necklace from under his shirt to show a reporter .
Many observers have a simple explanation for what makes Haitians so devout .
" Because in all poor countries , you have to believe in something , " said Agnes Pierre - Louis , the Haitian - born manager of her family - owned hotel .
" If they do n't have that , they do n't have anything . "
Added Diederich : " They leave everything in the hands of God .
When you have so little , what else can you turn to ? "
Others say a special relationship between Haitian independence leaders and the devil are to blame for the nation 's extreme poverty and many problems .
According to some fundamentalist Christians , including Pat Roberston , revolt leaders made a pact with Satan in 1791 to gain independence from France .
Haiti won its freedom in 1804 .
Robertson said last week that deal brought on the quake .
" You know , the Haitians revolted and got themselves free , " Robertson was quoted as saying .
" But ever since , they have been cursed by one thing after the other . "
Robertson previously linked natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and terrorist attacks to legalized abortion in the United States .
Mainstream Christians want no part of that explanation .
" Why do we always have to go here ? " said David Burns , pastor at Trinity Presbyterian Church in Atlanta .
" Ca n't there be another explanation rather than , ' God did this ? '
Why not , ' God does not micromanage the world .
God 's heart breaks with us and instantaneously moves to comfort , catalyze imagination and compassion , and instill hope . ' "
Scientists from The Scripps Research Institute have determined for the first time that prions , bits of infectious protein devoid of DNA or RNA that can cause fatal neurodegenerative disease , are capable of Darwinian evolution .
The study from Scripps Florida in Jupiter shows that prions can develop large numbers of mutations at the protein level and , through natural selection , these mutations can eventually bring about such evolutionary adaptations as drug resistance , a phenomenon previously known to occur only in bacteria and viruses .
These breakthrough findings also suggest that the normal prion protein -- which occurs naturally in human cells -- may prove to be a more effective therapeutic target than its abnormal toxic relation .
The study was published in the December 31 , 2009 issue of the journal Science Express , an advance , online edition of the journal Science .
" On the face of it , you have exactly the same process of mutation and adaptive change in prions as you see in viruses , " said Charles Weissmann , M.D. , Ph.D. , the head of Scripps Florida 's Department of Infectology , who led the study .
" This means that this pattern of Darwinian evolution appears to be universally active .
In viruses , mutation is linked to changes in nucleic acid sequence that leads to resistance .
Now , this adaptability has moved one level down -- to prions and protein folding -- and it's clear that you do not need nucleic acid for the process of evolution . "
Infectious prions ( short for proteinaceous infectious particles ) are associated with some 20 different diseases in humans and animals , including mad cow disease and a rare human form , Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease .
All these diseases are untreatable and eventually fatal .
Prions , which are composed solely of protein , are classified by distinct strains , originally characterized by their incubation time and the disease they cause .
Prions have the ability to reproduce , despite the fact that they contain no nucleic acid genome .
Mammalian cells normally produce cellular prion protein or PrPC .
During infection , abnormal or misfolded protein -- known as PrPSc -- converts the normal host prion protein into its toxic form by changing its conformation or shape .
The end - stage consists of large assemblies ( polymers ) of these misfolded proteins , which cause massive tissue and cell damage .

" It was generally thought that once cellular prion protein was converted into the abnormal form , there was no further change , " Weissmann said .
" But there have been hints that something was happening .
When you transmit prions from sheep to mice , they become more virulent over time .
Now we know that the abnormal prions replicate , and create variants , perhaps at a low level initially .
But once they are transferred to a new host , natural selection will eventually choose the more virulent and aggressive variants . "
Drug Resistance
In the first part of the study , Weissmann and his colleagues transferred prion populations from infected brain cells to culture cells .
When transplanted , cell - adapted prions developed and out - competed their brain - adapted counterparts , confirming prions ' ability to adapt to new surroundings , a hallmark of Darwinian evolution .
When returned to brain , brain - adapted prions again took over the population .
To confirm the findings and to explore the issue of evolution of drug resistance , Weissmann and his colleagues used the drug swainsonine or swa , which is found in plants and fungi , and has been shown to inhibit certain prion strains .
In cultures where the drug was present , the team found that a drug - resistant sub -strain of prion evolved to become predominant .
When the drug was withdrawn , the sub - strain that was susceptible to swainsonine again grew to become the major component of the population .
Weissmann notes that the findings have implications for the development of therapeutic targets for prion disease .
Instead of developing drugs to target abnormal proteins , it could be more efficient to try to limit the supply of normally produced prions -- in essence , reducing the amount of fuel being fed into the fire .
Weissmann and his colleagues have shown some 15 years ago that genetically engineered mice devoid of the normal prion protein develop and function quite normally ( and are resistant to prion disease ! ) .

" It will likely be very difficult to inhibit the production of a specific natural protein pharmacologically , " Weissmann said , " You may end up interfering with some other critical physiological process , but nonetheless , finding a way to inhibit the production of normal prion protein is a project currently being pursued in collaboration with Scripps Florida Professor Corinne Lasmezas in our department . "
Quasi-Species
Another implication of the findings , according to the study , is that drug - resistant variants either exist in the prion population at a low level prior to exposure or are generated during exposure to the drug .
Indeed , the researchers found some prions secreted by infected cells were resistant to the drug before exposure , but only at levels less than one percent .
The scientists show that prion variants constantly arise in a particular population .
These variants , or " mutants , " are believed to differ in the way the prion protein is folded .
As a consequence , prion populations are , in fact , comprised of multiple sub-strains .
This , Weissmann noted , is reminiscent of something he helped define some 30 years ago -- the evolutionary concept of quasi-species .
The idea was first conceived by Manfred Eigen , a German biophysicist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 .
Basically stated , a quasi - species is a complex , self - perpetuating population of diverse and related entities that act as a whole .
It was Weissmann , however , who provided the first confirmation of the theory through the study of a particular bacteriophage -- a virus that infects bacteria -- while he was director of the Institut für Molekularbiologie in Zürich , Switzerland .
" The proof of the quasi - species concept is a discovery we made over 30 years ago , " he said .
" We found that an RNA virus population , which was thought to have only one sequence , was constantly creating mutations and eliminating the unfavorable ones .
In these quasi-populations , much like we have now found in prions , you begin with a single particle , but it becomes very heterogeneous as it grows into a larger population . "
There are some unknown dynamics at work in the prion population that leads to this increased heterogeneity , Weissmann added , that still need to be explored .
" It 's amusing that something we did 30 years has come back to us , " he said .
" But we know that mutation and natural selection occur in living organisms and now we know that they also occur in a non-living organism .
I suppose anything that can't do that would n't stand much of a chance of survival . "
The joint first authors of the Science study are Jiali Li and Shawn Browning of The Scripps Research Institute .
Other authors include Sukhvir P. Mahal and Anja M. Oelschlegel also of The Scripps Research Institute .
Weissmann notes that after the manuscript was accepted by Science , an article by Ghaemmanghami et al. appeared in PLoS Pathogens that described emergence of prions resistant to a completely different drug , quinacrine , providing additional support to the Scripps Research team 's conclusions .
The Scripps Research study was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health and by a generous donation to the Weissmann laboratory from the Alafi Family Foundation .
A certain constituency is determined to prevent President Obama from delivering his State of the Union on Feb . 2 .
Fans of the television show Lost .
The serial drama about a group of plane crash survivors trapped on a very mysterious island has its sixth and final season premiere that same night , Feb . 2 .
UPDATE : White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said today that Lost friends can relax because he does n't envision a scenario in which there would be a Feb.
2 State of the Union .
Some members of this near - cultish group of fans have sent up new Facebook pages , including one called " Lost is more important than the State of the Union ! ! ! "
Another is addressed to " ABC : Show " Lost " instead of the State of the Union . "
Lost souls have also taken to Twitter .
One missive to Obama ; " Leave my LOST alone , Skippy ! "
Just to be clear : The White House has yet to settle on a date for the State of the Union speech .
It could just as easily be Jan. 26 .

The requirements for our echo program is pretty simple .
Take any number of command line arguments .
Print each argument on separate lines .
Return the number of command line arguments .
In this lesson you will learn how to define parameters , work with arrays , work with loops , and return values from functions .
This lesson assumes that you already understand the hello world code .
Version 1
Version 1 will deal with requirements 1 and 3 .
This will be enough to prove that the command line parameters are actually making it all the way to the program and the return value is making it back to the shell .
In Windows you can use the command “ ECHO %ERRORLEVEL % ” immediately after running the program to see the return value .
For this to work you need to run the program itself from the command line as well .
.assembly extern mscorlib {} .assembly EchoProg {} . method static int32 Main( string [ ] args ) { . entrypoint ldarg.0 ldlen ret }
Line 1 is the core assembly reference .
Again , I ’m not asking for a specific version .
Line 2 is our program ’s name .
I ’m calling it “ EchoProg ” because “ echo ” is reserved by the Windows command shell .
Line 3 is our entry point .
Lets compare is to the hello world version .
. method static void Main ( )
As you can see void has been replaced by the return type .
In addition , we now have one argument in a C# - like style with the type preceding the argument name .
Note that we do n’t actually use the argument name anywhere , it is just their for reference .
Line 6 is the “ load argument N onto the stack ” command .
In this case we are loading the “ args ” parameter , which is a pointer to an array of string .
Line 7 is the “ replace the array on the stack with it ’s length ” command , also known as load length .
As I mentioned last time , the return command in line 8 takes the last value on the stack and places it on the calling stack , then exits the current function .
To make experimenting with this code a little easier , I wrote this little batch file .
If you run it using version 1 , you should get the number 4 .
ilasm EchoProg.il PEVerify EchoProg.exe EchoProg.exe " la la la " dee di doh ECHO %ERRORLEVEL %
Version 2
Before we jump into loops , lets just try printing the first command line argument .
The code for this is pretty straight forward .
.assembly extern mscorlib {} .assembly EchoProg {} . method static int32 Main( string [ ] args ) { .entrypoint // printline code ldarg.0 ldc.i4 0 ldelem.ref call void [ mscorlib ] System.Console :: WriteLine ( string ) // return code ldarg.0 ldlen ret }
Line 7 is a comment .
I believe you can use // at the end of any line , as I often see it in compiler - generated IL .
In line 8 we are loading the array onto the stack just as before .
In line 9 we see the “ load a constant ” command .
The “ .i4 ” suffix means that the constant is a 4 - byte integer , a .k.a. a System .
Int32 .
This is followed by the number 0 , which we want .
This gives us the following stack :
0 pointer to args [ not yours ]
Line 10 starts with the “ load element from array ” command .
It appears that the “ .ref ” suffix is used to indicate the array contains a non-numeric type .
After this command is executed both the array and the constant will be removed from the stack and a pointer to the first string will be in its place .
This is shown in the spec under the “ stack transition ” heading .
Version 3
Ok , now things get tricky .
We are going to have to start keeping track of an array index .
And since there are no loops in CIL , you have to fake it using if statements and gotos .
Before we run off and start coding , lets write some pseudo code showing what we are trying to accomplish .
Variables : index , arrayLength arrayLength = args .
Length index = 0 If index = arrayLength
Then goto done Print args [ index ] index = index+1 goto if done
Reminds me of BASICA back from the days of DOS , except you get labels instead of line numbers .
Anyways , on to the code .
.assembly extern mscorlib {} .assembly EchoProg {} . method static int32 Main( string [ ] args ) { .entrypoint // Variables : index , arrayLength .locals init ( [ 0 ] int32 index , [ 1 ] int32 arrayLength ) // arrayLength = args .
Length ldarg.0 ldlen stloc 1 //index = 0 ldc.i4 0 stloc 0 // If index = arrayLength
Then goto done if : ldloc 0 ldloc 1 beq done // Print args [ index ] ldarg.0 ldloc 0 ldelem.ref call void [ mscorlib ]
System.Console :: WriteLine ( string ) // index = index+1 ldloc 0 ldc.i4 1 add.ovf stloc 0 br if done : //return code ldarg.0 ldlen ret }
On line 6 thru 9 we see our variables being defined .
It starts with the “ .locals ” directive .
This is followed by “ init ” , which sets all the local variables to 0 /null .
According to the spec , all verifiable code must use the init keyword .
Each well formed local variable consists of three values .
First is the slot index , next is the variable type , and finally there is the variable name .
Of these only the type is actually required .
You could write , “ .locals init ( int32 , int32 ) ” , but that is going to be a royal pain to understand later on .
Lines 11 thru 14 load the array length into a local variable .
The only thing new here is the “ store local ” command , which takes a slot number as a parameter .
Lines 16 thru 18 load the value 0 into the index variable .
Strictly speaking this is n’t necessary because we are using init , but I ’ll leave it here for reference .
Lines 20 to 23 represent our if statement .
It starts with the label “ if : ” so we can jump to it later .
We could have used just about anything for our label , it does n’t really matter once the code is assembled .
Then we use the “ load local ” command twice , once for each variable .
Finally we use the “ branch if equal ” command on line 23 .
If the top - two items on the stack are equal , we go to line labeled “ done ” .
Lines 25 thru 29 is our code to actually print the parameter .
The only difference between this and the one in version 2 is that we are loading the index using ldloc instead of a constant value .
Lines 31 to 35 will increment our index variable .
It does this by loading both the index and the constant 1 onto the stack .
Then it calls the “ add with overflow check ” command .
Finally it stores the result value back into the index variable .
Line 37 takes us back to the top of the loop using the “ branch ” command .
It is important that this line is skipped if our if statement back on line 20 is true .
Conclusions
I was surprised how much code it took to write this .
Sure I knew I would have to write my own loops , but even basic stuff like incrementing local variables took much harder than I expected .
I was expecting to find a “ increment local ” command , but it looks like we ca n’t do anything with values until they are on the stack .
In the days following Casey Johnson ’s death last Sunday there ’s been a lot of talk about what in the heiress ’s life and relationship was “ real ” and what was n’t .
The ring , ex-girlfriend Courtenay Semel told the press , was not real , nor was it really 17 karats .
Casey ’s much - touted heiress fortune was also not real — multiple sources confirm that Casey ’s family had cut her off .
Tila ’s pregnancy was n’t real either , in the strictest ( only ) definition of “ pregnancy ” — due to Tila ’s apparent struggles conjugating verbs , she announced , “ I ’m pregnant ! ” when she really meant , “ I ’m going to be a surrogate parent for my brother ! ”
Some of their body parts , including Tila ’s breasts and Casey ’s lips , are n’t technically real , either .
But what about that other thing that is n’t real ?
That thing us gays do n’t really wanna bring up , lest we involve such a controversial and unstable figure in our very serious , very real , fight for marriage equality ?
What about the engagement , y’all ?
What about the potential of an actual marriage for Tila Nguyen and Casey Johnson ?
‘ Cause that engagement was n’t , after all , real , because Tila and Casey cannot legally marry .
I mean we all admit that , right ?
We do n’t like to discuss this vague conceptual notion of lawless “ marriage , ” or even acknowledge publicly that our engagements are n’t as “ real ” / significant as straight couple ’s engagements .
As Julie Goldman so deftly targets in her Commitment Ceremony video , when we use the same language for our ceremonies that heteros do , we ’re only playing along .
It ’s important for our movement that we play along .
We do n’t like to talk about the “ fiancée ” in quotation marks because it ’s offensive and disrespectful to include quotation marks , as it implies illegitimacy .
The press must exclude quotation marks because that ’s the politically correct thing to do and we get pissed every time we see “ marry ” in a headline .
But let ’s “ get real ” here : gay marriage is not the same thing as straight marriage right now .
It is , in practice , really only gay “ marriage . ”
Gay relationships in America exist in a sort of Lawless Netherworld : couples exist free of paper trails , free of proof and , unless they ’ve been together forevs , free of pressure to take complicated property and offspring - securing measures .
There is nothing in charge of our hearts besides the bodies that hold them in .
Well — we have rights , sometimes , like if something complicated like a custody agreement goes to court ; we ’re SOMETIMES protected by gender - free laws that govern all citizens , but besides that , we ’re left to navigate & delegate our relationships on our own .
Oddly , this lack of legality is rarely discussed in emotional terms .
We often speak of what marriage could offer dedicated , long - term couples ; but rarely do we discuss how the impossibility of marriage has shaped how ALL gay relationships evolve here in The Lawless Netherworld ; and subsequently how these relationships are considered or ignored by the rest of this country ’s citizens .
++
I ’m not here to defend Tila Tequila , or to defend her enemies or to subjectively judge anyone .
We do n’t know Tila , Casey , or any of Tila ’s friends or family members .
I ’m not defending Tila ’s actions or condoning her relationship or the legitimacy of her behavior , nor am I arguing that anyone on Casey ’s side is acting on anti-gay prejudice — in fact , quite the opposite .
I ’m arguing that we all make concessions for a gay - marriage - free universe ; and these actions are n’t driven by intolerance or hate .
That ’s precisely the problem .
See ; the fact is , Tila Tequila is alone in the Lawless Netherworld of Homosexual Relationships , and all she ’s got left are her feelings .
The fact is that Tila Tequila and Casey Johnson were engaged , and the world could n’t care less .
Had Tila been a male celebrity trainwreck rather than a female one — mentally ill or on drugs ( as alleged ) etc. — well , that would ’ve been a very different story because of the potential legality at stake .
They would ’ve been required to pay attention to her controversial methods of grieving , basically , and they all might know a little more about what went down .
So now Tila ’s sad and alone and aggressively loathed by the public .
She ’s also legally excluded from any formal support .
Tila ’s not well .
She ’s screaming with manic intensity into cyberspace about her feelings and her memories of Casey ’s feelings .
Tila ’s visibly aching to prove , SOMEHOW , that she mattered to this woman who died , and that this woman mattered to her :
So stop blaming me for her death , i was the ONLY one there for her .
Casey loved me & that is why she chose ME to be her fiance !
So enough with blaming me 4 her death !
I miss her so fucking much I ca n’t take it anymore !
I do n’t know what to do ….
I ’ve never lost a fiancee before … I miss her so muchh
click on the video link below to see PROOF of how EXTREMELY CASEY WAS AND IN LOVE SHE WAS AND HOW READY SHE WAS TO START A NEW LIFE WITH ME !
Well I Ca n’t Bring Her Back Now But At Least I know the Love Between us WAS REAL & They CAN NEVER TAKE THAT AWAY !
Casey was happiest when she was w/me .
She LOVED living alone with me at my house and our 3 dogs .
She told me she wished they would let us B !
These words and videos are all she has , and it ’s all any gay relationship has in Tila ’s home state of California : at our best of times , and in our worst of times .

If Lola had n’t interviewed Tila for AS in December ( a tough piece to put together ’ cause of conflicting feelings about Tila ’s body of work ) , I doubt I ’d be talking abut this .
But all of us here at Autoatraddle are kind of fascinated by our own fascination .
It ’s SO WEIRD because it ’s SO UNLIKE US that we bizarrely ended up being one of a handful of non-paparazzi sources who directly chatted with the couple in their home during their relationship .
Lola remembers : “ for what it ’s worth , [ Casey ] said hi to me on the phone and made Tila laugh and they sounded genuinely adorable & couple -y .
It was for real cute , and I truly wished the best for them — albeit against all odds .
This seriously bums me out , no matter what ugly truths may lay beneath the surface . ”
So that ’s what we know from the only reliable source Autostraddle has .
Despite this fascination , however , before I go on I want to admit there ’s only so much of the Tila - Casey story I can take before risking brain death .
So apologies ahead of time if I ’m missing some important fight / event ; but it actually does n’t matter as I ’m trying to look at broader issues here .
Like this issue : Everyone in Casey ’s life is legally entitled to ignore Tila .
+
Considering the intensity , insanity and / or ( allegedly ) drug - fueled energy lacing the Johnson - Nguyen union , it ’s not far - fetched to imagine that the two would ’ve wed before Casey ’s death had such a thing been legal — a là Pamela Anderson , Britney Spears , Dennis Rodman , Nicholas Cage et al .
That would ’ve required a pre-nup ( or not ) which ( either way ) would ’ve probs inspired a Serious Johnson Family Intervention .
If Tila was a man , the alleged drug use or potential mental illness would n’t prevent the two from marrying , but it would pose a very real threat to Casey — and vice versa ( though it seems no - one is exactly looking out for Tila anymore ) .
Marriage or engagement would ’ve enabled Tila to make medical decisions for Casey and also held her accountable for endangering her if that was the case .
There ’d have been lawyers , financial disclosures and well , Tila would ’ve kept the dogs Casey ’s friends retrieved earlier this week .
All the “ alleged ” things thrown around this week would have proof or not ; we ’d know for sure if Tila was supporting Casey financially ( we suspect so ) .
But not since Anna Nicole Smith has a widow been so swiftly discredited .
( Furthermore … unfortunately for Tila , she ’s a skilled gunman — not with that gun she posted on Twitpic , but at shooting herself in the foot .
Which does n’t help . )
I think legality would ’ve settled a lot of things and improved the situation for everyone involved here on both sides .
In the paparazzi video of Nicky and Bijou taking said dogs from Tila ’s home , one of the “ paps ” badgers Tila , clearly hoping for the censor - free TMI they always got out of her : “ If she ’s your fiancée or wife , why are they taking all of it ? ” I know what that made me think , but Tila , bless her tiny brain , just shrugged , and cried .
But the law is the law .
If Casey did have family money , her parents would n’t need to get alarmed about this bad relationship ’ cause Prop 8 protects Tila from automatically obtaining any .
If friends felt the relationship was toxic , a pending wedding would ’ve prompted a more urgent , forcible intervention ’ cause laws are serious like that and if the relationship was a good one , then Tila would currently have protections she deserves .
The fact that a wedding had n’t been planned makes sense for a gay couple , as the ceremony is n’t “ real ” anyhow ; but that detail would ’ve been an important piece of information when assessing the seriousness of a straight relationship .
Using their legal right to ignore Tila ’s stake does n’t make the Johnsons or Casey ’s friends homophobic at all .
( Although Casey ’s parents were one of George W. ’s top campaign contributors , sidenote . )
We ’re all complicit if accused of treating gay relationships differently because marriage is n’t a real possibility .
For example : we ’re sometimes relieved to never fear that a long - term girlfriend will one day demand having that conversation about putting a ring on it .
Closeted celebs are protected by a paper trail - free string of secrets .
A lesbian wo n’t log on to Facebook and see their ex-girlfriend married and if she does , she may guiltily remind herself that it ’s not “ real ” and therefore could be quickly broken up should she return to your loving arms again .
Come on , you know you ’ve done that !
I ’m not arguing that monogamy or legal marriage is an inherently “ better ” form of human union ; however , because our culture was built around it ( gender roles , etc ) , it is very different and esteemed here .
Marriage applies solid , technical structures to an emotionally - driven partnership .
For all the benefits legality provides for successful marriages , it also has benefits for unsuccessful ones –in emotional times , a legal framework can protect the emotional investment .
Marriage certificates , despite how freely straight people often obtain them ( Britney Spears ! ) , mean something .
Courtenay and Tila could settle the soulmate squabble with a piece of paper — that ’s the proof .
As the public , we do n’t need the proof ’ cause it ’s not our business .
But these papers and these laws are things you wish you had sometimes because only having feelings is fucking SCARY when you ’re in a crazypants relationship !
Maybe straight people do n’t deserve this legal protection either and we should all just grow up , but well they DO have it , and so we want it too .
Because who among us has n’t had or known of a crazy girlfriend who got away with shit a crazy husband never could : adultery , abuse , stalking , stealing , abandonment ?
We do n’t like to talk about that side of it because that ’s where straight people mess marriage up , and we focus on what looks good for our movement : loving dedicated couples who are denied hospital visits , child custody , or the pension of their deceased partners .
We do n’t look at those crazy - ass toxic relationships that were so intense they carved a hole in your heart and you knew , no matter how deep the emotional connection , that at any minute your loved one could get up , walk out the door , and never speak to you again , and that it would n’t matter if you ’d paid their bills or built a life around their demands .
There is nothing tying you together besides your feelings .
And that ’s really frightening .
+
Because we have no legality , no protection , and no papers ; instead in the case of Tila Tequila and Casey Johnson we now have one of the messiest almost - widows of all time .
“ Dyke Drama ” is partially a result of this terrifying lawlessness .
We have a lonely , possibly mentally ill tweetaholic who is loathed by the people who peddle her story .
This woman is presently claiming her ‘ wifey ’s ’ dying wish is for her to smear the reputation of an old friend via large unflattering photographs .
And her relationship , according to the majority of her state ’s residents , is also not worthy of respect .
This is A HOT MESS .
When celebs like Charlize Theron and Angelina Jolie refuse to marry til the gays can ; we often wonder , “ Well what good does that do ? ”
Well , I get it now .
We ’ve forgotten about the flipside : it ’s not about the kind of relationship they ’re not going to have , it ’s about the Lawless Netherworld relationship style they ’re consenting to have instead — the kind of relationship we have as our only choice .
It is , in fact , fairly impressive solidarity .
And regardless of who is right , wrong , good , or bad , I ’d like to suggest that this situation might mean more to the GLBT community than tawdry celebrity gossip and that maybe , just maybe , it presents us with the opportunity to advocate not only for the functional , smiling gay families on pro-equality ads , but also our human dysfunction — in all its raw and ugly shamelessness — for better and most certainly for worse .
OPINION : What will the decade ahead hold for the environment ?
Mankind has yet to meet the stark challenges posed by global warming , which will not go away
THIS IS not how it was supposed to end .
Internationally , this decade was supposed to give us a comprehensive global treaty to contain climate change .
In Ireland , some of us allowed ourselves hope that a soft - landing for the Celtic Tiger would herald a “ post - materialist ” era where environmental and social considerations were given as much weight as economic ones in policymaking .
Instead , the Copenhagen climate talks ended in confusion and recrimination and in Ireland the economic crash has driven us back to very understandable materialist concerns about budget cuts and job losses .
The coming decade will see whether humanity is capable of overcoming a complex web of environmental problems that pose an existential threat to civilisation .
Climate , the most urgent and most mainstream of these problems , epitomises the challenges .
Politicians and scientists agree we must limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius to prevent runaway climate change .
Current pollution trends put us on a path to six degrees of warming this century , when four degrees or more would trigger the breakdown of civilisation as we know it .
To be closer to two degrees than four we need to make global emissions start to decline before 2020 .
That is the challenge of the decade .
When we are writing our reviews of the 2010s there will be no more telling benchmark of human progress .
Are global greenhouse gas emissions lower in 2019 than they are now ?
Put another way , will we choose survival ?
To answer this most basic question successfully humankind will have to answer two subsidiary questions , one evolutionary , one political .
As a species are we evolved to tackle a threat like climate change ?
It does n’t seem to trigger our fight - or - flight reflex in a meaningful way .
For most of us it seems remote and abstract .
The gases that cause it are invisible .
And the ultimate source of the threat is not external – it is us , our current lifestyles , our historical choices and our future aspirations .
However unwittingly , we are the root of the problem , and therefore the solution .
If an army were massing on our borders , if an asteroid were hurtling towards Earth , no one would question the need to act .
But as we set fire to the only home humanity has ever known , we struggle to perceive the threat and have so far failed to act decisively .
The second question is a practical , political one .
Can an international system of 192 nation states solve a global problem ?
The lesson of Copenhagen is no , at least not if we cling to our traditional approach to interstate negotiating , where short - term national advantage trumps long - term public interest .
It is the tragedy of the commons writ large .
For the vested interests in each state it makes sense for their country to keep polluting as much as possible and national negotiators act on that basis .
Given the limited capacity of our common atmosphere to absorb that pollution , however , this approach will prove disastrous for humanity as a whole .
As the decade progresses there are three signs that would indicate we are moving beyond this “ mutual assured destruction ” approach to climate change .
We need to see all three .
First , are any of the players acting unilaterally to cut their emissions , against their perceived short - term interests ?
The obvious candidate is the European Union , itself a unique political formation where national sovereignty is pooled and co-operation has replaced competition in crucial areas .
The EU has made a unilateral commitment to action on climate change , but it is a weak one .
When you account for the caveats and the loopholes it adds up to less than half our fair share .
So , will we see EU climate policy start to reflect the union ’s pioneering nature ?
Will the EU move to cut its emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 , in line with the science ?
The union could act on the courage of its convictions .
Those advocating the abolition of slavery did not say they would only free half their slaves until their competitors freed theirs .
The EU could also act based on its long - term economic interest .
A low - carbon economy will build energy security , resilience and sustainable jobs for the rest of the century .
China is acting to limit its future emissions , despite its determination not to be legally bound to do so .
And the US is moving too , faster at state and company level than federal level .
If the early years of this decade see these players significantly limit their emissions it will be both a sign of hope and an international confidence - building measure .
Second , will the emerging transnational forces gain the strength and focus to push nation states towards a global deal ?
The run-in to Copenhagen saw supranational civil society coalition - building reach new heights , with the likes of 350.org , Avaaz and the tcktcktck campaign mobilising hundreds of thousands of people across the world .
Friends of the Earth alone had 500 activists in Copenhagen , representing our two million supporters across 77 countries .
On the business side , lobbyists for polluting interests still hold the upper hand – but this time more than 500 transnational corporations signed a Copenhagen communique most of which could just as easily have been written by non-governmental organisation campaigners .
Third , will our governments manage to agree a new treaty that provides a global framework for action and “ mutual assured survival ” rather than destruction ?
This is the key test .
Can we lift our eyes to the horizon long enough to put aside short - term national advantage ?
This past decade there has been much talk of the G8 , the G20 and now the G2 , China and the US .
But the new treaty must institutionalise the G1 : humanity , and our common cause to protect the only ecosystem that supports our existence .
The coming decade will require you to decide where you stand , and soon .

LIFE Magazine issued a wake - up call of sorts to its readership in their 2 March 1942 issue .
I say “ of sorts ” because even though this hard article ( entitled “ Now the U.S. Must Fight for Its Life ” ) must have sorely sobered some of its readers , it started on page 15 , following big ads for Listerine , Matrix ( women ’s shoes , Bell Telephone , Modess , Clapp ’s Baby Food , Dot Snap Fasteners , Goodrich Tires , White Horse Scotch , Pompeian Massage ( for shaving ) , Jack Benny / Carole Lombard ’s “ To Be or Not To Be ” , Colgate , Yardley powder and Mimeograph , and a few interspersed puff pieces — and a Ginger Rogers cover photo .
But once LIFE paid its bills1 , the article got right to business , responding to a February article by sci-fi / novelist Philip Wylie2 on the possibilities of the U.S. losing the war .
Losing looked like something that could actually happen in pre- war - ready America3 .
The war in Europe had been on in earnest since the very end of 1939 ( since 1933 in Asia ) , and the Axis had reached just about the fullest extent of their victories ( though there would be more gains in the Pacific to come ) .
By March of ‘ 42 , we had Bataan , MacArthur leaving the Philippines and the fall of rape of Manila , the siege of Leningrad , Corregidor , Java Sea , the Brits leaving Singapore , Malaya , and so much more .
The Axis powers in Europe were now in control of Austria , Czechoslovakia .
Poland , Denmark , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , France , Norway , Yugoslavia , Finland , Greece , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia , and parts of the Soviet Union ( Ukraine , Bylorussia , Crimea ) , and parts of North Africa ; plus the allies of Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria , and Slovakia .
There was also Italy , of course , controlling Sicily , Ethiopia and Libya . , and of course the Japanese controlled large swaths of China , South East Asia , Indonesia and points in - between .
The overall situation did not look very good .
The following maps appeared in a two - page spread , detailing ways in which the Axis powers could combine their efforts , focus on America , and take over the country .
Maps such as these with arrows being drawn towards America were absolutely uncommon during this time .
Notes
1. This is almost universal SOP for war reporting for almost all media , and which continues today .
The Illustrated London News delivered reports of success and disaster sandwiched between ads for socks and trifles , as did the Illustriete Zeitung ( Leipzig and Berlin ) , the New York Times , and so on .
I remember very clearly as a kid hearing the reading of the daily list of American soldiers killed in Vietnam on one of the Big - Three networks , somber and intoned , followed instantly by a ad for Coke or Mister Kleen .
2 Wylie ( 1902 - 1971 ) was an interesting guy with a wide reach .
In addition to Hollywood - feeding work , interesting fiction , insightful scifi and social commentary , Wylie also provided the inspiration for the creation of Superman ( “ The Gladiator ” , 1930 ) and Flash Gordon ( When Worlds Collide , 1933 ) .
3 . Once the war machine in the U.S. got into hyper drive I think that it was impossible for this country to be defeated given its population , workforce , industrial capacity , raw materials , and of course scientific superstrucutre .
Also there was also no other country in the world with the necessary ( and enormous ) components needed to construct an atomic bomb .
This is a simplified statement that seems pretty homespuna dn jingoistic , but the fact of the matter is that the U.S. was the seat of overwhelming possibilities and capacities .
And yes the Nazis had been slowed down mightily with the expense of dozens of millions of Russian lives and the entire British war machine and on and on — I ’m just saying that in the end , the U.S. could not have been beaten .

Yesterday in Iran , articles appeared in two government - run news outlets blaming the Baha ’i “ sect ” for the recent unrest in Iran , and namely the widespread protests that took place across the country on the day of Ashura .
The Javan Newspaper , affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards , claimed that the protesters in “ Mousavi ’s camp ” tore Qur ’ans during the protests , and that this is a practice that is common among the “ Baha ’i branch ” of Mousavi ’s staff .
The semi-official Fars News Agency , which has recently seen an influx in its ranks of Basij members , claimed that “ Baha’ism under the leadership of Zionism is behind the latest crisis and unrest ” .
The following is a translation from Farsi of the relevant paragraphs of the Fars News Agency story :
Baha’ism , Led by Zionism , is Hatching Intrigue Behind the Scenes of the Recent Unrest
Ne ’matollah Bavand , an expert and researcher in political affairs , proclaims that Baha’ism under the leadership of Zionism is behind the latest crisis and unrest .
Asserting that there is no doubt that Baha’ism , led by Zionism , is behind these disturbances , Bavand declared : “ A female advisor to one of the candidates in the recent presidential election who wears a turban defended Baha’ism . ”
[ Note : this is an implied and disparaging reference to Mehdi Karroubi ] .
He added : “ How long will the government put up with these people ?
Have n’t the people been convinced yet of the nature of these hypocrisies ?
… An advisor to this man , who pretends to be a man of the cloth and who was once the head of parliament , has openly come out in defense of Baha’ism and is currently completing training with her husband in England to become spies . ”
He emphasized , “ The public sees these things and becomes upset .
Is n’t there a way to take care of these problems ?
The key players leave Iran and people of lesser importance are tried , when it is the key players that need to be tried !
… The enemy has come to seek revenge for all the victories [ of the Islamic Republic ] in the Mecca of Islam : Iran ! ”
Below in a translation from Farsi of the Javan newspaper story
Plot of Baha’ism in the Musawi Camp to Publicly Desecrate Religious Sanctities is Exposed
On ‘ Ashura , the protectors of the Musawi camp did not have the decency to abstain from desecrating even the most sacred of religious sanctities .
By tearing up copies of the Qur’an on Enqelab Street in front of those mourning the martyrdom of Imam Husayn , they have exposed another side of their contempt for religion .
Confirming the above report , an expert in matters of security told Javan Online : “ The actions of the Musawi Camp in desecrating religious sanctities is nothing new .
In fact , this began happening when a Baha ’i branch in the staff of this candidate was formed during the days leading up to the election . ”
He added : “ This sect has long been planning to attack the religious sanctities of the people on ‘ Ashura but since they can never secure the protection of the masses , they will never be succeed . ”
Regarding the role of Baha’ism in desecrating religious sanctities , our expert in matters of security stated , “ The path that the Musawi camp is taking in their attack on religious sanctities is the exact same path that the misguided Baha ’i sect has been on for years . ”
He added : “ We have evidence connecting the sect of Baha’ism with the Musawi camp and the strategic partnership between these two groups . ”
Congratulations !
You 've got a fantastic idea for a science - fiction movie script .
But how can you transform your sweeping epic into a workable screenplay ?
A screenplay is n't a novel , and you can actually use that fact to your advantage .

As a film student with a concentration on writing , I 've thought a lot about the proper way to write a screenplay .
It 's only through trial and error that I 've started to sort out what bits of advice really work for me , and which ones can go by the wayside .
A screenplay is n't something that 's designed or written for being read .
It is first and foremost a production document .
You should n't be writing a screenplay , unless you want it to be made into a movie .
If you do n't want it to be a movie ( or some other visual medium ) then you should write a novel instead .
Advertisement
And a good screenplay is a blueprint .
It 's a set of directions for the actors , the director , and the crew to follow to construct the film .
Like a blueprint , a screenplay has to be able to support the weight of the story , and that means following some basic rules .
But those rules can be a little tricky to understand , like how much detail is too much and how much is too little ?
How do you develop your characters and tell your story in a way that will come across to the audience , who usually has n't read your script before they see the film ?
There are five things you can do before you even get started that will help you start to wrestle with those questions and come out ahead of the pack .

Read .
A lot .
The best way to really get the feel for the proper way to approach a screenplay is by reading a lot of produced screenplays .
Note : a draft probably wo n't cut it on this front .
You want to learn by studying a finished product , to see something that 's been honed .
You want to read something that 's sold because while it might not guarantee quality , it at least guarantees that it had something that made a producer give the writer a chance .
You can find scripts in bookstores , but most are also available on the internet these days .
You can do a google search if you are looking for a particular script , or just browse .
Three places to look are The Internet Movie Script Database , JoBlo's Movie Scripts , and Script Collector .

A good writer is a good reader , in any genre , style , or format .
Outline first .
I tried one time to go on a rant about how I tend to just freeform write and " let things flow " as I 'm going .
Then I wrote a feature screenplay .
My professor required outlines , beat sheets , treatments , and a ton of preparation work and I hated every step .
Advertisement
By the end of the semester , I can't imagine how I could have disagreed .
I could not have written that screenplay without doing that work up front .
You can free form write , but your script wo n't be as good and the process will be more difficult .
If nothing else , you need to know your story 's beginning , middle , and end before you get started .
Scripts are built around setup and payoff .
You can't set up and pay off if you do n't know where you 're going .

Do n't discount structure .
When I first started grad school , and my teacher started talking about screenplay structure , I scoffed .
I crossed my arms and resisted and told myself that structure just meant formulaic and who wants that ?
I was completely and utterly wrong .
Even quirky and strange movies that feel plotless still tend to follow this model , because it 's so ingrained in the language of film .

The three act structure is simple .
Act
One establishes your character , sets up the story , and begins the journey .
It 's usually the first quarter of the length .
Act
Two takes up half of the film , and contains the bulk of the conflict , as the protagonist faces the things that stand in the way of what he / she wants .
Act Three is your resolution .
It is NOT the epilogue , though the epilogue is part of Act Three — the climax is the bulk of Act Three .

The original Star Wars trilogy provides the best way to understand the three acts .
A New Hope establishes our heroes , their characters , and their universe .
Empire Strikes
Back is full of conflict and obstacles , double crosses , and unhappy endings that set up our climax .
Several plot threads are established but not completed .
Return of the Jedi contains the final moments where Luke confronts Vader and Palpatine , and chooses not to follow the dark side .
Vader is redeemed and all the threads that were created in Empire are brought to a close .
Each individual film also follows along three acts .
In Star Wars , Act One is establishing Luke on Tatooine .
Act Two is their journey to the Death Star and rescue of Princess Leia .
Act Three is the Battle of Yavin .
In simple terms , the three acts are just the beginning , middle , and the end .

Following the three - act structure is n't a bad thing .
It grounds the audience in something they know , it guides and paces your story .
Plus , it 's been around forever for one reason : it works .
Most writers who discuss structure use nine points in the story to build around .
The " Nine Point Clothesline " that I use is from the book How To Write A Movie in 21 Days by Vicki King .
Most books will tell you what page number each step should happen on , and that 's getting a little too detailed and prescriptive .
You 'll probably find as you write and follow your outline that these things will naturally occur at about the place they assign , but it 's not a hard and fast rule .
Advertisement
Page 1 : Establish the mood , tone , and place .
Page 3 : Establish the central dramatic question .
Page 10 : Here the book talks about setting up more story or giving more information so we know what the hero wants .
For me , it 's easier to just say this is where you 'll probably put your catalyst or inciting incident .
Page 30 : The break into act two , an event that moves the hero into new territory .
Page 45 : A moment of initial growth or change in the character .
Page 60 : The midpoint .
This is a hard one , because not every story has a midpoint .
But the midpoint is usually a mirror of the end , either a false victory or a false defeat .
The hero makes a deeper commitment to his / her task .
Page 75 : The " all is lost " moment , when the protagonist is convinced he / she can't achieve their task .
But in the end , something happens that changes everything and makes the climax possible .
Page 90 : The second turning point .
The hero is committed to the final path towards the climax .
Page 120 : The dramatic question is resolved .
Advertisement
If you plotted the arc of one of my favorite films , Pitch Black , you 'll see it follows this structure very closely .
We establish the setting in the opening monologue .
The central question is " will they survive ? "
The inciting incident is the crash of the ship , the break into act two is the discovery of the monsters in the dark .
Around 45 pages into the script , the characters discover the empty mining town , the ship , and the coming eclipse .
The midpoint is the eclipse itself , the " all is lost " moment is when Riddick abandons the survivors in the cave .
At the second turning point , Fry takes control of the two survivors , finally completing her arc to die for them in the climax .
At the last moment , the question is resolved : three of them survive .

Not every movie falls into a perfect little timeline , but take the next film you watch and think about the way it plots the arc of the story .
It probably follows this structure .
If nothing else , it will contain three acts , a catalyst , and the two turning points on the character 's journey .
You can find any number of books that tell you what the author thinks is the " perfect " screenplay structure , and really they 're all both right and wrong .
I like the outline I use , because it works well with the way I structure character arcs , and it makes the most sense to me personally .
Look around online , and find a structure that makes sense to you and your story .

Learn to format correctly before you get started .
I once had a teacher tell us to get the script down and then start to worry about formatting .
All you 're doing if you try it that way is asking for hours of mindless reformatting AND mistakes you did n't catch .
Not to mention that there is absolutely no reason for it .
You can get the basics of screenplay formatting from Script Frenzy .
But if you 're really serious , what you need is The Screenwriter 's Bible by David Trottier .
I have yet to find a formatting question that this book does n't answer .

Do n't spend a ton of money .
You can spend a couple hundred dollars on Final Draft , if you really want to .
Or you can download Celtx .
It 's absolutely free , and it does everything you could want it to do .
It makes screenplay formatting so simple that you 're only limited by your typing speed .
Once you sell a screenplay you can buy something shiny , but for now do n't let anybody tell you that you need to buy Final Draft or any other expensive software .

If you prefer an online option , check out Scripped .
It works a bit like Google Documents , where your screenplay is online and accessible from any computer with an internet connection .
Your next stop is to start thinking about how to write " visually " and how to represent character without the benefit of the third person narrator .
I 'll talk about those things in another post , in a few days .
A single - celled slime mould mindlessly foraging for food can create a network as efficient as the Tokyo rail system , researchers say .
A network created by a slime mould connects food sources corresponding to cities around Tokyo .
The network is similar to the railway system that exists around the city .
( ( Science / AAAS ) )
A team of Japanese and British researchers say the behaviour of the amoeba - like mould could lead to better design of computer or communication networks .
The slime mould Physarum polycephalum grows to connect itself to food sources as part of its normal behaviour .
The mould " can find the shortest path through a maze or connect different arrays of food sources in an efficient manner , " wrote Atsushi Tero of Hokkaido University and his colleagues in this week 's issue of Science .
The researchers noticed that the slime mould spreading to gather scattered food sources organizes itself into a gelatinous network that interconnects the sources and looks somewhat like a railway system .
To emphasize this similarity , they placed oat flakes on a wet surface in locations corresponding to Tokyo and cities in the surrounding area and let the slime mould loose .
The resulting slime network bore a striking similarity to a simplified layout of the extensive railway network that exists around Greater Tokyo .
Real - world implications
A slime mould forms a network of tubes connecting food sources scattered to correspond to the locations of cites around Tokyo .
( ( Science / AAAS ) )
The resemblance to the real - world network was even stronger when the scientists prevented the mould from growing in areas corresponding to lakes and mountains — places the railway can't go — by bathing those areas in bright light , which the mould avoids .
Being a single - celled organism , the mould lacks a brain or any kind of nervous system , so the network was n't planned but arose from very simple biological rules , which " have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection , " the researchers wrote .
The researchers also compared the mould 's network to an idealized network based on a mathematical model called the minimum spanning tree , a geometric concept used to create cost - efficient networks .
They broke down the mould 's behaviour and distilled it into a set of simple mathematical rules and built a new computer model out of them .
The model could lead to more efficient transportation , computer and communications networks , the researchers said .
" The model captures the basic dynamics of network adaptability through interaction of local rules and produces networks with properties comparable to or better than those of real - world infrastructure networks , " wrote Wolfgang Marwan of Germany 's Otto von Guericke University in a related article in Science .

The attorney representing a Bethlehem Township , Pa. , man who allegedly allowed eight teenagers to party in his home has asked that the case be heard in another county .
Lawyer Erv McLain filed the request today in Northampton County Court , arguing his client
wo n’t receive a fair trial because of media reports referring to him as a
" stripper pole dad . "
Police said the father of two allowed teens ranging in ages from 14 to 17 to drink vodka , rum and beer and encouraged girls dressed in their cheerleading uniforms to dance on a stripper pole in his basement .
In December , Northampton County Judge Stephen Baratta sentenced Russo to up to 23 months in prison after a jury found him guilty of stalking his ex-girlfriend .
Baratta at the same time threw out Russo ’s guilty plea on the party charges and ordered he stand trial .
McClain argues in court papers that the stalking and other charges “ have been over - reported and substantially sensationalized in the local news media . ”
McClain claims in court papers that an

McClain asks for a change of venue because
" an extreme and irreparable public prejudice "
exists against his client , making it impossible to seat a fair and impartial jury .
Close to 900 drivers were caught talking on their mobile phones on NSW roads during a one - day crackdown on dangerous driving practices across the state .
As part of Wednesday 's Operation Compliance , police caught a total 1875 motorists breaking road rules .
Of those , 895 drivers were booked for using their mobile phones , while 414 were caught speeding in school zones .
Another 48 were fined for Children 's Crossing offences , while 273 were reprimanded for not wearing a seatbelt .
" Every life lost on our roads is a tragic waste which is why record numbers of police are on our roads every day seeking out motorists who are putting their safety , the safety of the passengers and the safety of others at risk , " Police Minister Michael Daley said in a statement on Friday .
" That 's why we all have a responsibility to drive as safely as possible every time we get behind the wheel . "
Justice has prevailed : a judge has ruled that Boy George should not be allowed to bend the rules of his probation and appear on Celebrity Big Brother .
Richard Clayton QC , representing the probation service , argued that to permit such a TV appearance would undermine public confidence in the service .
Alison Macdonald , representing the singer ( whose real name is George O'Dowd ) , argued that he should be given permission because the terms of his probation licence were , in part , to rehabilitate the star .
Mention of the most important person in this case was scant : the victim .
It has n't seemed to have occurred to Boy George – perhaps blinded by the reported £ 200,000 fee from Channel 4 – what effect his appearance on the show might have had on Audun Carlsen .
But then , everyone except the judge in the original trial has , from the outset , routinely dismissed the male escort and the damage inflicted upon him .
Why ?
Imagine for a moment if , say , Robbie Williams had dragged a female escort across the floor of his house before handcuffing her to a wall and beating her with a chain .
His career would be over , permanently .
His reputation would be plunged to a level only a couple of rungs higher than that of Gary Glitter .
He would be shunned .
Compare this with what 's happened to Boy George .
Many gay people reacted to his incarceration with shock and disgust , throwing parties and club nights in his honour , as if he were a martyr , an Oscar Wilde figure .
The justice system reacted by allowing him to serve just four months of his 15 - month sentence .
The publicly funded BBC reacted by inviting the star , after his release , to appear on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross , ( where O'Dowd laughed and joked about his time in prison ) .
And Ross , as ever asking the questions the public would like to pose , probed him about everything other than his despicable crime .
Boy George had been forgiven .
And not just because he has a good line in hats , quips and pathos - drenched lyrics .
Not just because he is an apparently cuddly " out " gay man who once said he preferred a cup of tea to sex .
But for the simple reason that his victim was male .
We still cannot seem to take crimes of sex and violence against men seriously .
The response of the authorities to female victims of rape and domestic violence is often lacking .
The response of the public to male victims is one of disbelief , apathy and even humour .
This is why even fewer male rape victims report the crime to the police , or even tell anyone .
This is why , in part , there are fewer provisions for male victims of domestic violence .
( One in six men suffer domestic violence at some point in their lives , compared with one in four women – the figures are not dissimilar . )
But something else is going on here too : male escorts and prostitutes are irrationally viewed differently to female ones .
They 're not victims , our collective consciousness cries .
They 're gigolos !
They choose it !
They 're oversexed !
The reality is horribly different from this " happy whore " fantasy .
Having interviewed many male prostitutes and porn stars over the years , I have invariably unearthed back - stories of abuse , poverty , and desperation .
Yet when I interviewed O'Dowd in 2005 he spoke unapologetically about hiring men to pose naked for his camera .
At the end I asked what his plans were for the future .
He replied : " More sex ; more disturbing encounters with straight guys . "
I 'm relieved , then , that the 48 - year - old will not be disgracing the UK 's most talked - about house with his presence .
Had he been allowed , had the juggernaut of celebrity clout reached its greedy target , had the crimes against Carlsen been completely brushed aside , every male victim of a sex crime should have stood outside the studio in Elstree singing , through turned - up megaphones , Do You Really Want to Hurt Me ?
Collusion .
That 's what it 's all about .
The United Arab Emirates suspect – only suspect , mark you – that Europe 's " security collaboration " with Israel has crossed a line into illegality , where British passports ( and those of other other EU nations ) can now be used to send Israeli agents into the Gulf to kill Israel 's enemies .
At 3.49 pm yesterday afternoon ( Beirut time , 1.49 pm in London ) , my Lebanese phone rang .
It was a source – impeccable , I know him , he spoke with the authority I know he has in Abu Dhabi – to say that " the British passports are real .
They are hologram pictures with the biometric stamp .
They are not forged or fake .
The names were really there .
If you can fake a hologram or biometric stamp , what does this mean ? "
The voice – I know the man and his origins well – wants to talk .
" There are 18 people involved in the killing of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Besides the 11 already named , there are two Palestinians who are being interrogated and five others , including a woman .
She was part of the team that staked out the hotel lobby . "
Two hours later , an SMS arrives on my Beirut phone from Abu Dhabi , the capital of the United Arab Emirates .
It is the same source .
" ONE MORE THING , " it says in capital letters , then continues in lower case .
" The command room of the operation was in Austria ( sic , in fact , all things are " sic " in this report ) ... meaning the suspects when here did not talk to each other but thru the command room on separate lines to avoid detection or linking themselves to one another ... but it was detected and identified OK ? ? "
OK ?
I ask myself .
My source is both angry and insistent .
" We have sent out details of the 11 named people to Interpol .
Interpol has circulated them to 188 countries – but why has n't Britain warned foreign nations that these people are using passports in these names ? "
There was more to come .
" We have identified five credit cards belonging to these people , all issued in the United States . "
The man will not give the EU nationalities of the extra five – this would make two women involved in Mr Mabhouh 's murder .
He said that EU countries were cooperating with the UAE , including the UK .
But " not one of the countries we have been speaking to has notified Interpol of the passports used in their name .
Why not ? "
The source insisted that one of the names on a passport – the name of a man who denies any knowledge of its use – has travelled on it in Asia ( probably Indonesia ) and EU countries over the past year .
The Emirates have proof that an American entered their country in June 2006 on a British passport issued in the name of a UK citizen who was already in prison in the Emirates .
The Emirates claim that the passport of an Israeli agent sent to kill a Hamas leader in Jordan was a genuine Canadian passport issued to a dual national of Israel .
Intelligence agencies – who in the view of this correspondent are often very unintelligent – have long used false passports .
Oliver North and Robert McFarlane travelled to Iran to seek the release of US hostages in Lebanon on passports that were previously stolen from the Irish embassy in Athens .
But the Emirates ' new information may make some European governments draw in their breath – and they had better have good replies to the questions .
Intelligence services – Arab , Israeli , European or American – often adopt an arrogant attitude towards those from whom they wish to hide .
How could the Arabs pick up on a Mossad killing , if that is what it was ?
Well , we shall see .
What started out as a few tips on 3G issues for Google 's Nexus
One seems to have ballooned into a fair bit of drama at Google 's support forums .
The main complaint appears to be owners reporting that their device either never switches to 3G , or , it is constantly switching between 3G and EDGE .
Many users are also posting that switching out to another manufacturer 's set yields great 3G reception where they 're testing , and others have chimed in that the service on their phones has been spotless .
In an interview today at All Things D here at CES , Walt Mossberg mentioned the support problems to which Andy Rubin replied " we have to get better at customer service " -- all too true if this is a real problem .
Let us know in comments if you 're seeing an issue , and if there is a real problem here , hopefully it 'll get addressed on the double .

Erik Mona has been involved with gaming since he was a grade schooler , but most most tabletop gamers first became aware of Mona through his work with Wizards of the Coast ’s third edition of Dungeons & Dragons , and later during his tenure as publisher of both Dragon and Dungeon magazine .
Now , as the publisher of Paizo Publishing , Erik has overseen the release of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game : a fantasy roleplaying game that picks up where Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 left off and propels it into the future .
Erik recently spoke with Matt Staggs about Pathfinder and what the future holds for Paizo Publishing .
If I already have my 3.5 Players Handbook and Dungeon Master ’s Guide , why should I pick up Pathfinder ?
Is this just a retread ?
Pathfinder starts with the 3.5 rules , but benefits from a year and a half of open playtesting of the 3.5 system and a 10 - year development cycle starting with third edition .
Paizo ’s editorial staff has been publishing adventures and game books using 3.5 for a decade .
During that time we became very familiar with some of the system ’s rough edges , and with the playtest feedback we ’ve created a game that is true to the previous edition while offering lots of exciting streamlining of complicated rules like grappling and figuring out character skills .
Toning down a little needless complexity left room for some new options , and nearly every character class has some new tricks up its sleeves .
The game is familiar and new at the same time , which I suppose was the whole purpose of the exercise in the first place .
What do you think that will surprise people the most about Pathfinder ?
I think gamers will be surprised by the sheer mass of the book , by how much we managed to fit into 576 pages .
This thing is a TOME .
How much playtesting went into this product ?
The open playtesting went about a year and a half , from the earliest Alpha test documents to the printed Beta playtest and testing of the final edition here in - house at Paizo .
More than 55,000 individual gamers downloaded the free Pathfinder Beta Playtest , which makes this the most robust public playtest of a tabletop RPG in history .
Can you tell me about some of the changes to the core classes ?
Cleric ?
Magic User ? Etc.?
All 11 standard base classes ( bard , barbarian , cleric , druid , fighter , monk , paladin , ranger , rogue , sorcerer , wizard ) received a thorough going - over .
With the exception of the barbarian , who keeps his traditional d12 Hit Die , we standardized the Hit Dice for all the classes .
Arcane casters like the sorcerer and wizard got a bump from d4 to d6 , monks , rogues , and bards are at d8 , and fighting classes remain at d10 .
This will give many characters a few more hit points to help them survive challenges .
We also added several class abilities and refined others .
The cleric ’s always - confusing turn undead ability , for example , is now called channel energy , allowing the cleric to release what amounts to bursts of positive energy that do direct damage to undead foes .
Because this is _positive_ energy , it also heals most normal characters , giving the cleric more options to pick interesting spells .
In 3.0 , there was a suggestion that sorcerers received their arcane powers from hereditary influence , so we added the concept of bloodlines .
You get to pick what makes your sorcerer special , from a too - long dalliance with arcane forces to demonic heritage to the blood of true dragons in his veins .
Paladins have a new ability called mercies that allow them to remove conditions like disease , fear , or stunned .
I could list off this sort of thing for every single class in the game .
Everybody got some cool new power or ability .
Suppose that I ’m a gamer , and the only edition of D&D that I ’ve played is 4th edition and it is n’t to my liking : why should I try Pathfinder ?
Sometimes it takes a little looking around to find the best system to match your personal play preference and style .
You would n’t swear off all science fiction movies just because , say , you did n’t like “ Independence Day , ” so why swear off sword & sorcery roleplaying because you did n’t like the first system you tried ?
Pathfinder is very open ended .
You come up with a character you ’d like to play , and the rules will help you find a way to build it .
It ’s based on a game system that has been around and refined for more than 30 years , so you can be sure most of the changes and the bedrock of the system has been carefully considered , abused , slapped around , and adjusted appropriately .
What can you tell me about the Pathfinder license ?
Pathfinder itself is built using the Open Game License released by Wizards of the Coast back in 2000 , when Open Systems development was a major buzz - word and when the Internet and easy desktop publishing offered what seemed like a limitless vista of cooperation among a community of publishers .
All of the rules content in all of Paizo ’s products is released under this open development paradigm , allowing others to build on Pathfinder the same way we built upon the 3.5 system .
In order to denote compatibility , we ’ve set up a free Pathfinder Compatibility License that provides a “ Pathfinder Compatible ” logo other publishers can use to denote compatibility with our system .
You can learn a lot more about the license by visiting paizo.com / pathfinderRPG/compatibility
How much support will Paizo be bringing to Pathfinder ?
All of Paizo ’s existing product lines were switched over to support the Pathfinder RPG in August , which brings the following resources to bear :
Monthly Pathfinder Adventure Path adventure and campaign supplements .
Monthly Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting support books .
Monthly “ organized play ” support in the form of 2 - 4 short scenarios geared toward convention or in - store play .
Bi-Monthly Pathfinder Companion player - focused sourcebooks .
Bi-Monthly Pathfinder Modules stand - alone adventures .
We also continue to produce several GameMastery gaming accessories ( maps , Item Cards , etc. ) on a monthly basis .
And next year we plan to launch Pathfinder fiction !
Are there other companies planning on making Pathfinder - compatible products ?
At present more than 40 companies have signed on to produce Pathfinder Compatibile products .
The first dozen or so of these are already available and selling well .
Will we be seeing Pathfinder demonstrations at conventions ?
Yes !
Paizo always attends the Gen Con Indy convention , and our Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign ( think of it as a Massively Multiplayer Analog Game ) is played at dozens of conventions around the world .
You can get a list of upcoming events in your area by visiting paizo.com / pathfindersociety
What if I ’m a older gamer , and I have n’t played a fantasy roleplaying game since Advanced Dungeons & Dragons .
Is Pathfinder a good opportunity for me to get back into gaming ?
Absolutely !
You will be very comfortable with the Pathfinder rules , which after all have their origins in the earliest years of the hobby and are still , in many ways , based upon the same mechanical designs .
Unlike back then , however , the rules actually handle things like whether you can hear a monster creeping up on you , how to jump across a ravine , or how to do any number of things that GMs formerly had to pull out of nowhere .
Our design staff is HEAVILY influenced by the pulp fantasy writers who inspired the old game , so I am certain long - time players ( even dormant ones ! ) will find much to appreciate in the new Pathfinder system and related support products .
I understand that there ’s a campaign setting that ’s available for Pathfinder .
Can you tell me a little bit about it ?
What are some of the major inspirations that guided its development ?
The Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting starts with the idea that gamers enjoy lots of different types of campaign styles , so our world should be able to accommodate lots of different gamers .
The result is a world in which there ’s a place for traditional dungeon crawling , atmospheric horror play , intensely political urban campaigns , and just about anything else , up to and including weird fantasy / sci - fi fusion ( thanks to a crashed space ship in the world of Golarion ’s northern wastes ) .
The trick , of course , was to provide all of these interesting backdrops without making the setting feel like a hodge - podge of disparate influences .
The setting has been honored with the Best Campaign Setting Gen Con / ENnie award for two years running , so I guess we ’re doing something right !
Will we be seeing anything like Pathfinder franchise novels and that sort of thing ?
Yes .
The first Pathfinder novel should appear in the late summer of 2010 , very probably with a launch event at Gen con Indy .
Tell me a little bit about your own gaming history .
How does Pathfinder fit into this ?
Is this the kind of game that you ’d pick up and play in your own group ?
Why ?
I started playing thanks to an after - school class in third grade , played obsessively through junior high , high school , and college , became a top - ranked RPGA player in the years after college and eventually moved to Seattle to join the editorial staff of Wizards of the Coast in 1999 , during the birth period of third edition D&D .
While at Wizards I was a player in Dungeon Master ’s Guide author Monte Cook ’s weekly Ptolus game for about 8 years , and in 2003 I moved with the Wizards periodicals department to a new spin - off company called Paizo .
At Paizo I became the editor - in - chief of Dungeon magazine , then Dragon , and then became the publisher of the entire company .
I still game regularly , and due to my long association with and love of the third edition rules , Pathfinder is now my system of choice .
What ’s the “ bottom line ” on Pathfinder ?
What ’s the absolute essential that readers need to know ?
The bottom line is that Pathfinder supports the best - tested , most popular RPG rules set of all time , and that the rules are more fun and easier to understand now than they have been at any point in history .
It ’s a great game , and a great time to get in on the ground floor .

Migraines affect one in ten people
The visual pathway that underlies a migraine sufferer 's sensitivity to light has been uncovered by Harvard scientists .
The researchers studied two groups of blind people who suffered migraine headaches .
They found light triggered a reaction in a group of brain neurons that remained active for some time .
Migraines are one - sided throbbing headaches that cause nausea and affect up to six million people in the UK .
The researchers , writing in the journal Nature Neuroscience , said they noted that even blind people who had migraines experienced sensitivity to light or photophobia .
The observation led them to the idea that the signals transmitted from the retina via the optic nerve were somehow triggering worsening of the pain .
Sleep - wake cycles
They looked at 20 blind people who fell into two groups - the first were totally blind due to eye diseases such as retinal cancer and glaucoma .
They were unable to see images or to sense light and therefore could not maintain normal sleep - wake cycles .
Patients in the second group were legally blind due to retinal degenerative diseases , such as retinitis pigmentosa .
We are now wondering if this research might help us to further understand why so many people with migraines are sensitive to low energy light sources as well
Lee Tompkins
Migraine Action
Although they were unable to perceive images , they could detect the presence of light and maintain normal sleep - wake cycles .
The patients in the second group described intensified pain when they were exposed to light , in particular to blue or grey wavelengths .
Rami Burstein , professor of anaesthesia and critical care medicine at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston , US , led the study .
Professor Burstein said : " While the patients in the first group did not experience any worsening of their headaches from light exposure , the patients in the second group clearly described intensified pain when they were exposed to light .
" This suggested to us that the mechanism of photophobia must involve the optic nerve , because in totally blind individuals , the optic nerve does not carry light signals to the brain .
" We also suspected that a group of recently discovered retinal cells containing melanopsin photoreceptors ( which help control biological functions including sleep and wakefulness ) is critically involved in this process , because these are the only functioning light receptors left among patients who are legally blind . "
Lee Tomkins , director of Migraine Action , said : " We have known from previous research that this sensitivity can be triggered by the blue light waves in the light spectrum , but avoiding grey light is a new aspect , and we are now wondering if this research might help us to further understand why so many people with migraines are sensitive to low energy light sources as well . "
Electrical signals Migraine pain is believed to develop when the meninges , the membranes that surround the brain and central nervous system , become irritated .
This stimulates pain receptors and triggers a series of events that lead to the prolonged activation of groups of sensory neurons .
The researchers also examined what happened when they injected dyes into the eyes of rats .
They traced the path of the melanopsin retinal cells through the optic nerve to the brain where they found a group of neurons that become electrically active during a migraine .
" When small electrodes were inserted into these ' migraine neurons ' , we discovered that light was triggering a flow of electrical signals that was converging on these very cells , " said Professor Burstein .
Even when the light was removed these neurons remained activated .
" This helps explain why patients say that their headache intensifies within seconds after exposure to light , and improves 20 to 30 minutes after being in the dark . "
Dr Sue Lipscombe , a GP from Brighton with a special interest in headaches , said : " It suggests that an external source is contributing to the migraine condition and it is not just a contained brain disorder that just takes its cycle but that there are outside modifying factors . "

A woman who lost her balance and tore a hole in a Pablo Picasso painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art likely cut the $ 130 million painting ’s value in half , a top appraiser said yesterday .
Conservators said they will be able to fix the 6 - inch tear in “ The Actor ” ( above ) , but appraiser Gerard van Weyenbergh said the painting may never recover its value .
“ It ’s a 50 percent loss of the value — at least , ” van Weyenbergh , who has handled numerous Picassos , told The Post .
“ When an artwork comes up in auction , that ’s the first thing people want to know — were there any repaints or restorations .
“ Even a small hole and Picasso collectors like [ Steven ] Spielberg are not going to be interested . ”
Museum officials would not identify the woman who fell into the painting , but they said conservators will have it ready for the museum ’s Picasso exhibition later this year .

YOUNG adults who used marijuana as teens were more likely than those who did n't to develop schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms , a seven - year Australian study found .
Those who used the drug for six or more years were twice as likely to develop a psychosis such as schizophrenia or to have delusional disorders than those who never used it .
Research involving more than 3800 young adults , released online by the Archives of General Psychiatry , found long - term users were also four times more likely to have psychotic - like experiences .
The findings , by the Queensland Brain Institute at the University of Queensland , build on previous research and shows that marijuana use is not as harmless as some people think , lead study author John McGrath said yesterday in an email .
The researchers quizzed 3801 young adults who were born in Brisbane between 1981 and 1984 .
The participants , whose average age was about 20 , were asked about marijuana use .
The researchers also measured whether those in the study had psychotic symptoms .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia 
In this urban oasis widely considered one of the most livable places in the world , the Downtown Eastside is about 15 square blocks of something else .
At the corner of Main and Hastings , residents of the poorest postal code in Canada passed a recent Tuesday afternoon .
One man lighted a crack pipe , inhaling deeply .
Another urinated on a wall .
Another burned a book of matches , muttering at the flame .
Two men started fighting .
One brandished a bicycle seat , the other a salad that spilled onto the sidewalk .
“ All that over drugs , ” a passer - by said .
“ Welcome to the Downtown Eastside . ”
That scene unfolded five blocks from the site of the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics , scheduled for next Friday , and a five - minute drive from the athletes ’ village .
By bidding for the Olympics , Vancouver invited the world to visit .
Now city officials are trying to redirect the international news media spotlight from this blighted neighborhood in the shadows of the picturesque North Shore Mountains .
I love bridges , from the simple brick - and - mortar and wooden contraptions ( I ’m not so sure about the rope kind ) to the massive engineering marvels with their elegant spans and towering masts .
Some cross a simple stream or small creeks whilst others traverse wide rivers , harbours and canyons .
It ’s always a joy to cross a bridge on foot ; to appreciate the views , to make my knees tremble from great heights , to enjoy the breeze or just to feel the rumble of the traffic .
I ’ve crossed many bridges on foot but I ’ve chosen ten which were absolutely memorable as they offered beautiful scenic views .
If you ’re in any of these places , spare some time in your itinerary for an incredible bridge walk experience .
Ten incredible bridge walks
Sydney Harbour Bridge , Sydney , Australia
The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of my absolute favourites .
You can do the simple walk from one end to the other to enjoy the stunning views of Sydney Harbour and the city skyline .
Or you can choose the exhilarating Bridge Climb which takes you along the arch to the summit of this magnificent bridge on catwalks and ladders , more than 130 meters ( +300 feet ) above Sydney Harbour .
I tried it years ago to challenge my fear of heights .
I guess that ’s why I ’ll never forget this bridge walk .
😉
Book your Bridge Climb here .
Golden Gate Bridge , San Francisco , USA
The Golden Gate Bridge is certainly one of the most famous bridges in the world .
Crossing it by foot is an experience to treasure .
The wind , the terrifying heights , the fog , the vibrating deck , and the views will be etched in your memory forever !
It ’s a long walk from the San Francisco city side to Marin County on the other end ( and back ) but oh so worth it !
Yokohama Bay Bridge , Yokohama , Japan
It ’s not the longest or highest bridge in Japan but the Yokohama Bay Bridge is definitely one of the most spectacular .
About a third of the way across the bridge is a viewing platform which offers amazing views of Yokohama Bay , the city skyline and on clear days , the stunning Mount Fuji .
Not to be missed if you ’re visiting Yokohama .
Brooklyn Bridge , New York City , USA
The Brooklyn Bridge is arguably one of the most famous bridges in the world .
It ’s been in dozens of movies and television series .
In addition , who can ever forget the images of terrified New Yorkers crossing the bridge , covered in blankets of dust , in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks ?
The bridge is truly a global icon and a visit to New York will not be complete without a leisurely stroll across it .
The views of the Manhattan skyline are breathtaking and the incessant buzz of the New York traffic below is unforgettable .
Galata Bridge , Istanbul , Turkey
The Galata Bridge is a historic bridge that crosses the Golden Horn in Istanbul .
There were many designs for a bridge crossing at this spot over the centuries , including drawings by Leonardo da Vinci .
However , the first bridge was built in the 19th century .
The Galata Bridge that spans the Golden Horn today is the fifth version .
A walk across the Galata is a true feast for the senses .
The stunning minarets of the Hagia Sophia , Blue and Süleymaniyeh mosques and the Galata Tower form a striking backdrop while the spice - filled air , the anglers , and the traffic ( cars , buses and trams ) on the bridge and the many boats plying the Golden Horn below will keep your senses tantalised !
Charles Bridge , Prague , Czech Republic
The Charles Bridge crosses the Vltava river that meanders through the city of Prague .
It is one of the city ’s most famous icons and deservedly so .
This historic bridge , with its 16 arches and three Gothic bridge towers , was built in the 14th century and is lined with gorgeous statues .
I recommend walking across the bridge both in the daytime , when the bridge is crowded with day - trippers , artisans , artists and souvenir vendors , and in the early evening .
When the vendors and artisans have packed up , the day - trippers have left , and the lights illuminating the bridge and Prague Castle are turned on , the bridge turns into , arguably , one of the most romantic spots in Europe .
Tower Bridge , London , England
Often mistakenly referred to as London Bridge ( I guess that nursery rhyme had something to do with it ) , the Tower Bridge is one of the most famous symbols of London , and probably the most famous bascule bridge in the world .
It ’s a short stroll across the bridge but the views over the Thames to the Tower of London ( another iconic landmark ) , the lovely Butler ’s Wharf and the futuristic London City Hall ( designed by Norman Foster ) will stay with you forever .
You can also visit the Tower Bridge Exhibition which showcases the history of the bridge and includes a walk across the high walkway across the bridge .
Pont des Arts , Paris , France
The Pont des Arts is my favourite bridge in Paris .
This elegant metal bridge , with its nine arches , crosses the Seine river and connects the Louvre with the Institut de France .
The best part : it ’s a pedestrian bridge .
Take a leisurely stroll across the bridge in the evenings to watch the Paris lights and be temporarily blinded by the cruise boats as they pass by below ! 🙂
Ponte Vecchio , Florence , Italy
The Ponte Vecchio is a gorgeous medieval bridge that spans the Arno river in Florence .
Its most distinguishing feature is the fact that it has houses and shops built on it .
If you ’re visiting Florence , do some research on the fascinating history of this bridge before you visit .
It ’s an amazing story involving the Medici family , merchants and some of Italy ’s greatest architects .
As you walk across the present - day bridge , with its jewellery , art houses and souvenir shops , recalling the history of the bridge will help you truly appreciate its beauty .
Kintai Bridge , Iwakuni , Japan
My favourite wooden bridge , the Kintai Bridge is absolutely one - of - a- kind .
Located in Iwakuni , a town in the Yamaguchi Prefecture on Honshu island , the Kintai Bridge will keep you captivated for hours .
I ’d never seen anything like it before .
Built in the 17th century , the bridge is one of the National Treasures of Japan and crosses the Nishiki river in a series of wave - like curves .
The views from the bridge of the lush forested hills and the impressive Iwakuni Castle are absolutely gorgeous .
In spring , the breathtaking cherry blossoms add a touch of magic to the surroundings of this incredible bridge .
Which other great bridge walks would you add to this list ?
Please add your suggestions in the comments section . 🙂

Google is teaming up with the National Security Agency to investigate the recent hack attack against its network in a bid to prevent another assault , according to The Washington Post .
The internet search giant is working on an agreement with the controversial agency to determine the attacker 's methods and what Google can do to shore up its network .
Sources assured the Post that the deal does not mean the NSA will have access to users ' searches or e-mail communications and accounts .
Nor will Google share proprietary data with the agency .
But the move is raising concerns among privacy and civil rights advocates .
The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a Freedom of Information Act request on Thursday , shortly after the agreement was made public , seeking more information about the arrangement ( .pdf ) .
Executive Director Marc Rotenberg believes the agreement covers much more than the Google hack and that the search giant and intelligence agency were in talks prior to Google discovering that it had been hacked .
" What they 've told you is that this is about an investigation of a hack involving China , " he told Threat Level in a phone interview .
" I think and have good reason to believe that there 's a lot more going on . "
Google declined to comment .
" At the time [ of the hack announcement ] , we said we are working with the relevant US authorities , but we do n't have any comment beyond that , " wrote spokesman Jay Nancarrow in an e-mail .
The FOIA request also seeks NSA communications with Google regarding Google 's failure to encrypt Gmail and cloud computing services .
Rotenberg says EPIC wants to know what role the NSA has played in shaping privacy and security standards for Google 's services .
EPIC also filed a lawsuit against the NSA and the National Security Council , seeking a key document governing the government 's broader national cybersecurity policy , which has been shrouded in secrecy .
" We can't afford to have secret cybersecurity policy that impacts the privacy rights of millions of internet users , " he said .
Google announced earlier this month that it had been the target of a “ highly sophisticated ” and coordinated hack attack , since dubbed Operation Aurora , against its network and other companies in the defense , technology and finance industries .
Google said the hackers had stolen intellectual property – presumed to be its source code – and sought access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists .
The attack originated from China , the company said .
Computer security firm iDefense has said that 34 companies were targeted by the attackers , who were primarily after source code .
A recent report has provided details into the nature of the persistent espionage attack that mirrored attacks on thousands of companies over the last few years , which have largely gone unpublicized .
The agreement between Google and the NSA , still being finalized , would allow Google to share critical information with the NSA about the attacks and its network – such as the malicious code that was used and its network configurations – without violating Google 's policies or laws that protect the privacy of users ' communications , the sources say .
The NSA 's general counsel began drafting the cooperative research and development agreement the day that Google announced it had been hacked , according to The Wall Street Journal .
The agreement was finalized within 24 hours , but the information sharing at that time was limited , and only allowed the NSA to examine some of the data related to the hack .
Most of the data that was shared concerned the nature of the data that was stolen , the paper said .
Both the FBI and NSA worked directly with Google on the investigation .
The agreement between Google and the NSA would reportedly be the first time Google entered into such a formal information - sharing relationship – apart from its general cooperation with subpoenas and national security letters .
Matthew Aid , NSA historian and author of The Secret Sentry , said the move troubled him .
" I'm a little uncomfortable with Google cooperating this closely with the nation 's largest intelligence agency , even if it 's strictly for defensive purposes , " he told the Post .
The NSA has been embroiled since 2005 in allegations that the agency violated federal laws in conducting illegal surveillance of Americans ' phone and internet communications .
Giving the agency authority over coordination of the government 's cybersecurity plan – which would include working with telecoms and other critical companies in the private sector – could put the agency in the position of surreptitiously monitoring communications .
Last year Director of National Intelligence Admiral Dennis Blair raised a ruckus when he told the House intelligence committee that the NSA , rather than the Department of Homeland Security which currently oversees cybersecurity for the government , should be in charge of securing cyberspace for government and critical infrastructures .
" The National Security Agency has the greatest repository of cybertalent , " Blair said .
" [ T ] here are some wizards out there at Fort Meade who can do stuff . "
NSA Director Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander later balked at claims that his agency wanted to control the government 's cybersecurity plan and said it wanted to partner with DHS and others in securing networks .
Speaking at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco , he told the audience of security professionals that the NSA does " not want to run cybersecurity for the United States government . "
This week Blair , commenting on the Google hack , said cyberspace could not be secured without a " collaborative effort that incorporates both the U.S. private sector and our international partners . "
" As part of its information - assurance mission , " NSA spokeswoman Judi Emmel told the Post , " NSA works with a broad range of commercial partners and research associates to ensure the availability of secure tailored solutions for Department of Defense and national security systems customers . "

People buy insurance coverage for a reason .
They buy it so that when or if something bad happens in life , they will have the financial resources needed to recover from that event .
But insurance companies sell policies for a different reason .
They sell them to make a profit .
More to the point :
When it comes down to a choice between protecting their profits or honoring their obligations to a policyholder , the policyholder is often left holding an empty bag .
When a claim is wrongfully denied , you need a lawyer on your side for legal help with the insurance and bad faith claim lawsuit , or California Insurance disputes , whether they be auto , personal injury insurance claims , life insurance claims , ERISA ( employee retirement income security act ) or long term disability claims , can be complicated .
You ’re a lot better off facing a denied insurance claim with an experienced lawyer who knows how to pursue insurance companies for bad faith for denied or disputed insurance claims .
CHART Magazine ’s 15th Annual Year - end Readers ’ Poll named The Cliks lead singer Lucas Silveira , an out transgender man , the sexiest Canadian man .
Silveira cleaned up with 38 percent of the reader vote in the category aptly named Throw Your Underwear Award .
CHART Magazine is a top music publication in Canada , which is why it is so sensational that it entered a transperson into its sexiest man poll .
Contests , polls and countdowns like this one usually reinforce stereotypical ideas of who is attractive , leaving out people whose gender does not conform to their sex .
L ast fall , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission issued its much - anticipated Internet traffic management ruling , better known as the Net neutrality decision .
The case attracted national interest as the CRTC established several key requirements for Canada 's Internet providers .
These included new transparency obligations that forced ISPs to disclose their network management practices , such as why the practices were introduced , who will be affected , when it will occur and how it will impact users '
Internet experiences ( down to the specific impact on speeds ) .
The CRTC also opened the door to complaints about network management practices by establishing a test that any harm to users be as little as reasonably possible .
Several months later , Canada 's ISPs have had ample time to comply with the new requirements .
Yet , a review of the policies from the biggest ISPs – including Bell Canada , Rogers Communications Inc. , Shaw Communications Inc. , Telus , Cogeco Inc. and Groupe Vidéotron – reveals a decidedly mixed bag .
Two of the six providers – Telus and Vidéotron – do not have explicit network management practice disclosures since neither currently uses throttling , or traffic shaping technologies , that limit the speeds of some applications .
Of the remaining four providers , none makes it easy to find the disclosures and at least two may not be compliant with the CRTC requirements .
Bell features the most detailed disclosure , providing specific information about its policies and their impact .
While critics may object to the positive spin the company uses to describe limitations on its service , it has done precisely what the CRTC asked .
The Rogers policy is not quite as extensive , yet it also covers much the same terrain , including a description of the policy , the frequency of traffic shaping and the resulting limitations in its service ( including the specific impact on speed ) .
By contrast , neither Shaw nor Cogeco appear to meet the CRTC requirements .
Shaw 's policy , which can be found within its terms of use , does not disclose the actual speeds users encounter when it throttles peer - to - peer activity .
Cogeco , which implausibly claims " customer experience is never affected by the application of ( its ) measures , " similarly does not disclose the speeds that result from its throttling practices .
Not only are two providers arguably failing to meet the transparency requirements , but some traffic - management practices may be ripe for complaint .
Telus and Vidéotron once again get a pass , since neither uses throttling technologies , opting instead for economic measures that add additional costs for heavy broadband users .
Shaw 's policy also appears compliant with the CRTC minimal harm threshold , since it limits its throttling practices to actual instances of congestion on specific segments of its network .
Meanwhile , Rogers and Cogeco continuously throttle all upstream P2P traffic .
Both providers admit that the limits on their service occur on a 24 hour , 7 - day basis , regardless of whether the network is actually experiencing any congestion .
For example , Cogeco claims " it is ( our ) experience that congestion created by P2P can occur at any time within a 24 - hour period . "
This may be true , but the failure to limit throttling activities to instances of actual congestion is surely grounds for a CRTC complaint .
While Bell limits its throttling practices to specified periods , its defined period is so broad that it , too , may be the target of a complaint .
Bell discloses that its throttling practices , which target upload and download traffic , runs from 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m .
By covering nearly half the day , the company could face questions about whether the policy limits harm as much as reasonably possible .
The CRTC's
Net neutrality guidelines garnered well - deserved plaudits last year , yet the true test will be whether the guidelines will be enforced effectively .
By that measure , the jury is still out .

In my recent blog post about the ACLU ’s lawsuit against the State of Mississippi for promoting religion in a state - sponsored and state - funded event , I pondered whether Mississippi thinks the Constitution does n’t apply to them .
Apparently , Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant does n’t think it does .
Early this week , the lieutenant governor commented on the ACLU ’s case , saying :
I was so disappointed that the ACLU has decided that we do n’t need to tell young women in the state of Mississippi about our faith ; we do n’t need to explain to them that abstinence , we believe , is related to our faithful Christianity beliefs .
If you are like me and cannot believe that a state official would basically admit to violating the Constitution , you can see for yourself by watching the lieutenant governor utter those words in an interview .
There are so many things wrong with his sentence , I do n’t even know where to start .
First , the lieutenant governor ’s remarks show no respect for the First Amendment , which prohibits the government from supporting one religion or another .
Mississippi clearly crossed the line when it featured Christian prayers , sermons , and performances in its 2009 abstinence - only summit .
Second , it is revealing that the lieutenant governor believes that we need to tell “ young women ” that they should remain abstinent until marriage .
This is the age - old — and sexist — double standard that dictates that women and girls must be the gatekeepers of sex , and are solely responsible for the consequences .
Instead of reinforcing these outdated gender stereotypes , we should be providing all teens with the tools they need to make healthy and responsible decisions .
Tomorrow , September 17 , is Constitution Day — perhaps the lieutenant governor and other state officials should take a moment and study the First Amendment , so in the future they can ensure that they do n’t promote government - sponsored , taxpayer - funded religious activities , and reinforce outmoded gender stereotypes in the process .
Sharing is caring !
Behold the list below of the treasonous politicians who have voted for the health care legislation .
Mark their names and remember them well .
At the very least vote them out – they will pay for this .
America wo n’t stand for this blatant Marxist move and power - grab that neuters our Constitution and financially destroys America and her citizens .
Torch , pitchfork , tar , feathers – meet the politicians who sold out .
Remember kids , your price has a price and we are taking names .
Whores of a feather fall together …
We are coming for you – you arrogant , elitist asshats .

A federal lawsuit alleging collusion among the major music labels over digital download pricing can proceed , a three judge Appeals Court panel ruled today .
As lawsuits go , this one 's a humdinger , charging that the labels engaged in a price - fixing conspiracy to ensure that they each made about 70 cents per track sold online , and that no one received a better deal than anyone else .
The case had earlier been tossed for a " failure to state a claim , " but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has reinstated it and ordered the trial judge to proceed with the case .
Most Favored Nations
The case in question , Starr V. Sony BMG , actually began life as a host of cases filed by various plaintiffs in various state and federal courts in 2005 and 2006 .
The cases were eventually consolidated into a single one to be heard in a New York federal court , and that case covers behavior that goes all the way back to those dark post - Napster days when the labels attempted to foist MusicNet and pressplay onto an unsuspecting public .
Those early services were at first the only way that the labels would allow their music to be sold over the Internet , and the control exercised was extreme : they were actually label - controlled ventures , neither store had a complete selection of music , and the DRM was flat - out ridiculous .
Here 's how the complaint sketches the scene :
To obtain Internet Music from all major record labels , a consumer initially would have had to subscribe to both MusicNet and pressplay , at a cost of approximately $ 240 per year .
Both services required consumers to agree to unpopular Digital Rights Management terms ( " DRMs " ) .
For example , pressplay prohibited consumers from copying more than two songs from any particular artist onto a CD each month .
Music purchased from MusicNet and pressplay would often " expire " unless repurchased : A MusicNet consumer would need to repurchase music each year and a pressplay consumer who unsubscribed would immediately lose access to all of the music he or she had purchased .
MusicNet and pressplay also did not allow consumers to transfer songs from their computers to portable digital music players like the iPod .
One industry commentator observed that MusicNet and pressplay did not offer reasonable prices , and one prominent computer industry magazine concluded that “ nobody in their right mind will want to use ” these services .
Truly execrable stuff , but the complaint argues that the DRM was n't the worst of it .
Rather , the secret side deals relating to price were where the real sleaze was hidden .
One of the common arrangements alleged by the complaint was " Most Favored Nation " clauses , under which no one label could be offered a worse deal than any other label .
" Defendants attempted to hide the MFNs because they knew they would attract antitrust scrutiny , " said the court , summarizing the complaint .
" For example , EMI and MusicNet had a ' side letter ' agreement which assured that EMI 's core terms would be no less favorable than Bertelsmann 's [ Song BMG ] and [ Warner Music Group ] . "
The complaint quotes EMI CEO Rob Glaser as saying that the letter was secret because " there are legal / antitrust reasons why it would be a bad idea to have MFN clauses in any , or certainly all , of these agreements . "
It 's just a coincidence !
When pressplay and MusicNet fell apart , though , the complaint charges that the labels agreed to an internal price floor of 70 cents per track in order to keep revenues higher for everyone .
The plaintiffs also complain that the labels actually raised this level from 65 cents back in 2005 , even though costs ( CD stamping , packaging , shipping , etc. ) had fallen off dramatically in the shift to digital downloads .
( The price increase was then allegedly granted to every label by virtue of the MFN clauses . )
But here 's the rub : the complainants do n't appear to have any evidence of direct collusion .
That is , they can't point to a specific meeting or name which specific people got together from different companies and agreed to illegal price controls .
Instead , the plaintiffs claim that such an arrangement can logically be deduced from the behavior of the industry .
The defendants say that their pricing can just as easily be explained as a rational business response to the market , and that no collusion should be implied .
Judges from the Appeals Court agreed that in this case " the complaint alleges specific facts sufficient to plausibly suggest that the parallel conduct alleged was the result of an agreement among the defendants . "
( This key principle is important to prevent the courts from supporting mere " fishing expeditions . " )
The case returns to the trial court , where it has been stalled since October 2008 .
I want to love Avatar , I really do .
Almost everything that Director James Cameron has touted about the film over the past few years is absolutely true .
The film absolutely breaks new ground visually with the best use of 3D I ’ve seen in a narrative film ( the best use of 3D overall I still think is U23D ) .
Visually it is simply stunning .
The world of Avatar is one of visual delights which rivals almost any film I ’ve seen .
The character animation is as close to human as I ’ve ever seen .
No films have had CGI characters and creatures which feel so alive .
For the most part , Avatar is wonderfully acted .
Sam Worthington is superb as Jake Sully , crippled Marine set free through the use of an avatar .
Zoe Slanda is also fantastic in the lead female role , Neytiri , a Na’vi trying to protect her homeland from the invading humans .
Even CCH
Pounder puts in a stand out performance in a supporting role .
Unfortunately Avatar is n’t everything that it could be , or even should be .
Side by side strong performances are some ridiculously bad ones .
Giovanni Ribisi is laughably bad as a corporate boss focused on acquiring “ unobtainium ” from the land beneath the Na’vi .
Stephen Lang is straight out from a bad Steven Segal or Jean Claude Van Damm movie as a Marine who will hit his objective at all costs .
Also , I ’m sad to report the actual Avatar script is extraordinarily predictable and uneven .
Plot turns are so ridiculously linear and easily anticipated that there rarely is any sense of surprise in the story .
Some of the dialogue is also extremely bad , laughably so ( expect them to become rampantly overused as Twitter updates and Facebook statuses for months to come ) .
But with all its faults , Avatar is n’t a bad movie .
Aside from the pure visual spectacle , there are some genuinely magical moments .
In it ’s 2 1/ 2 hour running time there are definite sections which pull you in and help make you forget the films many faults .
And yet , Avatar fails at becoming a great film .
James Cameron clearly has all the tools to create legendary cinema , and yet he fails here , relying on a bad script and some poor actors who knock his film out of contention for being truly great .
This of course leaves us with the essential question : should you go see Avatar ?
Even given all its faults and imperfections I ’m recommending that , yes , you go see this film .
Avatar is worth the price of admission for the visual spectacle alone , and it does deliver an extraordinary experience .
But I ’d strongly advise going into it with the understanding that it is a very imperfect film , that it has some really significant faults , and to be truly enjoyed those faults need to be ignored or forgiven .
Avatar is an exciting piece of cinema , its technological achievement will surely have a major impact on films that follow it .
It also is the ‘ killer app ’ for 3D movies and is probably the film which will be credited with keeping 3D around and not letting pass as a fad .
It ’s just a shame that it could n’t have been a great film .
If you ’re going to see Avatar in Portland , I HIGHLY recommend you see it in 3D at The Roseway Theater .
The Roseway is the best movie theater experience in Portland with the best digital projection and sound and it would be an absolute shame to see this movie any other way .
The Roseway Theater is Located at 7229 SE Sandy Blvd .
Avatar has a midnight showing on Friday December 18th and then runs 12:00 3:30 7:00 10:30 .
You can also follow the Roseway on twitter at @rosewaytheater for updated showtimes and more .
For all the criticism about massive U.S. stimulus spending ' not working ' , and warnings of an imminent economic downturn once stimulus is removed , here 's a simple rebuttal -- most of the administration 's stimulus spending has n't even hit the economy yet .
Thus it 's absurdly premature to judge its impact or fear its withdrawal .
As shown by the pie chart below , only 1/3 of the U.S. recovery stimulus from the The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has been used so far .
The amount spent and amounting from tax cuts is only 35 % , in blue below , according to stimulus watchdog Propublica .
Almost 2/3 of the stimulus is still on the way , as shown below in shades of red .
The stimulus was n't meant to be entirely spent in 2009 , but rather over the course of multiple years .
Thus it is completely disingenuous to decry the total stimulus cost in relation to the current economic rebound -- since this stimulus program has just begun .
Wait to see it actually hit .
For investors , this means that the U.S. economy wo n't be forced off of life support any time soon .
Stimulus is far from surefire , but the wind will remain behind your back in 2010 .
Note the stimulus even includes massive amounts of tax cuts for those who think markets know better than government in these matters :

What we do know is that one evening , the principal agent and his boyhood pal , now his betrayer , had dinner at a shabby seaside restaurant ; that they sat at the same table they had occupied the night before ; that a group of four men in a car drove slowly around the block twice ; that two of the men entered the restaurant and strolled over in front of the principal agent ’s table ; that each then emptied his pistol into the agent ’s chest .


In the wake of President Obama ’s speech on intelligence last week , there is much soul - searching going on , at C.I.A. headquarters in Langley and elsewhere , about what happened in Khost on Dec. 30 .
We are told that a Jordanian - born informant betrayed his spymasters and ignited a suicide bomb at a military base , killing those seven C.I.A. employees and wounding at least six more in the greatest blow to American intelligence in two decades .
It comes as a cold slap in the face , but one that implicates us all .
For these men and women , like the uniformed troops they serve alongside , have assumed great risks , and they have assumed them to keep the rest of us safe at home .
As the wildly divergent news accounts attest , none of us on the outside knows what really happened .
But this has n’t stopped the armchair geniuses who dispense grave platitudes on the enormity of the mistakes made , or the “ former officials ” who preen for reporters , spouting revelations regarding international intelligence relationships that , if true , are best not spoken of at all .
There may well have been some element of human error or incaution .
Young operatives might have allowed their desire to strike a blow against America ’s enemies to override their professional caution .
( As perhaps I did myself so many years ago . )
Or , perhaps , having weighed the risks and gains of the alternatives , the officers simply came up short .
In the wilderness of mirrors that defines human intelligence in counterterrorism , the threat of disaster is an inescapable presence .
But for the grace of God , my colleagues and I could have come up similarly short on any number of occasions in Pakistan and Afghanistan during the run-up to 9/11 and the resulting American - led invasion .
Brave young men and women met in wild and obscure places with dubious characters ; had they not done so , we would not have had the human information network that was vital in routing Al Qaeda and the Taliban so quickly in 2001 .
Some flew on helicopters deep into Taliban - controlled areas to meet with tribal leaders whom we felt we could trust , but whose followers might have had the means and motivation to murder my colleagues .
We fully expected to lose many of our people in those days .
That our losses were light in the end was a testament to their courage , their professionalism and , yes , their luck .
The importance of the human intelligence work done by officers like those we lost at Khost is only increasing over time .
The growing sophistication of our enemies , as they react to the grievous losses they have suffered , makes us all the more reliant on human spies .
To outsiders , the counterterrorism struggle along the Pakistani - Afghan border can seem antiseptic  a war of drones , of terrorists who simply disappear in a puff of smoke .
But make no mistake : the intelligence - led struggle fought in our name is , at its core , every bit as gritty and as visceral as conventional combat .
But in this war , you come to know your enemies as well as your friends , and the battlefield encompasses the full scope of human character .
Franklin Lamb , Beirut
Lebanon reacts : “ Would it be simpler just to put the whole world on ? ”
However President Obama is judged on various subjects for his first year in office , he has already made history in the way that neither his predecessor nor any other leader has ever managed .
On January 3 , 2010 , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) issued new security directives to all United States and international air carriers with inbound flights to the U.S. effective January 4 , 2010 .
The TSA press release sought to assure the traveling public : " The new directive includes long - term sustainable security measures developed in consultation with law enforcement officials and our domestic and international partners . "
At midnight Washington DC time , January 3 , it went into effect and placed 675,000,000 ( 675 million ) more Muslims and Arabs on yet another ‘ Terrorism ‘ list .
Also added were Nigerian and Cuban Christians but they were not the target .
675 million is the approximate total number of people on the new list from the ten “ prone to terrorism Countries ” as the Washington Post called them this morning , or “ terrorist leaning countries “ according to Fox news , ( Sudan , Afghanistan , Algeria , Iraq , Lebanon , Libya , Nigeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Somalia and Yemen ) and the four current ” State sponsors of Terrorism ” ( Iran , Syria , Libya and Cuba ) .
All 675 million of these citizens are subject to being watched , patted down , and full body scanned under arrangements calling for ‘ intense screening ’ by the national airlines who would like to transport them to the US .
As with the new H. R. 2278 Congressional initiative against satellite TV providers , the airlines flying from or via the 14 countries will have to enforce the new stringent security measures or themselves risk losing their lucrative US bi-lateral landing rights and potentially , end up on yet another US Special Global Terrorism facilitator list .
In addition to the approximate 675 million covered by the new measure , with the average birth rate of these countries being approximately 45 live births per 1000 per year , it means that more than 17,000,000 newborns will join the new US T list even before their first gulp of their mommy ’s milk .
And every subsequent years worth of new ‘ T babies ’ .
The new list initiative is enough to warm Dick Cheney ’s heart , reputed as he is to have never seen an Muslim or Arab ( except those he does business with ) he did n’t want terrorized by a listing or other means , but the international rebellion against this latest US War on Terrorism initiative has begun .
As this report is being prepared , Nigeria has just weighed via media reports reaching Beirut around noon on 1/5/09 and its government has demanded that their 150,000,000 ( 150 million ) citizens be immediately scratched from the new T list of 14 countries singled out for special treatment .
Nigeria Information Minister Dora Akunyili announced today that ” Nigeria , Africa 's most populous nation , did not accept the new Terrorism list and we do not have a history of terrorism and such a move could not be justified .
It is unfair to include 150 million Nigerians on the US list for tighter screening because Nigerians do not have terrorist tendencies .
It ’s no secret these days that anyone who even looks like they could be Arab or Muslim is already on a ‘ mental US Terrorism watch list ’ evidenced by reports of some passengers deciding not to board flights after observing Hijab wearing females or Abaya wearing Muslin or Arab men looking at them .
What often happens according to airport security officials is that non Muslims sometimes stare at Muslims trying to detect something unusal or suspicious about them and then the Muslims stare back wondering why they are being stared at and both parties become paranoid .
The Lebanese , bless them all , ever alert to foreign intrigues , and were among the first objecting to being placed on the new US T list .
On Sunday night ’s ( 1/3/09 ) late and wild van ride back to Beirut from Beital in the now frigid and frequently bitterly cold and windblown , Bekaa Valley of Lebanon , this observer got an ear full .
Our driver , by appearance , down to the “ Akek ” ( Amber ) ring on his little finger , neatly trimmed short beard , black wool jacket and black baseball cap , was a Hezbollah guy .
Fellow passengers were accepting as “ Abass ” treated us to his new CD of Resistance music , ( again and again ! ) , including the popular songs “ Haydar , Hayder ” and “ Oh Hussein ! ” , and the catchy “ Ali , Ali ! ” ( Ali was the cousin and son in law of the Prophet Mohammad who Shia Muslims believe should have been the first Khalifa ( successor ) of the Prophet rather than Abu Bakr and his line including Omar ( the second Khalifa ) and Othman ( the third Khalifa ) .
In important respects , from this succession argument grew the Shia - Sunni conflict now deeply splitting Islam .
On the van , it was a party atmosphere among the fifteen or so passengers most of whom were returning from week - end visits to their families with Bekaa toting delicacies of one kind or another .
Van users , including this one , prefer Hezbollah drivers on the Beirut - Bekaa run because they know every pot hole on the route over the West Lebanon Mountains , do n’t try to overcharge riders , are unfailingly polite to the elderly and infirm - assisting them on and off the vans , and perhaps most importantly , these guys drive like bats fleeing hell , which cuts travel time by about one - third .
But those probably most grateful for riding with drivers like ‘ Abass ’ are those whose documents might not be quite in order or they just might be carrying contraband of some sort .
For them our driver was golden because drivers like him are routinely waived thru various check points en route once their affiliation is noticed .
One ca n’t help wondering what would happen if a US ‘ profiling ’ system was in place and a van was pulled over by a Pennsylvania State trooper named Lawrence and his flashing red light , for ID and luggage inspection or just to sniff inside the vehicles quickly rolled down windows .
Would the van still have passengers traveling to Beirut or would he ask to share a smoke ?
The friendly young man sitting next to me opened a carry on case and while not wanting to appear snoopy , one could not help noticing that it was packed with filled honey comb and softball sized clumps of Red - bud Hashish ( known locally by Western clients as ‘ H & H’ , with sometimes the prized honey fetching more than the Red - bud ) two ancient Bekaa products .
Appreciated from before Roman times each harvest achieved bumper crops this year .
The near record yield was recorded despite a couple of DEA funded ‘ photo op ’ anti-drug ‘ raids ’ last summer that the locals laugh at .
The chatty kid told me lots of couriers make at least twice weekly Baalbek trips .
One Baalbek young lady , a member of the large Jaafar clan ( which producers some of Hezbollah ’s best fighters ) , studying Journalism at Beirut ’s American Lebanese University ( LAU ) , commented to this observer after our driver took a music break to tune in the news , “ Oh , your country just added 14 more Muslim countries to another airplane Terrorism list .
Mabrouk ! ”
This opened an animated discussion of the ways things are going these days between the Obama administration whose sweet words last spring have become the source for scowls and ridicule in Lebanon due to deep disappointment and , once more dashed hope of America becoming an honest broker in the region -- and of course , the various US Terrorism lists .
A teen ager from the back of the van sing - songed “ Would n’t it be easier just for you Americans to put the whole world on your terrorism list and then let everyone on the planet convince you they should be taken off ? ”
And another smart alec grinned : “ Or you could just stop giving Israel weapons to kill and terrorize us and then there would be no need for any terrorist lists at all ? “ Within two seconds , not more , an old woman who must have been in her 80’s , wrapped in an Ashoura black covering , and who appeared to be sound asleep , lifted her head and shouted “ Enshallah !
( God willing ! ) and returned her head forward to slumber .
With that sage intervention the van erupted and shook in laughter .
The strongest reaction came from ‘ Mustapha ’ who appeared to be some sort of Salafist recently arrived from the gulf .
Claiming to have friends in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , he expressed a strong opinion and with anger in his voice :
“ Does your government think Muslims with self respect and who value the Koran will allow his family especially his wife and his daughters to be body scanned ?
He would rather die .
This will not happen .
One phone call and your Embassy in Lebanon will close faster than the one in Yemen .
I think sometimes that you Americans have no idea about these latest aggressions against Muslims ?
Are you out of your minds ?
We are a peaceful people with a few extremists doing some crasy things but only in response to crimes against us like in Palestine .
Stop provoking us and leave us and our lands ! ”
Will frequent flyers start to Glow ?
As Mustapha expressed , Muslims and Arabs find the full - body scanner treatment abhorrent and they will likely oppose in strongly .
In this they are not alone with many questions being raised from cost ( approximately $ 200,000 each or 10 more expensive that the usual metal detectors ) to questions whether such devices would have even detected the type of bomb allegedly used on Christmas Day in Detroit .
While the Israel Defense Industries has announced a crash program to build and distribute quickly a cheaper and improved full body scanner ( FBS ) version , the stock of American Science & Engineering , a US company that makes the full body scanners skyrocketed after Christmas and hit $ 82 dollars per share on 1/4/09 , up from around $ 42 this summer .
UK companies like L - 3 Communications and Qinetiq hope to fend off competitors in landing quick orders .
Qinetiq announced yesterday that it can perfect a “ stand - off ” full body scanner to reduce privacy issues .
Former Bush Homeland Security director , Michael Chertoff admitted to NPR the other day that he is in the hunt for contracts for his new consulting firm , while denying that his advocacy of fbs when he held his post is a conflict of interest .
Janes
Weekly claims the fbs are here to stay .
There are many critics of FBS including claims that it tends to fry hearing aids , and sends massive doses of ionizing x-rays radiations to the thyroid and breast areas .
Others insist dogs are more effective and much cheaper .
Dr. John Gofman , Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , a leading U.S. expert on the biological effects of X - radiation has concluded after exhaustive research that there is NO SAFE DOSE - LEVEL of ionizing radiation .
His studies indicate that radiation from medical diagnostics and treatment is a causal co-factor in 50 percent of America ’s cancers and 60 percent of our ischemic ( blood flow blockage ) heart disease .
He stresses that the frequency with which Americans are medically X - rayed “ makes for a significant radiological impact . ”
Privacy Issues
The rapid introduction of full body scanners at British airports threatens to breach child protection laws which ban the creation of indecent images of children .
Terri Dowty , of Action for Rights of Children , in London claims that the scanners could breach the Protection of Children Act 1978 , under which it is illegal to create an indecent image or a " pseudo - image " of a child .
The ACLU and similar civil liberty organizations in England and Europe are waging a campaign against fbs on privacy grounds some arguing that the images created by the machines are so graphic they amount to " virtual strip - searching " and have called for safeguards to protect the privacy of passengers involved .
US and European Child porn laws are applicable in the view of some lawyers and there is growing concern that TSA type at airports around the World do not commit offences under child pornography laws or sell to the likes of the National Enquirer , the UK Sun , NY Post etc. full body scan images of celebrities , movie stars and others .
Some governments are expressing concern that images could end up on the Internet .
A 12 - month trial at Manchester , England airport of scanners revealed naked images of passengers including their genitalia and breast enlargements only went ahead last month after under - 18s were exempted .
According to a US Congressional source , the Obama administration ’s new list is meant to parry the coming expected rampage from the likes of Russ Limbaugh .
Already some conservatives such as retired Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney who wants to get young Muslim men naked in the worst way .
The former US Air Force general 's comments during a recent Fox News broadcast .
" We 've got to go to more than just the normal process that they 're talking about now , " he opined on Saturday .
" We have got to go to very ; very strict screening and we 've got to use profiling .
And I mean , be very , very serious about the profiling .
If you are an 18 - 28 - year - old Muslim man , then you should be strip searched .
If we do n't do that , there 's a very high probability that we 're gonna lose an airliner . "
The Obama administration has expressed for months an interest in revamping the Terrorism lists and who is on them who should not be .
Now is the time to rethink the whole T list concept .
They can boomerang and cause many more problems than they were constructed to prevent .
The Obama administration should proceed on a case by case basic with people suspected of planning violence .
It should immediately scrap the latest 675 , 000,000 + Mega Special Global Terrorism
List and try good works rather than threats and serial humiliations to build trust and friendship among Muslims and Arabs who are identical to ourselves in what they are working to accomplish in life for their loved ones .

The nomination failed to clear the 60 - vote threshold needed in the Senate to beat back a Republican filibuster .
Two Democrats , Sens. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska joined Republicans in blocking the nominee .
The labor movement had hoped that Becker ’s inclusion on the NLRB would help bring the nation ’s most important labor relations board closer to what it sees as that board ’s main purpose : protection of the collective bargaining rights of American workers .
In recent years , particularly during the period when the Bush administration appointed the majority of the board ’s members , the NLRB , labor says , moved away from its core mission and too often sided with employers against workers .
Analysts say the vote on Becker indicates that nothing friendly to organized labor can get through current Senate rules if Republicans act in unison .
There were 57 votes in favor of Becker ’s nomination , three short of the 60 needed , a total that would not have been reached even if the two Democratic senators had not defected .
Democratic senators are saying they will now explore rules changes to end the Republican obstruction .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy , D - Vt. , expressed frustration and anger after the vote yesterday .
“ I ’m in my thirty - sixth year .
I ’ve never seen anything like it , ” he declared , noting that no previous Republican Senate leader would have allowed his party to filibuster such a “ routine ” nomination .
Leahy said that the overuse of filibusters by the GOP was causing Democrats to examine ways of changing the rules .
“ The abuse of the filibuster is unsustainable , ” declared Michigan ’s Democratic Senator , Carl Levin .
“ I think it will either fall of its own weight or it will fall after some massive conflict on the floor .
The filibuster should be restricted to major issues . ”
With the election of Republican Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts recently at least one Republican vote will be needed to break any filibuster .

( CNN ) -- Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , the man charged with trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane on December 25 , pleaded not guilty Friday to six federal charges .
Asked by Magistrate Judge Mark Randon whether he was taking any medication , he replied that he was taking painkillers but that he understood the six charges he faced .
His lawyer , chief federal defender Miriam L. Siefer , entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf .
Throught the hearing , which lasted less than 10 minutes , security was tight .
At least three dogs were inside the courtroom , and security guards were stationed at the doors .
Members of the media had to wait in line outside the courtroom until 9 a.m. before passes were distributed allowing them entry .
Anyone who wanted to leave the courtroom had to ask a security guard for an access card and then display it before being allowed to re-enter .
The court hearing came a day after President Obama released a report on the incident that said officials had " sufficient information " to have foiled the failed attack that but a variety of errors kept investigators from uncovering the plot .
AbdulMutallab faces a federal indictment issued Wednesday , including an attempt to murder the other 289 people aboard .
The seven - page indictment charges AbdulMutallab with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction ; attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ; willful attempt to destroy and wreck an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ; willfully placing a destructive device in , upon and in proximity to an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States ; and two counts of possession of a firearm / destructive in furtherance of a crime of violence .

If convicted , the 23 - year - old Nigerian national faces a sentence of life in prison .
Wearing a white T - shirt , too - long khaki pants that were rolled up several times at the ankles and blue sneakers , AbdulMutallab national walked slowly into the federal courtroom , ankles shackled and in apparent pain after having suffered second - and third - degree burns in the flight .
Among Friday 's courthouse audience was Hebbe Aref , who witnessed the event from six rows ahead as a passenger on the same flight .
" When I saw him on the plane , he was very blank .
He did n't move .
He did n't struggle , " Aref said .
" He spoke in court today ; he did n't say anything on the plane . "
Asked how seeing him again affected her , she said , " I felt something sort of in my stomach and in my heart .
It a little bit brought back the feeling that I felt on the 25th . "
Asked why she had attended the courtroom appearance , the hijab - wearing lawyer said , " I 've been to proceedings before , and I just wanted to see one that affected me personally and affected the country .
It 's a big event . "
The indictment said AbdulMutallab boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam , Netherlands , on December 25 , carrying a bomb concealed in his clothing and designed to be detonated " at a time of his choosing . "
Authorities say the bomb components included Pentaerythritol ( also known as PETN , a high explosive ) , as well as Triacetone Triperoxide ( also known as TATP , a high explosive ) and other ingredients .
The indictment said that , just before the jet landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Michigan , " AbdulMutallab detonated the bomb , causing a fire on board flight 253 . "
The device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at the man 's seat .
He was subdued and restrained by the passengers and flight crew .
The airplane landed shortly thereafter , and he was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers .
CNN 's Deb Feyerick and LaNeice Collins contributed to this story from Detroit .
The eight - seat recreational airplane , a single - engine Gippsland Airvan , is cruising peacefully over southern Maryland on a hazy June afternoon , pilot and passengers enjoying the view from 4,000 feet , where the Nanticoke River runs into the swamplands at the edge of the Chesapeake Bay .
Suddenly — whoosh !
A trademark shape most of us encounter only in the movies or at airshows darts underneath the 100 - knot pleasure craft , then carves a semi-circle in the sky in front of it .
A voice crackles in the pilot ’s headset : “ This is a United States Air Force armed F - 16 .
You are in violation of restricted airspace .
Do you require any assistance ? ”
No response from the Airvan .
A minute or two later , the fighter is back , aiming for a more dramatic impression .
It executes the “ head butt , ” soaring up vertically within 500 feet of the intruder ’s nose .
The voice in the earphones sounds less helpful this time : “ This is a United States Air Force armed F - 16 .
You have been intercepted .
Please acknowledge or rock your wings . ”
The jet and an unseen wingman have scrambled from Andrews Air Force Base , just east of Washington , D.C.
But their controllers sit 400 miles north , outside the faded Erie Canal town of Rome , New York , amid a forest of glowing monitors at the headquarters of the Eastern Air Defense Sector ( EADS ) .
Yellow blips track every aircraft aloft east of the Missis­sippi River , several thousand on a typical weekday afternoon like this .
A general aviation airplane without a flight plan , chugging into restricted airspace , does not take long to stick out from the herd .
If the Airvan continues to ignore the fighters in its face , EADS will pass an alert up a chain of command , where unspecified persons will have to decide what to do about it , perhaps within minutes , if the off - course pilot swings west toward the nation ’s capital .
This particular interception turns out to be a dress rehearsal .
The Airvan ’s pilot and copilot are Bill Parris and Michael Regen , two Civil Air Patrol volunteers on a day off from their real jobs , as radio station owner and restaurant supply wholesaler .
The routine is choreographed in advance with the Andrews top guns .
“ Nice work , braves , ” Parris compliments the F - 16 pilots as the passenger airplane peels off toward its home hangar , at Martin State Airport near Baltimore .
This was practice , but the real thing happens often enough .
One of the few detailed studies on the subject , a 2005 Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report , found 3,400 violations of restricted airspace , or about three a day , in the 39 months following the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which rewrote the rules of U.S. aviation .
About 88 percent of the offenders were general aviation pilots , and seven percent were military .
The most common reasons for infractions were pilots altering flight plans to avoid bad weather , or not keeping up to date on the shifts and expansions of the government ’s no -fly zones .
The zones can change with little warning , as when the president travels .
Nearly half the violations — 43 percent — tallied by the GAO were in the Washington , D.C. area .
Most violators , of course , respond to a radio warning from Federal Aviation Administration controllers , and if not to that , then to the bright red and green lights used to flood the cockpit of intruders in the vicinity of Washington , and if not that , then to the Coast Guard Dolphin helicopters that sometimes precede the jet fighters .
All the same , military aircraft have engaged interlopers “ hundreds of times ” over American skies since 9/11 , says Davi D’Agostino , the GAO ’s director of Defense Capabilities and Management .
And defenders cite at least three cases last year alone when they feared they would be ordered to apply the ultimate sanction : annihilating a general aviation aircraft to stop it from committing a presumed terrorist act .
On April 6 , 2009 , what turned out to be a mentally disturbed young Canadian pilot entered U.S. airspace over Lake Superior without warning , and led Air National Guard F - 16s on a five - hour chase over four states before finally landing on a country road in Missouri .
Minnesota Air National Guard pilots were the first to intercept the Cessna 172 near Michigan ’s Upper Peninsula .
National Guard units from Wisconsin and Louisiana took over as the pilot continued south without responding to the military jets .
Failing to raise the off - course Cessna 172 on the radio , the F - 16s tried to get the pilot ’s attention : firing flares in front of the renegade aircraft and flashing their landing lights .
When the Cessna came within five miles of downtown Madison , the governor , on the recommendation of the Wisconsin homeland security advisor , ordered the state capitol building evacuated .
The Missouri state troopers who arrested Adam Leon reported he was trying to commit suicide .
“ If he had turned toward Chicago , he would have gotten his wish , ” says Gary Miller of the Federal Aviation Administration ’s Office of Tactical Operations Security , who monitored the slow chase .
“ That ’s the closest we ’ve ever come to shooting down somebody on my watch . ”
Just 18 days later , Maine retiree William Wales , flying down to see his daughter in North Carolina , strayed over Washington , D.C. ’s restricted zone .
Though repeatedly hailed on emergency frequencies by F - 16s , he failed to respond , prompting a lock - down at the White House , preparations to evacuate the Capitol , and frayed nerves at EADS , whose staff flagged the incident to the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) in Colorado and braced for an order to fire .
“ Everything looked to be going against this man for a while , ” says Air Force Master Sergeant Michael Roberts , who was directing the interceptors from his chair in Rome that day .
Wales finally saved himself when a Coast Guard helicopter flew by with a light board , a sort of neon sign , ordering him to call a certain radio frequency .
He did , and was escorted to an airstrip out of harm ’s way .
Last September , NORAD sent F - 16s after a Mooney M20 M that lost contact with controllers over Michigan and subsequently crashed near Muncie , Indiana .
Military officials reported that the hobby pilot was apparently unconscious in his cockpit .
He died in the crash .
OTTAWA - The federal Conservative government cannot be forced to ask the United States to return Omar Khadr to Canada , even though the young Khadr ’s Charter rights were violated in Guantanamo Bay , the Supreme Court of Canada declared today .
In a unanimous 24 - page ruling by the country ’s nine top judges , the court tried to craft a narrow judgment that would grant some relief to Khadr ’s advocates .
It issued a “ declaration ” that stated clearly the actions of Canadian officials contributed to the continued detention of a young person who had no access to legal counsel , was subjected to “ improper treatment ” through sleep deprivation , likely aided his upcoming criminal prosecution , and violated principles of fundamental justice .
But in reality , the ruling comes as a disappointment to those who argued the federal government must ask U.S. President Barack Obama to repatriate the Toronto - born native .
That ’s because the high court said that while the actions of the executive – the Harper government – are “ not exempt from constitutional scrutiny , ” it would not be “ appropriate for the court to give direction as to the diplomatic steps necessary to address the breaches of Mr. Khadr ’s Charter rights . ”
The court essentially deferred to the prime minister and his cabinet ’s political choices .
Grounded in an attempt to be respectful of the separation of powers , the decision essentially allows the government to stick to its position .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has consistently refused to request the Americans repatriate Khadr , and argues the U.S. military justice system must be allowed to take its course .
In a written statement , Justice Minister Rob Nicholson suggested the court vindicated the government ’s view .
“ The Government is pleased that the Supreme Court has recognized the ‘ constitutional responsibility of the executive to make decisions on matters of foreign affairs in the context of complex and ever - changing circumstances , taking into account Canada 's broader interests , ” said Nicholson .
Nicholson said the judgment “ overturned two previous lower court decisions and ruled that the Government is not required to ask for accused terrorist Omar Khadr ’s return to Canada . ”
He repeated the longstanding Harper government line : “ Omar Khadr faces very serious charges including murder , attempted murder , conspiracy , material support for terrorism , and spying . ”
But Nicholson added “ the Government will carefully review the Supreme Court 's ruling and determine what further action is required . ”
“ Naturally we ’re disappointed but not surprised , ” said lawyer Nathan Whitling , one of Khadr ’s Canadian legal team .
“ It was always a long shot given that there had never been an order of this nature ever granted . ”
Whitling said the fact that the court issued a declaration – despite the fact that it is a remedy nobody asked for – “ should have ” some moral , legal or political sway on the Harper government , but he was not holding out hope .
“ We ’re realists .
Realistically I do n’t think it ’s going to have an effect on this government ’s behaviour …practically speaking , I do n’t think Prime Minister Stephen Harper is going to change his mind given the degree to which he has dug in on this issue . ”
While Khadr may pick up some rumour of the decision in Guantanamo , he is completely cut off from the world and even his lawyers have to go through several hoops to arrange a phone call .
That can take weeks to set up , Whitling said , so it is unlikely they will be able to brief Khadr on the court ’s conclusions until the next time they travel there .
In any event , they had already prepared him not to expect victory , Whitling said .
“ You ’d have to classify this as a decision in which they ducked their responsibility to interpret the Charter to protect a Canadian detained abroad , ” said New Democrat critic Joe Comartin in an interview .
“ It ’s disappointing in a sense , ” conceded Alex Neve , of Amnesty International , who said the court was “ reluctant to go that final step ” to grant Khadr the remedy of a repatriation order , even though it said it would address the rights breach .
But Neve said the court ’s finding of a Charter violation is a powerful statement from the highest court in the land that the government cannot now ignore .
“ Canada has been complicit in serious human rights violations of a Canadian citizen .
It is not open to the Canadian government to just yawn and not take that seriously now .
There has to be an effective response . ”
Sukanya Pillay of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the ruling “ was not a setback . ”
“ It ’s a victory for human rights in the sense that the court has found that there is a clear breach of section 7 of the Charter , and that Canadian officials had violated their international human rights law obligations . ”
“ They ’ve thrown the ball back into the government ’s court but with clearer rules . ”

The ruling , which was not authored by a single judge and signed only by “ The Court , ” did not deal with the question of whether the government has a “ duty to protect ” a Canadian citizen detained abroad .
As for Khadr ’s plight , the court noted the military commission system was found by the U.S. Supreme Court to be an “ illegal regime ” at one point during the seven years that it detained the young Khadr .
That regime has been revamped , but still allows evidence obtained through “ oppressive circumstances . ”
The Canadian high court concluded that Canadian officials contributed to depriving Khadr of fundamental justice when CSIS and Foreign Affairs agents interrogated him in Guantanamo in 2003 and 2004 and passed on information to his U.S. prosecutors .
“ Interrogation of a youth , to elicit statements about the most serious criminal charges while detained in these conditions and without access to counsel , and while knowing that the fruits of the interrogations would be shared with the U.S. prosecutors , offends the most basic Canadian standards about the treatment of detained youth suspects , ” the court said .
Nevertheless , the high court found the lower courts went too far in ordering the government to request Khadr ’s repatriation , saying it “ gives too little weight to the constitutional responsibility of the executive to make decisions on matters of foreign affairs in the context of complex and every - changing circumstances , taking into account Canada ’s broader national interests . ”
It also said it is “ unclear ” whether a proposed repatriation order would be accepted by the U.S .
And it said “ the impact on Canadian foreign relations of a repatriation request cannot be properly assessed by the court . ”
“ We do not know what negotiations may have taken place , or will take place , between the U.S. and Canadian governments over the fate of Mr. Khadr . ”
Instead , the court said it would take “ the prudent course ” of merely declaring that Khadr ’s constitutional rights have been violated , and leave it to the federal government to act .
Khadr , now 23 , was just 15 when first captured in Afghanistan after a 2002 gunfight and is charged with tossing the grenade that killed a U.S. special forces soldier , Christopher Speer .
His lawyers argue Khadr was a child soldier badly injured at the time , “ tortured ” since then , who can not be held responsible .
He faces trial by military commission in July for murder and other charges .
His legal team wants Khadr returned to Canada where they say he should be released under a strict supervision and rehabilitation plan .
Khadr is a member of a notorious family whose father , Ahmed Said Khadr , was an Osama bin Laden supporter and later killed by Pakistani forces .

Today is sad day for Netflix customers .
The online video rental supplier has just announced an agreement with Warner Bros. that will forever alter your online rental experience .
Now should you wish to rent a Warner Bros.
flick you 'll have to wait out a 28 - day holding period after the film 's initial DVD release date .
Of course the partnership rooted in money - making greed — Warner Bros. wants you to buy the DVD instead of rent it — was to be expected .
But the new deal is a first of its kind , and we could soon see several other studios follow in Warner Bros. footsteps .
Both companies would like you to know that the deal also guarantees that Warner Bros. will add more direct - to - video and streaming titles to the Netflix collection .
It 's the end of an era and the end of the new release rental as we know it .
While we mourn the loss of new release rental freedom , we 'd like to point out that RedBox is every bit the rebel , and the enemy of the entertainment industry .
So if you can stomach getting off the couch , hit up one of their kiosks and you 're still likely to find Warner Bros .
new releases for rent on the cheap .

TORONTO — Canada 's top court has ruled in favor of Wal - Mart Stores Inc. 's Canadian unit regarding the closure of a unionized store in Quebec four years ago .
The Supreme Court of Canada , which heard the case in January , voted 6 - 3 for Wal - Mart Canada .

Hotel Says They Have Already Fired Valet CompanyDec. 15 , 2009 ( KTVI - FOX2 ) ST. LOUIS , MO ( KTVI -FOX2now.com ) -
The video is being called appalling and unreal .
It shows a valet at the Hyatt Hotel in downtown St. Louis doing donuts , peeling out , burning out , revving engines and spinning tires in expensive cars , without the owners ever knowing it .
Kyle O'Brien did n't know anything had happened to his 2004 Dodge until he saw his car being abused on FOX 2 Tuesday night , " I 'm not freaking out about it , but it is n't that funny , " says OBrien .
" I would just think a valet service at a nice hotel would have to have more responsibility .
" Someone calling himself " valet underground " posted dozens of videos on YouTube , showing fancy cars being driven to the extreme in a parking garage about six months to a year ago .
The general manager of the Hyatt hotel downtown , formerly the Adams Mark , which sits in the shadow of the Gateway Arch , confirms it happened in his garage .
Tire marks are still visible on the pavement .
He says the Hyatt fired this valet company , which has been identified as AAA Valet , from Atlanta , Gerogia , before he even knew of the video .
He says the hotel replaced them with a St. Louis based valet company , and once he saw the video , he called AAA Valet to alert them to their employees ' conduct .
FOX 2 left messages for AAA Valet at the home office in Atlanta , but it was after regular business hours and no one returned the call .
O'Brien says he stayed at the Hyatt for one night about eight months ago .
He says when the valet brought him his car , he asked him if it was for sale .
O'Brien says he also thought it was strange when the valet commented on the nice tires he had .
Then when he got in the car to drive away , he noticed there was a problem , " It drove really funny , " O'Brien recalls .
" I had to replace the spark plugs and the distributor when I got home because they were not working any more .
" He says he was not suspicious that the valet had taken it on a joy ride .
" No , it 's nothing I would ever consider at all , " he says .
Tuesday night , the videos showing the parking garage antics were removed from YouTube .
When EA Sports community manager Alain Quinto tweeted back in December that EA execs were preparing to announce a new game , the rumors and speculation spiraled out of control .
Was EA going to steal the WWE license from THQ ?
Is " MVP Baseball " coming back ?
Is a new sport like lacrosse finally going to break through with an NCAA - licensed game ?
To make it simple , no , no and no .
EA plans to bring back the classic Midway game exclusively for the Wii .
Instead , sources confirmed to ESPN that the new title is actually one of the all - time classics coming back to consoles as EA Sports has acquired the rights from the NBA to deliver an updated version of " NBA Jam " that will ship to retail exclusively for the Wii .
For those too young to remember , " NBA Jam " is a two - on - two basketball game that hit arcades back in 1993 and instantly took the video game industry by storm .
The game ( originally published by Midway ) shattered all coin - op records , and still holds the mark for most money earned at a single location in one week .
" ' Jam ' was making so much money when it first came out .
There was so much four - player action at this one arcade in Chicago that the first week they had to shut the arcade down , because there was a huge fight over whose turn it was to play , " the game 's creator , Mark Turmell , told me last year for a piece in ESPN The Magazine .
" There was so much money coming in , they had to change the coin - box every day .
It was crazy . "
And that crazy four - player action is set to return big - time as sources claim that EA has not only hired Turmell to work on upcoming sports games ( would love to see him also bring back " NFL Blitz " ) , he 's already been brought to EA 's Vancouver studio to help consult on the new " Jam . "
Sources also claim that Turmell is n't the only old - school " Jam " vet being brought back into the mix , which makes me wonder if EA will also hire the voice of the original game , Tim Kitzrow , to once again unleash phrases like " Boomshackalacka ! " and " He 's on fire ! "
And considering that " Jam " was famous for including hidden characters like Bill Clinton and Will Smith , one has to wonder if EA is planning a hidden Obama character to deliver a presidential throwdown on King James .
" NBA Jam " first hit arcades in 1993 and soon became one of the industry 's most popular games .
Then again , even if there 's no president this time around , the prospects of who will be in this game are intriguing , to say the least .
Thinking back to the dominant teams in " Jam " history , dynamic duos like Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning , John Stockton and Karl Malone , Patrick Ewing and John Starks , and Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp ruled arcades and consoles for years .
Will Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol be this generation 's best squad ?
Or will a team of Shaq and LeBron make for an unbeatable one - two punch ( especially considering that Shaq was in the original arcade game way back when he was teaming with Scott Skiles ) .
I guess we wo n't know until EA Sports officially announces the game later this month .
Until then , I leave you with some of the secrets of " Jam's " past from my ESPN The Mag column , straight from the mouth of famed creator Mark Turmell :
The Limited Edition Team of Michael Jordan and Gary Payton
" Payton did n't make the cut to be in the [ first arcade ] game , and of course , Jordan pulled himself out of the licensing of the NBA , so we had to pull him out of the game , " explained Turmell .
" But one day , I got a phone call from a distributor out on the West Coast who told me that Gary Payton was willing to pay whatever it cost to get into the game .
So we told him what to do in terms of taking photographs , so he sent in photographs of himself and Jordan , saying , ' We want to be in the game , hook us up . '
So we actually did a special version of the game and gave both players all - star , superstar stats .
There are only a handful of these machines , but Jordan and Payton did end up being in one version of the game . "
The Pack - A - Shaq
" Shaq actually bought two machines , " said Turmell .
" He kept one at home and then , if you can believe this , they shipped the game with them on their road trips , setting up the machine in their hotel rooms as they traveled .
The players would play , then get someone to pack it up and ship it off to the next city . "
The Pippen Jinx
Did Scottie Pippen 's ratings really drop when he played certain teams or was I just the least clutch shooter every time I played Detroit ?
" It 's true , but only when the Bulls played the Pistons , " explained Turmell .
" If there was a close game and anyone on the Bulls took a last - second shot , we wrote special code in the game so that they would average out to be bricks .
There was the big competition back in the day between the Pistons and the Bulls , and since I was always a big Pistons fan , that was my opportunity to level the playing field . "
The One Where Drazen Petrovic Haunted the Studio
" We had already finished making ' NBA Jam ' when Drazen Petrovic died , " said Turmell .
" The game had already shipped and he was on the Nets .
So we had all of these coin - op machines around , and one night we were playing ' Mortal Kombat ' and there was a ' Jam ' machine next to it , and all of a sudden the game started calling out ' Petrovic !
Petrovic !'
And this only happened after Petrovic had died .
Everyone started freaking out .
Something weird was going on with the software , and to this day , if you have an original ' NBA Jam ' machine every once in a while it will just yell out ' Petrovic ! '
It 's wild . "
That 's right kids , it 's Mole Day Eve !
Remember to hang up your Moleskines by the chimney ( using Molex connectors of course ) .
And be sure to leave some guacamole for Santavagadro .
Oh , I can already hear the carolers singing ...

Verizon will release Google 's Nexus One Android device on March 23 according to sources familiar with the matter .
The Nexus One , originally released on T - Mobile in January , has passed FCC inspection for use on Verizon 's CDMA network and according to a Google worker who wishes to remain anonymous it will be made available on March 23 .
Verizon will introduce the Nexus One on the day the International CTIA wireless show begins in the US .
It 's not yet clear whether Verizon plan to hold a press conference at CTIA regarding the launch .
Pricing and tariffs are not yet known but our source said they would be " competitive . "
The Nexus One is available unlocked for a price of $ 529 currently .
Consumers can also order the phone through T - Mobile for $ 179 with a two year contract .
In related news the Nexus One is expected to be available in Europe from April on the Vodafone network .
Both the beer and the details herein .
The press release Deschutes Brewery sent out for Hop Henge Experimental IPA describes the beer as “ our annual exercise in IBU escalation , combining several new hop processes and techniques to create a unique and unexpected beer . ”
Notice that although Hop Henge checks in at 8.75 % and includes , according to the press release , 95 bitterness units that it is labeled neither Imperial nor Double .
But it is one big ass beer , and were it entered as an IPA in a competition would surely be kicked for its big-assedness .
Deschutes first brewed Hop Henge in 2006 , some years calling it an Imperial IPA , and jamming a boatload of hops into a beer is hardly new .
So what ’s this about experimental ?
I asked and lickety - split the answer arrived in an email from brewmaster Larry Sidor :
“ As always , hopping is an adventure with Deschutes Brewery .
We kicked off this year ’s Hop Henge Experimental
Ale by milling 1.0 pounds of Amarillo and Centennial hops per barrel in our grain mill .
Yes , you read that right , the hops went directly to the mill along with the grain !
So , we ended up with a green mash .
Never fear , lautering went fine with a high performance German lauter tun .
“ The next hop stop was at the Kettle .
We added Millennium , Herkules ( more German influence ) and Northern Brewer at just at 0.99 pounds per barrel .
The next wort hopping was in the hop back using Northern Brewer , Citra and Brewers Gold at 0.6 pounds per barrel .
“ Drum roll please , the final wort hopping was with Cascade and Amarillo in the whirlpool at 0.8 pounds per barrel .
“ Let ’s see , we ’re now up to 3.39 pounds per barrel just in the wort .
We ’re not stopping here .
“ So , off to the fermenter where we added Centennial , Cascade and Amarillo at 1.32 pounds per barrel .
These were hop pellets , very unDeschutes ! )
So next , we added 0.3 pounds per barrel of Citra in the bright beer tank .
I can finally relax and get those damn pellets out of my tank and back to leaf hops !
So after seven days on dry hops we called it good with a grand total of 5.01 pounds of hops added per barrel . ”
Blame the power of persuasion but it seems you can smell a blend of citrus fruits  grapefruit , clementines  northwest pine trees , pineapples , and on and on through the cap .
Really .
Besides they had me from the point when they milled the hops .
The Justice Department Says the Amended Google Book Settlement Is n't Good Enough
* Read or listen to this interview with Professor James Grimmelmann at the New York Law School if you do n't know what the hell is going on here *
The DOJ issued a filing today saying that while they appreciated the amendments that Google , the Author 's Guild , and the AAP made to the Google Book Settlement , the amendments have n't gone nearly far enough , meaning that it will be almost impossible for Judge Chin to approve this Settlement as it is .
Tactically , the DOJ waited until now to say this ( two weeks before the proposed fairness hearing on February 18th ) in order to squeeze the parties into making big concessions .
Maybe this will happen .
Maybe Google has a secret , emergency Settlement hidden away somewhere .
However , it is most likely impossible at this point for the parties in question to draft a new agreement in time that will make the DOJ happy .
Google had plenty of opportunities to make changes before this , mind you : they just decided ignore the DOJ 's concerns back in October , hoping these issues were mere bluster .
Evidently , the DOJ was n't bluffing about their antitrust issues with the Settlement , however .
From their press release " Although the United States believes the parties have approached this effort in good faith and the amended settlement agreement is more circumscribed in its sweep than the original proposed settlement , the amended settlement agreement suffers from the same core problem as the original agreement : it is an attempt to use the class action mechanism to implement forward - looking business arrangements that go far beyond the dispute before the court in this litigation . " " ... the amended settlement agreement still confers significant and possibly anticompetitive advantages on Google as a single entity , thereby enabling the company to be the only competitor in the digital marketplace with the rights to distribute and otherwise exploit a vast array of works in multiple formats .
"
" The department continues to believe that a properly structured settlement agreement in this case offers the potential for important societal benefits .
The department stated that it is committed to continuing to work with the parties and other stakeholders to help develop solutions through which copyright holders could allow for digital use of their works by Google and others , whether through legislative or market - based activities .
" This has all basically been the DOJ 's way of testing to see whether or not Google was really in it for the books , or were only in it for the greedy monopoly .
The DOJ gave them one last chance to change the anti-competitive elements in this Settlement -- preserving the spirit and still opening up orphan books for publication -- and Google refused , proving that the only way this Settlement is interesting to them is if they can leverage total control over special rights no one else will have .
So do n't blame the DOJ , Ursula Le Guin , Microsoft , Slashdot , or Brewster Kahle for the failure of the Google Book Settlement and the continuing curtain over orphan books .
Blame Google for their hubris and their attempt to capitalize on a serious problem that needs to be fixed : broken copyright legislation .
Do n't freak out too much .
Google can still do whatever they want with books whose rights they can legally acquire , which are plenty , man , plenty .
Radiation oncologist claims proof of the afterlife
January 25 , 2010 — Near - death experiences have long been a fascinating phenomenon , prompting more questions than answers .
According to a Gallup poll , between 8 to 12 million Americans — around five percent — say they have had a near - death experience .
Despite these substantial numbers , most scientists are at a loss to explain these events .
Dr. Jeffrey Long , a radiation oncologist , has spent the last twelve years studying over a thousand cases of near - death experience .
In his groundbreaking new book , EVIDENCE OF THE AFTERLIFE : The Science of Near - Death Experiences ( HarperOne , January 2010 , $ 25.99 ) , Dr. Long provides scientific evidence that powerfully supports what many have long suspected : near - death experiences provide proof that life continues after we die .
A nationally recognized expert who has been quoted in Newsweek , ABC News , and The Wall Street Journal , Dr. Long presents the largest scientific study of near - death experiences ever reported .
Through his work at the Near Death Experience Research Foundation ( NDERF ) , Dr. Long has gathered over 1,300 accounts of near - death experiences ( NDEs ) from all over the world — the largest database of its kind .
The people whose stories are captured in the this database span all age groups , races , and religious affiliations and come from all over the world , yet the similarities in their accounts are as awe - inspiring as they are revealing .
Dr. Long chronicles these firsthand stories in his book , and draws compelling evidence for life beyond death from them .
Many skeptics have argued that near death experiences are hallucinations brought on by illness , strong medications , or the stress of a dying brain .
Others have pointed out that near - death experiences could be the result of cultural conditioning : by now , they argue , everyone has heard of the key familiar elements ( out of body sensation , a bright light , a tunnel , etc ) .
But Dr. Long says the evidence from his study refutes all of these arguments .
He details nine lines of evidence , extensively corroborated by prior scholarly NDE research , that send “ a consistent message of the afterlife , ” including :
1 ) Children ’s experiences .
The near - death experiences of children , including very young children who are too young to have developed concepts of death , religion , or near - death experiences , are essentially identical to those of older children and adults .
This refutes the possibility that these near - death experiences are shaped by preexisting beliefs or cultural conditioning .
2) Worldwide consistency .
Near death experiences appear remarkably consistent around the world , and across many different religions and cultures .
NDEs from non-western countries are incredibly similar to those that occur in people in Western countries , again disproving that religious beliefs and cultural norms are responsible for creating these experiences .
3 ) Realistic — and accurate — out - of - body experiences Out - of - body experiences are one of the most common elements of near - death experiences .
Remarkably , what NDErs report seeing and hearing during these experiences of earthly events while they are unconscious or clinically dead is almost always realistic .
Over 60 people who had a near - death experience in Dr. Long ’s study later sought to confirm the accuracy of their out - of - body observations following their experience .
All of them confirmed the complete accuracy of their observations , including observations far from their physical body and beyond any possible sensory awareness .
4 ) Consciousness During Anesthesia — Many near - death experiences occur while under general anesthesia — a time when any conscious experience should be impossible .
The content of near - death experiences that occur under general anesthesia is essentially indistinguishable from near - death experiences that did not occur under anesthesia .
Dr. Long asserts this is strong evidence that near - death experiences are occurring completely independently from the functioning of the physical brain .
Further consistent elements of near - death experiences include crystal - clear recollections , heightened senses , reunions with deceased family members and long - lasting positive effects after the person is brought back to life .
“ No physiological or psychological explanation of NDEs can account for what is observed in NDEs , ” Dr. Long points out .
Dr. Long ’s conclusions are consistent with what NDErs themselves almost always believe about their own near - death experiences : that they have glimpsed an afterlife .
Belief in life after death is quite common — a recent poll revealed that 82 % of Americans believe in some form of afterlife — but until now , scientific evidence was rare .
With his new book , Dr. Long provides strong , science - based proof to support those beliefs .

Modder Jack Rossi took it upon himself to build the controller for the ‘ Ghostbuster Wii ’ game that we all dreamed about .
Yup , your very own ‘ Ghostbuster Proton Pack ’ .
The replicate ‘ Ghostbuster Proton Pack ’ is fully functional , even the back pack which tells the player how much power left in the pack and which player is selected in the game .
As of now ,
Straight from Egon ’s lab , after months of Beta testing I bring to you the first ever fully fictional Wii-Proton Pack to be used in conjunction with the Nintentdo Wii version of the Ghostbusters Video game .
The cyclotron features four blue LEDs allowing you to know which player is selected or active and the Blue Power Cell actually shows you how much power the pack has .
The Thrower has been carefully designed in regards to ergonomics and function .
The front of the wand has an area in which you can place the Wii-mote and the back handle is where the Nunchuck is placed .
Since the Wii-mote has in internal speaker in it ’s ABS housing , when playing the game the pack makes all the iconic Ghostbusters SFX .
And being that the Wii utilizes wireless technology , the wand is not tethered to the pack via a cord .
I will be shooting some video footage this week and will post it as soon as it ’s finished so you can see the pack in action !
Thanks for looking !

Russian Orthodox believers washed away their sins by taking a plunge into icy waters on the feast of the Epiphany , which fell on Monday according to the Orthodox calendar .
The traditional triple dip commemorates the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan .
Here are several Reuters photographs and a Reuters video of Russians braving the winter cold to perform the ritual .
Here ’s the video :
Russian Orthodox pilgrims also took the Epiphany dip at the River Jordan , where the temperatures were much warmer .
Our Jerusalem bureau chief Alastair Macdonald accompanied a group to the area said to be where Jesus was baptised .
Pilgrims from the Jordanian side were allowed to wade into the river , but Israeli police made sure the faithful on their side had to content themselves with dips in basins marked “ Jordan Water : Not Drinking . ”

If you believe Lin Yutang , author of The Importance of Living , man is a curious wayward dreamer who is furiously pursuing all the wrong things .
Yutang has a very specific philosophy for living life which will bring genuine contentment , and he begins with the idea of detachment , which is similar to Buddhist philosophy .
Yutang says that in order to be happy , man must go through life with a certain amount of nonchalance , and distance himself from outcomes and results .
He feels that we could be a lot happier if we were more like the country squire and less like the Wall Street banker .
To Yutang , humans are influenced by two great forces , idealism and realism , and the valuable characteristic of humor is essential for toning down our dreams ( i.e. idealism ) into reality .
Yutang thinks that we need humor for the right perspective in life , and for reasonableness in living .
With humor , we learn to never expect too much or too little .
In this , Yutang is not unlike Johnathan Swift who said :
In comedy the best actor plays the part of the droll , while some second rogue is made the hero or fine gentleman .
So , in this farce of life , wise men pass their time in mirth , while fools are only serious .
( The Comic Vision and the Christian Faith )
Yutang espouses a philosophy of moderation , which he calls the philosophy of half and half . . . half action and half non-action .
And for those of us who are doers , this idea of inaction may seem troublesome , but Yutang says we must learn to be magnificent idlers , spinning for spinning ’s sake .
Yutang also believes that we are more animal than angel and that we are not made in the image of God , but in the image of the monkey .
He goes on to describe two types of humans : herbivorous and carnivorous , the former being the artist and peace - maker ; the latter , the warrior and brute among us .
He thinks that the salvation of man lies in the warrior and brutes becoming herbivores , “ chattering like women . ”
He says that unless we bring our lives into harmony with our instincts and educate our senses and emotions , rather than educating our ideas , we will never be fulfilled or truly evolved .
He has many more thoughts on how to live a happier , more fulfilled life , everything from what constitutes a good family life , drinking and wine games , to growing old gracefully .
This book is an excellent roadmap for the disquieted , modern soul .
You ’ll discover not to take things so seriously , and to enjoy yourself without feeling guilty for not doing enough .
I leave you with a quotation from the book :
The ideal world for mankind will not be a rational world , nor a perfect world in any sense , but a world in which imperfections are readily perceived and quarrels reasonably settled .
For mankind , this is frankly the best we can hope for and the noblest dream that we can reasonably expect to come true .
This seems to imply several things : a simplicity of thinking , a gaiety in philosophy and a subtle common sense , which will make this reasonable culture possible .
Now it happens that subtle common sense , gaiety of philosophy and simplicity of thinking are characteristic of humor and must arise from it .

Visiting synagogues is not getting any easier for Pope Benedict .
Today ’s meeting with Rome ’s Jewish community was the third time he has entered a synagogue , which is a kind of a papal record considering that his predecessor Pope John Paul — probably the first pope to do so since Saint Peter two millennia ago — made only one such visit himself .
His first synagogue visit , in Cologne only months after his 2005 election , was heavy with the symbolism of a German pope visiting Jews in Germany .
At one point , the rabbi referred to an elderly woman in the congregation who had a concentration camp number tattooed on her arm .
He did this , though , to say that she could not have never imagined back there in Auschwitz that her son — a leader of the Cologne Jewish community present at the ceremony — would one day welcome the pope to a synagogue in Germany .
It was tense , but it seemed to be a good start .
Three years later , he got a warm welcome at New York ’s Park East Synagogue .
Chief Rabbi Arthur Schneier , a Hungarian - born Holocaust survivor , thanked God that both of them had made it through the Second World War and seen the Catholic - Jewish reconciliation begun by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s .
“ Your presence here gives us hope and courage for the road we still have to travel together , ” he added .
Benedict seemed to be getting over the stumbling block of his German background and finding a way to reach out to Jews .
But instead of getting easier , today ’s third visit — to the synagogue at Rome ’s old Jewish ghetto — turned out to be the most difficult of all .
Over 1,000 Roman Jews were deported to Nazi death camps in 1943 ; only 16 of them survived .
The local Jewish community was divided over the visit , with some urging that it be put off after Benedict honoured his wartime predecessor Pope Pius XII last month by moving him closer to sainthood .
Pius ’s controversial role during the Holocaust — or non-role , as his critics see it , because he did not speak out — is a roadblock on the path of Catholic - Jewish reconciliation .
But Benedict seems determined to honour him , and every time he speaks or acts in his favour , the barrier seems to get higher .
Rome ’s Chief Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni insisted on going ahead with the visit but Rabbi Giuseppe Laras , head of the Italian Rabbinical Assembly , boycotted it .
Citing Benedict ’s support for Pius and his decision to lift the excommunication of a Holocaust denying ultra- traditionalist bishop , Laras said ties between Catholic and Jews had “ become increasingly weaker during this pontificate . ”
Benedict ’s visit began a stop at the ghetto monument to Rome ’s deported Jews .
At the synagogue along the banks of the Tiber , Di Segni and his colleagues greeted the pope and escorted him into the imposing building .
Among those attending were a handful of aging concentration camp survivors wearing blue shawls with prisoner ’s stripes .
They got a long round of applause when they were introduced during the ceremony .
Riccardo Pacifici , president of Rome ’s Jewish community , choked with emotion as he delivered his welcoming address .
“ The man speaking to you is the son of Emanuele Pacifici and grandson of Genoa ’s Chief Rabbi Riccardo Pacifici , who died in Auschwitz with his wife Wanda .
If I am here in this sacred place to speak , it ’s because my father and my uncle Raffaele found refuge in the convent of the Sisters of Saint Martha in Florence , ” he said , to another round of applause .
“ Our debt of gratitude to this religious institution is immense and the relationship continues with the sisters of our generation .
The State of Israel has given the convent the Medal of the Righteous among the Nations , ” he added , wiping away tears and greeting one of the Sisters of Saint Martha seated in the congregation .
Then Pacifici added some of the toughest words ever publicly delivered by a Jewish leader to a pope : “ In Italy and other parts of Europe , many religious people risked their lives to save thousands of Jews from certain death , without asking anything in return .
This is why the silence of Pius XII before the Shoah still hurts because something should have been done .
Maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of Auschwitz . ”
As many Jewish leaders before him , he urged the pope to open all the Vatican ’s wartime archives so historians can judge for themselves how much Pius knew and how much he did about the Holocaust .
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Silvan Shalom , who met the pope privately , did so as well .
The Vatican , which says it will do so once the files are catalogued , argues that Pius worked hard behind the scenes to help persecuted Jews because he avoided publicly denouncing the Nazis out of concern that it would lead to only harsher oppression .
The congregation broke into approving applause several times while Benedict addressed the meeting .
They clapped loudly when he said that “ many , including Italian Catholics sustained by their faith and Christian teaching , reaced with courage , often at the risk of their lives , opening their arms to assist the Jewish fugitives who were being hunted down , and earning perennial gratitude . ”
But then Benedict added the argument that Pius loyalists cite in his defence : “ The Apostolic See itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way . ”
Nobody raised a hand to applaud that line .
After a split second , the pontiff continued reading his speech .
After the ceremony , the Holocaust survivors distributed the text of a letter they gave to Benedict .
“ We are here but we never left Auschwitz , ” it read .
“ We are here but every night our thoughts go to those who were left nameless and lifeless at Auschwitz .
We have never abandoned our faith in men but men did not come to our help …
Our hope is that the silence of those who did not stop absolute evil may be overcome by the cry of those who want that what happened will never happen again , so that our yesterday does not become their tomorrow . ”

“ The U.K. is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances , ” Mr. Miliband said in a statement .
“ However I also deeply regret the fact that our specific concerns about the individual in this case were not taken into consideration , despite repeated calls by the prime minister , ministerial colleagues and me . ”
Mr. Shaikh ’s daughter , Leilla Horsnell , was quoted by the BBC as saying she was “ shocked and disappointed that the execution went ahead with no regards to my dad ’s mental health problems , and I struggle to understand how this is justice . ”
British officials had pressed the Chinese courts to consider Mr. Shaikh ’s history of mental disturbance and to allow an independent evaluation of his mental state .
But China ’s highest court , the Supreme People ’s Court , rejected a last - minute appeal from the family and British officials and allowed the execution to go ahead as scheduled .
Two of Mr. Shaikh ’s cousins , Soohail and Nasir Shaikh , who traveled to China to visit him in prison and make a last - minute plea for clemency , said they were “ astonished at suggestions that Akmal himself should have provided evidence of his own fragile state of mind , ” according to the BBC .
China defended its handling of the case at a regularly scheduled press conference at the Foreign Ministry in Beijing saying that criticisms were .
“ groundless , ” and “ China expressed its resolute opposition ” to them , said Jiang Yu , a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry , according to the English - language report on Xinhua .
Governor Rick Perry ( R - Tex . ) lashed out at President Obama Wednesday .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Perry : Obama ' hell - bent ' on socialism
Texas GOP Gov. Rick Perry accused President Barack Obama on Wednesday of “ punishing ” Texas and being “ hell - bent ” on turning the United States into a socialist country .
Speaking at a luncheon for a Midland County Republican Women ’s group , Perry said that “ this is an administration hell - bent toward taking American towards a socialist country .
And we all do n’t need to be afraid to say that because that ’s what it is . ”

Perry praised the tea party movement to the Republican activists in attendance , crediting the grassroots groups with discouraging some Democrats in Washington from pushing for a public option in the health care bill .
“ If you all think those tea parties did n’t work , then let me tell you something , ” Perry said .
“ When they all came home in August for those town hall meetings , they got an earful .
Then they went back to Washington , D.C. and the Senate voted that public option down in committee with a majority of Democrats in the Senate . ”
Perry also accused the Obama administration of intentionally dumping illegal immigrants from other western states in Texas , recalling a conversation he had with local officials notifying him that illegal aliens that were caught in Nogales , Arizona were being dropped off by federal authorities in Presidio , Texas .
“ Friday a week ago , I got not a phone call from Washington , not a letter from Washington and as a matter of fact , I do n’t think any member of our congressional delegation was even notified .
The first time we were contacted was by the superintendent of the school and the county judge of Presidio County , ” Perry said .
“ They said , ‘ do you all know what ’s fixin ’ to happen ? ’
I said , ‘ well , no .
What ’s going on ? ’
They said ‘ the government has just called us and said for us to get ready for an influx of illegal aliens who were captured illegally crossing the border . ’”
“ It ’s called the alien transfer - and - exit program , ” Perry told the crowd , “ trucking them from Nogales , past El Paso down to our western border in Presidio . ”
The Texas governor said he sees the action as “ punishing this state ” and urged the assembled Republicans to “ stand up ” to Washington .
“ I say it ’s time to make tea parties twice as big as what they were , ” Perry declared .
“ I think it ’s time for us to stand up and say to Washington , D.C. that we are no longer going to accept that kind of stuff sitting down and being quiet . ”
ROME ( Reuters ) -
An Italian scientist says he has reproduced the Shroud of Turin , a feat that he says proves definitively that the linen some Christians revere as Jesus Christ ’s burial cloth is a medieval fake .
An archive negative image of the Shroud of Turin ( L ) is shown next to one recreated by an Italian scientist and released in Pavia October 5 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Turin Diocese ( L ) and Luigi Garlaschelli / Handout
The shroud , measuring 14 feet , 4 inches by 3 feet , 7 inches bears the image , eerily reversed like a photographic negative , of a crucified man some believers say is Christ .
“ We have shown that is possible to reproduce something which has the same characteristics as the Shroud , ” Luigi Garlaschelli , who is due to illustrate the results at a conference on the para - normal this weekend in northern Italy , said on Monday .
A professor of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia , Garlaschelli made available to Reuters the paper he will deliver and the accompanying comparative photographs .
The Shroud of Turin shows the back and front of a bearded man with long hair , his arms crossed on his chest , while the entire cloth is marked by what appears to be rivulets of blood from wounds in the wrists , feet and side .
Carbon dating tests by laboratories in Oxford , Zurich and Tucson , Arizona in 1988 caused a sensation by dating it from between 1260 and 1390 .
Sceptics said it was a hoax , possibly made to attract the profitable medieval pilgrimage business .
But scientists have thus far been at a loss to explain how the image was left on the cloth .
Garlaschelli reproduced the full - sized shroud using materials and techniques that were available in the middle ages .
They placed a linen sheet flat over a volunteer and then rubbed it with a pigment containing traces of acid .
A mask was used for the face .

PIGMENT , BLOODSTAINS AND SCORCHES
The pigment was then artificially aged by heating the cloth in an oven and washing it , a process which removed it from the surface but left a fuzzy , half - tone image similar to that on the Shroud .
He believes the pigment on the original Shroud faded naturally over the centuries .
They then added blood stains , burn holes , scorches and water stains to achieve the final effect .
The Catholic Church does not claim the Shroud is authentic nor that it is a matter of faith , but says it should be a powerful reminder of Christ ’s passion .
One of Christianity ’s most disputed relics , it is locked away at Turin Cathedral in Italy and rarely exhibited .
It was last on display in 2000 and is due to be shown again next year .
Garlaschelli expects people to contest his findings .
“ If they do n’t want to believe carbon dating done by some of the world ’s best laboratories they certainly wo n’t believe me , ” he said .
The accuracy of the 1988 tests was challenged by some hard - core believers who said restorations of the Shroud in past centuries had contaminated the results .
The history of the Shroud is long and controversial .
After surfacing in the Middle East and France , it was brought by Italy ’s former royal family , the Savoys , to their seat in Turin in 1578 .
In 1983 ex-King Umberto II bequeathed it to the late Pope John Paul .
The Shroud narrowly escaped destruction in 1997 when a fire ravaged the Guarini Chapel of the Turin cathedral where it is held .
The cloth was saved by a fireman who risked his life .
Garlaschelli received funding for his work by an Italian association of atheists and agnostics but said it had no effect on his results .
“ Money has no odor , ” he said .
“ This was done scientifically .
If the Church wants to fund me in the future , here I am . ”
Dear Cecil :
How come February only has 28 days ( plus an extra day in leap year ) when all the rest of the months have 30 or 31 ?
Did they figure winter would go faster if the months were short ?
Randy Sue C. , USA Weekend , Arlington , Virginia
Cecil replies :
Dear Randy Sue :
You may be closer to the truth than you think , scoop .
But let ’s dispose of the other explanations first .
A widely believed — but possibly erroneous — story has it that February is so short because the Romans borrowed a day from it to add to August .
August was originally a 30 - day month called Sextilis , but it was renamed to honor the emperor Augustus Caesar , just as July had earlier been renamed to honor Julius Caesar .
Naturally , it would n’t do to have Gus ’s month be shorter than Julius ’s , hence the switch .
But some historians say this is bunk .
They say February has always had 28 days , going back to the 8th century BC , when a Roman king by the name of Numa Pompilius established the basic Roman calendar .
Before Numa was on the job the calendar covered only ten months , March through December .
December , as you may know , roughly translates from Latin as “ tenth . ”
July was originally called Quintilis , “ fifth , ” Sextilis was sixth , September was seventh , and so on .
To meticulous persons such as ourselves , Randy , having the calendar run out in December and not pick up again until March probably seems like a pretty casual approach to timekeeping .
However , we must realize that 3,000 years ago , not a helluva lot happened between December and March .
The Romans at the time were an agricultural people , and the main purpose of the calendar was to govern the cycle of planting and harvesting .
Numa , however , was a real go - getter - type guy , and when he got to be in charge of things , he decided it was going to look pretty stupid if the Romans gave the world a calendar that somehow overlooked one - sixth of the year .
So he decided that a year would have 355 days — still a bit off the mark , admittedly , but definitely a step in the right direction .
Three hundred fifty five days was the approximate length of 12 lunar cycles , with lots of leap days thrown in to keep the calendar lined up with the seasons .
Numa also added two new months , January and February , to the end of the year .
Since the Romans thought even numbers were unlucky , he made seven of the months 29 days long , and four months 31 days long .
But Numa needed one short , even - numbered month to make the number of days work out to 355 .
February got elected .
It was the last month of the year ( January did n’t become the first month until centuries later ) , it was in the middle of winter , and presumably , if there had to be an unlucky month , better to make it a short one .
Many years later , Julius Caesar reorganized the calendar yet again , giving it 365 days .
Some say he made February 29 days long , 30 in leap year , and that Augustus Caesar later pilfered a day ; others say Julius just kept it at 28 .
None of this changes the underlying truth : February is so short mainly because it was the month nobody liked much — a judgment with which I heartily concur .
Frankly , if the Romans had cut it down to 15 minutes , it would n’t have bothered me a bit .

Canadian companies will get access to funding from U.S. economic stimulus projects in 37 U.S. states under a deal to circumvent the protectionist " Buy American " clause , CBC News has learned .
The breakthrough in negotiations between Washington and Ottawa might not be announced until tomorrow , the CBC's Chris Hall said .
Industry Minister Tony Clement , seen in a file photo , would not confirm details of the trade deal when he spoke to reporters on Thursday at Parliament Hill .
( Sean Kilpatrick / Canadian Press )
During an afternoon press conference , Industry Minister Tony Clement would not confirm details of the deal but said Trade Minister Peter Van Loan and Prime Minister Stephen Harper were working hard on the file .
" There is nothing to be announced now , " Clement told reporters at Parliament .
The agreement applies only to U.S. funding delivered under the current stimulus program , not future legislation that might include " Buy American " - type provisions .
The U.S. money is allocated for roads , public housing and other infrastructure projects , the drawback being that most of the money has already been spent .
Hall said the Canadian government is arguing the deal sets a precedent for future stimulus spending in the U.S .
In return , Canadian provinces are to sign on to a World Trade Organization general procurement agreement , which will give the U.S. and other countries access to projects underway in Canada with federal stimulus spending .
The " Buy American " provision gives priority to U.S. iron , steel and other manufactured goods for use in state - level and municipal public works and building projects funded with stimulus tax revenue .
The provision was put into the $ 787 - billion US American Recovery and Reinvestment Act — the U.S. government 's economic stimulus package — by the U.S. Congress .
Canada has been trying to get an exemption from the provisions since last fall .
In October , reports of progress between the U.S and Canada over the controversial provision prompted the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to withdraw a resolution to block U.S. companies from bidding on city contracts in this country .
Catching sight of a cockroach tends to make us behave chaotically , what with the running and screaming and throwing of shoes .
But it appears that chaos might actually explain how we , and the cockroach itself , behave .
An interdisciplinary team of scientists from Germany have created a robotic cockroach that autonomously behaves in a way reminiscent of a real cockroach .
The robot independently changes gait depending on the surface it is walking on , avoids obstacles and can even extricate its leg from a hole or run away from predators .
Recreating lifelike behaviour is not new , but this robot reproduces a huge range of behaviours and quickly reacts to new situations and switches between them .
And the secret to its success is controlled chaos in its robotic brain .
An autonomous robot works by taking inputs from sensors ( such as light , floor contact for each leg , and object recognition cameras ) and generating outputs to the motors that control the robot 's movement .
But deciding exactly which combination of inputs should lead to which combination of outputs rapidly becomes very difficult as more inputs and outputs are considered .
In contrast , a living cockroach processes information from a large number of sensors ( such as touch , vision , smell , temperature and vibration ) to control the 100 or so muscles responsible for its movement .
Therefore , the researchers noted in their paper , nature has apparently solved the difficult problem of coordinating a large number of inputs and outputs .
In humans and animals , periodically recurring movements like walking or breathing are controlled by small neural circuits called central pattern generators ( CPGs ) .
Scientists have been using this principle in the development of walking machines .
To date , typically one separate CPG was needed for every gait .
Previously robots received information about the environment via several sensors and selected the CPG that would produce the gait appropriate for the current situation .
There is growing evidence that the CPGs in real biological systems exploit chaos .
Mathematically something is chaotic if a tiny change in starting conditions produces vastly different results .
For example , one starting point for a mathematical function could produce a steady repeated pattern of outputs , but a slight nudge ( called a perturbation ) might result in wildly different output .
It seems that individual neurons may behave in a chaotic way , but when connected to other neurons they interact , pushing and pulling each other , to create the patterned neural output of a CPG .
And operating at the very edge of chaos seems to be an advantage : the organism can flip between behaviours in an instant , and even into chaos itself .
For example it is thought that the CPG that produces steady flight in some moths also controls the erratic fluttering and tumbling that help the insect dodge predators .
( You can read more in Lewis Dartnell 's Plus article Chaos in the brain . )
Silke Steingrube , Marc Timme , Florentin Wörgötter and Poramate Manoonpong have tried to install this controlled chaos into their robotic cockroach .
Inspired by the biology of the insect itself , they used a very simple neural network of two neurons to act as a CPG .
The outputs of this CPG controlled the movement of the 18 mechanical muscles of the robot .
This simple neural network was defined mathematically , where the state of each of the two neurons at any time ( each a real value between 0 and 1 ) was dependent on the state of both neurons an instant before .
This mathematical system was tuned so that the network behaved chaotically : a tiny change in the value of the starting states would result in vastly different output .
To control this chaos , the researchers introduced an extra term in their equations that would essentially provide nudges to move the system from one type of behaviour to another .
For example if the input sensors indicated the robot was on level floor , the control parameter would push the system into a periodic pattern of length 5 , resulting in a walking style called a tetrapod gait ( see movie ) .
Different inputs from the sensors , such as that it was on a hill , on rough terrain , and predator attack stimulated a different periodic output .
If the input did not fit a known situation the control parameter was turned off , turning the output of the CPG back to chaotic and allowing the robot to flail about until it found itself in one of its known situations again .
This chaotic behaviour turned out to be ideal for many situations , for example when the robot is turned on its back , or its leg is trapped in a hole , as the chaotic behaviour eventually righted the robot and enabled it to quickly switch back to a stable gait .
The connection between sensory properties and CPG can either be preprogrammed or learned by the robot from experience .
The scientists use a key example to show how this works : the robot can autonomously learn to walk up a slope with as little energy input as possible .
As soon as the robot reaches a slope , a sensor shows that the energy consumption is too high .
Thereupon , the connection between the sensor and the control input of the CPG is varied until a gait is found that allows the robot to consume less energy .
Once the right connections have been established , the robot has learned the relation between slope and gait .
When it tries to climb the hill a second time , it will immediately adopt the appropriate gait .
In the future , the robot will also be equipped with a memory device which will enable it to complete movements even after the sensory input ceases to exist .
In order to walk over an obstacle , for instance , the robot would have to take a large step with each of its six legs .
" Currently , the robot would not be able to handle this task — as soon as the obstacle is out of sight , it no longer knows which gait to use , " says Marc Timme .
" Once the robot is equipped with a motor memory , it will be capable to use foresight and plan its movements " .
By mathematically controlling chaos these researchers have developed an elegant neural network that autonomously mimics real insect behaviour .
The robot provides further proof that a chaotic ground state CPG is key in producing a wide range of behaviours and instinctively switching between them , whether in a robot , a roach , or even ourselves .
Southwest Airlines : Kevin Smith Too Fat To Fly ( PHOTOS )
Award winning film director , comedian and author Kevin Smith has picked up a new label thanks to Southwest Airlines - ' too fat to fly ' .
Smith boarded a flight in Oakland on Saturday that was bound for Burbank .
All was going according to plan until he was deemed too obese to make the journey .
The airlines went so far as to call him a risk to the safety of others before they ejected him from the plane .
A flight attendant named Suzanne approached him and relayed a message from the cockpit .
According to Smith , " She told me Captain Leysath deemed me a ' safety risk . ' "
Before he exited the plane , Smith puffed out his cheeks in an exaggerated pose and captured a photo for posterity and for use as a future ' twitpic ' .
Southwest eventually had a change of heart and booked him on a later flight and gave him a $ 100 airline voucher but the damage was done .
The disgruntled passenger did what anyone would do under the circumstances -- he took his case to his Twitter page , where the four - letter words were flying fast and furious .
Southwest has apologized for getting it wrong after receiving a deluge of hate mail from Smith 's 1.6 million Twitter followers .
According to TMZ , the masses actually brought down the Southwest website at one point on Sunday .

Gosh .
Does n't really seem like he deserves it .
What do you think ?
Will we come to his defense ?
He is one of the best political cartoonists we have in this country .
Consistently hilarious and spot on , Fiore also does n't shy away from controversy , choosing instead to engage in , and encourage discussion across the political spectrum , while making you laugh too .
To all of you who have written emails and comments , I really wish I could respond to every one of you .
I truly appreciate your taking the time to write , even if we may be on different sides of the political fence .
If there is one thing that my politically mixed San Francisco / Idaho background has taught me , it is benefit of continuing a discussion even if you do n’t agree .
Too often these days , the Left and the Right immediately shut down if you are deemed to be from the opposing camp .
Here ’s to good discussion even if we do n’t agree .
Now please do n’t kill me :-)
Send Mark some love today and check out his other fine work and a description of what is going on today here .
UPDATE : It appears the Flying Monkey Brigade was sent by .
. . wait for it . . . Fox News ' own Bill O Reilly !
Ken Rudin over at NPR 's Policial Junkie has the backstory .
UPDATE 2 : Just to be " fair and balanced " here is a high - minded explanation of the wingnut outrage .
( Short version .
They hate satire . )
From that site ...
We live in seriously challenging times – times that warrant serious conversations on the state and direction of our nation .
From the fiscal crash course our nation is on to the ever - present threat we face from Islamic terrorism , there ’s plenty of fodder for constructive political discourse .
Read this heartfelt call for satirical leniency on the Teabaggers because we live in " times that warrant serious conversations . "
That 's pretty funny coming from the same people who spent the entire summer of 2009 disrupting ( and possibly ruining forever ) the venerable American institution known as the Town Hall Meeting with your Congress member .
How do they say on SNL ... " Really ? ! ! "
Frankly , I think Fiore let the teabaggers off easy .
If you really want to see some rough teabagging satire , check out what MAD TV did .
( The show was recently cancelled by Fox , perhaps they stepped over the line ? )
UPDATE 3 : Best comment over at Mark 's blog .
Perhaps when the teabaggers stop calling Obama a Socialist , Nazi , Muslim , etc. and the Democratic Party the Democrat Party I 'll stop calling them teabaggers .
UPDATE 4 : ( h/t skeezixwolfnagle )
One Final Note :
Would n't Teabagger activist anger be better aimed at the GOP consulating firms who are ripping them off ?
Long Beach , California ( CNN ) -- Microsoft Corp. founder and philanthropist Bill Gates on Friday called on the world 's tech community to find a way to turn spent nuclear fuel into cheap , clean energy .
" What we 're going to have to do at a global scale is create a new system , " Gates said in a speech at the TED Conference in Long Beach , California .
" So we need energy miracles . "
Gates called climate change the world 's most vexing problem , and added that finding a cheap and clean energy source is more important than creating new vaccines and improving farming techniques , causes into which he has invested billion of dollars .
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month pledged $ 10 billion to help deploy and develop vaccines for children in the developing world .
The world must eliminate all of its carbon emissions and cut energy costs in half in order to prevent a climate catastrophe , which will hit the world 's poor hardest , he said .
" We have to drive full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline , " he said .
Gates said the deadline for the world to cut all of its carbon emissions is 2050 .
He suggested that researchers spend the next 20 years inventing and perfecting clean - energy technologies , and then the next 20 years implementing them .
The world 's energy portfolio should not include coal or natural gas , he said , and must include carbon capture and storage technology as well as nuclear , wind and both solar photovoltaics and solar thermal power .
" We 're going to have to work on each of these five [ areas ] and we can't give up on any of them because they look daunting , " he said .
" They all have significant challenges . "
Gates spent a significant portion of his speech highlighting nuclear technology that would turn spent uranium -- the 99 percent of uranium rods that are n't burned in current nuclear power plants -- into electricity .
That technology could power the world indefinitely ; spent uranium supplies in the U.S. alone could power the country for 100 years , he said .
A " traveling wave reactor " would burn uranium waste slowly , meaning a 60 - year supply could be added to a reactor at once and then not touched for decades , he said .
Gates also called for innovation in battery technology .
" All the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy [ in the world ] , " he said .
" So , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here .
Something that 's going to be of a factor of 100 better than what we have now . "
Gates called for more investment in climate - related technology .
He said he is backing a company called TerraPower , which is working on an alternate form of nuclear technology that uses spent fuel .
Money that goes into research and development will pay bigger returns than other investments , he said , especially if money goes into energy sources that will be cheap enough for the developing world to afford .
Clean energy technologies must be installed in poorer countries as they develop , he said .
" You'd be stunned at the ridiculously low costs of innovation , " said Gates , who received a standing ovation for his remarks .
If he could wish for anything in the world , Gates said he would not pick the next 50 years ' worth of presidents or wish for a miracle vaccine .
He would choose energy that is half as expensive as coal and does n't warm the planet .
Horrid slimy things , mushrooms .
I 've never liked them .
So I 'm not tempted by a box of three pale brown fungi on sale at a stall in Kyoto 's food market .
That 's just as well , because they cost 37,000 yen , or about £ 250 .
Fans of Japan often say its reputation for emptying a tourist 's wallet faster than you can say " konnichiwa " is exaggerated .
What 's certainly true is that if you spend a lot in this land of high design , delicate aesthetics and unfailingly polite service , you 're spoilt silly .
About Y25,000 ( £ 169 ) buys a night at a top ryokan , a traditional inn where pampered guests can gaze out at bonsai gardens from the comfort of a private bathtub .
There 's no limit to luxury here .
There are more three - star Michelin restaurants in Tokyo than any other city .
Bullet trains are stupidly fast , punctual , clean – sexy , even .
Your fellow travellers disport themselves without jostling or eating smelly food , meaning you can actually enjoy the journey .
But a regular return fare from Tokyo to Kyoto on the fastest Shinkansen service , the 180 mph Nozomi Super Express , will also tear Y27,040 ( £ 182 ) from your purse .
So , my challenge was to take a two - week trip around the big - ticket sights of Honshu , seeing Tokyo and Kyoto , plus some of the prettier places in the " Japanese Alps " – keeping to about Y10,000 ( about £ 67 ) each a day .
It was n't a shoestring ; my days of sleeping in dorms are over .
I 've been to Japan twice before , on business , but this time I wanted to see more ; my boyfriend had never been but had learnt some Japanese and was keen to try it out .
Our plan was to sleep in cheaper , chain business hotels and budget ryokan .
We 'd use buses and local trains but we still wanted to eat decently , buy small souvenirs and experience some only - in - Japan moments .
The solution was a new self - guided tour offered by Inside Japan , which would pre-book accommodation and travel .
The " Price Cruncher " tour also meant we knew how much the trip would cost : the only variables would be food and spending money .
We start in Tokyo , regularly at the top of any " most expensive city " charts .
But there are plenty of free amusements : a 6 am visit to the Tsukiji fish market ; walking in the Imperial Palace Gardens ; watching sumo wrestlers practise ; and the view from the 45th floor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Building , Shinjuku .
Living frugally can't keep me from touring the city 's ritzy department stores and gleaming malls .
But , like lots of Tokyoites right now , we just look .
It 's easy not to buy clothes when your giant limbs would split Japanese XL sizes at the seams .
The gourmet shops in department - store basements are harder to resist .
I soon give in to the call of consumerism , but keep purchases small – not the latest micro-camera , but what I 'll call " cuteware " .
The country 's unofficial religion is still the worship of all things kawai ( cute ) , and for a few pounds you can load up on Miffy calendars , stickers , fun - fur ashtrays , glittery hair clips , and strapus ( the mini toys that dangle from every mobile phone ) .
Recession has meant good times for the 100 - yen shops , which trade in cheap knick - knacks , household essentials and sometimes food .
Tokyo's subway system requires concentration to navigate ( with the help of an English - language map ) , but it 's affordable .
We buy pre-paid Pasmo cards and load them with credits ,
although unlike London 's
Oyster system there 's no saving on the standard ticket .
Expect to spend about Y1,200 ( £8 ) a day for about six journeys .
After four jet - lagged , beer - soaked nights in Tokyo , we 're wrung out , so we head to the mountain resort of Hakone on the Odakyu Highway Bus ( Y1,850 , or £ 12.50 ) , which is , they say , a great way to see Mount Fuji .
( It 's hidden in mist when I travel , so I 'll take their word for it . )
The next morning , to get to Kyoto , we take the bullet train – the most expensive leg of the trip at Y6,000 ( £ 40 ) for a reserved seat – and savour the journey .
It 'll be coaches and local transport from now on .
Hidden away at edges of the city , the antique pavilions , Zen gardens and pagoda architecture are captivating – but entry tickets average at Y500 .
We search out less popular sites , which are not only more peaceful but cheap , or even free .
The best is a sprawling compound of Zen temples called Daitokuji .
Here , the minuscule ryogen is a perfect jewel of five dry gardens , each about the size of a tiny city roof terrace , and each symbolising with moss or rock or gravel a lovely , if obtuse , piece of Buddhist philosophy .
Entry costs a mere Y300 ( £ 2 ) , and it is deserted .
Kyoto 's gardens require lots of walking , and , for me , that takes caffeine .
Blowing Y400 ( £ 2.70 ) at Starbucks is out , so I get familiar with the vending machines on every corner .
I had thought a formal Japanese tea ceremony was out of reach until I hear about a place in the small town of Uji , just south of Kyoto .
Here , in a tea house next to the tourist office ( where you buy the ticket ) , is supposedly the cheapest tea ceremony in Japan .
The hot , fluffy , bright green liquid you drink at the end of cha - no - yu , or " way of the tea " , is n't the point , of course .
We 're offered a place to kneel , while two ladies in brocade kimonos and elaborate hair split duties : one heats the water on a brazier and whisks the tea ; the other kneels behind her , keeping one eye on her technique , while also making stilted conversation .
It 's like visiting a great aunt , but the tea ceremony is a showcase of traditional Japanese etiquette .
At 20 minutes and just Y500 ( less than £ 3.50 ) , this was short order compared with the average Kyoto experience ( 45 minutes or longer , for Y2,000 , or £ 13.40 ) .
Back in modern Japan , eating fast , furious and cheaply is n't a problem .
At lunch , restaurants offer a cheaper set menu .
We slurp in noodle restaurants , where a big bowl of thick udon noodles in hearty soup stock are layered with slices of pork , just Y850 , less than £ 6 , in an Ebisu branch of the hip noodle chain Ippudo .
Conveyor - belt sushi restaurants with colour - coded plates helps avoid shocking bills , though you 'll watch the priciest dishes glide by .
Bento boxes are cheap and easy to select ; okonomiyaki , an omelette filled with sliced cabbage , or noodles , with egg , slices of beef or fish , is yours for Y750 ( about a fiver ) .
Our favourite frugal dinner is yakitori , chicken skewers cooked to order as you sit facing the grill .
A step up from McDonald 's , places such as Jonathan 's , Royal Host and Yoshinoya are the equivalent to Pizza Hut , with a Japanese level of service and quality .
My favourite is the " Italian " chain Saizeria : portions are modest but the flavours are decent and the picture menus are easy to use .
A bowl of penne all 'arrabiata and a glass of drinkable French red wine is Y600 ( £ 4 ) .
Two hours and 20 minutes from Kyoto on the limited express train ( Y6,800 or £ 46 ) is the coastal town of Kanazawa , with famous ornamental gardens and a sleek new contemporary art museum .
We spend the afternoon in the " Ninja Temple " , a castle of tricks with hidden staircases and sliding doors designed to confuse invading enemies .
The price is rather sly , too , at Y800 each , and by now the budget 's getting tight so we start hanging out in games arcades ; bigger places have their own " maid cafés " .
Sadly , nowhere do I find a budget karaoke venue to parrot my favourite Eighties ' hits – the ubiquitous chain Big Echo charges Y2,000 ( about £ 13.50 ) per hour .
Too expensive .
The end of our frugal tour rounds the mountains west of Tokyo , through Takayama , home to Hida beef , which locals obviously hope can challenge Wagyu and Kobe varieties .
Next day , in Matsumoto , two hours away by carefully driven coach ( with filmic views of rusty autumn leaves ) , we spend the afternoon in the most beautiful castle I 've ever seen .
Five tiers of beautiful blackish wooden pagoda , reflected in koi carp - filled waters .
On a war footing after a sturdy curry noodle lunch ( Y525 a bowl ) , we march up the wooden steps inside the 16th - century keep with legions of school kids .
Entry fee ?
A mere Y600 each ( £ 4 – the Tower of London costs £ 16.50 ) .
By the end of the fortnight , we meet our daily budget but the ruinous exchange rate did n't help .
Our " self - guided " tour package gave us all the train and bus tickets beforehand and helped us sidestep expensive mistakes .
A couple of practical tips : debit and credit cards are not as widely accepted here as in the UK , and post offices are the only place where foreign - issued cards work – so you need to carry cash .
It 's safe to do so , but the Y10,000 ( £ 67 ) limit per transaction at a post office ATM means bank charges can tot up .
The Japanese have got used to living in recession , and there are bargains here – you just have to find them .
I did n't feel like the Queen of Sheba , but everything I ate , drank and looked at offered amazing value – except for those mushrooms .
They were definitely overpriced .

All thanks to the ETS .
Fortunate , then , that it will never make it into law :
New modelling by the Government ’s energy market operator reveals the wholesale price of electricity will rise from $ 30 per megawatt hour in 2010 to about $ 100 by 2024 .
In a national transmission report released before Christmas , the Australian Energy Market Operator ( AEMO ) predicts the price will double to $ 60 per megawatt hour by 2012 .
The wholesale price makes up less than half of the final bill that reaches each customer , who also pays distribution costs .
The AEMO modelling is based on Treasury ’s carbon price estimates under the proposed emissions trading scheme , which from next year will force big polluters to pay for their emissions .
[ Er , well it would if it was actually law yet – Ed ]
Opposition energy spokesman Nick Minchin yesterday accused the Rudd Government of trying to hide the real costs of tackling climate change .
“ I think Australians will be stunned to learn that their power bills could more than triple as a result of Mr Rudd ’s climate change policies , ” Senator Minchin said .

An error - checking algorithm found in software used to attack Google and other large companies circulated for years on English - speaking language books and websites , casting doubt on claims it provided strong evidence that the malware was written by someone inside the People 's Republic of China .
The smoking gun said to tie Chinese - speaking programmers to the Hydraq trojan that penetrated Google 's defenses was a cyclic redundancy check routine that used a table of only 16 constants .
Security researcher Joe Stewart said the algorithm " seems to be virtually unknown outside of China , " a finding he used to conclude that the code behind the attacks dubbed Aurora " originated with someone who is comfortable reading simplified Chinese . "
" In my opinion , the use of this unique CRC implementation in Hydraq is evidence that someone from within the PRC authored the Aurora codebase , " Stewart wrote here .
In fact , the implementation is common among English - speaking programmers of microcontrollers and other devices where memory is limited .
In 2007 , hardware designer Michael Karas discussed an almost identical algorithm here .
Undated source code published here also bears more than a striking resemblance .
The method was also discussed in W. David Schwaderer 's 1988 book C Programmer 's Guide to NetBIOS .
On page 200 , it refers to a CRC approach that " only requires 16 unsigned integers that occupy a mere 32 bytes in a typical machine . "
On page 205 , the author goes on to provide source code that 's very similar to the Aurora algorithm .
" Digging this a little deeper though , the algorithm is a variation of calculating CRC using a nibble ( 4 bits ) instead of a byte , " programmer and Reg reader Steve L. wrote in an email .
" This is widely used in single - chip computers in the embedded world , as it seems .
I 'd hardly call this a new algorithm , or [ an ] obscure one , either . "
Two weeks ago , Google said it was the victim of highly sophisticated attacks originating from China that targeted intellectual property and the Gmail accounts of human rights advocates .
The company said similar attacks hit 20 other companies in the internet , finance , technology , media and chemical industries .
Independent security researchers quickly raised the number of compromised companies to 34 .
But Google provided no evidence that China was even indirectly involved in the attacks targeting its source code .
During a conference call last week with Wall Street analysts , CEO Eric Schmidt said only that that world 's most populous nation was " probably " behind the attacks .
One of the only other reported links between China and the attacks is that they were launched from at least six internet addresses located in Taiwan , which James Mulvenenon , the director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis at Defense Group , told The Wall Street Journal is a common strategy used by Chinese hackers to mask their origin .
But it just as easily could be the strategy of those trying to make the attacks appear to have originated in China .
The claim that the CRC was lifted from a paper published exclusively in simplified Chinese seemed like the hard evidence that was missing from the open - and - shut case .
In an email to The Register , Stewart acknowledged the CRC algorithm on 8052.com was the same one he found in Hydraq , but downplayed the significance .
" The guy on that site says he has used the algorithm , did n't say he wrote it , " Stewart explained .
" I 've seen dates on some of the Chinese postings of the code dating back to 2002 . "
Maybe .
But if the 16 - constant CRC routine is this widely known , it seems plausible that attackers from any number of countries could have appropriated it .
And that means Google and others claiming a China connection have yet to make their case .
The lack of evidence is important .
Google 's accusations have already had a dramatic effect on US - China relations .
If proof beyond a reasonable doubt is good enough in courts of law , should n't it be good enough for relations between two of the world 's most powerful countries ? ®

( There 's a great deal of mystery about how polling is conducted , so I asked Del Ali , president of Research 2000 , to discuss the mechanics of the polling process .
Hopefully , this is not just educational , but helps squash some of the more ridiculous assertions made by critics of our commissioned polling -- kos )
HOW A POLL IS CONDUCTED
By Del Ali , Research 2000
So , how is a poll conducted ?
We will go over step by step precisely how R2 K conducts a poll :
1 ) Questionnaire or survey instrument :
This is the list of questions that will be asked in the poll .
First of all , it is vital to ask the question as fairly and objectively as possible .
The exact wording of the questions and their order in the questionnaire are obviously important , as this can be the most controversial part of any poll .
To provide full transparency , we publish the exact questions we ask , in the order asked .
In addition , R2 K and our clients make a point of releasing the full results of every poll conducted , instead of publishing just the positive results and hiding less favorable numbers .
I am critical of candidate polls -- for both Democrats and Republican -- that only release the horserace results , but refuse to release either the rest of the results , or even the order in which the questions were asked .
What must be emphasized is that it is important to be objective and have the facts straight when asking any issue question .
Adjectives cannot be used in asking such questions , period .
A question about the death penalty , for example , needs to be asked fairly and straightforwardly , with no embellishment : " Do you favor or oppose the death penalty ? "
2 ) Finding the respondents :
After our survey instrument is ready to commence , we then CATI the survey .
This means simply that we put this into our Computer - Assisted - Telephone - Interview system .
Those interviewed are selected by the random variation of the last four digits of telephone numbers , whether this is a national poll , statewide , congressional district , etc .
A cross-section of exchanges are utilized in order to ensure an accurate reflection of the area being polled .
People often note that they 've never been polled .
Well , the first law of polling is that every single individual in a designated population must have an equal chance of being selected as part of the polling sample .
In other words , if one was conducting a poll among likely voters in the United States , the validity of the poll comes into question unless every single adult 18 years or older has an equal chance of being called randomly .
3 ) Asking the questions :
First we screen respondents depending on the criteria the client requires .
So if we need to zone in on likely voters , we screen for likely voters ( more on how we do that below ) .
Then we ask three demographic questions .
The first is the gender of the respondent .
The second is political party identification , which is simply , " Politically , do you consider yourself to be a Democrat , a Republican , an Independent , or of another party ? "
( Keep in mind that there are many states in our nation that do not have party registration . )
The third question we ask is the age of the respondent .
Then we go directly to our name recognition question (s ) .
This is a two - part question in which we ask the respondent over the telephone if they recognize a name being polled , say , " Markos Moulitsas " .
If they say do not recognize Markos , we go on to the next name on the list .
If they do recognize Markos , we than ask the respondent if they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him .
If they respond they have no opinion of him or if they respond favorable or unfavorable , we either move on to the next name or we measure the intensity of that answer by asking the respondent if that is very favorable or very unfavorable .
After we go through all the names on the list , we then go to the horserace question .
That is simply asked : " If the election for President were held today , would you vote for Barack Obama , the Democrat , or John McCain , the Republican ? "
After the horse race question , we then move on to other issues , such as asking job approval of the President , the Democrats in Congress , the Republican in Congress , or any of the national leadership figures commonly polled .
If we were conducting a statewide poll , we could do job approvals among the Governor , both U.S. Senators and the Legislature of the state .
After this , we could ask several issue questions that pertain to both state and national issues .
Finally we ask additional demographic questions .
Keep in mind we already asked three of them -- sex , party affiliation , and age .
We now ask the rest , such as geography and race .
4 ) Determining likely voters :
How do pollsters define " likely voter " and how are they selected ?
This is a major source of controversy when it comes to the accuracy of polls .
We will simply say this : we use several screeners in determining how the likely voter is selected .
We already shared one of the most important screeners -- party identification .
While we will not share the actual wording of our screeners because they are proprietary and they are what make us successful , we will share two examples of those screeners :
SCREENER :
Which of the following best describes what you will do next Tuesday when it comes to the November election : I will definitely vote - PROCEED
I am pretty certain I will vote - PROCEED
I am not sure if I will vote - TERMNATE
I will not vote - TERMINATE
I am not sure - TERMINATE SCREENER : How often do you vote when there is a statewide election ?
I vote always - PROCEED
I vote almost always or most of the time - PROCEED
I vote some of the time - TERMNATE
I rarely vote - TERMINATE
I do n't vote - TERMINATE
5 ) Additional information on poll of Republicans .
We need to address a few items pertaining to the recent national poll we just completed for the Daily Kos among 2,000 - plus self - identified Republicans nationally .
We started with a screener that was , quite simply , " Politically , do you consider yourself to be a Democrat , a Republican , an Independent , or of another party ? "
In other words , if they stated they were a Democrat , an Independent , something else or told us to go to hell , they were not part of this 2,000 + sample .
It looked like this :
Politically , do you consider yourself to be a Democrat , a Republican , an Independent , or of another party ?
DEM 1 - TERMINATE
REP 2 -PROCEED
IND 3 - TERMINATE
OTHER 4 - TERMINATE
DK 5 - TERMINATE
After these self - identified Republicans were selected , we then asked them : " In the 2010 Congressional elections will you definitely vote , vote , not likely vote , or definitely will not vote ? "
As was reported , 8 % of this sample stated that they are not likely to vote , 5 % stated they definitely will not vote and 4 % were not sure if they would vote , while 83 % stated that they would definitely vote or vote .
The purpose of the poll , as clearly stated , was to interview self - identified Republicans on various issues .
Each of the questions asked on the poll have been released via Daily Kos , as well as the order in which the questions were asked and the demographic information collected .
These were straightforward and objective " favor or oppose " or " yes / no " questions , such as " Do you favor or oppose the death penalty ? " and " Do you think Barack Obama is a socialist ? "
Margin of Error
The most common complaint we hear from the public is : “ Nobody has ever polled me . ”
For millions of people , that will be true throughout their lives .
However , these individuals , while they may never be interviewed by R2 K or any other firm , have an equal chance of being selected as the lucky respondent who ends up qualifying to participate in the poll .
The beauty of polling is that one does not have to contact and interview every single likely voter in the United States to see where the 2008 Presidential election stands a week before the election .
In fact , we only have to interview 400 likely voters to get an accurate refection of where the race stands .
However , if we want to learn where the race stands among the various subgroups within the poll ( for example , 18 - 29 year olds or Latinos ) , a larger overall sample is recommended because the sub - group of the 18 - 29 year old and Latino voter in a 400 - voter sample would be very low .
So , the higher the overall sample , and the higher the subgroup overall numbers , the lower the margin of error .
The MOE is as follows for each sample size :
SAMPLE SIZE MOE 400 5 %
600 4 %
800 3.5 %
Using the MOE of 5 % in our 400 sample size , this means if Barack Obama yielded 50 % as his level of support in the poll , his actual level of support will not be higher than 55 % or lower than 45 % if every single likely voter in the nation had actually been interviewed .
That 95 % confidence level simply means that we are 95 % certain that this principle is true .
No doubt , with upcoming events like the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016 , more and more people will become aware of Brazilian culture .
That ’s a trend that has n’t been lost on the makers of cachaça ( pronounced “ ka - SHA - sa , ” ) , the key ingredient in Brazil ’s classic cocktail , the caipirinha ( pronounced “ kai - pur - EEN - ya ” ) .
Several cachaça brands have been working hard to promote the category , educating consumers about the spirit , and doing outreach with bartenders and restaurateurs to teach them how to incorporate it in cocktails and on menus .
The effort appears to be paying off .
One brand , Leblon Cachaça , was recently designated as a “ rising star growth brand ” by Beverage Information Group .
The award is given to brands that are less than five years old and have shown dramatic growth .
Sales of Leblon have been growing at a double - digit pace , which is even more impressive when one considers that Americans slowed their liquor consumption last year .
Leblon is using Carnival , which ends tonight , as a way of encouraging bars and restaurants build events around cachaça - based drinks .
The company ’s promotion focuses on “ Caipi Hours , ” which feature specially priced caipirinhas cocktails made from cachaça and freshly muddled limes and sugar .
Rival Cabana Cachaça also is sponsoring some promotions tied to the Carnival period , but instead of focusing on caipirinhas , the company has worked with bartenders in several different cities to create cachaça - based drinks that are representative of the region .
Cabana Cachaça ’s strategy has focused , in part , on the popularity of the local foods movement , emphasizing that cachaça is a very versatile spirit that can be mixed with just about anything including fruit juices and tonic .
The brand also emphasizes that it is a single - estate cachaça that is doubled - distilled and aged for nine months .
Although cachaça remains unknown to many U.S. consumers , it is the third - most consumed spirit in the world .
In the U.S. , there has been a lot of confusion about the product .
No doubt some of this can be tied to the fact that under U.S. law , the spirit must be labeled Brazilian rum .
While both cachaça and rum are derived from sugar cane , cachaça takes the actual cane sugar juice and ferments and distills it , while rum is derived from molasses .
“ It ’s more akin to tequila in terms of its nose and profile , ” said Steve Luttmann , president and founder of Leblon .
So think of it this way , you make a caipirinha like a mojito , but it tastes a bit like a margarita .
Peter Gorenstein , TechTicker : U.S. Manufacturing grew in January at its fastest pace in more than five years .
Yet , manufacturing makes up only 12 % of the U.S. economy - down from its post World War II peak of 28 % percent in 1953 .
That lack of an industrial base has put the American economy and worker in jeopardy , says distressed investor Lynn Tilton , CEO of Patriarch Partners .
" The reality is , in recent times , every great empire has been built on a manufacturing economy , " notes Tilton .
" The fall of every empire has been the failure to remember that one fundamental fact . "
Tilton 's point is simple : the country cannot thrive as simply a service - based economy .
As Tilton explains to Aaron and Henry in the accompanying clip , there is n't enough demand for services and those related jobs to keep the U.S. competitive on a global scale .
We should also not over look the fact some people are better at building and making things then working on spreadsheets in a cubicle .
Tilton speaks from hands - on experience , not theory .
Her firm either lends to or has controlling interest in more than 70 companies with assets of over $ 7 billion , including Heritage Aviation , MD Helicopters , Global Automotive Systems , Vulcan Engineering and Amweld Building Products .
Late last year , Patriarch acquired a controlling stake in Dura Automotive Systems , which is headquartered in Rochester Hills , Mich .
In the accompanying clip , Tilton discusses the challenges and opportunities of trying to revive Michigan 's automotive sector , and her plans to open a machine shop nearby .
Sounds promising , but how does America compete with cheaper labor from emerging markets ?
" It 's a long humble journey back " but with " cash and creativity " Tilton 's confident it can be done .
What we lack in cheap labor and certain raw materials American manufacturers can make up with innovation , she says .
It will also take sacrifice on the part of capitalists .
Investors will have to be willing to accept tighter margins in the short run in exchange for a stronger country in the long run .
" Frankly , if we do not employ people in this country it will ultimately end badly for all of us , " Tilton warns .

Advertisement A trainer at the SeaWorld park in Orlando , Florida , has died after being attacked by a killer whale .
Witnesses said the orca had jumped and grabbed Dawn Brancheau by the waist from a poolside platform before dragging her underwater .
Guests were evacuated while fire crews tried to rescue the 40 - year - old , but they were unable to revive her .
The killer whale , Tilikum , was also reportedly involved in the death of a female trainer in Canada in 1991 .
Other orcas were also said to have attacked trainers at SeaWorld parks in 2006 and 2004 .
' Shaking her violently ' Chuck Tompkins , SeaWorld parks ' head of animal training , was quoted by Reuters news agency saying : " She was rubbing the killer whale 's head , and [ it ] grabbed her and pulled her in . "

SeaWorld said an investigation was under way into Wednesday afternoon 's death of Ms Brancheau , a trainer with 16 years ' experience .
Jim Solomons , a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff 's Office , said early accounts indicated she could have slipped and fallen into the tank .
He said it was too early to tell if she had been attacked by the 12,000lb ( 5,450 kg ) orca .
But witnesses told a different story .
Park visitor Victoria Biniak told a local TV channel that the trainer had just finished explaining to the audience what they were about to see .
FEARSOME PREDATOR
The killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) is largest species of dolphin family Known as orcas , they roam all the oceans , from the Arctic and Antarctic to tropical seas Can specialise in particular prey : salmon , sea lions , seals , or walruses , even large whales Considered under threat due to pollution , loss of prey and habitat Despite its savage reputation , there have been very few documented attacks on humans After success of 1993 film Free Willy , the movie 's star Keiko was freed near his native Iceland
What to do with captive orcas ?
Killer whale attack : Your comments
At that point , she said , the whale " took off really fast , and then he came back around to the glass , jumped up , grabbed the trainer by the waist and started shaking her violently .
The last thing we saw was her shoe floating . "
Audience member Eldon Skaggs told AP news agency the whale had " pulled her under and started swimming around with her " .
A male spectator who witnessed the tragedy gave CNN a similar version of events .
Brazilian tourist Joao Lucio DeCosta Sobrinho and his girlfriend were at an underwater viewing area when they saw the whale with the trainer in its mouth .
The entertainment park , known for its killer whale , seal and dolphin displays , was closed after the incident .
SeaWorld in San Diego also suspended its killer whale show .
Tilikum is said to have been involved in previous incidents , the BBC's Andy Gallacher reports from Florida .
A SeaWorld spokesman said the orca had been one of three whales blamed for killing a trainer in 1991 after she had fallen in a pool at a marine park in British Columbia , Canada .
Naked man
After the whale - nicknamed Telly - was sold to SeaWorld Orlando it was involved in a second incident when authorities discovered the body of a naked man lying across his back in 1999 .
Officials later concluded the man , who had either crept into SeaWorld after closing time or hidden in the park until it closed , probably drowned after suffering hypothermia .

There have been incidents involving other whales at SeaWorld .
In November 2006 , a male trainer escaped with a broken foot after he was bitten and held underwater by a female killer whale during a show at SeaWorld 's San Diego park .
In 2004 , another whale at the company 's San Antonio park attempted to bite a trainer , but he too escaped .
Though called a killer whale , the orca ( Orcinus orca ) , is actually the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family .
Animal rights group Peta says it has long been asking SeaWorld to stop taking wild , ocean - going mammals and confining them to an area that , to them , is " the size of a bathtub " .

Intel and Nokia Merge Software Platforms for Future Computing Devices MeeGo* enables an open ecosystem for rapid development of exciting new user experiences
NEWS HIGHLIGHTS :
• Global leaders Intel Corporation and Nokia merge Moblin and Maemo to create MeeGo* , a Linux - based software platform that will support multiple hardware architectures across the broadest range of device segments , including pocketable mobile computers , netbooks , tablets , mediaphones , connected TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems .
• MeeGo offers the Qt application development environment , and builds on the Moblin core operating system and reference user experiences .
Using Qt , developers can write once to create applications for a variety of devices and platforms , and market them through Nokia 's Ovi Store and Intel AppUpSM Center .
• MeeGo will be hosted by the Linux Foundation and governed using the best practices of the open source development model .
The first release of MeeGo is expected in the second quarter of 2010 with devices launching later in the year .
• Nokia and Intel expect MeeGo to be adopted widely by global device manufacturers , network operators , semiconductor companies , software vendors and developers .
ESPOO , FINLAND , and SANTA CLARA , CALIF . , Feb. 15 , 2010 – In a significant development in the convergence of communications and computing , Intel Corporation and Nokia are merging their popular Moblin and Maemo software platforms .
This will create a unified Linux - based platform that will run on multiple hardware platforms across a wide range of computing devices , including pocketable mobile computers , netbooks , tablets , mediaphones , connected TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems .
Called MeeGo , the open software platform will accelerate industry innovation and time - to - market for a wealth of new Internet - based applications and services and exciting user experiences .
MeeGo - based devices from Nokia and other manufacturers are expected to be launched later this year .
This announcement strengthens the Nokia and Intel relationship , and builds on the companies ' broad strategic collaboration announced in June 2009 .
Intel and Nokia now invite participation in MeeGo from existing Maemo and Moblin global communities and across the communications and computing industries .
" Our vision for seamlessly communicating between computing devices from the home , auto , office or your pocket is taking a big step forward today with the introduction of MeeGo , " said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini .
" This is a foundational step in our evolving relationship with Nokia .
The merging of these two important assets into an open source platform is critical toward providing a terrific experience across a variety of devices and gaining cross- industry support . "
" MeeGo will drive an even wider range of Internet computing and communication experiences for consumers , on new types of mobile devices , " said Olli- Pekka Kallasvuo , CEO , Nokia .
" Through open innovation , MeeGo will create an ecosystem that is second to none , drawing in players from different industries .
It will support a range of business models across the value chain , building on the experience and expertise of Nokia , Intel and all those who will join us .
Simply put , MeeGo heralds a new era of mobile computing . "
MeeGo blends the best of Maemo with the best of Moblin to create an open platform for multiple processor architectures .
MeeGo builds on the capabilities of the Moblin core OS and its support for a wide range of device types and reference user experiences , combined with the momentum of Maemo in the mobile industry and the broadly adopted Qt application and UI framework for software developers .
MeeGo also unites the robust worldwide Maemo and Moblin applications ecosystems and open source communities .
For developers , MeeGo extends the range of target device segments for their applications .
Using
Qt for application development means that they can write applications once and easily deploy them on MeeGo and across other platforms , for example , on Symbian .
The Ovi Store will be the channel to market for apps and content for all Nokia devices , including MeeGo and Symbian - based , with Forum Nokia providing developer support across all Nokia device platforms .
The Intel AppUpSM Center will be the path to market for Intel - based MeeGo devices from other device manufacturers , with the Intel® AtomTM Developer Program providing support for applications targeting devices in a variety of categories .
The MeeGo software platform , running on high - performance devices , will deliver a range of Internet , computing and communication experiences , with visually rich graphics , multitasking and multimedia capabilities and the best application performance .
Since MeeGo runs on multiple device types , people can keep their favorite applications when they change devices , so they are not locked into one kind of device or those from any individual manufacturer .
MeeGo Hosted by the Linux Foundation
The MeeGo software platform will be hosted by the Linux Foundation as a fully open source project , encouraging community participation in line with the best practices of the open source development model .
Intel and Nokia invite the respective members of Maemo.org and Moblin.org to join the combined community at MeeGo.com , as well as encouraging wider participation from the communications , computing and related industries .
Developers can begin writing applications for MeeGo in Qt immediately .
The first release of MeeGo is targeted for the second quarter of this year .
The White House and congressional Democrats have struck a deal with unions over taxation of high - end insurance plans , a major step toward agreement on a final health care package .
The announcement came as congressional leaders returned to the White House this afternoon to negotiating other differences between the bills passed by the House and Senate last year .
" We are hopeful that by day 's end they will have worked through -- House , Senate and the president -- worked through any number of issues that remain outstanding , " said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
Obama told House Democrats this afternoon that the new legislation will cover more Americans and reduce health care costs .
He dismissed claims by Republicans it will do the opposite , and urged Democrats to hang tough in the face of political problems over the legislation .
" Believe me , I know how big a lift this has been , " Obama said .
" I see the polls ... The worst fears will prove groundless . "
If Republicans want to campaign against the health care bill , Obama said , " that 's a fight I want . "
Don Stewart , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , cited polls showing that a growing number of Americans oppose the health care plan .
" Union lobbyists might like it now , but constituents do n't , " Stewart said .
Union members had balked at the Senate plan for taxes on so - called " Cadillac " health care plans , saying it would hit too many of their members .
They preferred the House plan , which put higher taxes on wealthy Americans to pay for changes to the health care system .

The UK could run out of gas within six hours this winter , the Observer has learned .
The revelation has sparked a row between the Conservatives and Labour over who is doing more to keep the heating on .
Last winter , the UK was left with only three days of reserves when foreign energy companies started exporting gas to supply their European customers after Russia cut supplies that used a pipeline through Ukraine .
A spokeswoman for Ed Miliband 's energy and climate change department said that under a civil contingency act he had the power to halt exports from the UK if the Queen had signed the order .
Charles Hendry , the shadow energy minister , told the Observer that the current minimum requirements on companies to keep gas in storage were not tough enough to safeguard the security of the UK 's energy supplies .
Labour hit back this weekend , accusing the Conservatives of " blighting progress " on building more gas storage facilities by blocking planning reforms proposed by the government .
If its storage facilities are full , the UK has enough gas supplies for about 16 days , based on average demand .
France 's storage capacity would last a maximum of 91 days and Germany 's 73 days .
But National Grid has told energy companies that they only need to fill tanks by a minimum of 2.3 % this winter .
If all gas imports to the UK ground to a halt , for example if Gazprom turned off supplies to Europe , and supplies from the North Sea were disrupted , this amount would keep the country 's households and businesses supplied for just six hours on a cold day .
In France , regulators require companies to keep their facilities at least 85 % full from November .
Unlike France and Germany , the UK has direct access to dwindling gas fields in the North Sea which provide about half the country 's gas needs and ensure some security of supply .
National Grid also said the government had powers in an emergency to order North Sea operators to boost production .
But fields are already operating at 90 % capacity .
UK energy companies do not have access to storage facilities in Europe , unlike their foreign counterparts .
National Grid said its minimum requirement for gas storage was based on ensuring the smooth and safe operation of the network , rather than security of supply .
It said it had the power to slow the rate of withdrawal of supplies , but admitted it could not order companies to replenish stocks once tanks became depleted .
Businesses could be cut off to keep households supplied , it added .
The system assumes the market will deliver sufficient supplies by sucking in gas to the UK when demand is high .
Hendry said : " We are concerned at the low levels of gas storage .
Existing requirements on energy companies to maintain a minimum level of storage are clearly not sufficient to ensure the UK 's security of supply , especially as we become increasingly dependent on imported gas . "
A Labour spokeswoman said : " Alarmism from the Conservatives is designed to hide the fact that they have no coherent energy policy .
As the North Sea gas declines , we need more gas storage , more import capacity and more low - carbon generation , all of which is happening .
The Tories ' opposition to planning reform will blight progress on this and all the other low - carbon measures we need . "

US troops are stepping up aid operations across Haiti , a week after the devastating earthquake .
UN officials said aid distribution points were being set up in the capital and UN security forces would accompany US troops as they delivered supplies .
Helicopters dropped scores of US troops in the presidential palace grounds , and they moved to secure a nearby hospital .
Meanwhile , the UN Security Council has voted to boost its peacekeeping forces to help control outbreaks of looting .
Anger has been growing in the streets of the capital , Port - au - Prince , as people wait for help .
The US military has begun delivering food and water to distribution points in the capital and elsewhere by helicopter , after congestion at the airport delayed deliveries of aid .
For those who have lost everything , of course , help cannot come soon enough
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon
Mass amputation fears
How to manage a crisis Sarkozy quells Haiti rift with US Some 14,000 ready - to - eat meals and 15,000 litres ( 3,300 gallons ) of water were dropped north - east of Port - au - Prince on Monday , the US said .
It also defended its handling of operations at the airport in Port - au - Prince .
Aid agencies - and some governments - have complained at delays in access for aircraft full of equipment to help the survivors , with priority going to military flights .
" We 're doing everything in our power to speed aid to Haiti as fast as humanly possible , " said Gen Douglas Fraser , head of US Southern Command Meanwhile , the UN has approved a recommendation by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to boost UN troop numbers in Haiti by 2,000 for six months , and UN police numbers by 1,500 .
Mr Ban said he was grateful to the UN Security Council for its swift action , calling it " a clear signal that the world is with Haiti " .
He said the UN was in discussion with member states , and he hoped to have the extra troops and police to deploy soon .
The UN mission in Haiti currently numbers about 9,000 .

There have been reports of widespread violence and looting .
But the UN has played down worries over security , saying that despite violent incidents , the overall situation is calm .
US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn , deputy commander of the Joint Task Force on ongoing relief efforts , echoed that message , saying the security situation was " relatively calm " and that aid distribution points were orderly .
He said there were " pockets of instability " , but that UN forces and the Haitian national police were addressing security needs with " agility " .
AT THE SCENE Mark Doyle , BBC News , Haiti
The Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital in Port - au - Prince was destroyed in the earthquake , so the local and international medical staff who survived set up a new treatment centre across the road in their pharmacy .
Using rough wooden sticks and a crude curtain they 've established an operating theatre in the open air .
The operating table is a wooden desk .
The doctors say they treated several hundred people a day in the first few days after the earthquake , and that more are coming all the time as they hear medical aid is available .
Most patients have broken or crushed limbs from falling concrete .
There were more than 2,000 US personnel on the ground and 5,000 offshore on ships , he said , adding that 10,000 troops in total would be arriving in the coming weeks , half of whom would be directly involved in distributing humanitarian aid .
Mr Ban said the UN 's goal was to increase the number of people receiving food to one million this week and at least two million in the following two weeks .
Addressing concern that aid has been too slow to reach desperate Haitians , Mr Ban said the situation on the ground was " overwhelming " , but that UN efforts were " gearing up quickly " .
" For those who have lost everything , of course , help cannot come soon enough , " Mr Ban said .
" But we are working day and night . "
' Test of resolve ' Last week , US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said airdrops had been ruled out because they might do more harm than good .
Mr Gates warned that they could trigger riots if there was no proper structure on the ground to distribute supplies .
The problem is dehydration but there is still a chance [ of finding survivors ]
UN spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs
In pictures : Haiti one week on US opens doors to Haiti orphans Battle against the looters
But the BBC's Nick Davis in Port - au - Prince says that the US military is now securing areas on the ground before pallets of food and water are parachuted in .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday Haiti was a " test of resolve " for the international community .
France 's Co-operation Minister , Alain Joyandet , had suggested on Monday that the US was " occupying " Haiti and urged the UN to " clarify " the US role .
However , a statement from President Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday said France was " very satisfied " with the co-operation and praised the US for its " exceptional mobilisation " .
The UN says dozens of search and rescue teams are now on the ground .
On Tuesday , UN spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said 90 people had been pulled out alive since the earthquake , and rescue efforts were now concentrated outside the capital .
She insisted there was still hope for survivors .
" The climate is mild , there are significant air pockets .
The problem is dehydration but for the moment there is still a chance , " she said .
Haitian officials say the death toll in the quake has risen to at least 75,000 .
Some 250,000 people were injured and about a million left homeless .
At least 70,000 earthquake victims have already been buried .
On Tuesday , the Paris Club of creditor governments , including the US , UK , France and Germany , called on other nations to follow its lead in cancelling debts to Haiti .
Venezuela and Taiwan are the other biggest creditors .
Meanwhile , the bodies of eight Chinese nationals killed in the quake have arrived back in Beijing in a high - profile ceremony attended by relatives and top officials .

Hang onions and garlic with pantyhose

Culinary stores sell fancy baskets and all kinds of other ideas for keeping onions , garlic , and similar staples dry and separated .
Kind of ridiculous , considering you 're probably not looking to put them on display .
Knot up an old pair of pantyhose and use them to hang onions and garlic vertically , while allowing the restricted air flow to preserve your aromatic items longer than an air - tight model .
It 's one of pantyhose 's many alternate uses .

Pancakes are fun .
Cleaning up after them is not .
Lo and behold , the progression of ketchup and other plastic squeeze bottles into EZ - pour , high - volume dispensers makes them perfect for conversion into pancake batter dispensers ( discovered via the Crafter - Holic blog ) .
The price is right ( free , if you buy ketchup ) , and the cleanup is as simple as shaking a bottle full of soapy water , or recycling the bottle if you do n't plan on future precise pancake pour projects .

It ’s disappointing that something better did not come from the Copenhagen talks but I suppose the outcome was to be expected .
There were about 1,500 people at the conference but the voting representatives would have been much fewer .
Even if there were only 50 actual voters it would still have been difficult to get much agreement .
So what of the future ?
What will happen over the next 100 years or so ?
Will any country do what is needed to minimise the rate of global warming ?
Will the natural forces driving global warming wait while humanity dithers ?
If we all close our eyes will it all go away and the climate magically return to what we would like ?
Of course not !
We will go on doing what we do and the climate will go on doing what it must - it does n’t care - and we still wo n’t want to change our ways .
There is evidence that Earth ’s climate has been slowly warming for many hundreds of years so I do n’t think there was ever anything we could have done to avoid some level of change .
By continuing to live the way we do , by continuing to burn vast amounts of fossil fuels and by deforesting the planet we have created conditions that cause the climate to change at a faster rate than ever before in Earth ’s history .
Earth ’s biosphere , the place where we live , is heating up faster than what life on the planet will be able to cope with , and that includes humanity .
Advertisement
Most people think of the human race as separate from other life on Earth but that ’s a big mistake .
We are just one species of life on Earth .
We are just one component of Earth ’s biosphere .
Earth ’s biosphere is what we are part of and it ’s where all Earth life lives .
It includes all of the oceans and the air up to a few miles high and a few metres depth of soil on the land surface .
It seems pretty big to most but few people really appreciate just how thin the film of air , water and soil clinging to Earth ’s surface is .
The oceans seem deep and vast , the air seems miles high and there is soil all over the land , but the reality is that those three life supporting ingredients , land , sea and air , are a comparatively thin film covering the surface of the planet .
Let ’s get the size of Earth ’s biosphere into perspective .
Earth is about 13,000 km in diameter .
The biosphere , the land , sea and air that supports life , together , averages about 13 km thick .
So if we scale the planet down to 1.3 km diameter the biosphere would be 1.3 m thick .
If we scale down further to where Earth is 1.3 m diameter , like a big beach ball , the biosphere would be 1.3 mm thick .
That ’s not much thicker than a couple of coats of paint on the beach ball .
All of the activities of life and the storms and weather and the seasons happen within that thin layer .
Note : all the lumps and bumps come within that 1.3 mm so Earth is really a very smooth ball .
Reduced to the size of a billiard ball it would be almost as smooth - and very slightly damp .
Few people I talk with seem to understand there is only one life on Earth and that is “ The Biosphere ” .
Earth ’s biosphere is really one living organism and all life contributes to the health of the biosphere .
And all life within the biosphere is co-dependent , which means that we all need each other .
Every time any species goes extinct the biosphere is weakened .
The record shows that the richness and diversity of life on Earth waxes and wanes .
The health and richness of the biosphere builds up and dies down at irregular intervals .
Although Earth is about 4,500 million years old , and life originated about 3,800 million years ago , life did n’t really get going until about 400 million years ago .
That ’s when life moved out of the seas onto the land and into the air and quickly spread all over the planet .
There have been many times in the past 400 million years when the biosphere has been very healthy with a rich diversity of life .
Then there have been many times when global extinctions of species has reduced the diversity of life and impoverished the biosphere .
Even though there is no obvious pattern to these irregular happenings , they do seem to be cyclic .
There is evidence that there is a global extinction of species of unprecedented proportions operating as you read this , caused by humans as we exterminate and displace other species .
Although we do n’t feel any pain it ’s almost like cutting bits off ourselves as we increasingly prune living bits off the biosphere .
There are of course many factors involved but the really big one is that there are just too many of us .
From about 100,000 years ago , when we discovered that a club and a spear gave us tremendous ( unnatural ) superiority over all of the other animals , our numbers have steadily increased and their numbers have steadily decreased .
Then from when we started to industrialise and mechanise our food production , about 200 years ago , our numbers have exploded .
During those 200 years our numbers increased from about 700 million to more than 7 billion , a tenfold increase .
We have seriously overpopulated the planet and our numbers are still increasing .
In some areas overpopulation has long passed the point where the numbers are sustainable and they do n’t have enough to eat .
In other countries excessive population numbers and excessive consumption , which is propped up with technology is depleting natural resources at an alarming rate .

My opinion
The bad news is : the planet seems to be preparing to get rid of us .
I believe climate change will prove to be much faster than presently predicted and that humanity may eventually be obliterated .
The good news is : without us there is a chance that Earth ’s biosphere will regenerate .
A rich new diversity of life will have the opportunity to evolve and hopefully never again produce a species like us .
The solar system will last a few billion years yet so there is time for Earth to produce a more intelligent species that will take its place in some future interstellar / galactic / universal community .
It was just a few days ago that Sarah Palin was so offended at White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel 's use of the word " retarded , " that she devoted a Facebook entry decrying his lack of " decency " and calling for his dismissal :
Just as we’d be appalled if any public figure of Rahm ’s stature ever used the “ N - word ” or other such inappropriate language , Rahm ’s slur on all God ’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities – and the people who love them – is unacceptable , and it ’s heartbreaking . [...]
As my friend in North Andover says , “ This is n’t about politics ; it ’s about decency .
I am not speaking as a political figure but as a parent and as an everyday American wanting my child to grow up in a country free from mindless prejudice and discrimination , free from gratuitous insults of people who are ostensibly smart enough to know better ...
Have you no sense of decency , sir ? ” Mr. President , you can do better , and our country deserves better .
But in the wake of Rush Limbaugh 's rant :
Our political correct society is acting like some giant insult ’s taken place by calling a bunch of people who are retards , retards .
... it seems that Palin is back to speaking as a political figure -- a.k.a.
Queen of the teabaggers :
I asked Palin spokesperson Meghan Stapleton for comment on Rush ’s rant , and she emailed me this : “ Governor Palin believes crude and demeaning name calling at the expense of others is disrespectful . ”
Disrespectful ?
Wow , way to tear Rush a new one in the name of " all God ’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities – and the people who love them " -- through a spokesperson without ever mentioning Limbaugh by name .
That would be as opposed to the ten times she used " Rahm " in her Facebook entry .
But when Palin gets around to calling for Limbaugh 's job , I 'm sure she will be just as tough .
It 's either that or our country does n't deserve better when it 's Palin 's pal using the slur .
I 'm an elitist .
I frequently enjoy lattes , chardonnay , Surry Hills and leftism .
These are all good things and should be partaken with a great degree of hubris .
However , I object to this new wave of '' parking elitism ' ' sweeping the city .
In Chatswood last week , I noticed that Westfield had reserved a number of parking spaces for '' hybrid vehicles only ' ' .
They were n't just any old parking spaces either ; they were practically inside the entrance , paved in an elitist green hue and , naturally , empty .
Meanwhile , the commoners were left to circle the six stories of hell that make up this complex , fighting for the one or two spaces not already sequestered by a north shore LandCruiser .
I 'm willing to concede the disabled spaces might have some merit , although they always seem to be grossly oversupplied .
The '' parents with prams ' ' spots have always irked me , as they must surely infuriate everyone bar new mums with an overblown sense of entitlement .
Who needs the baby bonus as an incentive - have a kid just for the parking perks .
Priority parking should provide geographical assistance to the disadvantaged .
But what handicap can hybrid car owners possibly claim ?
Constant derision by the rest of society , perhaps , but surely they foresaw that when they bought the thing .
I 'm a power user ; a professional software designer and developer .
I use computers ( specifically , Macs running Mac OS X ) to do my job and I 'm guessing that most of you are in the same boat .
Most people are not power users , they mainly consume content using their computer rather than produce it .
When they produce content it 's more casual : posting to Twitter , updating Facebook , writing personal blog entries and notes , uploading photos .
Their personal computer usage may include the following :
Chatting with friends
Sending and receiving email
Listening to music
Watching videos
Playing games
Browsing the web
The iPad excels at almost all of those things .
Some of those tasks can be done at the same time on the iPad ( or using the same application ) but some cannot , so building multitasking into the iPad seems like the logical way to fully duplicate how most people use their personal computers at the moment .
Most people who attended the iPad unveiling and are now writing about the iPad are misunderstanding its intended audience because they 're not in it .
Some smart folks — who happen to also be power users — see the iPad 's potential and are trying to convince everyone else .
This will certainly take some time , just like there are still iPhone doubters even after Apple sold 40 million of them .
The market for potential iPad users is tremendous , possibly larger than the iPhone 's market .
There are millions of PC users who are dissatisfied with their virus - ridden , clunky computers who just want it to work better for the simple things they do every day .
They might want a MacBook knowing that it 's easier to use , but the thousand - dollar price point scares them off .
But wait !
For $ 500 less they can own a piece of Apple technology that lets them do almost everything they currently do in a form - factor that 's more convenient , mobile and beautiful .
This is the iPad 's intended audience .
People who have a PC and use 10 % of its features and software 90 % of the time .
People like my Mom & Dad who browse the web , read news , send email and watch videos .
People like my cousin Jenny who chats with friends , uses Facebook and uploads photos .
Regular folks .
Consumers .
People who use computers to stay informed , connected and entertained .
There are also many people not in the iPad 's intended audience who want one , myself included .
We 'd use it as a secondary computing device ; a casual , home - browsing entertainment piece .
The iPad is perfect for this .
The iPad is not made for you , it 's made for everyone else .
Let Them Leave
Long before the calamity in Haiti , many Haitians and their families benefited from working abroad , and many , including me , have suggested allowing more Haitian immigrants into the United States as a way to help the country ’s economy recover .
It might seem strange that the best solution to Haiti ’s woes lies outside its borders , but migration and remittances have been responsible for almost all of the poverty reduction that has happened in the island country over the past few decades .
They have done enormously more good than any policy intended to reduce poverty inside Haiti during that time .
Any poverty - reduction strategy for Haiti going forward that does not include what has been Haitians ’ most successful poverty - reduction strategy to date is not a serious one .
This idea is a no - brainer if we take a minute to look at the numbers .
First , Haitians have already emigrated in droves .
There are around 535,000 Haitian - born U.S. residents at the Census Bureau ’s last count , out of roughly 1 million in total living abroad .
The vast majority of Haitians who have escaped poverty have done so by leaving the country .
Pick any reasonable poverty line for Haiti ; the vast majority of Haitians above it no longer live there .
In a study I did with Harvard ’s Lant Pritchett , we chose a bare - bones poverty line of $ 10 per day ( measured as a living standard at U.S. prices ) .
That ’s total destitution — just a third of the $ 30 per day that the United States considers " poverty " for a single adult .
Eight out of 10 Haitians above that line currently live in the United States .
Most of this represents the effect of emigration on poverty .
Only 1 percent of people in Haiti live on more than $ 10 per day , and there is no evidence that most Haitian emigrants come from the extreme tip - top of the income distribution , so very few people who emigrated would have an income that high if they had been forced to stay home .
A typical low - skill male Haitian in the United States earns at least six times what he could earn in Haiti .
And all of this just accounts for Haitians in the United States .
Include the roughly 100,000 more who are in Canada and Western Europe , almost all of whom live on over $ 10 per day , and it ’s even starker :
The vast majority of Haitians who escaped poverty did so by leaving Haiti , not as a result of anything that happened in the country .
What about Haitians who did not emigrate ?
A limited number of these have emerged from poverty , but many were lifted out of poverty by remittances from abroad .
They , too , should be included in any accounting of the effect of migration on poverty .
Dilip Ratha , a top expert on remittances , estimates that a full accounting would show that Haitians abroad send home $ 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion per year or higher .
That is much more than all the foreign aid that Haiti receives .
The middle of Ratha ’s range suggests that remittances account for more than one quarter of Haiti ’s GDP .
This is conservatively low because remittances have a multiplier effect on local GDP .
Living standards in Haiti have not improved in the last 30 years .
They ’ve gotten much worse .
According to the World Bank , the annual income of the average person in Haiti , measured as a living standard at U.S. prices , steadily declined from $ 2,400 in 1980 to roughly $ 1,200 just before the earthquake .
It is certainly even lower now .
The poverty inside Haiti would almost certainly be much greater without remittances .
Economist Manuel Orozco has shown that remittances to Haiti are primarily spent on the most basic necessities of food , clothing , shelter , and medicine .
Because remittances are impossible by definition without emigration , and cover at least a quarter of people ’s income in Haiti , emigration must have substantially reduced poverty for those back home .
What all of these numbers mean is that the large majority of all poverty reduction that has occurred for Haitians — whether outside Haiti or inside Haiti — has been caused by international migration and remittances .
Foreign aid has had little or nothing to do with it .
The numbers do not allow any other reasonable interpretation .
Why , then , is migration seen as a sideshow as donor countries discuss how best to help Haiti rebuild ?
Their first step should be to leverage the force that has most helped Haitians in the past .
The United States has agreed not to deport any Haitians for a limited period , but it has only been deporting about 1,000 Haitians per year for the past decade .
The suspension of deportations will make very little difference in how Haitians are living abroad and sending money home .
The United States has another option for helping Haitians .
I propose a new kind of U.S. visa for Haitians and poor people around the world , a Golden Door Visa .
This would formally recognize that one of the unwritten goals of immigration policy is global poverty reduction .
The Golden Door Visa would not necessarily mean more immigrants .
Instead , the United States could reallocate visas within the current levels to include people from the world ’s poorest countries who are most in need of opportunities .
This small adjustment to U.S. immigration policy would have a big impact by improving the lives of poor immigrants and those who remain in their home countries through remittances .
We can do a back - of - the - envelope calculation of what additional migration could do .
Suppose the United States lets in 100,000 Haitian immigrants , which is the number that currently arrives over a span of five years .
First , this would dramatically raise their incomes and raise essentially all of them out of extreme poverty .
Second , this would increase the size of the worldwide Haitian diaspora by 10 percent .
If the new migrants remit like earlier migrants did , this would mean roughly $ 150 million to 180 million every year in additional remittances for Haiti ( and because things are so much tougher in Haiti now , we could expect new migrants to remit more than migrants have before ) .
The Guardian reports that as of today the United States has committed a one - time total of $ 167 million in aid .
Remittances recur year after year , and unlike aid , almost the whole amount of remittances goes directly into needy families ’ pockets .
Of course , migration alone is not " the answer " for all Haitians .
Unfortunately , one big answer for all Haitians does not exist .
As donors discuss what to do for Haitians going forward , it should be with extreme humility .
Billions of dollars of aid have yielded very little poverty reduction there to date .
Aid and other measures , such as improved access to U.S. markets , are worth continuing , of course , but they are unlikely to have dramatically different effects in the near future than they have had for the past two generations .
Migration , on the other hand , has clearly and demonstrably lifted many Haitians out of poverty .
It should be an important component of the portfolio of assistance for Haiti .
Many people react with fear to statements of this kind , thinking that " more " Haitians is synonymous with " every " Haitian , and that a flood of Haitians would sink the countries they would move to .
But the numbers of Haitians moving to the United States has been so small — just 2 percent of all immigrants to the United States — that even a substantial increase would hardly constitute a flood .
On Tuesday Hasselblad announced its new 40 - megapixel medium - format DSLR camera , the H4D - 40 .
The announcement , originally scheduled for Febuary 9th , was moved up to the 4th after details of the camera were leaked early online .
The H4D - 40 is the latest in Hassselblad 's H4D line of medium - format DSLRs .
Aimed at professional , 35 mm photographers , the H4D - 40 camera will have 40 million pixels in a 33 - by - 44 mm CCD sensor .
That 's about twice the size of a typical full - frame 35 mm DSLR sensor .
Like other cameras in the H4D line , the H4D - 40 will have Hasselblad 's Absolute Position Lock processor ( APL ) and True Focus AF system which tracks camera movement to calculate and predict proper focus during recomposition .
The H4D - 40 will also feature new low - noise color filters and an 80 mm HC / HCD lens which will allow for an increased depth of field .
The lens features digital lens correction ( DAC ) for any color aberration , vignetting , or distortion .
The H4D - 40 kit will sell for $ 19,995 and includes the camera body , the 80 mm lens , and a viewfinder .
For photographers who want a little hands - on time before parting with 20 grand , Hasselblad is doing a series of demonstrations and events at across the world .
The camera will also come with Hasselblad 's latest Phocus 2.0 image processing software to handle the enormous RAW files ( approximately 50 MB ) produced by the H4D - 40 .
Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama paid tribute Friday to seven CIA officers killed in Afghanistan in December , calling them " American patriots who loved their country and gave their lives to defend it . "
Obama delivered the remarks during a memorial service at CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia .
The service was closed to the media to protect the identities of undercover officers in attendance .
A transcript of Obama 's speech was provided to members of the press .
" There are no words that can ease the ache in your hearts , " Obama told families , friends and co-workers of the seven officers .
" But to their colleagues and all who served with them -- those here today , those still recovering , those watching around the world , I say : Let their sacrifice be a summons .
To carry on their work .
To complete this mission .
To win this war and to keep our country safe . "
A suicide bomber killed the CIA officers and contractors , as well as a Jordanian intelligence official , on December 30 at a U.S. base in Khost , in southeastern Afghanistan .
The bomber was within seconds of being searched by security contractors when he detonated his explosives , a former intelligence official with knowledge of the incident said in January .
Two of those killed were contractors with private security firm Xe , formerly known as Blackwater , a former intelligence official said .
The CIA considers contractors to be officers .
Former CIA official Robert Richer called the bombing the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon , which killed eight agents .
" These remarkable men and women are the story of America , " CIA Director Leon Panetta said at Friday 's service , according to the transcript .
" They are the heart and soul of this great country .
Their devotion to duty is the foundation of our country . "
U.S. and Jordanian officials say the bomber , Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al - Balawi , had been recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence agent , despite concerns over his extremist views , and was being used in the hunt for a senior al Qaeda figure .
The suicide bombing was " a huge blow , symbolically and tactically , " because it eliminated so many CIA officers , who can take years to become ingrained in the region , said Reva Bhalla , director of analysis for Stratfor , an international intelligence company .
In addition , she said , the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets : a CIA base .
But Panetta issued a strong statement at the service Friday , assuring those in attendance that " we will carry this fight to the enemy . "
" Our resolve is unbroken , our energy undiminished and our dedication to each other and to our nation unshakable , " Panetta said .

Your article ( Britain must launch GM food revolution , says chief scientist , 6 January ) , misrepresents my position and my paper at the Oxford Farming Conference .
The paper makes no mention of GM and I have not said that Britain must launch a GM food revolution .
Increasing global population , urbanisation and purchasing power in parts of the developing world , combined with the need to combat climate change , means the world will need to produce 50 % more food over the next two decades , using less land , less water , less fertiliser and less pesticide .
Science and technology will have a vital role to play in helping the world combat these problems .
That is why I launched the UK cross - government strategy for food research and innovation to develop solutions and to provide the evidence governments and the food industry will need to tackle these problems .
GM technology is not something that should be simply accepted or rejected .
Indeed , it would be unwise to say either we must use , or we will never use , GM technology .
The question that needs to be posed is , what particular problems of agricultural production can GM and / or other new technologies address ?
If GM technology can address some of the problems in agricultural production that conventional breeding or other technologies cannot , or can address them more efficiently and effectively , then clearly we need to be thinking about adopting it in these particular cases , with appropriate regulation ensuring safety to human health and the environment .
Professor John Beddington
Chief scientific adviser to the government
• The government 's food " vision " puts the spotlight on an alarming trend in its approach to food and farming ( Editorial , 6 January ) .
From GM crops to supermarket regulation , it has consistently ignored independent evidence and investigations to bow to the demands of big business .
While the Conservatives woo rural voters with the promise of a supermarket watchdog to protect farmers , Labour continues its obsession with GM crops , even though their introduction will sign a death warrant for many small farmers .
Furthermore , the meat and dairy industry is responsible for a fifth of the world 's climate - changing emissions , yet plans to tackle this are absent from the food plans .
Helen Rimmer
Friends of the Earth
• To be truly effective in tackling supermarket power an ombudsman must be fully independent , not a part of the Office of Fair Trading .
It is not just UK farming that would benefit .
The squeeze by UK supermarkets on developing countries is affecting suppliers and workers at the bottom of the supply chain .
A decision from Peter Mandelson is long overdue .

Imagine a state law that says that any federal agent that comes into said state and runs afoul of a new state law should be considered a felon !
Well , that is what New Hampshire is about to do if HB1285 passes during the coming 2010 legislative session .
HB1285 is another one of those laws that exempts all firearms and firearms accessories that are made in a state from certain federal restrictions if they remain in that state .
Several states have made attempts to implement these 10th Amendment laws and New Hampshire intends to be one of the next to do so .
Thus far Montana and Tennessee have passed their own firearms freedom acts and thirteen or so other states have introduced or are introducing laws that exempts local firearms industries and accessories as well as in - state firearms owners from overweening federal gun banning laws .
To be sure , these laws have not yet been challenged in a Supreme Court case and there is no doubt that they will be , but until that happens as each state passes its own firearms act exempting its in - state manufacturers and owners from federal laws we cannot help but expect an increasing amount of tension to build up between the states and the federal government as a result .
All that said there is an interesting aspect of the New Hampshire law that goes a step beyond that of other states , that being the aforementioned idea of making felons of federal agents that dare to try and implement federal firearms laws that conflict with the new state laws .
Here is section II . of the Penalty section of New Hampshire ’s proposed new Lawful Commerce in Firearms law : ( my emphasis )
II .
Any official , agent , or employee of the government of the United States , or employee of a corporation providing services to the government of the United States that enforces or attempts to enforce a act , order , law , statute , rule or regulation of the government of the United States upon a personal firearm , a firearm accessory , or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in New Hampshire and that remains within the State of New Hampshire shall be guilty of a class B felony .
Interesting is it not ?
This law would make a felon of any federal agent that tries to implement a federal firearms law that conflicts with New Hampshire ’s new firearms law .
That is simply an astonishing flourish , is it not ?
Whatever happens these laws are setting up a certain clash between the states and the federal government … unless the federal government follows the states to the same destination for firearms regulations , that is .
So , it ’s a waiting game .
Which will come first ?
Will the feds follow the states to the same firearm regulation conclusions or will the feds haul the states into court ?
It ought to be an interesting few years in forearms law making .

Canadian - born screenwriter / director / producer James Cameron won the top Best Drama prize at the Golden Globe awards last night , also scooping up the Best Director award for Avatar .
Already shattering a series of box office records , the breakthrough 3 - D picture could replace Cameron ’s Titanic as the highest - grossing film in history .
Cameron told the audience that the aim of Avatar is to remind us that “ everything is connected , all human beings and the Earth . ”
Sounds like a concept he might have come up with smoking pot in his youth , when he worked as a truck driver and spun his first fantastic scripts .
Meryl Streep picked up a record seventh Golden Globe for Julie & Julia Streep was also nominated for It ’s Complicated , which made headlines when it was slapped with an “ R ” rating for depicting pot smoking without negative consequences .
Streep has smoked pot on film before , in Silkwood ( 1983 ) , and she did her usual stellar performance getting high by sniffing an orchid extract in Adaptation ( 2002 ) .
In 1985 Streep portrayed Danish author / hashish smoker Isak Dinesen in Out of Africa .
Jeff Bridges got a standing ovation when his name was announced for Best Performance by an Actor in a Drama .
Bridges , who achieved cult status as the pot-smoking “ dude ” in The Big Lebowski ( 1988 ) , won instead for playing an alcoholic country singer in Crazy Heart .
– Drama .
Bridges told USA Today in 2008 he was , like the Dude , a major pothead .
” Oh yeah .
Big time .
That part of my life was in the past . ”
( Which is actually a double negative . )
Bridges went up against cannabis fan Morgan Freeman ( Invictus ) .
“ Never give up the ganja .
“ It ’s God ’s own weed , ” Morgan told an interviewer from UK’s The Guardian in April 2003 .
Freeman has reportedly been spotted at Vancouver ’s Blunt Brothers .
Reformed polydrug user Robert Downey Jr. won Best Actor in a Comedy for Sherlock Holmes .
Both Arthur Conan Doyle and his character Sherlock Holmes used cocaine , back in the day when Sigmund Freud was prescribing it .

Phoenix's Scoring Bug Analyzed and Fixed By Don Hodges Posted 1/22/2010 .
Updated 8/14/2015
The 1980 arcade game , Phoenix , was created by Amstar Electronics .
It is fairly well known that if the player shoots 3 birds in a row very quickly as they fly upwards during the second stage of the game , the score will jump to around 204,000 points , no matter what the player 's current score is .
3 birds fly upwards and will trigger the bug if shot quickly enough .
A sample score after triggering the bug .
A video of the feat can be seen here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OABVZGUMMkY
After some digging around in the assembly language code and using the MAME emulator with the dubugger , we can discover the reason that this bug exists , and design a fix for it .
The program reserves 4 slots of memory for birds that have been hit by the player 's missile .
Each of these slots are 4 bytes long , and they are all contained in a single area of memory at locations # 4370 through # 437 F .
[ The # indicates a hexadecimal number . ]
Slots 1 and 2 are normally used for the regular death animation for most of the birds .
Slots 3 and 4 are used for the special death animation which has the score shown in the middle of two shells which open on both sides of it and move apart .
This is used for small birds that are flying upwards with wings outstretched , and for the large birds in the third and fourth stages .
Table 1 : Slots for bird death animations .
Slot Number Type Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 1 Regular 4370 4371 4372 4373 2 Regular 4374 4375 4376 4377 3 Special 4378 4379 437A 437B 4 Special 437C 437D 437E 437F
In each slot , the first byte is used as a counter which indicates the state of the animation of the dying bird .
When a bird is hit , this byte is normally set to # C , or is set to # 10 for the special animation .
This counter is decreased as the animation of the dying bird goes through its stages , and reaches 0 ( zero ) when it is complete .
When a bird is hit , the program first checks to see which type of bird was hit .
If it was a normal bird , the memory location that is checked first is set to # 4370 , which is the first byte of the first slot .
If it is one that uses the special animation , the first memory checked is set to # 4378 , which is the first byte of the third slot .
Then it examines the first byte from either slot 1 or slot 3 .
If the byte is zero , this means that the slot is open to use and the code then uses this slot to store 4 bytes of data that are related to the animation of the dying bird .
If the byte is not zero , this means that the slot is being used and the next slot is then checked .
The program then checks either slot 2 or 4 .
If the first byte is zero , then it is then used , but if not then the code uses the next slot , without doing any more checks .
This works out OK for regular hits .
The third death animation becomes the special one that pulls apart onscreen .
However if 3 birds flying upward are hit in quick succession , then the program , after checking the third slot and the fourth slot , ends up using 4 bytes starting at # 4380 to store the data , in a nonexistent fifth slot .
The memory locations # 4381 , # 4382 , and # 4383 are normally used to hold the player 's score !
[ The first byte # 4380 , does not appear to be used for anything . ]
These bytes get overwritten .
# 4381 always gets the value # 20 .
This corresponds to the player 's hundred thousands and ten thousands digits .
The second byte # 4382 gets a value of # 41 or # 42 .
This corresponds to the player 's thousands and hundreds digits .
The last byte can vary widely , and represents the player 's tens and ones digits .
When this occurs , the player 's score becomes # 204, XYZ , where X can be 1 or 2 and Y and Z can be various digits .
[ The score is held in memory in Binary Coded Decimal ] .
The assembly language code with my comments for all of this follows , for those that are interested .
You may need some assembly language knowledge to follow this .
The CPU code is assembly language from the Intel 8085A .
; come here when a bird has been hit .

We can fix the bug by checking the value of L after it finds the first 2 slots filled and gets ready to use the next slot .
If L is # 80 , then we will set it to # 70 so that the first slot is used instead of the score RAM .
This will end up using a normal animation for the bird death instead of the special animation , but this is probably the best way to fix this without doing a much more complete code rewrite .
The fix does not appear possible to patch within the confines of the original codespace , so a hook is created to a new subroutine in an area of unused memory .
This bug can be fixed by the following patch , which requires changing 10 bytes of code : 0ED2 : CD E6 0E call $ 0EE6 ; call patch ... 0EE6 : 2C inr l ; restore instructions wiped by the patch call 0EE7 : 2C inr l ; 0EE8 : 2C inr l ; if L becomes # 80 then the S flag is set .
Did it happen ?
0EE9 : F0 rp ; no , return and continue normally 0EEA : 2E 70 mov l,$ 70 ; else set L to # 70 to use 1st slot , not the score RAM 0EEC : C9 ret ; return
This patch has been tested and does work .
It can be implemented by a MAME cheat code : : phoenix: 20600000:0EEA:002E70C9:00

Comments and Conclusions :
Some have suggested that this bug is actually an " Easter Egg " , but I disagree .
It seems like this bug was not intentional .
In my opinion it looks like some sloppy programming .
It would suck to be going for a record score and accidentally trigger this and set your score BACKWARDS .
Much thanks to Steve Fewell for inspiring me to look into this bug and providing help , and feedback on drafts of this page .

Printer Friendly ... User - supplied Array Index Exploitation Simplified .. sort of .
Author : lin0xx # Views : 2753
Have you ever ran into a case where you controlled an index into an array , but then were tasked with the annoying prospect of massaging the overwrite to suit your needs ?
For example , from http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=5 :
#define RFC2231_MAX 64
...
char * pieces [ RFC2231_MAX ] ;
and indexed by the signed integer variable ' n ' :
if(n < RFC2231_MAX ) {
pieces [ n ] = parms -> value ;
^^ Note : parms -> value is a pointer to user data .
Say you do some reversing and find out that ' pieces ' is 300 bytes away from the stored return address .
From the array write , we can tell that overwriting the return address would totally be exploitable ( assuming no N^X ) since it 's overwritten with a pointer to data supplied by you .
We need the following : a negative integer that when multiplied by 4 ( assuming a 32 bit architecture here ) , will yield 300 .
Well , I 'm not the most k- awesome bithax0r in the world , so I find the prospect of finding a negative integer to exploit this bug to be quite annoying .
I know what I want , I just do n't want to waste time telling some stupid imperative language how to give it to me !
What could possibly solve my quandary ?
Hmmm , STP .. a constraint solver .. that sounds like just the thing !
Throw this into a file :
dummy : BITVECTOR ( 32 ) ;
overflow : BITVECTOR ( 64 ) ;
multiplyOverflow : BITVECTOR ( 64 ) ;
notDummy : BITVECTOR ( 32 ) ;
evilIndex : BITVECTOR ( 32 ) ;
% Make sure the number is negative via two 's compliment ninjutsu
ASSERT ( notDummy = ~ dummy ) ;
ASSERT ( evilIndex = BVPLUS ( 32 , notDummy , 0hex00000001 ) ) ;
% Make sure it 's signed too
ASSERT( evilIndex & 0hex80000000 = 0hex80000000 ) ;
% Need a bigger bit width to express the overflow
ASSERT ( overflow [ 31:0 ] = evilIndex ) ;
ASSERT( multiplyOverflow = BVMULT ( 64 , overflow , 0hex0000000000000004 ) ) ;
% We want evilIndex * 4 == 300
ASSERT( multiplyOverflow [ 31:0 ] = 0hex0000012C ) ;
QUERY ( FALSE ) ;
Now feed it to the solver ...
$ stp -p array.access.stp
ASSERT ( v_solver_0 = 0x00000000 ) ;
ASSERT ( overflow = 0x00000000C000004B ) ;
ASSERT ( multiplyOverflow = 0x000000030000012C ) ;
ASSERT ( evilIndex = 0xC000004B ) ;
ASSERT ( notDummy = 0xC000004A ) ;
ASSERT ( dummy = 0x3FFFFFB5 ) ;
Invalid .
Well , there you have it : 0xC000004B .
Compare this to the alternative ( from : http://milw0rm.org/exploits/99 ) :
unsigned int num ( int dist ) {
int tmp = - 1 - dist ;
unsigned int border = tmp ;
int neg = ( border / 4 ) * ( - 1 ) ;
unsigned int res ;
res = 0xffffffff+neg ;
return res ;
}
I checked the output of my formula against the return value for num ( ) here - they matched .
Well , I know which method looks more intuitive to me .
Hope someone finds this useful !
Operation Chokehold — a flashmob - style protest against AT&T that began as a joke on Fake Steve ’s blog — looks like it may actually take place .
The meme is gathering a lot of steam on Twitter and Facebook , with people saying they plan to join the protest .
“ We have got to do this ! , ” says Mashable reader pjserven , who set up a couple of Facbook pages to help mobilize protestors : an event page and a fanpage that makes it easy to invite friends .
The protest began with a Fake Steve post about an internal Apple memo — fake of course — about bringing AT&T ’s network to its knees on Friday , December 18 at noon Pacific :
Subject : Operation Chokehold
On Friday , December 18 , at noon Pacific time , we will attempt to overwhelm the AT&T data network and bring it to its knees .
The goal is to have every iPhone user ( or as many as we can ) turn on a data intensive app and run that app for one solid hour .
Send the message to AT&T that we are sick of their substandard network and sick of their abusive comments .
The idea is we ’ll create a digital flash mob .
We ’re calling it in Operation Chokehold .
Join us and speak truth to power !
“ I made up the note , ” said Dan Lyons , aka Fake Steve .
“ A reader sent in the opposite idea — a boycott of AT&T for one day , everyone stops using their iPhone for a day , and we show them what ’s what .
I liked the sentiment but who ’s going to stop using their iPhone ?
And for a whole day ?
I figured no one would go for it .
But a one - hour flash mob of overuse ?
Now that i could see people doing . ”
The fake memo follows Fake Steve ’s inspired and widely - linked anti-AT&T rant last week .
Fake Steve ’s diatribe was prompted by comments by A&T CEO Ralph de la Vega ’s saying the carrier may “ incentivize ” iPhone users to cut back on their usage .
Note : Operation Chokehold may adversely affect AT&T ’s voice network and block emergency calls .
" The enemy of my enemy is my friend "
At Macworld 1997 in Boston , Steve Jobs surprised everyone when he announced a new partnership with Microsoft , a company , which at the time , was still considered Apple 's arch - nemesis .
The terms of the agreement stipulated that Microsoft would invest $ 150 million into Apple and continue to support Office on the Mac for the next 5 years .
In exchange , Apple agreed to drop its lawsuit against Microsoft for copying the " look and feel " of the Mac GUI while also agreeing to make Internet Explorer the default web browser on the Mac .
Nearly 13 years later , Apple and Microsoft are reportedly in talks to strike another deal , one that would make Microsoft 's Bing the default search engine on the iPhone .
According to Business
Week , sources close to the matter have said that Apple and Microsoft have been in negotiations over the past few weeks , and even if a deal is n't ultimately reached , the fact that Apple is considering it underscores just how seriously Apple views the threat from Google and its ever expanding range of products / services .
Over the past few months , the relationship between Apple and Google has done a complete 180 .
One minute , Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a member of Apple 's board of directors , and the next thing you know , Schmidt resigns due to conflicts of interest and Google and Apple are battling it out over Apple 's rejection of Google Voice from the iPhone .
Flash forward a few months , and not only is Google 's Android OS gaining in popularity , but Google now has their own phone in the form of the Nexus One .
It 's also worth noting that in the past few months , Apple purchased a mobile mapping software company and a mobile ad company , 2 acquisitions which certainly encroach onto Google 's turf .
Apple , of course , likes to control as much of the underlying technology in its product as possible , and they may very well be wary of Google 's growing influence on the iPhone where two Google products , Maps and YouTube , appear on the homescreen .
As it stands now , the only search options for mobile Safari are Google and Yahoo , though there is a Bing iPhone app users can download from the app store .
Fans of Google Search need not worry , though , because even if Apple does strike a deal to make Bing the default search engine on the iPhone , users will inevitably be able to switch back to Google if they so choose .
Still , the message from Apple to Google is undeniably clear .
Interestingly , Business
Week notes that even if Apple chooses to make Bing the default search engine in Safari , it may not be a long lasting relationship .
Even if it 's consummated , an Apple - Bing deal may prove short - lived .
The person familiar with Apple 's thinking says Apple has a " skunk works " looking at a search offering of its own , and believes that " if Apple does do a search deal with Microsoft , it 's about buying itself time . "
Well , Apple will be showcasing the next version of the iPhone OS in just a few days , and maybe we 'll be able to catch a glimpse of the search bar in Safari when Steve Jobs shows off some of the new features .
Once again the music industry has come out with disappointing results for physical music sales , which they blame entirely on file - sharing .
What they failed to mention though , is that their findings show that music pirates are buying more digital music than the average music consumer .
Since digital music is the future , pirates are the industry 's most valuable customers .
Have you ever heard one of the major movie studios complaining about the decrease in sales of VHS tapes ?
We have n’t .
The music industry on the other hand continues to blame the decrease in physical sales on digital piracy , ignoring the fact that there ’s a generation growing up that has never owned a physical CD .
Yesterday the music industry lobby group IFPI presented its 2009 figures , again putting the blame for decreased physical sales on file - sharers .
Unfortunately , most mainstream media outlets simply reposted the IFPI press release and their flawed analysis .
In general , no effort is made to actually balance out or check the message being sent out to millions of readers .
In their annual Digital Music Report , IFPI states that file - sharers are half as likely to buy physical CDs than the average music buyer .
Although the report is about digital music , they carefully avoid saying anything about file - sharers and digital sales .
That would actually show a completely different picture as we will explain below .
The music group made this statement based on an IFPI - commissioned study that was executed by Jupiter research .
Although IFPI refused to share the entire research report with TorrentFreak , we can conclude the following from the two pages that were published online .
Compared to music buyers , music sharers ( pirates ) are …
* 31 % more likely to buy single tracks online .
* 33 % more likely to buy music albums online .
* 100 % more likely to pay for music subscription services .
* 60 % more likely to pay for music on mobile phone .
These figures ( as reported by the music industry ) clearly show that file - sharers buy more digital music than the average music buyer .
In fact , the group that makes up the music buyers category actually includes the buying file - sharers , so the difference between music sharers and non-sharing music buyers would be even more pronounced .
How can this be true and why was there no mention of this in the Digital Music Report ?
They must be spending less on digital music then , right ?
But again , this is not the case at all .
On average , file - sharers actually spend more than non-sharing music buyers .
At least that ’s what Mark Mulligan , Vice President and Research Director at Forrester Research who conducted the study for IFPI told us .
Mulligan has his hands tied and could n’t say much about the findings without IFPI ’s approval , but we managed to get confirmation that paying file - sharers are the music industry ’s best customers .
“ A significant share of music buyers are file sharers also .
These music buyers tend to be higher spending music buyers , ” Mulligan told TorrentFreak .
So why do file - sharers download music without paying ?
According to the annual IFPI report , one of the main reasons people share music is because it ’s free .
This leads the music industry group to conclude that they are cheapskates and not willing to pay for music at all .
But , as the above clearly shows , they are misinterpreting this finding , and we ’d like to explain why .
In the digital age , people ’s demand for music has changed significantly , but their budgets are still limited .
The average file - sharer is currently spending $ 100 a year on music according to IFPI ’s own research , not really a group that can be classified as freeloaders .
However , their demand for music simply exceeds their budget and that ’s where they start downloading music on file - sharing sites , because it ’s free .
Just to be clear on our motivation to balance the ‘ facts ’ as reported by IFPI .
We are not advocating that all music should be free and neither do most of the music lovers who share files online .
However , the music industry continues to ignore that file - sharing is much more of a signal from the market that it is the increased demand for music that fuels piracy .
The solution to the problem is relatively easy .
Start offering more unlimited and unrestricted music services and piracy will go into a free - fall .
File - sharers are already paying for digital music , and they pay more than the average music consumer .
File - sharing is simply a market signal showing that there is a need to compensate for the lack of high quality and affordable subscription services .
If anything , the music industry should have more respect for file - sharers , as they are their most valuable consumers .
They are ahead of the curve and actually leading the way for the future of digital music , buying more digital music than anyone else .
It ’s the music industry that has to change , not the other way around .
Anthony Watts of WattsUpWithThat.com and SurfaceStations.org published a 30 page white paper in 2009 with the help of the Heartland Institute titled “ Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable ? ”
His conclusion was that the temperature record was not reliable due to problems with where thermometers are located .
If Watts were correct , this would be a major problem .
If the entire US temperature record was unreliable , then conclusions drawn from the temperature record could also be similarly flawed .
At a minimum , the scientific papers using the temperature record would have to be revisited .
So a thorough investigation of Watts ’ conclusion by scientists was warranted .
And now a new peer - reviewed paper by scientists at the National Climate Data Center ( NCDC ) have analyzed the temperature record and found that Watts ’ conclusion of a flawed temperature record runs contrary to the actual data .
Let ’s start by looking a little closer at how Watts ’ reached his conclusion that the US temperature data was unreliable .
According to Watt ’s white paper , 89 % of the surveyed temperature stations in the United States Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) do not meet new NOAA standards for proximity to heat sources , location away from shade and the crest of hills , and so on .
Watts chose a station in Bainbridge , Georgia , as his main example ( pictured at right ) .
It shows that the thermometer is located about 9 feet from an air conditioning unit and in the shade rather than the desired 100 meters from any heat sources .
Furthermore , the original thermometer enclosure can be seen just above “ 14.3 ′ ” distance indicator in a much better , but still not ideal location .
Given the photographic evidence , it ’s impossible to claim that the new thermometer location is ideal .
As Watts points out , “ the new station may report higher temperatures than the old station even if ambient temperatures remain unchanged . ”
But this statement presents a problem .
Watts says that the new station “ may ” report higher temperatures .
But do we know for certain that it will ?
Determining what effect the AC unit and shade tree have on the temperature measurement requires an actual analysis of the temperature data from the new thermometer and location .
Watts ’ white paper has no such analysis .
In fact , in the entire paper , Watts presents a brief analysis of only a single station ’s temperature record , and it ’s not this station .
One station out of a total 865 stations that had been surveyed at the time of the white paper ’s publication , and out of a total of 1221 USHCN stations in the continental United States , is not enough to cast doubt on the entire network no matter how bad the analysis turned out .
Watts uses words like “ may ” and “ likely ” and “ could have ” throughout his white paper .
In fact , just about the only firm conclusion that Watts reaches is that the temperature record is unreliable .
But he ’s based that conclusion entirely on qualitative information known as “ metadata ” ( information that may or may not affect the accuracy of a measurement ) rather than on quantitative ( mathematical ) data analysis .
With respect to thermometer measurements , the proximity of the thermometer to a heat source like an AC unit or an electrical transformer is metadata .
So is the type of thermometer used .
And the time of day that the temperature measurement was taken .
And the color and composition of the thermometer enclosure .
And whether or not the thermometer moved from one place to another .
And so on .
The problem is that metadata is a tool to determine if there might be a problem in the real data , but it takes actual data analysis to establish if there ’s a problem .
And analyzing a single station ( Watts used Lampasas , Texas ) is n’t enough to draw any statistically valid conclusions , such as reliability or unreliablility , about any other station or about the temperature monitoring network as a whole .
Watts makes a number of other mistakes in his white paper as well .
One of the larger errors is that he claims , based exclusively on qualitative metadata , that “ 89 % of the stations surveyed produce unreliable data by NOAA ’s own definition ( emphasis original ) . ”
It ’s not possible to make that claim without a detailed mathematical analysis of the temperature record for the supposedly unreliable stations , and Watts shows no such analysis .
Watts also claims that “ the reported increase in temperature during the twentieth century falls well within the margin of error of the instrument record , ” but does n’t take into account the simple techniques that can be utilized to reduce error in a measurement – techniques like averaging multiple samples , correcting for known biases in equipment , filtering , homogenization of station errors , and so on .
Watts does , however , make a couple of good recommendations in his white paper .
One of them is that “ a pristine dataset should be produced from the best stations and then compared to the remainder of the USHCN network to quantify the total magnitude of bias . ”
While this is something that Watts himself probably should have done before making a blanket declaration that the US temperature record was bad , it ’s still necessary to quantitatively assess the impacts of all the metadata on real temperature measurements .
And that analysis is what the NCDC team undertook in their new paper titled “ On the reliability of the U.S. Surface Temperate Record ” .
What the NCDC scientists found was that , contrary to Watts ’ claim of unreliability , the difference between good and poor sited thermometers was small and thus the US temperature record is reliable .
The NCDC scientists reached this conclusion by looking at thermometer stations scattered around the continental US that were in the surfacestations.org database and broke them up into two groups , one each for good and poor thermometer siting .
Then the scientists calculated the monthly temperatures at each station and compared the results of the good stations to the poor sited stations , both before and after adjusting for discontinuities ( aka “ homogenization ” ) in the records .
When they did this , they discovered that , contrary to what Watts expected , the unadjusted data showed that poor sites showed cooler maximum temperatures and only slightly warmer minimum temperatures , while the adjusted data showed almost no difference whatsoever .
This is shown in the image below .
Furthermore , when the scientists continued their analysis , they found that the vast majority of the difference in the unadjusted temperature came not as a result of the location of the thermometer as Watts had claimed , but rather from changes in the technology used to measure temperature ( liquid - in - glass thermometers vs. electronic ) and from a widespread change from taking measurements in the afternoon to taking them in the morning .
In fact , these two changes represented 90 % of the adjustment required for good sited temperature stations and 72 % of the adjustment needed for poorly sited stations .
The fact that the two transitions mentioned above represents so much of the overall adjustment disproves another claim of Watts ’ , namely that the homogenization process itself transferred hot temperatures from poorly sited stations to good stations .
Had Watts ’ claim been correct , then the time of day adjustment would account for a much smaller percentage of the total adjustment .
In fact , the data shows that time of day adjustments account for less of the adjustments made to poorly sited stations ( 72 % vs. 90 % for good sited stations ) , suggesting that the good stations are actually correcting the poor ones .
Watts also claimed that the transition from LiG thermometers to electronic thermometers took too long to correct and would n’t show up in the data .
The analysis in the NCDC paper shows that this claim is also incorrect .
In fact , the transition occurred mostly in the mid 1980s , and the transition is clearly visible in the maximum temperature graphs of the figure below where the “ adjusted maximum ” crosses the red line ( 0.0 degrees C ) .
In addition , Watts ’ surfacestation.org project classified USHCN temperature stations by using criteria developed for a new generation of climate monitoring stations , known as the United States Climate Reference Network ( USCRN ) .
The USCRN stations and the criteria by which they ’re gauged as “ good ” or “ poor ” are newer and significantly more restrictive than the quality criteria for the USHCN .
So Watts ’ use of the CRN standards for USHCN stations is something of an apples / oranges comparison .
However , the USCRN has 60 months of good data that can be compared to the most recent 60 months of USHCN data .
The result is a statistical correlation ( r2 ) of 0.998 and 0.996 for the maximum and minimum monthly temperatures respectively .
While this is a short period of correlation , it shows that , at least recently , the USHCN data is clearly reliable .
As the NCDC scientists point out ,
the value of the USCRN as a benchmark for reducing the uncertainty of history observations from the USHCN and other networks will only increase with time .
The image below visually illustrates the close correlation of the USCRN ( black dashes ) data to the USHCN data .
Finally ,
Watts claimed that if the US surface temperature record was unreliable , then by extension , the entire global surface temperature record must be similarly unreliable , since “ the U.S. temperature record is widely regarded as being the most reliable of the international databases . ”
While Watts offered no documentary support for this statement , if we accept his logic , then the results of the NCDC paper clearly show that the international records must be reliable because as the US records have been shown to be .
However , it ’s certainly possible that the international databases are less reliable than the US database , and so the accuracy of Watts ’ original statement is questionable at best .
Ultimately , the paper ’s conclusion represents a clear rejection of Watts ’ conclusions :
[ O ] ur analysis and the earlier study by Peterson 2006 illustrate the need for data analysis in establishing the role of station exposure characteristics on temperature trends no matter how compelling the circumstantial evidence of bias may be .
In other words , photo and site surveys do not preclude the need for data analysis , and concerns over exposure must be evaluated in light of other changes in observation practice such as new instrumentation .
The NCDC scientists directly acknowledge Watts ’ effort at documenting and categorizing the USHCN sites via the surfacestations.org project .
And even though Watts ’ conclusions in the Heartland Institute white paper cannot be supported , the work he organized and accomplished via a legion of volunteers at surfacestations.org represents a significant contribution to climate science and the surface temperature record in the United States .
Unfortunately for Watts , he rushed his white paper to print before he had verified that his conclusions were justified by the measured data .
Ever since Watts and the Heartland Institute published Watts ’ white paper , a large number of self - described climate disruption skeptics have been using the white paper as “ proof ” that that temperature records are riddled with errors .
These so - called skeptics claim that the qualitative metadata about the surface stations make strong conclusions about the state of the global climate impossible .
The new paper authored the NCDC scientists shows those claims to be wishful thinking .
The temperature record clearly shows that the U.S. climate has warmed significantly over the last 130 years , and this paper serves as yet another proof of the robustness of that observation .

Rather than let children be exposed to Marc Brown ’s book Buster ’s Sugartime — where Buster , of the PBS series , visits his mom’s two lesbian friends in Vermont , Karen and Gillian , and their three kids — the Tulsa County Union Public School District was considering a good old fashion booked burning !
Okay , no actual fire ; this is the 21st century after all , and school boards do n’t act crazy anymore !
Instead , the school district heard an appeal Wednesday night to remove the book ( which also makes mention of Buster ’s friend ’s Lilly ’s moms , Tracy and Gina ! ) from library shelves , after parents Don and Mary Danz complained about The Gays .
But after the Board of Education considered the matter at a public hearing — which did not permit comments from the public — they opted to do the responsible thing , and keep the book stocked .
The 3 - 1 vote confirms an October ruling by the district ’s Materials Review Committee , which voted 6 - 1 to deny the parent ’s request .
According to the district ’s review committee meeting minutes , the Danzes said their kindergarten - age son brought the book home from Thomas Jefferson Elementary School ’s media center and that they thought the reference to “ two moms ” was not appropriate for elementary - age children .
Don Danz , an attorney , told the school board that rather than from a religious or moral perspective , his problem with the book was that it advocated a practice that is not recognized under Oklahoma ’s constitution .
“ For kindergarten through fifth grade , material that advocates — that ’s the author ’s stated goal — positions , behavior , relationships which are objectively contrary to well - established Oklahoma law ” are inappropriate , Danz said .
“ If a subject matter is inappropriate for a grade level , passing or surpassing all the other criteria ( that would make it appropriate ) does not save it , ” Danz said .
“ The tough decision is to pull this book .
Do n’t make this book part of the curriculum ; do n’t make same - sex unions part of the curriculum . ”

Sen .
Al Franken ripped into White House senior adviser David Axelrod this week during a tense , closed - door session with Senate Democrats .
Five sources who were in the room tell POLITICO that Franken criticized Axelrod for the administration ’s failure to provide clarity or direction on health care and the other big bills it wants Congress to enact .
" There was a lot of frustration in there , " said a Democratic senator who declined to be identified .
" People were hot , " another Democratic senator said .
In his public session with the senators Wednesday , Obama urged them to " finish the job " on health care but did not lay out a path for doing so .
That uncertainty appeared to trigger Franken ’s anger , and the sources in the room said he laid out his concerns much more directly than any senator did in the earlier public session .
A Democratic source said that Franken directed his criticism solely at Axelrod .
Frailty is a geriatric condition marked by weight loss , low energy and strength , and low physical activity .
UCLA researchers followed 1,072 healthy adults aged 70 to 79 between 1988 and 1991 to determine if productive activities -- specifically volunteering , paid work and child care -- prevent the onset of frailty .
At the beginning of the study , 28 percent of participants volunteered , 25 percent performed child care duties and 19 percent worked for pay .
After three years , participants in all three activities were found to be less likely to become frail .
After accounting for levels of physical and cognitive function , however , only volunteering was associated with lower rates of frailty .
The study suggests that participating in volunteer activities may prevent frailty in older adults .
A randomized trial is needed to determine whether volunteering itself prevents the onset of frailty , or if there is something about the types of people who volunteer regularly that keeps them from becoming frail .
Yunkyung Jung , Tara L. Gruenewald , Teresa Seeman and Catherine A. Sarkisian , all of UCLA , authored the study .
Sarkisian is also affiliated with the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System .
The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation .
The study appears in the Journal of Gerontology : Social Sciences .
Carly Fiorina , whose name sounds like a mispronunciation of the state from which she 's now running for the U.S. Senate , has come out with this campaign ad , and it runs the full gamut of terrible : hokey animal imagery ( in the style of Georgia 's John " Subtlety " Oxendine ) , public - domain movie - villain music , a solemn voiceover and a clunky acronym .
It 's the perfect storm of political gibberish .
( Be sure to stick around until the 2:26 mark for maximum effect . )
Best of all , I still have no idea what Carly 's plans are for California .
But if they 're similar to what her plans were for Hewlett - Packard , I 'll pass .

After a couple of weeks playing phone tag , Unfair Park finally managed to connect with George M. Clayton , the District 12 State Board of Education candidate opposing incumbent Geraldine " Tincy " Miller in Tuesday 's GOP primary .
Clayton has been something of a mystery man to the Republican Party folk and state board watchers we 've spoken with , and we wanted to ask him why he 's running .
" I think the state board needs an educator , " replied Clayton , 60 , an academic coordinator and English administrator at North Dallas High School .
Clayton said he particularly incensed by the " stranglehold that standardized testing has on education in Texas . "
Says the teacher , " In spite of all the lies you hear from some those [ board ] members and members of local ISDs , teachers do teach to the TAKS test , and that 's all they do .
And the reason they do that is that if they do n't do well on the TAKS test teachers are threatened and stressed out constantly under the threat of losing their jobs . "
Texas student are required to pass the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills -- or TAKS -- test to graduate high school or be promoted in grades 3 , 5 and 8 .
It 's being replaced by a new , similar exam , the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness ( STAAR ) in 2011 .
( Education bureaucrats are like the military in their love of unwieldy acronyms . )
Complaints that education in Texas has been reduced to " teaching to the test " are common , particularly among teachers , but there 's one problem with Clayton running for the State Board of Education on an anti-standardized testing platform :
The SBOE has precious little to do with the TAKS or STAAR .
The exams are mandated by the Legislature and developed by the Texas Education Agency .
The board 's role is oblique , at best :
It designs the classroom curricula that will be eventually be covered by the tests .
And it 's the raucous battles over curricula standards that have brought attention in recent years to a board that once was a quiet little backwater in Austin , as a group of seven Christian conservatives have led battles over sex education , the teaching of evolution and the perceived " liberal " content of social studies and history books .
Unfair Park tried to pin Clayton down on where he stood on the GOP conservative spectrum -- using a form of reportorial shorthand .
We asked him how old the Earth is , figuring anything in the 10,000 - year range would peg him as a religious conservative .
" I 'm not going to cut it half and count the rings , " Clayton replied cannily .
OK , slippery answer .
( Also wrong , but never mind . )
We tried again : Should evolution be taught in science classrooms ?
Clayton said evolution is and should remain in science classrooms , but he thinks the alternative theories supported by the religious right -- intelligent design and creationism -- can " find a real nice home " in humanities , philosophy or world history classes .
" It 's seems to me you can't be taught the one [ evolution ] without the other [ creationism ] , " Clayton said .
" It 's an impossibility to talk about evolution without mentioning creationism . "
Right .
Of course .
You can't have physics without metaphysics .
Ca n't teach marine biology without mentioning mermaids .
And we still can't figure out why anyone in his or her right mind would want to serve on the State Board of Education .
By all appearances , Google 's trying to break Android free of the surly bonds of the manufacturers and carriers that support it , opening its own online store and selling unlocked Nexus Ones to anyone willing to pony up the $ 529 .
Problem is , the Nexus One as we know it today is only available in a configuration that supports North American 3G on AWS spectrum , meaning you 've got to go with the States ' fourth - largest carrier if you want to blaze -- you 've got no other option .
That 's not very " open , " is it , Google ?
That brings us to an FCC finding today .
Take a look at the two labels above ; the one on the right comes from the current Nexus One .
The label on the left , meanwhile , is physically identical and comes from a new filing for a device with FCC ID NM899110 .
The old Nexus One has ID NM899100 , so this new device is just a single digit off -- likely a variant of the existing model .
If you look into the RF reports a bit , you 'll immediately notice that the new handset supports 3G on WCDMA Bands I , II , and V , meaning that it'll work on AT&T ( and Rogers , Bell , and Telus for the Canadians in the room ) along with most of Europe .
Same label style , nearly identical model ID , different bands -- we think we know what 's going on here .
Google , your move .

DOCTOR
Who fan Rob Bosher is hoping to exterminate the competition with his hand - built Dalek .
He has been slaving away in his spare time to recreate a full - size monster from the hit TV series .
And after almost two years of hard work , the Time Lord ’s nemesis is finally finished .
The 47 - year - old , from Birtley , Gateshead , said the project had been a labour of love .
“ I ’ve been a Doctor Who fan since I was a little boy , ” said Rob .
“ I loved the old series when I was young .
And the special effects of the new version is brilliant .
“ I was n’t petrified of the Daleks when I was young , I was fascinated by them .
“ I always wanted to own a full - size Dalek , and then I came across a plan for making one on the internet .
It all started from there . ”
Rob , who works as a health care assistant , transformed his back yard into a workshop and started piecing together the Dalek bit by bit .
He has spent around £ 700 on the build , using off - cuts of wood and scrap or charity shop items where possible .
The robot has a base of an electric wheelchair , with a joystick - type control to direct its movements .
It is fully fitted with a voice modulator to create the trademark croaky Dalek voice and also has working lights and a moving eye – made from a magic eight ball .
“ I had never done anything like this before .
It was all a bit of a learning curve , ” Rob said .
“ I ’ve never been much of a DIY man , so I have learned a lot of skills by doing this – and sometimes getting it wrong .
“ I have never sanded so much in my life . ”
And his long - suffering family – wife Michelle , 45 , daughter Becky Donohue , 21 , 14 - year - old son James Donohue , and grand - daughter Holly , six months – have had to get used to living alongside the nemesis of the Doctor .
“ At the moment it is taking up the whole of our study , ” Rob explained .
“ I think my wife secretly likes it – although she would never admit it . ”
Rob now plans to put his creation to good use , and has already travelled to Rotherham to take part in a Children in Need charity event .
The gathering of Daleks , at a science museum in the city , raised over £ 1,000 for the charity .
“ I have just started a website for charity Daleks in the North East , ” Rob explained .
“ I think there are three or four people in the area who have one .
“ I hope to raise money for charity by attending events with the Dalek . ”
Is the United States the only country worried about its collective weight ?
A new Reader ’s Digest survey has analyzed responses from 16,000 people in 16 countries to find out what people around the world think about weight .
Here are some of the findings :
The most pressure to be thin : Brazilians topped the list , with 83 percent complaining that the culture places too much emphasis on weight .
India was second , at 68 percent , and the United States ranked third , with 62 percent complaining about an overemphasis on weight .
Wives who want their husband to lose weight : Just over half of married women in the United States want a thinner husband , while 47 percent of married American men said they were unhappy with their wife ’s weight .
Husbands who want their wife to lose weight : Indian men were most unhappy with their spouse ’s weight , with 48 percent saying they wished their wife was thinner .
Most likely to use weight loss pills :
The survey found that 37 percent of people in China had used weight loss drugs , followed by Brazil ( 30 percent ) , Russia ( 24 percent ) and Mexico ( 23 percent ) .
In the United States , 19 percent said they used diet pills .
Most likely to blame genetics : Seventy percent of Russians said their weight problems are inherited , followed by Germans ( 61 percent ) and Indians ( 50 percent ) .
In the United States , 20 percent of respondents blamed their genes for a weight problem .
Most likely to blame Americans :
More than any country surveyed , the French were most likely to blame American eating habits and American fast - food companies for spreading obesity .
Go to the Readers Digest Web site to read the full article , “ Global Poll : Weight Around the World , ” where you ’ll learn where people are most likely to use smoking to lose weight , where most people are happy as they are , and where weight is most likely to affect a job promotion or to ruin your sex life .
FAMILY members have criticised the hefty sentences handed out in Sydney 's terrorism trial , saying murderers get less .
" That 's a very big sentence , " said the sister of the youngest of five Muslim men sentenced to maximum terms of between 23 and 28 years .
" Not even murderers get sentenced that much .
" Twenty - three years , that 's half of his life , '' she said of the sentence imposed on her 25 - year - old brother .
" It 's not fair to him , our community or our religion . "
Relatives of some of the other men yelled out expletives as they heard the sentences via closed - circuit TV outside the court room at Parramatta in western Sydney .
One woman began sobbing as two men shouted " f*** ; " and left the building .
The sister , who said she attended every day of the 10 - month trial , said she believed her brother was innocent .
" He was not planning any mass murder or terrorist attack , " she said .
" He is no extremist ; the only extremists are people like ASIO , they go way deep . "
She said the jail sentences would only serve to strengthen the faith of the convicted men .
They would not cause a divide between Muslims and non-Muslims in the Australian community , or incite any other Muslims to take extremist action .
She read out a poem dedicated to her brother that said in part : " They handcuffed your spirit , they stole your freedom , they locked you up for a crime you did n't commit , they locked you up because you fit the script . "
She said her brother would have " the last laugh " because the truth would come out before God on judgment day .
' Serious case '
Justice Anthony
Whealy sentenced the men today in the New South Wales Supreme Court sitting at Parramatta .
Last October after four and a half weeks of deliberations , a jury found them guilty of the conspiracy which involved stockpiling explosive chemicals and firearms .
During the long - running trial , crown prosecutor Richard Maidment SC said the men were all devout Muslims driven by extremist beliefs to plot violent jihad in retaliation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
They spent months working together to acquire chemicals , firearms and ammunition , and extremist literature found in their homes showed they had violent intent , he said .
Justice
Whealy said the criminality involved in the enterprise fell " only marginally short of the most serious case " .
The men's motivation had been an " intolerant , inflexible religious conviction " and each had contempt for the Australian Government , its leaders and laws , he said .
Justice
Whealy said at the very least the men had intended to cause serious damage to property , but he could not conclude they had intended to kill people , although they were aware it was highly likely life would be endangered .
He said the evidence did not establish the precise nature or target of the plot .
" There is a wide range of material that has never been recovered , " he also noted .
None of the men had shown remorse and their prospects for rehabilitation were poor , the judge said .
EXCLUSIVE : Lane Kiffin Scandal and Cover Up Rumors
The above photo was taken at a party in the spring .
It shows Lane Kiffin , Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin , and Kiffin 's brother - in - law David Reaves chatting up some co-eds .
According to sources , former Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin fraternized with co-eds often , and did more than just knock back a few beers with them .
Sources tell us that boosters maintained a downtown apartment in Knoxville that was commonly referred to as Kiffin 's " rendezvous place . "
Sources also say that following the Tennessee - Western Kentucky game , a local sports bar opened the doors for the coach , some of the boosters and several co-eds late at night .
Afterward , Kiffin and a few of the boosters and co-eds left the club to continue their fun at the downtown apartment .
In an unrelated incident , we have also received information that in true Tiger Woods fashion , Kiffin was allegedly driving a vehicle provided by Lexus of Knoxville and was involved in a car accident .
Several co-eds were in the car , and Kiffin -- who had been drinking , was picked up by a neighbor and left the girls at the scene .
The car was reportedly returned to the dealership the next day with extensive damage .
( Calls to the dealership owner have not been returned )

Scientistsu , engineers , and doctors yearn for tiny sensors to record a vast array of events in the world 's many hard - to - reach places .
And so far , the tradeoff between battery life and size has prevented sensors from becoming small enough to fit unobtrusively in the human body , or inside very small machines .
Now , University of Michigan researchers seem to have solved that puzzle by creating a chip that draws energy through solar power , heat , or movement .
By forgoing a large battery for perpetual environmental power , the U of M scientists managed to produce a sensor 1,000 times smaller than any other similar device .

On the morning of December 6 , 1917 , two passenger trains en route to the port city of Halifax , Nova Scotia were stopped in response to a brief , cryptic telegraph message sent from Halifax station : “ Munition ships on fire .
Making for Pier 6 . Goodbye . ”
The ship described in the message was the French munitions ship Mont - Blanc , which was adrift in Halifax harbor , burning , and loaded with almost 2,700 tonnes of explosives intended for use in the first world war which was then raging in Europe .
On both sides of the harbor , hundreds of onlookers who were unaware of the danger had gathered on the shores to watch the spectacular fire .
The burning ship slowly drifted into the pier on the west side , where its flames spread onto land .
The fire department arrived in their first motorized fire engine , and began rolling out the hoses in an attempt to douse the flames , but their efforts proved futile .
Within minutes , the Mont - Blanc ’s highly explosive cargo of TNT , picric acid , and benzol fuel finally reached a tipping point , and the ship exploded in a ball of fire and energy more powerful than any man-made explosion before it .
The morning had started like so many others , with ships beginning to move in and out of the harbor through the narrows after the antisubmarine nets were opened for the day .
The Mont -Blanc , captained by Aimé Le Médec , was entering by way of the right channel at a leisurely four knots when another ship , the Norwegian Relief ship Imo , was spotted approaching from the opposite direction in the path of Mont - Blanc .
The Imo was traveling the wrong direction for the channel it was in , and moving at almost seven knots , which was exceeding the speed limit of the harbor .
The narrows left little room for maneuvering .
Mont -Blanc blew its whistle once , the standard signal to assert right - of - way , essentially ordering the Imo to move into the proper channel .
The Imo ’s whistle sang out twice in response , signaling that the Imo ’s captain intended to maintain its course .
Both captains refused to yield as the whistles blew hurried signals at one another through the morning haze , until at the last minute both captains ordered actions to attempt to avoid collision .
The Mont - Blanc turned hard to the left , and the Imo put all engines in full reverse , which caused it to drift towards the center .
Imo ’s prow struck the starboard side of the other ship , and as the steel hulls scraped across one another , a shower of sparks flew which ignited the vapors from the barrels of benzol fuel on the deck of the Mont - Blanc .
Her crew , aware of the danger posed by their cargo , quickly abandoned ship as the flames rapidly grew , feeding on the benzol .
As they rowed to shore they cried warnings at the people gathered there to watch the bright flames and oily black smoke erupting from the Mont - Blanc .
But none of the Frenchmen spoke English , so their warnings were not understood .
The people watched as the blazing ship slowly drifted up the shoreline until it came to rest at pier 6 , setting the pier ’s wooden pilings ablaze .
A nearby tugboat , which had earlier dodged the Imo to avoid collision , trained its fire hose on the flames , and attempted to tow the Mont - Blanc away from the pier without success .
Fire crews from the city also began to arrive to fight the inferno .
The harbor staff , aware of the ship ’s explosive cargo and the danger it posed to the city , attempted to organize an evacuation .
Workers in waterfront business were ordered to leave , and the workers for the Intercolonial Railway of Canada were warned away as well .
One man , a train dispatcher named Vincent Coleman , realized that two passenger trains were still inbound from Bedford , and returned to the telegraph office to signal Rockingham Station to hold any trains inbound for Halifax .
He sent the warning successfully , but it was the last thing he ever did .
At 9:04 AM , after having weathered the inferno for twenty minutes , Mont - Blanc ’s massive and unstable cargo finally exploded .
The resulting blast was enormous .
A cubic mile of air was consumed by the terrific explosion , whose force was sufficient to annihilate the Mont - Blanc and push the sea away , exposing the harbor floor for an instant .
An estimated 1,000 people were killed instantly by the blast , which tore buildings to pieces and shattered every window within fifty miles .
Flying glass and splintered wood caused numerous gruesome injuries throughout the city as the pressure wave shredded many of the city ’s wooden structures .
Doors were blasted open , and wood stoves were toppled , touching off fires throughout the city .
The intense heat of the explosion caused cyclones around the harbor , wreaking further destruction .
Immediately after the initial blast , the twisted , red - hot remains of the Mont - Blanc began to rain upon Halifax , as well as the city of Dartmouth across the harbor .
People blown off their feet by the explosion were soon clinging to whatever they could as a tsunami of water rushed over the shoreline and through the dockyard .
The sea was brought to eighteen meters above the high water mark , toppling smokestacks and wrenching buildings from their foundations as a mushroom cloud hung overhead .
Two and a half square kilometers of Halifax was completely flattened by the blast .
Many thought that the city had been attacked by Germany , but there was little time to consider the cause of the destruction .
Entire city blocks were afire , and countless people were injured or trapped in the rubble .
The area of Halifax along the shoreline⁠ — what had been known as Richmond⁠ — made up the majority of what would soon come to be known as the Devastated Area .
As black , oily soot rained down from the mushroom cloud , survivors found the streets of Halifax were littered with severed arms , legs , heads , and mutilated torsos .
A huge number of people had received injuries from flying debris and glass , particularly to the face and eyes due to the large number of people who had been watching the fire through their windows .
Hospitals were rapidly filled beyond capacity , where doctors began to use triage methods , sending the people with non-life - threatening injuries away from the hospitals to aid stations .
Medical facilities were packed so tight that it was difficult to move about , and some battered survivors awoke only to find themselves left for dead in back rooms .
Local doctors performed surgeries on their own kitchen tables , using ordinary cotton thread for sutures and their own torn - up shirts for bandaging .
Two American ships which had just left Halifax returned when they saw the explosion and mushroom cloud , and offered the assistance of their medical nurses and orderlies .
Firefighters from neighboring cities arrived before nightfall to help in the effort to put out the burning structures , but many of their fire hoses were of different sizes , and unable to connect to the Halifax taps and hydrants .
The rescue effort was not an easy one .
Most of the utilities had been knocked out of commission by the blast , and many of the people working to save their fellow citizens were injured themselves .
A panic was stirred up after rumors of second impending explosion , sending many rescue workers retreating to higher ground .
The second explosion never came , but the distraction was a significant setback to rescue efforts .
The following day , the already battered city was hit by a brutal blizzard which caused further complications .
But American medical teams began arriving 48 hours after the explosion , offering relief for exhausted doctors , nurses , and rescue workers .
All told , about 2,000 men , women , and children were killed that day , and some 9,000 injured .
Makeshift mortuaries were left with the grim duty of processing bodies , which arrived by the dozens .
Trains came and went from the city , bringing in men and women to help in the rescue efforts , and hauling away the dead , injured , and homeless .
Dartmouth was less hard - hit , but far from spared .
Approximately one hundred souls died there , and many of its buildings were damaged by the blast .
On that day , the Halifax explosion was the most powerful explosion that had ever been created by man .
As a result of the blast , the Imo was found beached on the Dartmouth shore , lifted there by the massive tidal wave .
One of the Mont - Blanc ’s cannon barrels was thrown three and a half miles , and her 1 / 2 ton anchor was later found two miles in the opposite direction .
The event would hold the record as the most powerful man-made explosion for the next twenty - eight years , when it was bested by the the first atomic bomb test explosion in 1945 .
There would also be political questions within the core .
Many West Germans were appalled by the cost of national unification when East Germany merged into the current German state .
If they did not like subsidizing people who in some cases were their cousins , how will they like subsidizing Greeks or Portuguese ?
Perhaps of more importance , how can the troubled economies regain competitiveness within Europe ?
Before the use of the euro , when Europe tried to maintain exchange rate stability but kept separate currencies , there were periodic sharp devaluations of some currencies , most notably the Italian lira .
That made those countries competitive again , for a time .
Europe ’s Growth and Stability Pact , which sets the rules for euro membership , limits the size of budget deficits .
It was supposed to prevent such problems .
But it was largely toothless , especially after Germany and France found it convenient to violate its terms when it suited their economic needs .

Political union would not cure the underlying economic problems , but it would make it easier for a European government to provide assistance to ailing areas through transfers of tax revenue and special spending programs , and for Continentwide laws to be enacted even if they were deeply unpopular in some areas .
Even then , problems could arise .
In the United States now , some states , including California , are in severe financial straits .
California represents a larger part of the American economy than Greece does of the European one , but even if it did default it would not create a national debt crisis , and Washington could provide help .
The world has sought currency stability across national borders many times .
The gold system was such an effort , but it retained separate national currencies whose value against gold could be adjusted if need be .
Some economists think that maintaining artificially high exchange rates was a cause of the Great Depression .

This is one of the most timely and insightful articles I ’ve read in a long time – the editorial from the new issue of Turbulence magazine .
They discuss the economic crisis within the frame of the collapse of the neoliberal order that has been the standard - bearer of global capitalism for the last 30 - 35 years , resulting in a state of “ limbo ” where no “ deal ” exists tying the system together .
Nevertheless , the system persists like a zombie , dead and discredited but carried forward by sheer momentum and the fact that nothing else has shown itself capable of replacing it .
Our job then , is to hold up an alternative way of life ( a new “ common ground ” ) that values communities and the planet above narrow profit , and that job becomes easier by studying analysis like this .

Life in Limbo ?
By Turbulence
We are trapped in a state of limbo , neither one thing nor the other .
For more than two years , the world has been wracked by a series of interrelated crises , and they show no sign of being resolved anytime soon .
The unshakable certainties of neoliberalism , which held us fast for so long , have collapsed .
Yet we seem unable to move on .
Anger and protest have erupted around different aspects of the crises , but no common or consistent reaction has seemed able to cohere .
A general sense of frustration marks the attempts to break free from the morass of a failing world .
There is a crisis of belief in the future , leaving us with the prospect of an endless , deteriorating present that hangs around by sheer inertia .
In spite of all this turmoil – this time of ‘ crisis ’ when it seems like everything could , and should , have changed – it paradoxically feels as though history has stopped .
There is an unwillingness , or inability , to face up to the scale of the crisis .
Individuals , companies and governments have hunkered down , hoping to ride out the storm until the old world re-emerges in a couple of years .
Attempts to wish the ‘ green shoots ’ of recovery into existence mistake an epochal crisis for a cyclical one ; they are little more than wide - eyed boosterism .
Yes , astronomical sums of money have prevented the complete collapse of the financial system , but the bailouts have been used to prevent change , not initiate it .
We are trapped in a state of limbo .
Crisis in the middle
And yet , something did happen .
Recall those frightening yet heady days that began in late 2008 , when everything happened so quickly , when the old dogmas fell like autumn leaves ?
They were real .
Something happened there : the tried and tested ways of doings things , well - rehearsed after nearly 30 years of global neoliberalism , started to come unstuck .
What had been taken as read no longer made sense .
There was a shift in what we call the middle ground : the discourses and practices that define the centre of the political field .
To be sure , the middle ground is not all that there is , but it is what assigns the things in the world around it a greater or lesser degree of relevance , validity or marginality .
It constitutes a relatively stable centre against which all else is measured .
The farther from the centre an idea , project or practice is , the more likely it is to be ignored , publicly dismissed or disqualified , or in some way suppressed .
The closer to it , the more it stands a chance of being incorporated – which in turn will shift the middle more or less .
Neither are middle grounds defined ‘ from above ’ , as in some conspiratorial nightmare .
They emerge out of different ways of doing and being , thinking and speaking , becoming intertwined in such a way as to reinforce each other individually and as a whole .
The more they have become unified ‘ from below ’ as a middle ground , the more this middle ground acquires the power of unifying ‘ from above ’ .
In this sense , the grounds of something like ‘ neoliberalism ’ were set before something was named as such ; but the moment when it was named is a qualitative leap : the point at which relatively disconnected policies , theories and practices became identifiable as forming a whole .
The naming of things like Thatcherism in the UK , or Reaganism in the US , marked such a moment for something that had been constituting itself for some time before , and which has for the past three decades dominated the middle ground : neoliberalism , itself a response to the crisis of the previous middle , Fordism / Keynesianism .
The era of the New Deal and its various international equivalents had seen the rise of a powerful working class that had grown used to the idea that its basic needs should be met by the welfare state , that real wages would rise , and that it was always entitled to more .
Initially , the centrepiece of the neoliberal project was an attack on this ‘ demanding ’ working class and the state institutions wherein the old class compromise had been enshrined .
Welfare provisions were rolled back , wages held steady or forced downwards , and precariousness increasingly became the general condition of work .
But this attack came at a price .
The New Deal had integrated powerful workers ’ movements – mass - based trade unions – into the middle ground , helping to stabilise a long period of capitalist growth .
And it provided sufficiently high wages to ensure that all the stuff generated by a suddenly vastly more productive industrial system – based on Henry Ford ’s assembly line and Frederick Taylor ’s ‘ scientific management ’ – could be bought .
Bit by bit , the ferocious attack on the working classes of the global North was offset by low interest rates ( i.e. cheap credit ) and access to cheap commodities , mass - produced in areas where wages were at their lowest ( like China ) .
In the global South , the prospect of one day attaining similar living conditions was promised as a possibility .
In this sense , neoliberal globalisation was the globalisation of the American dream : get rich or die trying .
Clearly , neoliberalism also relied on a ‘ deal ’ of some kind .
But the word here has a different meaning ; its mode of attraction / incorporation was quite unlike that of Fordism / Keynesianism .
The latter involved visible , constituted collective forces through the likes of trade unions or farmers ’ organisations ; the former worked more as a buyout from the original deal , addressing individuals directly as individuals .
It was a middle ground that emerged out of ‘ deviant ’ desires , discourses and practices that looked for ways out of the existing one ( the fear that unions had become too powerful , dissatisfaction with the drab uniformity of everything , para - statal practices of corruption that compensated an over - regulated life ) , and as such were very much about individualisation .
Indeed , it aimed to create a certain kind of individual , an atomised self - entrepreneur whose collective social ties are subordinated to the search for private gain .
Crisis of the common
Today , the neoliberal deal is null and void ; the middle ground has crumbled away .
We ’ve gone past the era when cheap credit , rising asset prices and falling commodity prices could compensate for stagnant wages .
Those days are over but no new middle ground has cohered .
Nobody has ‘ agreed ’ any replacement ‘ deal ’ .
That ’s why we find ourselves in a state of limbo .
Mind you , deals and middle ground do n’t necessarily go hand in hand .
A new middle ground might result from a deal , explicit ( like that of the New Deal of the 1930s ) or implicit ( like neoliberalism ) – indeed , it will be firmer , more stable , if this is the case .
But a new centre of the political field can also emerge without one .
A middle ground does not require the degree of consent implied by a deal ; it ’s a sufficient but not a necessary condition .
It does , however , always involve a process of attraction and incorporation of forces that could threaten it – the extent of which is defined by the terms of each emerging middle ground itself .
Striking a deal is like agreeing – consciously or otherwise – to a ( temporary ) truce following a fierce battle .
But a middle ground could establish itself in the midst of a period of ongoing conflict and contestation – a more protracted struggle of attrition .
From our current vantage point , much is unknown .
We certainly can’t predict the duration or outcome of the struggle over what becomes the new political ‘ common sense ’ .
Moreover , the sides are n’t even clear .
Finding out who your allies are only really happens once a fight has been picked .
So who will be fighting whom and about what ?
What will be the common ground among movements in the new struggles and those further down the line ?
Our concept of ‘ common ground ’ is , like middle grounds , a theoretical tool .
We use it to name the intersections and resonances of diverse struggles , practices , discourses , targets and referents .
In the previous alter - globalisation movement , the common ground was the shared ‘ One No ’ – against the monopolising logic of neoliberalism – along with the acceptance that there were ‘ Many Yeses ’ – the multiplicity of alternative notions of economy , commons and sociality .
For many years , many movements could meet and recognise one another as kindred on this common ground of rejection of neoliberalism – without denying their difference .
But the shattering of the middle ground means a common ground rooted in antagonism to it now lies in ruins .
SHIFTING GROUNDS
From madness to mainstream ?
Until recently , anyone who suggested nationalising the banks would have been derided as a quack and a crank , as lacking the most basic understanding of economics and the functioning of a ‘ complex , globalised world ’ .
So strong was the grip of ‘ orthodoxy ’ that such an idea would have been disqualified without the need to offer a counter - argument .
Yet over the past year , governments around the world have effectively nationalised large parts of the financial sector , while handing over dizzyingly large amounts of public money to those institutions that remained in private hands .
Similar moves into the mainstream have taken place with the discourses around climate change and commons .
Every ‘ serious ’ politician must at least appear to be concerned about global warming .
And the ‘ commons ’ , long an exclusive focus of the left , has also entered the vocabulary of centrist intellectuals and politicians : from widening recognition of the ‘ public benefits ’ of access to cheap drugs and other intellectual property , to cautiously approving comments in The Economist , and the economics professions ’ faux Nobel prize going to Elinor Ostrom for her work on commons .
Put these together and some might argue that the centre of gravity of public discourse has shifted to the left .
Yet it cannot escape notice that the recent nationalisations were argued for precisely on the grounds that they are necessary to save financialised capitalism , not as part of a social democratic programme of redistribution , let alone a strategy for a socialist transition .
Likewise , the new green economy that is now on politicians ’ public agendas aims to maintain a big - business , productivist model of development by marrying it to more environmentally sustainable energies and processes .
So things have changed , but , trapped in limbo , the extent of change is by no means obvious .
Let us be clear , then , about where things have started to happen .
Perhaps the most obvious change is at the level of what can be said – what can be accepted as valid argument , rather than being consigned to a wilderness inhabited by raging ideologues , and the ignorant .
In its heyday , neoliberal ideology was effective in banishing all other thought because it posed as non-ideological , as merely the ‘ reasonable ’ application of the ‘ science ’ of utility .
Today , however , it is possible to see ( and say ) that the presuppositions of these reasonable decisions were , of course , ideological .
The market does not tend toward equilibrium , the maximisation of self - interest can override instincts of self - preservation and lead to sub-optimal outcomes , and in times of crisis any trickle down is reverted into the upstream splurge of bailouts .
The premises of those supposedly non-ideological arguments – such as the transformation of ‘ the market ’ into a natural given governed by scientific laws available to ortho - dox ( ‘ correct opinion ’ ) but not to hetero - dox ( ‘ other opinion ’ ) economists – have now been debunked .
Hardcore neoliberal ideology will cease to shape the space of politics by defining its terms , what is good and bad ( investment rather than public spending , efficient private versus inefficient public , markets not planning ) , and pulling the centre of gravity of the debate towards itself .
Neoliberal orthodoxy no longer forms the middle ground of politics in regard to which all other opinions have to position themselves .
Zombie - liberalism
But does the disappearance of the ideological middle ground mean that the neoliberal era is actually over ?
Or is this just a pause , a kind of radical diet to shed inefficient capital and institutions , in order for neoliberalism to emerge leaner and meaner at the other end ?
On the one hand , rather than the banking system being restructured , and financial capital being subordinated to political direction , the recent bailout mania has simply been a massive robber - baron - style plunder of public resources , exacerbating 30 years of neoliberal upward redistribution of wealth .
On the other , this major heist has lost its ideological justification , and been revealed as just that : theft .
Neoliberalism has always had two sides .
It was both a counterattack by elites against social gains won by workers ’ and other movements from the 1930s onwards , an attempt to shift wealth back up the social ladder ; and an ideological project claiming to rid ‘ the markets ’ of unwarranted intervention by governments and their ilk .
What remains of neoliberalism once the ideological padding comes off ?
It is no longer a ( relatively ) coherent politico - economic programme : it has become the plunder of a retreating army , a way of booby - trapping the political system before it has to relinquish control over it .
But these booby traps , even if stripped of their ideological camouflage , are dangerous and deadly .
In all the countries that have seen bailouts and / or financial crises , the enormous government deficits created are now being used by exactly those social forces that most benefited from them ( in absolute terms ) to argue that they should be paid off through yet more rounds of austerity and spending cuts .
By handing over control to some ‘ safe hands ’ outside any form of accountability , neoliberalism gets locked in .
A neat trick : the financial sector uses the debts incurred bailing it out to secure continued control over policy .
The picture is confusing , and gets even more so .
As credit dries up and food and energy prices rise , workers are left underpaid and , in the North , over - indebted – a so - called recovery that does n’t massively increase wages and / or cancel personal debt will not change that .
Deal ’s off , as it were .
But if there is no more deal , and no more ideology , what of the social basis of neoliberalism – the neoliberal power bloc ?
In short , it is in disarray , if not totally shattered .
There is no longer any social group that can credibly claim ‘ leadership ’ in society , politics , culture or the economy .
‘ The centre cannot hold ’ , the middle ground is broken , leaving behind a confused and vicious army , institutions no longer guided by a coherent framework , political parties still vying for power but without any real programmes .
So if the power bloc is weak , engaged in obvious , large - scale looting of the system it used to run , and if – above all – the ideological core of neoliberalism is gone , why is a new middle ground failing to emerge ?
Why is the apparent discursive shift to the left not paying off in practical terms ?
The answer lies at least partly in the fact that the neoliberal project relied a lot less on ideology than its critics tended to think .
Theories and ideologies are used to create neoliberal ideologues and activists , but persuasion through argument is n’t how it transforms our subjectivities and the limits of what we perceive possible .
These changes are brought about more operationally than ideologically , that is , through interventions into the composition of society .
Neoliberalism re-organises material processes in order to bring about the social reality that its ideology claims already exists .
It attempts to create its own presuppositions .
Rather than being persuaded by the power of neoliberal arguments , people are trained to view themselves as rational benefit - maximisers , those elusive creatures of economic theory .
This training takes place through a forced engagement with markets , not just in our economic activities , but in every sphere of our lives : in education , health care , child care , you name it .
Take the school system in Britain .
An army of government inspectors and statisticians compiles mountains of data on schools ’ performance ; parents , for their part , are expected to use this information to make the best decision regarding school choice .
Education is seen as preparing bodies for the labour market , so ‘ rational choice ’ is invoked to justify the channelling of certain students into vocational training from an early age .
Meanwhile , many ‘ middle - class ’ parents attempt to maximise their offspring ’s chances of ‘ getting the best start in life ’ by engaging private tutors or dragging themselves to church every Sunday morning ( Anglican faith schools having the best reputation ) .
Effectively , people are forced to become human capital , little enterprises locked in competition with others – an isolated atom entirely responsible for itself .
In this context accepting the individual ‘ deal ’ offered by neoliberalism made sense .
Neoliberalism is n’t – or was n’t – just about changes in global governance or how states should be governed : it is about the management of individuals , about how you should live .
It set up a model of life , and then established mechanisms that shepherded you towards ‘ freely ’ choosing that manner of living .
The dice are loaded .
Today , if you want to participate in society , you have to behave as homo economicus .
In many ways it is this neoliberal coding , not just of public institutions and policy programmes , but of our very selves , that keeps us trapped in limbo .
Neoliberalism is dead but it does n’t seem to realise it .
Although the project no longer ‘ makes sense ’ , its logic keeps stumbling on , like a zombie in a 1970s splatter movie : ugly , persistent and dangerous .
If no new middle ground is able to cohere sufficiently to replace it , this situation could last a while … all the major crises – economic , climate , food , energy – will remain unresolved ; stagnation and long - term drift will set in ( recall that the crisis of Fordism took longer than an entire decade , the 1970s , to be resolved ) .
Such is the ‘ unlife ’ of a zombie , a body stripped of its goals , unable to adjust itself to the future , unable to make plans .
A zombie can only act habitually , continuing to operate even as it decomposes .
Is n’t this where we find ourselves today , in the world of zombie - liberalism ?
The body of neoliberalism staggers on , but without direction or teleology .
Any project that wants to slay this zombie will have to operate on many different levels , just as neoliberalism did , which means that it must be tied to a new manner of living .
And it must start from the here and now , the current composition of global society , large parts of which are still in the grip of the neoliberal zombie .
This is the greatest challenge facing those advocating a New or Green New Deal .
It is n’t a case of simply changing elite thinking or dabbling with government spending : it requires a more fundamental change .
Not just a change of consciousness at the head of society , but a transformation of the social body .
The middle and the common
We can detect many symptoms of the waning of the old middle ground .
In a way , this is where the significance of the Obama phenomenon lies : a political project that comes to power on a tide of vague promises of ‘ hope ’ and ‘ change ’ speaks less of the strength of its own ideas than of the weakness of others .
Meanwhile , on the other side of the Atlantic , we have seen the collapse of the parliamentary left in a number of recent elections .
Whether in or out of power , Europe ’s centre - left parties have been punished at the ballot box , while the vote for the right has generally held up better .
Many have been mystified as to why the centre - left has taken the blame for the economic crisis , but the left that embraced neoliberalism became the truest of believers : it was they who came to see it as a progressive force that could bring development even to the world ’s poor .
( There is never a greater zealot than a convert . )
It is the obliteration of this illusion that has led to the neoliberal left ’s collapse .
So does that mean that the many left - wing critics of neoliberalism ( and , sometimes , capitalism ) , from the radical left parties to the alter - globalists of Seattle and Genoa , can now simply bask in a self - satisfied glow ?
They can now claim to have been right all along in opposing not only the neoliberal triad of financialisation , deregulation and privatisation , but also the Blairite Third Way ?
We count ourselves amongst these critics , and we have certainly been right about some of these things – the instability of the neoliberal credit system , say .
But one of the worst mistakes we could make right now would be to assume that old answers and certainties are still valid .
With the disappearance of the old , anti-neoliberal common ground , and the emergence of new struggles , we must not only revisit the question of who ‘ we ’ are ( or were ) .
We must also construct a new ‘ we ’ .
We need a new attentiveness to emerging responses to the present conjuncture .
We need a capacity to recognise at what levels these responses communicate and an active effort to identify the points where they overlap and reinforce each other .
In other words , we need – collectively – to create , identify and name new common grounds .
The work of naming a common ground is for the most part analytic : it seeks to identify the components and directions of different trajectories , and to act back on them to strengthen commonalities , work through tensions that can be resolved , recognise the sources of those that can’t .
Of course , the act of naming something as a common ground always entails proposing a partial synthesis ; but this synthesis can only be as effective as the depth of the analysis that underpins it .
It only works to the extent that what it names means something to those to whom it speaks .
Common grounds , like middle grounds , have a double character .
On the one hand they have an ‘ objective ’ side : diverse practices , subjectivities , struggles and projects may share common aspects , or even resonate with one another , even if the one is unaware of the other .
On the other hand , common grounds may have a subjective side , which requires a certain self - awareness and the ability to recognise what ’s common in other struggles or projects .
The ‘ one no ’ rejection of neoliberalism is an obvious example of a self - aware , subjective common ground .
It takes an active effort to identify common grounds , but identifying and maintaining them helps make them more effective .
This self - awareness creates a feedback loop that can allow the common ground to gain consistency and exceed the established middle ground ’s ability to contain it .
Common grounds contain an element of autonomy , asking their own questions on their own terms .
This leads to the next question : how do common grounds affect middle grounds ?
To begin with , this often occurs in ways that are invisible , as centrifugal forces countering the middle ground ’s centripetal pull .
They are new practices and ways of living and thinking that deviate from the synthesis ; they spread out without necessarily becoming a visible challenge to the middle .
Think of the many hidden struggles of factory or office workers that slow down the pace of work without organising a strike ; the impact on society of gays and lesbians carving out of niches for their desires ; of the syncretic religions of Latin America and Africa , where indigenous and slaves practised their traditions right under the nose of the colonisers .
Think of the advent of the pill and the way it gave women more power over their own bodies , producing mutations in sexual relations , in social roles and identities .
Such phenomena become visible when they rub up against the middle ground , coming into conflict with existing institutions and practices .
Common grounds problematise the way that the middle ground has composed the world , posing problems that it ca n’t get to grips with .
The effects of such unnamed common grounds and the mutations they produce can still be limited , and are often accompanied by some form of disqualification or repression .
Common grounds become more powerful and their effects more pronounced when they are made both visible and named .
This is when their centrifugal force is turned into open antagonism .
But this antagonism is not simply an end in itself .
During the 1990s , when the neoliberal middle ground was at its strongest , its most ‘ hegemonic ’ , it was necessary to name and maintain an antagonism that remained at a distance to the middle ground precisely because one of neoliberalism ’s dogmas – the ‘ end of history ’ – had proclaimed the end of all antagonism .
Today , the situation is different .
Globally , the left appears to be weak , but the simultaneous and equivalent weakness of the middle ground gives ‘ us ’ a unique ability to intervene into the shaping of the new middle ground .
The work of naming new common grounds is at the same time the work of increasing our power to shape the outcome of the many global crises , by influencing the way they are dealt with .
We should be aware , however , that the emergence of a common ground that unsettles a middle ground is not necessarily a good thing .
We could think here of the genesis of neoliberalism itself .
The Mont Pelerin Society , founded by Friedrich Hayek in 1947 , studied free - market ideas throughout Keynesianism ’s ‘ golden age ’ , as did that circle of admirers that gathered around Russian - American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand in the 1950s .
The Mont Pelerin Society ’s members included George Shultz and Milton Friedman – Shultz went on to serve in the Nixon and Reagan administrations and , at the University of Chicago , both men trained the ‘ Chicago boys ’ who liberalised Latin American economies in the 1970s and ’ 80s .
The young Alan Greenspan , who later became Chairman of the Federal Reserve , was a member of Rand ’s circle .
These free - market thinkers and activists articulated a common ground that profoundly unsettled the Keynesian / Fordist middle and went on to destroy it .
Towards new common grounds ?
But while we might appear to be trapped in limbo , history is still being made .
In the last few years we have seen the irruption of a multiplicity of struggles , some more visible than others .
In parts of the global North a direct action movement against climate change and for climate justice has emerged and grown rapidly .
There ’s been an increase in political activity around universities – such as the wave of occupations and strikes across Italy against the country ’s Education Reform Bill , and mass protests against the raising of tuition fees and job losses at the University of California .
In some cases , protest movements have emerged around issues directly connected to the financial crisis , for example , in Iceland , Ireland , France ( remember ‘ bossnapping ’ ? ) ; or , as in Greece , they have tapped into the widespread social malaise concerning the lack of prospects for the ‘ 700 - euro generation ’ .
In Latin America , surely the part of the world where left forces are most ascendant , there have been explosive indigenous struggles around the control of natural resources .
Indigenous people in Peru successfully confronted the government and its army to prevent the destruction of forests and livelihoods in the pursuit of new sources of oil .
Elsewhere , the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has fought the Nigerian army to a standstill and disrupted several of Shell ’s operations in the area .
In South Korea , sacked workers occupying the SsangYong car plant in Seoul fought pitched battles with the police and army , only to be dislodged after a massive security operation .
While the list could go on and on , it is hard to avoid the impression that these struggles have remained relatively separate from each other .
By and large , they have not resonated sufficiently to constitute new common grounds .
But : we can be certain on a few points and , from here , it may be possible to identify some emergent tendencies .
First and foremost , we know that in an epochal crisis such as this one , both new middle and new common grounds will initially have to emerge around the problematics that brought the old era to its knees .
Take again the crisis of Fordism .
By the 1970s , not only had persistently high wages led to a crisis of profitability , there were also widespread fears that unions had become too strong , the state too expansive and too bureaucratic , life too uniform .
The success of the neoliberal project , at least in its Anglo - American heartlands , lay partly in the fact that it effectively tackled these problems , that it captured previously ‘ deviant ’ desires , discourses and practices by promising individuals the ability to realise them .
When neoliberalism crushed the unions , shrank the welfare bureaucracy , ended stagnation and beat inflation , it on the one hand effectively addressed the problems that brought the old New Deal to its knees , and on the other , laid the groundwork for a new set of systemic problems to emerge .
The first , most immediately obvious , problematic apparent in the crisis of neoliberalism appears very different , depending on where you are standing .
What from the top looks like an ‘ economic crisis ’ ( not enough growth , not enough profits , not enough demand ) is experienced , from below , as a ‘ crisis of social reproduction ’ .
Unemployment is soaring and national deficits are placing ever - greater constraints on social security .
The zombie - liberal response has been ultimately self - defeating : bail out the banks and some well - connected industries ( but at huge cost to governments , increasing deficit spending ) , try to re-inflate the bubble of cheap credit , and hope that someone will borrow the money that is made available .
Alas , there is no source of mass demand , no consumer of last resort , no new large - scale investment opportunities .
Along this road lies nothing but future ruin .
These two perspectives on the same crisis obviously call forth two different ‘ logical ’ responses .
While the reaction of zombie - liberalism makes sense according to its own ( undead ) logic , the logical response to the crisis of social reproduction is perhaps a strategy of commoning .
This would be a defence , creation and expansion of resources held in common and accessible to all : expanding public transport , socialising health care , guaranteeing a basic income , and so on .
This type of strategy would achieve two linked and essential goals .
First , it would address our immediate fears of losing our livelihoods – because it would create spaces where social reproduction becomes possible outside the crisis - ridden circuits of capital .
Second , it would counter the atomisation caused by three decades of neoliberal subjectivation in markets – just as engaging in market - based interactions tends to create market - subjects , engaging in commoning tends to create ‘ commonistic ’ subjectivities .
And if another , equally ‘ logical ’ , response to the economic crisis is the attempt to exclude certain people from collective resources , then the creation of open commons as a response to the crisis of social reproduction would counteract this , too .
Open commons would undermine the nativist , racist politics that are gaining ground , certainly in Europe , and in parts of Africa and Asia .
A second central problematic is that of the biocrisis , of the many socio-ecological crises that are currently afflicting the world as a result of the contradiction between capital ’s need for never - ending growth and the fact that we live on a finite planet .
Again , the biocrisis has two faces .
From the perspective of governments and capital , it looks like an emerging threat to social stability .
Climate change is undermining livelihoods , which increases the number of people forced to secure their reproduction through extra-legal means .
Large - scale movements of ‘ climate refugees ’ are feared by many governments .
Piracy is a response by Somali fisherfolk and others to over - fishing off the Horn of Africa .
But states and capital also perceive precisely these threats to social stability as opportunities to relegitimise political authority , to expand government powers and to kick - start a new round of ‘ green ’ economic growth , fuelled by uranium and austerity .
But the biocrisis , as the name implies , is one that threatens life ; and disproportionately the lives of those who have done the least to cause it .
Increasingly , the movements coalescing around this contradiction – between capital and life , growth and limits – are doing so around the notion of climate justice : the idea that responses to the crisis should undo rather than exacerbate existing injustices and imbalances of power , and that their construction should involve the direct participation of those affected .
Of course , we can not be sure that new middle and common grounds will emerge around either of these issues – the economic crisis / crisis of social reproduction and the biocrisis – but we are convinced that any successful new project will need to address both .
From commons to constitutions
Allowing a new common ground to emerge involves a moment of grace , a stepping back from the assumptions , tactics and strategies of the anti-neoliberal , counter - globalist protest cycle of the turn of the century .
The common ground constructed and maintained from that period must be recomposed through the prism of our contemporary situation .
The counter - globalisation movement was suspicious of – often even opposed to – institutions per se , constituted forms of power .
This suspicion was obvious , for example , in the tension within one of its most institutionalised forms , the World Social Forum ( WSF ) .
The reason for the counter - globalisation movement ’s scepticism was , of course , well founded : the result of the generalised recognition that neoliberal ideology had successfully colonised most social democratic parties and trade unions .
But when the crisis of neoliberalism irrupted , it became apparent that this mistrust of institutions had translated into an inability to consistently shape politics and the economy .
Antagonism against institutions as an end in itself is a dead end .
The power to vacate institutions leaves a void that politics , which abhors vacuum , tends to cover up with the calculations of piecemeal cooptation .
Moments of antagonism are either part of ongoing processes of building autonomy and constituting new forms of power , or they risk dissipation , or even worse , backlashes .
Today , it is necessary to have more than the sporadic show of strength : we need forms of organisation that start from the collective management of needs , that politicise the structures and mechanisms of social reproduction , and build force from there .
What form could these take in the present climate ?
Campaigns against foreclosures , around the cost of utility bills , private debt , energy resources … ?
In any case , what is needed are interventions that start from shared life and acquire their consistency there ; that employ moments of antagonism in order to increase their constituent power , rather than as ends in themselves .
If a decade ago , with the neoliberal doctrine at the height of its power and most institutional roads well and truly blocked , outright rejection was a credible tactic , the brittle ground of today presents us with very different problems .
We do , in fact , have some present examples of important transformations that have managed to inscribe themselves in institutional forms .
The most remarkable are undoubtedly the constituent processes in Bolivia and Ecuador , which have resulted in political constitutions that represent radical innovations not only in relation to the countries ’ histories , but to constitutional law itself .
First of all , because they give a form to a new arrangement of forces in which , for the first time in their history , the vast majority of the population actually has a voice , and some degree of representation .
More than that , however , in instituting pluri-nationality as a principle of the state , both of them signal a remarkable break with modern notions of sovereignty by recognising multiple , autonomous sovereign forms within the state itself , as well as acknowledging the historical debt of the colonisation process .
In the case of Ecuador , in fact , it is not only pluri-nationality , but also the indigenous concept of ‘ the good life ’ ( sumak kausay ) and the ‘ rights of nature ’ that are made into principles .
The latter , a unique invention in legal history , follows directly from the former : ‘ the good life ’ necessarily involves the environment in which one lives – not as the source from which , but as the medium in which , one subsists .
The idea that , in the modern parliamentary state , the world had found a definitive , non-perfectible form , was central to the ‘ end of history ’ doctrine .
While emphatically opposing the doctrine , the alterglobalist cycle seemed to accept the premise in inverse form : institutions were not subject to change .
But rejecting institutions as such does not follow necessarily from rejecting institutions - as - we - know - them .
But these constitutions can only be a beginning , and in a certain way , it is after they are written that the real constituent process begins : that of filling the letter of the text with real transformation .
This , indeed , is the real test that the Latin American ‘ Pink Tide ’ will have to confront very soon : it is not so much in an increasingly organised backlash ( see Honduras ) , but in the future of its own most - vaunted ‘ success ’ stories , that the question mark lies .
Of course , this is also a matter of new middle and common grounds : a question of how far from the old middle ground these processes can move , and what new common grounds will have to be constructed in order to affect them .
The recent experiences in Latin America have been , and remain , contradictory : the recognition of ‘ the rights of nature ’ and ‘ the good life ’ goes hand - in - hand with a resurrection of ‘ developmentalism ’ , increased exploitation of natural resources , and a renewed emphasis on primary commodity exports .
The question is : has the constituent power of existing movements been entirely spent in this process ?
Is the coming time one of consolidating gains instead of raising the game – of tactical rearguard manoeuvres rather than strategic movements ?
In Brazil , as in Bolivia , Venezuela etc. , will new dynamics below the state level rekindle the transformative energy that created the present situation , or will we see its cooling off and crystallisation ?
*****
How relevant are these processes , and these questions , to those of us outside Latin America ?
In many ways the continent , with institutional actors responsive to social movements ’ common ground , seems like an anomaly .
Indeed its anomalous status is perhaps a symptom of neoliberalism ’s breakdown .
Most of the world faces very different symptoms and a different set of questions :
If zombie - liberalism is an ongoing form of governance , then how can social movements affect the wider world ?
If there is no dominant middle ground for emergent common grounds to rub up against then how are struggles made visible ?
How do we form an antagonism against an incoherent enemy ?
If neoliberal subjectivities continue to be reproduced then how do we interrupt this process and create new subjects with expanded horizons ?
However , many current struggles are also premised on the idea that zombie - liberalism wo n’t persist and a new middle ground will emerge .
Just think of the movements around climate change where the battle is not only against inaction but simultaneously against the manner in which the problem is being framed and the solutions being offered .
From this perspective the Latin American anomaly can seem like an outpost from a potential future and its problematics can suddenly seem timely .
This is the true difficulty of acting in a crisis .
When the future is so unclear we must operate in many different worlds at once .
We must name a common ground , while keeping it open to new directions .
We must look for institutional interlocutors while accepting that , in part , we will have to create them ourselves .
We must set the conditions for a new middle ground to emerge while not getting trapped by it .
These are all , of course , difficult tasks but it is how a new ‘ we ’ is constructed .
The smallest step may seem near impossible now , but we should remember that once a new common ground begins to take shape , things can move very quickly .
Such is the fragility of the current state of things that a little movement could have a dramatic effect .
It may not take too much to tip a world gripped by entropy into a world full of potential .
by James W. Pennebaker
Most years since George Washington , the President of the United States has addressed the joint sessions of Congress along with leaders in the military , judiciary , and other parts of government in a public speech .
The purpose of the address is to summarize the accomplishments and problems of the nation and to lay out plans and expectations for the coming years .
Although the tone of the State of the Union addresses change from year to year , the occasion is generally a mixture of a sober analysis and political undertones .
The address is typically written , at least in part , by the president with help from experts , speechwriters , and aides .
Nevertheless , it generally reflects the leader ’s intentions , values , emotional and thinking styles , and personality .
Unlike the inaugural address , which is delivered to the nation once every four years , States of the Union ( SOU ) talks are delivered annually to the country ’s governing body .
The SOU , then , is a more business - like and detail oriented communication intended to direct Congress to move in specified directions .
As has been discussed elsewhere , the words people use reflect their social and psychological states .
When analyzing people ’s communication , it is possible to separate what they are saying from how they are saying it .
That is , different words reflect the content of the communication and others reveal the style of the message .
Very broadly , linguistic content is conveyed through the use of nouns , regular verbs , and some adjectives and adverbs .
Language style is apparent through a group of words variously referred to as function , style , or junk words .
These style - related words include pronouns , prepositions , articles , conjunctions , and auxiliary verbs .
Style or function words are quite different from content words in that there are very few of them , they are used at high rates , are processed in the brain differently , and are quite social .
For example , of the 50,000 to 100,000 words most English speakers have in their vocabulary , only about 500 are function words .
Despite the small number of these words , we use them in almost every sentence .
In fact , 50 - 60 percent of all the words we use are style words .
Of particular significance , these style words are social in the sense that they require a shared understanding between speaker and listener .
Over the last several years , multiple studies have found that the analysis of function words can reflect psychological dimensions of speakers .
Laboratory and real world studies indicate that pronouns and other style words predict a speaker ’s honesty , social status , emotional state , social connections with others , dominance , and thinking style .
Function words are linked to people ’s immediate psychological state within a given context and also can provide a broader view of their personality across situations and time .
SOU addresses are a perfect opportunity to study the psychological features of the nation ’s leaders within relatively formal contexts .
Unlike most speeches , SOUs are generally given in the same location , to the same types of dignitaries , at the same time of the year .
Although the speeches themselves have undoubtedly been shaped by others , they continue to reflect the personality and thinking of the president and his staff .
The Current Analyses – with special attention on Obama
All of the SOU addresses from Truman to Obama spanning from 1946 through 2010 were analyzed using the computerized text analysis program LIWC ( Pennebaker , Booth , & Francis , 2007 ) .
LIWC analyzes each speech , calculating the rates at which over 70 categories of words are used .
In addition , six broader categories of language are calculated based on previous research .
Social - emotional style .
Many speakers work to establish a close personal relationship between themselves and their audience .
Markers of this warm interpersonal style include the use of personal pronouns , high rates of positive and negative emotion words , and references to other people .
In general , people scoring higher on the social - emotional style dimension are individuals who truly enjoy talking and connecting with others .
As can be seen in Figure 1 , there has been a fascinating evolution in social - emotional language over the last 65 years – from very low social - emotional language to the second Bush ’s peak .
Obama is reversing this trend .
Not as emotionally or socially detached as Nixon and earlier presidents , his style is comparable to that of Reagan’s .
Figure 1 : Social - emotional style .
Higher numbers reflect use of more personal pronouns , references to other people , and emotional words .
Positive emotionality .
Speakers differ in the degree to which they convey feelings of positive and negative feelings in their speeches .
An overall positive emotionality index was computed by subtracting the percentage of negative emotion words from positive emotion words .
The higher the number , the more the speaker conveys optimism and the less he uses words that convey feelings of sadness , anxiety , or anger .
As can be seen in the second figure , Eisenhower , Carter , Reagan , and Clinton were consistently the most positive in their SOU addresses .
Obama is striking in being the least positive .
Figure 2 . Positive emotionality .
The higher the number , the more the person uses positive emotion words relative to negative emotion words .
Complex thinking .
An SOU address requires a certain degree of finesse to be effective .
The president needs to convey complex ideas in ways that a broad audience can understand .
Most issues facing a country – such as health care , national security , immigration – are composed of multiple dimensions that are often difficult to discuss in a simple way .
Since Truman , presidents have varied tremendously in their attempts to talk about large issues in complex ways .
Most opt to define problems simply and propose relatively straightforward solutions .
Function words allow for a nice metric to capture complexity of thinking .
When people are dealing with complicated problems they must acknowledge multiple sides to an issue .
Certain exclusive words – including but , except , without , or – signal that the speaker is making a distinction between what is and what is not included in the idea he is conveying .
Similarly , other word categories such as negations ( e.g. , no , not , never ) and causal words ( e.g. , because , cause , effect ) also reflect more complex thinking .
Figure 3 is a striking graph in suggesting that two presidents have been extraordinarily high in complex thinking – John F. Kennedy and Obama .
Nixon and George H. W. Bush are a distant 3rd and 4th .
It is also interesting that both Bush - 2 and Clinton are two of the least complex thinkers in their SOU addresses .
As a side note , the complex thinking dimension simply reflects the language that the president uses in the SOU address .
He may actually be a very complex thinker in general so these numbers merely tell us how he is presenting ideas to the congress and the American people .
Figure 3 . Complexity of thinking .
The higher the number , the more complex and nuanced the language in the presentation of arguments .
Categorical versus dynamic thinking .
There are multiple ways to break down a complex problem .
Perhaps the most traditional method is to try to categorize the issue .
For example , if asked to evaluate the current economy , a categorical thinker would likely identify the various components , then the subcomponents .
In other words , the categorical thinker sees the first issue in approaching a new task as creating the relevant categories and the breaking down the problem to fit into the boxes that have been constructed .
People who are high in categorical thinking tend to use a high rate of concrete nouns , articles , and prepositions .
A very different approach is called dynamic thinking .
Dynamic thinking involves evaluating a new problem from a historical or developing perspective .
Instead of first evaluating the categories or dimensions associated with the problem , the dynamic thinker tracks how we have arrived at the problem , thereby tracking the problem over time .
If asked to evaluate the economy , the dynamic thinker may start with a point in the past and trace how historical forces have brought us to today ’s economy .
Dynamic thinking is generally measured by the high use of verbs .
Interestingly , the more that people use verbs , the less they use nouns – suggesting that people tend to be either categorical or dynamic thinkers but not both .
Figure 4 reveals two fascinating trends .
The first is the evolution of dynamic thinking over time .
In the last 65 years , a striking shift in thinking emerged beginning in the 1980s .
With the election of Reagan , presidents moved from displaying categorical thinking to being more dynamic in the ways they discussed complex issues .
Every president since then has followed this trend .
Obama is striking in being by far the most dynamic and least categorical thinker in the modern presidency .
Figure 4 . Categorical versus dynamic thinking .
Higher scores reflect categorical thinking whereas lower ( or more negative ) scores indicate dynamic thinking .
The Language and Personality of Obama ’s State of the Union Addresses
Barack Obama thinks and relates to people differently from most of his predecessors .
His thinking style is both highly complex and , at the same time , dynamic .
Socially and emotionally , he is surprisingly cool and distant .
The word “ cool ” is not ill - advised .
In his SOU addresses , as well as his press conferences , he is detached .
His use of both positive emotion and negative emotion words is much lower than recent presidents .
Although his personal pronouns in his SOUs are slightly above average , they are actually quite low when talking informally in interviews or press conferences .
His is the language of the confident leader as opposed to the close buddy .
Obama has now delivered two SOU addresses .
Has his language changed much from a year ago ?
Very broadly , no .
If anything , he is becoming more dynamic in his thinking and slightly less positive in his emotional tone .
Overall , however , he maintains a remarkably even style in the ways he talks to his audiences .

Supervisors from the Civil Administration confiscated construction materials in the West Bank Monday , claiming that their presence there was a violation of the government - imposed 10 - month construction freeze .
A drilling truck was confiscated from Ariel , the largest city in Samaria .
Mayor Ron Nachman condemned the move , saying he felt as though Israel had " gone back to the saison days " .
Op - Ed Peace or appeasement ?
Yoram Ettinger Construction freeze in Judea and Samaria based on erroneous assumptions Peace or appeasement ?
" Those supervisors left us all with our jaws on the ground , " he said , explaining that the construction plans had been approved months ago and that the units had already been sold .
" Nobody told me about the freeze orders until the officers came to enforce them . "
Ben -Ayon said he had argued that the orders did not apply to his site because the foundations had already been laid , but the officers told him they had pictures proving he had laid them very recently .
He said they asked him to stop drilling .
" But that takes some time because you can't just leave open holes , so they took my equipment away , " the contractor said .
" I could n't talk to them at all . "
Mayor Nachman claims the orders take away the municipality 's legal right to approve construction , transferring them to the Civil Administration .
" The orders take away our right to allow ( construction ) but leave us with the obligation to enforce them , " he said .
" If my power has been taken away , I do n't mean to carry the obligation of responsibility . "
He condemned the government for its decision to impose the freeze on Ariel .
" There is no justification for doing this within the 1967 borders , " Nachman said .
" They have turned us into a persecuted group with a population of 300,000 residents , and now together with Peace Now 's spy patrols and the Civil Administrations supervisors I feel as though I have returned to the days when I saw my father , an Etzel man , persecuted by the Haganah , " he added , referring to the time of the British mandate .
The Civil Administration responded that appeals to the actions of its supervisors are welcome .
" The administration means to continue to enforce the orders thoroughly , in accordance to orders from the state , " an IDF statement said .
A low - carb diet may be better for lowering blood pressure than taking an over - the - counter weight loss medication and sticking to a low - fat diet .
Researchers placed participants in two groups .
One set consisted of 57 people who ate a low - carbohydrate diet and were allowed to consume unlimited amounts of meat and eggs .
The other set consisted of 65 people who limited their daily fat intake to 30 % or less of their total calories and restricted their consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol .
This group also took the drug orlistat .
The study lasted for 48 weeks .
The low - carb group dropped an average of 5.9 points of systolic blood pressure ( the top number that measures the heart ’s contractions ) and 4.5 points on diastolic blood pressure ( the bottom number measuring the heart at rest ) .
The other group dropped 1.5 points on systolic and 0.4 points on diastolic .
The low - carb set lost about 9.5 % of body weight while the medication / low - fat diet group lost about 8.5 % .
The study was published in the Jan. 25 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine .

Two hands are n’t better than one
Kids who are “ mixed - handed , ” or “ cross - dominant ” -- that is they do some tasks better with one hand , other tasks better with the other hand -- appear more likely to have language , learning and mental health problems , including attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms , at least compared with right - handed kids .
That ’s the word from a study published Jan. 25 in the journal Pediatrics .
The researchers conclude that mixed - handedness , which indicates the brain is wired a little differently than is the norm , could be used to help identify kids at risk of such problems .
But no one ’s suggesting that kids be forced to use one hand or the other -- the treatment some lefties once endured before the rest of society got enlightened .
For now , it ’s just one more thing about which parents can fret .

SpaceX Announces Final Arrival of Falcon 9 Flight Hardware at Cape Canaveral in Preparation for Inaugural Launch
Press Release From : SpaceX
Posted : Thursday , February 11 , 2010
Hawthorne , CA , FEBRUARY 11 , 2010 - Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) announces that all flight hardware for the debut launch of the Falcon 9 vehicle has arrived at the SpaceX launch site , Space Launch Complex 40 ( SLC - 40 ) , in Cape Canaveral , Florida .
Final delivery included the Falcon 9 second stage , which recently completed testing at SpaceX 's test facility in McGregor , Texas .
SpaceX has now initiated full vehicle integration of the 47 meter ( 154 feet ) tall , 3.6 meter ( 12 feet ) diameter rocket , which will include a Dragon spacecraft qualification unit .
" We expect to launch in one to three months after completing full vehicle integration , " said Brian Mosdell , Director of Florida Launch Operations for SpaceX .
" Our primary objective is a successful first launch and we are taking whatever time necessary to work through the data to our satisfaction before moving forward . "
Following full vehicle integration , SpaceX will conduct a static firing to demonstrate flight readiness and confirm operation of ground control systems in preparation for actual launch .
Though designed from the beginning to transport crew , SpaceX 's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft will initially be used to transport cargo .
Falcon 9 and Dragon were selected by NASA to resupply the International Space Station ( ISS ) once Shuttle retires .
The $ 1.6B contract represents 12 flights for a minimum of 20 tons to and from the ISS with the first demonstration flights beginning in 2010 .

Just days before Israel is expected to release its own report on the January 2009 invasion of the Gaza Strip , Israeli Information Minister Yuli Edelstein declared that the UN report on the war , and every other report since the war ended , “ are simply a type of anti-Semitism . ”
Israeli Information Minister Yuli Edelstein
The UN ’s report , also known as the Goldstone Report , successfully moved through the UN Human Rights Council in October .
It faulted both Israel ’s government and the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip for the massive civilian toll in the war .
Israel warned that any report which did n’t put the blame 100 percent on Hamas was inherently biased and declared that it showed the hypocrisy of the entire planet and a global bias against Israel .
The US House of Representatives also condemned the report as “ unfair ” and called for the president to block its consideration .
But Minister Edelstein took the usual complaints of anti-semitism against the report to a new level , saying that there was a clear connection between criticism of the Israeli war effort and the Holocaust and that it amounted to just the latest conflict in “ the battle against global anti-Semitism . ”
Though Israel ’s government has repeatedly canceled efforts to investigates the military ’s actions in the war , their own report is said to be completed and will aim not at explaining the war so much as attacking the Goldstone Report , and the reports from various human rights groups on which the Goldstone Report was chiefly based .

Cleo Trumbo , the widow of Oscar - winning screenwriter Dalton Trumbo , who was blacklisted for more than a decade as a member of the Hollywood 10 , has died .
She was 93 .
Trumbo died of age - related causes Oct. 9 at home in the Bay Area city of Los Altos , said her daughter Mitzi , with whom she was living .
“ She was n’t a person to be in the limelight at all , ” Mitzi Trumbo said of her mother .
“ She really devoted herself to the kids , in making sure that we were all OK , and in really keeping the family together . ”
Dalton and Cleo Trumbo ’s son Christopher , a writer , said of the blacklist , the Red Scare and the House Un- American Activities Committee : “ She hated bullies , and that ’s what she saw this as .
And she was right . ”
She was born Cleo Fincher in Fresno on July 17 , 1916 , and later moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles .
The vivacious Cleo was working as a carhop at a Hollywood drive - in , where she was known for juggling water glasses to encourage tips , when Trumbo drove up in his big Packard with a friend , who had induced him to go to there by saying , “ I know the girl you should marry . ”
Immediately smitten with the beautiful young brunet , Trumbo impulsively asked her to marry him .
“ She was n’t a push - over for this , ” said Mitzi Trumbo .
“ My father continued to come to the drive - in and leave her huge , lavish tips , which she saved and gave back to him a year later .
He had to court her , in other words . ”
She said her parents , who were married in 1938 , were opposites .
“ I think that was the attraction , ” she said .
Cleo “ was athletic and fun-loving -- she had a lot of good spirit to her -- and my father was not athletic at all .
He sat at a typewriter and read books all day .
I think she brought a lot of joy into his life . ”
The year after they were married , Dalton Trumbo ’s acclaimed antiwar novel “ Johnny Got His Gun ” was published .
He went on to receive an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for the 1940 movie “ Kitty Foyle ” and wrote the screenplays for movies such as “ A Guy Named Joe ” and “ Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo . ”
In 1947 , Trumbo was subpoenaed by the House Un- American Activities Committee as part of its investigation into “ communist infiltration of the motion picture industry . ”
Cleo Trumbo joined her husband at the hearings in Washington , where Dalton and nine other men refused to cooperate with the committee by challenging its right to ask questions about their political beliefs .
Dubbed the Hollywood 10 , they were blacklisted by the studio owners and later indicted for contempt of Congress , tried , convicted and sentenced to prison .
Trumbo continued writing under a variety of assumed names .
But he saw his income drop dramatically , his son said : From his standard script - writing fee of $ 75,000 , he earned $ 2,500 for the first assignment he accepted after he was blacklisted .
During the blacklist , Cleo Trumbo told People magazine in 1993 , “ we were broke , and we were n’t invited anywhere .
People dropped away . ”
In 1950 , Trumbo began serving his time at the Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland , Ky .
After his release 10 months later , he and his family moved to Mexico City .
They returned to Los Angeles in 1954 , moving to the Highland Park neighborhood .
For the family , the effects of the blacklist lingered .
At one point , Dalton Trumbo wrote an angry letter to the principal at Mitzi ’s elementary school after she told him that her classmates had begun harassing and shunning her when they discovered who her father was .
“ It was a bad year , ” she recalled .
For Dalton Trumbo , the blacklist ended in 1960 , when “ Exodus ” director - producer Otto Preminger and “ Spartacus ” executive producer and star Kirk Douglas gave him credit for the films ’ screenplays .
The year before Trumbo died in 1976 at age 70 , he belatedly accepted the Oscar for best motion picture story for the 1956 film “ The Brave One , ” which he had written under the pseudonym Robert Rich .
In 1993 , Cleo Trumbo accepted an Oscar on behalf of her late husband for best motion picture story for the 1953 film “ Roman Holiday , ” which he wrote under the name of a friend , screenwriter Ian McLellan Hunter .
“ He ’d be very pleased by this Oscar , ” Cleo Trumbo told People at the time .
“ It puts everything in order . ”
In her speech to an audience at the Academy theater , she observed that the time of the blacklist in Hollywood had passed .
“ But , ” she said , “ if we are not wise enough to learn the lessons of the blacklist , I am afraid that at some future time another generation will be faced with the same circumstance .
Once again men and women will find themselves compelled to risk everything in a fight they did not choose and stand up for the principles so eloquently stated in our Constitution . ”
In addition to her daughter Mitzi and son Christopher , Trumbo is survived by her other daughter , Nikola Trumbo ; three grandchildren ; and five great - grandchildren .
At her request , no memorial service will be held .

one more go - round for the best year ever !!!
2009 ! 2009 !
The New York Times has n't spilled the beans over the Apple tablet again , but rumors are linking the two companies once more .
Reports of an upcoming paid model to be adopted by the New York Times are correlated with the mythical Apple tablet , as both are said to go public in the coming weeks .
The Times is expected to announce in the next few weeks details on how the paper plans to charge for its online content , unnamed sources told the New York Magazine .
The Times did n't confirm or deny the report , saying it will announce the decision when possible .
Its answer , though , has raised several question marks in the blogosphere , especially as the paper 's announcement is supposed to come smack bang around the same time as the Apple tablet , at the January 27 event .
Even more , the Times presumably confirmed the existence of an Apple tablet in October last year , in a private speech .
The relation between Apple and The Times is said to be a special one .
Firstly , as noted by 9to5 Mac , Apple CEO Steve Jobs often uses the Times ' website when demonstrating the iPhone 's web browsing capabilities .
Also , Apple has reportedly been in talks with publishers , including The Times , in order to prepare content for its impending slate computer .
But could really the two rumors be linked ?
Previous reports and speculation conveniently point in this direction , but the correlations are pretty vague at the moment .
The Times announcement could be just a simple metered model , similar to the one used by the Financial Times , paidContent speculates .
This would allow registered users to read certain stories free , while full access would be available only to subscribers .
Then again , maybe the Times wo n't repeat its mistake with a paywall , as with TimesSelect , which operated from 2005 to 2007 .
The system charged $ 50 per year or $ 8 per month for access to certain areas of the site , but failed miserably and it was taken down .
To make up for that , The Times opened its archives from 1987 to the present without charge .
Leisure activities around New Zealand were disrupted today by a nationwide tsunami alert .
The alert was sparked by an 8.8 magnitude earthquake which struck with devastating and deadly force last night .
One of the first events affected was a mass nude photo shoot at Wellington 's Breaker Bay .
Wellington City Council emergency management staff contacted the organiser of the event , scheduled for 8 am today , and it was agreed the event be postponed .
City council emergency preparedness manager Fred Mecoy said the photoshoot , in which more than 100 people were expected to take part , had been cancelled due to the " obvious concerns we have about safety " .
Today 's dragon boat racing event on Wellington Harbour was also cancelled as a safety precaution .
Civil Defence staff and police asked the event organisers to cancel the event following reports about marked sea -level changes in the Gisborne area .
Around the country Civil defence and other emergency services were advising people to stay away from beaches and waterways , and closing boat ramps .
In Canterbury freedom campers were being evacuated from beaches and on Banks Peninsula people were moved out of the Okains Bay camping ground .
Rakaia fishing competition organisers were told of the possible tsunami about 5.30 am .
There were approximately 700 competitors over the length of river and Ellesmere search and rescue were advising people to move from the river mouth .
In the Bay of Plenty officials at the Ocean Athlete under - 14 national surf lifesaving championships put the event on hold and advised competitors to stay away from Mount Maunganui 's Main Beach after this morning 's tsunami warning .
Surf Life Saving New Zealand spokesman Nathan
Hight said they were taking every precaution .
" We 've been monitoring the situation for the past few hours and have already told team managers to keep their athletes away from the beach until otherwise advised , " Hight said .
The annual carnival has nearly 800 juniors from all over New Zealand attending .
Mount Maunganui , Omanu and Papamoa surf lifesavers were mobilised and patrolling beaches advising the public to stay away .
The Hawke's Bay Multisport Club's Ironkids Duathlon , due to take place at Ocean Spa on Napier 's Marine Parade at 9 am today , was cancelled due to the tsunami risk to Napier .
HB Multisport Club coordinator , Jeanette Cooper has advised people to check the club 's website www.hbmsc.org.nz for more information .
Further north , in Franklin , the Kaiaua Wine and Food Festival was cancelled , and in Rodney the Mayoral Bike Challenge was also canned .
In Auckland , the Cathay Pacific half marathon and 11 km race , starting at Orakei Reserve from 7 am and running along Tamaki Drive was cancelled , as were the Onetangi Beach Races on Waiheke .
Q : You , a black man , sat in on a white - separatist retreat .
How did that go over ?
A : They were curious and shocked they had found a black man on their premises .
A lot of the members of the church took pains to explain to me the difference between white supremacy and white separatism .
They said , " We do n't think we 're better than you ; we just want to be separate from you . "

One of the more interesting articles published last year : Racism is wanting to make definitions about which races are superior , and which are inferior .
Nationalism is wanting to be with people like you : culture , heritage , values , language and customs .
Underlying all of these is ( a ) similar raw ability and ( b ) similar parallel evolution , meaning that your people have similar tastes , tendencies and inclinations .
Instinct is shaped by evolution and is the cornerstone of culture and values .
I use " race " for ethnicity in the above because it 's how we speak of it .
While I think both race and ethnicity / ethny are valid concepts , I think ethnicity is theterm .
Racism is caused by diversity , or ethnic competition where ethnic segregation is disallowed .
The response is reactionary and violent .
Nationalism is the opposite of racism -- it is tolerance , in parallel , for all ethnic groups , including the right to preserve themselves by segregating .
After all , if we force other groups upon them , they 'll be bred into a hybrid , and the original group will be destroyed .
That 's racism and genocide .
If we do not suppress the urge to segregate , whether by Black Panthers or White Wolves , I think we 'll all be OK .
A millionaire in his thirties , Charles Veley decided he wanted to " go everywhere " .
Ten years on , he has visited 806 of 871 " countries " and is looking to complete the set .
Tim Adams joins him in Heligoland to find out why he has to keep moving
One of the things Charles Veley , the world 's most - travelled man , has discovered is that there is always a bar .
There was a bar on Palmyra Atoll , south west of Hawaii ( population : 8 ) ; there was a bar on Willis Island in the Coral Sea , off the coast of Queensland ( population : 4 ) .
Ten minutes after he and I have arrived in Heligoland ( population : a few hundred frozen Germans , and us ) we are , therefore , sitting in a one - roomed pub , advertised by a gigantic wooden herring outside , and crammed inside with Dutch and German and English nautical knick - knackery .
It is midday , and we have been on the road for four hours : first by car from Hamburg through fog and a blizzard to an airstrip at Uetersen .
Then by eight - seater plane , which took off in a perturbing foot of snow , to an island called Dune .
Then by roiling ferry across to here , Heligoland , holy land .
It feels something like a pilgrimage for the insane and the desperate , and Veley , a neatly groomed , 44 - year - old American , has been on the lookout for signs and wonders .
" This is part of my style , " he tells me , gesturing around the bar .
" Heligoland : I had no idea about it .
So when we got here I waited for something .
I saw this piece of paper in the window saying Eiergrog – " Egg grog " – and it looked interesting , so I walked past the big wooden fish and came in .
My philosophy for travel is this : always plan as if you are going to do a Japanese - style tour and every second is accounted for .
But on arrival , abandon all that and do whatever feels right .
Eiergrog felt right .
And you walk in , there is a pretty girl behind the bar , and you start to understand the place . "
Iris , the pretty girl , has just placed two Eiergrogs on the table in front of us : hot , rum - based , raw - egg drinks whisked into a froth .
Iris came here six years ago to do a seasonal job from Berlin , met a man , and stayed .
" It is , " she says , nodding at the swirling snow outside , the boarded - up beach huts and shop fronts , " better in summer . "
She has now met another man and plans to follow him to Australia .
There is one other drinker in the bar , an 87 - year - old named Herr Westerhaus , sipping glasses of hot gin .
He has a daughter in East Anglia and was , he says , a radio signaller here for U - boats during the war .
He had so many good memories he came back when he retired .
Veley , who slips easily in and out of German , has stories for both Iris and Herr Westerhaus ; he has been to all the places they have been .
In fact , as it quickly becomes apparent , he has been to all the places anyone has been .
Heligoland is number 806 on Veley 's list of visited " countries " .
He ticked off all the 193 UN - recognised nations eight years ago , and since then he has been collecting islands and atolls , provinces and protectorates .
These days he runs a website called Most Traveled People , which has 8,000 members , mostly , like him , " competitive travellers " , trading stories about Mizoram , Kingman Reef and Rio Muni .
He established it , he suggests , in an attempt to bring some rigour to these travellers ' tales , to rationalise the globe 's possibilities ( and , you imagine , to advertise his own unprecedented wanderlust ) .
It has n't , he concedes , always worked out like that .
The world of competitive travelling is , well , nothing if not competitive .
For a start , deciding what is and what is n't a separate " country " – " a discrete geographical , ethnological or political entity " – threatens to become almost a full - time job in itself .
Border disputes are rife .
" People put forward nominations and I collect those , " he says .
" And whatever has the most nominations becomes a candidate , and then there is a voting process .
Spain and France and Italy and several others are now divided into semi-autonomous regions .
So it 's getting tougher … "
He doubts anyone , not even himself , will ever get the whole list ( which currently stands at 871 ) .
" We are always adding new places .
And there are already some really difficult places out there .
Like Scott Island , a New Zealand island toward Antarctica ; only six people have ever landed on it . "
He says this with a certain frustration .
Beyond the attempt to quantify all the world 's remotest corners , there are also ongoing qualitative arguments , mostly about what is meant by the word " visit " .
Some travellers claim you must spend a night in a place ; some argue it is enough to visit a lavatory there ; " others , " Veley suggests , somewhat wearily , " will say you have to sleep on a park bench or do it for less than $ 10 to make it real .
And some people believe you must have cocktails at Annabelle 's or wherever … "
Veley has attempted to bring some order to this area , too .
Just touching down while on a plane is not enough ; Most Traveled People requires a photograph or a passport stamp or a credit card receipt .
He recently , he says , personally defined the minimum requirements of what constitutes a " landing " on the North Sea island of Rockall ( of shipping forecast fame ) .
He 'd had a go at Rockall once before , with his friend , the clubbable castaway Ben Fogle , but the weather had been too tricky and they had turned their sailboat back .
This time , with a different group , he set off from Benbecula , and it was beautiful , calm sailing for two days .
When they got to Rockall , however , even in those perfect conditions , it was not clear exactly how they might land .
" The swell is 7 metres , maybe , " Veley recalls , " and the rock has sheer sides all round with powerful eddies beneath them . "
Veley and his fellow travellers circled the rock for half a day , waiting for a change in the sea .
" We eventually decided to have a go at one corner that was a bit more craggy and had a skirt of thick kelp attached to it , " he says .
Among the crew was a photographer from Stornoway , who donned a wetsuit and jumped on a surfboard .
" He timed the swell , grabbed the kelp , found the crag and hauled himself up , " Veley says , " and we were all cheering wildly . "
Then it was Veley 's turn .
It took him ages to get the wetsuit on .
The swell seemed even wilder .
He plunged in .
" I found the kelp , timed the surge , grabbed the crag , stood up on Rockall for maybe one and a half seconds before the next wave crashed over and knocked me straight back into the sea .
But that counts , for sure … "
We order two more Eiergrogs .
Charles Veley grew up in Brooklyn and never left the United States until he was 18 .
His parents split up when he was young ; money was tight and did n't extend to foreign holidays .
Veley recalls sitting as a boy in the driver 's seat of his father 's car with the Rand McNally map on his knees , planning trips from coast to coast in his head , imagining himself always on the open road .
His first attempts at escape came when he was sponsored through his computer science degree at Harvard by the Officer Training Corps of the US Air Force ; this was the era of Top Gun and competition for places was intense .
Veley topped his year as a trainee fighter pilot before being abruptly dropped from the programme when a routine medical discovered a minute scar on his retina .
By that time he was pulling jets out of tailspins and imagining 10 years stationed in remote air bases .
He responded to the disappointment by taking a flight over to the UK to see some friends at Cambridge , and from there his addiction to travel began .
He took a Eurail pass and was hooked by the possibility .
The last time he was in this part of Germany he got off at Hamburg train station and went running round town trying to eat a hamburger .
" I had never left the States and suddenly there were borders , passport stamps ... "
Romance was a part of it , the prospect of unexpected encounters .
" I had a three - week coach pass around Britain , too , " he recalls .
" I really wanted to go to Dorset because I loved Thomas Hardy , and I wanted to go to Scotland .
I remember being in this overnight coach from Birmingham up to the Highlands and there was this redheaded girl sitting next to me .
And I remember sort of in the middle of the night we were snogging suddenly .
I had a lot of interesting seat mates on coaches . "
When he returned to the States , Veley joined with some friends in setting up a dot.com company creating software that delivered business intelligence , helping retailers to understand the buying patterns of consumers .
He worked 100 - hour weeks and managed some long - haul travel when he could .
In 1999 the company , MicroStrategy , floated on the ballooning Nasdaq and the share price peaked at $ 333 .
Veley had 500,000 shares .
He was about to get married , he was 35 , and he decided to retire .
" I 'd always had a goal to speak five languages , " he says .
" I was studying French , German and Italian at night school , and then I thought : why do this ?
Why not go and live in these places instead ?
So my wife Kimberly and I went and did a year abroad – this was 2000 .
We got two round - the - world tickets and we lived in France and then Germany and then we went down to South Africa , and the geography down there just blew my mind .
I realised we could go to Malawi , Botswana .
And then we took another year and went to South America .
And then I learned about the Travelers ' Century Club , which has an entry level of 100 countries . "
At the same time he was getting more and more interested in round - the - world tickets .
" If you really get into the mechanics of them , " he says , " you can fly first or business and pay much less than economy , and that appealed to the computer side of me , puzzling over algorithms . "
Along the way , while he was in Tasmania , Veley discovered by turning on the TV that he was no longer a multimillionaire : the MicroStrategy share price had crashed to 40 cents , but he was too far gone in his travelling to turn back .
He figured the shares would bounce back .
He booked some more flights .
It was when he and his wife were on the way to Hong Kong from Korea and he became excited when he realised they could stop in Taiwan for four hours that he knew he was hooked .
For a few years after that Veley averaged around 100 countries per year .
Some trips were more efficient than others .
He flew to the South Pole in 2003 and took in Argentinian , Australian , British , Chilean , French , New Zealand and Norwegian territories without leaving the same spot – all countries disputing a single patch of land .
The share price did rally somewhat , and he spent , he reckons , more than $ 1 m on plane tickets and freighter passages and sailboat charters : 1 m miles of travel in just three years , which took in every place you could name , and plenty you could n't : Malyj Vysotskij Island , Zil Elwannyen Sesel , Ogasawara .
For much of that time , Veley 's wife accompanied him , clocking up 200 countries herself , but in 2004 they had their first child , and now they have three , aged six , four and two , all autumn births because the Antarctic exploration season ends in February , and by that time Veley had generally been away from home for more than three months .
He insists that since his children have been born family has been his priority , but he still pursues his impossible itinerary .
When we meet he is midway through a 16 - stop round - the - world ticket , en route home for a week in San Francisco to catch the end of Valentine 's Day and take the children off to Disneyland .
Then he has a province of Argentina to collect .
Veley is telling me all of this while we wander somewhat aimlessly in the sleet and knifing cold , fortified by Eiergrog , up to the high point of Heligoland , past a stark geometric church to a headland spiked with radio masts and overlooking rock stacks washed by the ocean .
He takes it all in without too much comment .
He does n't collect souvenirs , or take photos beyond the odd snap on his iPhone , or jot down notes .
Never does .
I 'm intrigued , of course , by his motivation , but he can't explain the obsession much except in the blandest terms – proof positive that you are either a psychologist or an adventurer , but rarely both .
" If you want to have a complete worldview you have to go everywhere , " he 'll say .
" Every place you learn something new . "
Or : " It 's an investment in life experience .
Whenever I meet anyone , no matter where they are from , I can always relate to them . "
Or : " While I 'm alive I just want to see as much of the world as I can .
I 'm organised ; I have a computer background . "
When I mention the environmental impact of his travels , he brushes the question aside .
" I care about the environment just like you , " he says .
The challenge itself is sometimes enough of a motivation .
Palmyra Atoll ( population : 8 ; bars : 1 ) is maintained by Nature Conservancy in the US .
In his enquiries about how he might get there , Veley was referred to a woman named Nancy at the Conservancy offices in Vermont .
She suggested to him that the only people who ever got to go to Palmyra Atoll were those who made at least a " six - figure contribution to Nature Conservancy " .
To Veley this was fighting talk .
" I can be quite persistent , " he says , on deserted Heligoland , with a degree of understatement .
In the end he chartered a boat out of Hawaii with a few others to share the cost .
" We finally arrived at Palmyra some days later , " he recalls .
" The bar is a run -down wooden structure built 30 years ago and yachties had written stuff on the walls .
I wrote a ' Poem to Nancy ' : ' Palmyra is nice / great palm trees and sand / please lower the price / from one hundred grand … ' "
It seems almost redundant to ask Veley about his favourite places , though from time to time – he has a weirdly accurate memory for names and events – he will suggest how he had a fine time on St Kilda , or he 'll let slip that everyone loves country and western music on Pitcairn .
The strangest place he 's ever been was the " conference room " between North and South Korea , in Panmunjom , two nations staring at each other .
The scariest : Afghanistan on the first anniversary of 9/11 .
He once made a list of all the worst things that had happened to him : the time a tree frog urinated on his forehead in Tortuguero , or when his canoe capsized in the Zambezi , among hippos , or when he waited for three days for a boat out of Christmas Island , and when it arrived he went to introduce himself to the captain before their 1,000 - mile voyage only to discover him drunk , stoned , naked and masturbating in his cabin .
The urge to travel to Veley 's extent , a kind of attention deficit on a global scale , has a medical diagnosis : dromomania , the addiction to new experiences , the vagabond neurosis .
He 's a curious case , though .
While most dromomaniacs are permanently wedded to the road , Veley is both rooted and adrift , very settled , he insists , and almost permanently travelling .
His rivals – nearly all of them acquaintances – have sometimes claimed that what Veley does is not really travel at all : it 's too systematic , there 's no depth to it , not enough danger .
He became friendly with John Clouse , who for many years was the Guinness world record holder as the most travelled man ( before Guinness decided to abandon the category , as there were too many conflicting criteria ) .
Clouse , a lawyer from Indiana , went through six marriages before his death two years ago at 82 .
" He tended to find a new wife and travel with her , and then she would realise what was involved , " Veley explains .
About three - quarters of the travellers on his website are men , though the " leaderboard " used to include a woman who claimed all sorts of incredible journeys .
She had claimed , for example , that she had been to Mount Athos , the Greek monastic state into which only males are allowed , arguing that when she was a girl her father had cut her hair short and taken her in .
Veley asked for proof of some of her exploits and she immediately removed herself .
The table currently shows a man named Bill Altaffer slightly ahead of Veley , but though Veley does n't doubt Altaffer 's " been all over the place " he suggests that Altaffer refuses to always provide the evidence required , and that their paths do n't cross too often , and " it is , I guess , " Veley says , " not worth worrying too much about " .
One of the things that his years of waiting for planes and boats has taught him is that , try as you might , you can't force situations .
" I remember on my initial Euro trip it was late afternoon and I was in Rome and I could n't go in the Vatican because I was wearing shorts .
I remember thinking : this is the only chance I will ever have .
I was wrong . "
The first time he tried to get to the North Pole on an icebreaker from Svalbard they got stuck in the ice at 86 and a quarter degrees latitude .
He went back the next year and made it .
" Things will come round again " is his mantra .
His only assets , he suggests – beyond , that is , his financial resources – are patience and politeness in negotiating the world 's officialdom .
To that I would add a certain sure sense of restlessness , of giving the impression of being on the way somewhere else , of nowhere being a final destination .
On the boat back to the airstrip on Dune we find ourselves in the cabin of the Heligoland ferry with half a dozen German men in their sixties , who appear to have been at the Eiergrog all day .
Discovering we speak English they launch into a rousing version of " What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor " as the small boat pitches across the bay .
They come here every year , one of the more sober members of the group explains to me as we approach the airstrip .
Have been doing so for 40 years , always this weekend in February , always this place .
" Nothing changes .
Friends , the same .
Heligoland , the same .
That 's how we like it , " he says .
Charles Veley joins in with the singing , files away the experience neatly , but I 'm guessing he is also planning what to do later in Hamburg , and thinking about tomorrow morning 's flight , and the one after , and the one after that .
Novelty can have its own monotony , too .

by Congressman Dennis Kucinich
Washington D.C. ( January 12 , 2010 )
Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) today introduced legislation to impose a 75 % tax on the extraordinary bonuses that bankers are planning to pay themselves using windfall profits earned from massive taxpayer support of the financial services industry .
The “ Responsible Bankers Act ” will not penalize banks for making a profit , but rather will tax the bonus pools that are set aside .
This is the follow up to announcement made by Kucinich on December 10 , 2009 .
Kucinich , who has been a leading critic of the government ’s unlimited support to Wall Street , remarked ; “ Bankers are preparing to pay themselves record bonuses rather than lending and investing in American economic prosperity .
They could use their profits to do many things to improve the prospects of economic recovery , like strengthen their capital base , reduce fees charged to customers , or increase lending to small and medium sized - companies .
“ Bankers ’ failures to self - regulate , let us remember , were the direct cause of the crisis we are in today ; they need to be told that the money they are making is a public trust , not something they have earned for good behavior . ”
Other bills being discussed fall short of the Kucinich measure , which taxes all banker bonuses whether the bank has received or repaid TARP funds or not .
“ The aim of federal policy is to give banks the opportunity to clean up the mess they have created , ” Mr. Kucinich said today , “ but bank executives still do n’t get it .
They think the profits they are making are for themselves . ”
The Responsible Bankers
Act has already received the early endorsement of Public Citizen , a national , nonprofit consumer advocacy organization founded in 1971 .

The Economy Sucks and or Collapse 2
On January 21 , 2010 , the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a ruling in Big Baboon , Inc. v. Dell , Inc. et al , staying further consideration on the motion for summary judgment for invalidity until such time that the United States Supreme Court issues its much anticipated decision in Bilski v. Kappos .
This is exactly what I have been suggesting ( see Offering Help ) , and it has amazed me that other district courts and the United States Patent Office are plowing ahead and making Bilski rulings .
Reality be damned , many district courts and the United States Patent and Trademark Office would rather waste their own time , the time and money of litigants and patent applicants , knowing full well that the United States Supreme Court will issue a ruling that will change the Federal Circuit machine or transformation test announced in Bilski .
There is simply no other reason for the Supreme Court to have taken the case other than to , at a minimum modify the CAFC Bilski test .
There is no Circuit split , and the Supreme Court has not been in the business of giving “ attaboy ” compliments to the Federal Circuit .
This being the case , it is an extreme waste of judicial and examining resources to pretend that courts , litigants and patent applicants wo n’t be forced to go through the entire exercise all over again once the Supreme Court issues its ruling .
So for showing tremendous common sense , exhibiting appropriate judicial restraint and staying true to a conservative judicial philosophy a tip of the hat must go to Judge Stephen V. Wilson .
Now if only other district courts and the Patent Office would understand the enormously negative effect of wasting time and money only to have to start all over again we would be getting somewhere .
To give a little context to the story , allow me to begin with the patents being asserted by Big Baboon , which is a great name !
The plaintiff asserts that claims from US Patent No. 6,115,690 and US Patent No. 6,343,275 are being infringed by Dell , Amazon.com , American Honda Motor Co. , Amerisourceberge Corp. , Fedex Corp. , Hewlett - Packard , Ingram Micro , Intel , Staples , United Parcel Service and UTI Worldwide .
It is safe to say that these patents are not typical by any stretch of the imagination .
The ‘690 patent was filed on July 16 , 1999 , issued on January 29 , 2002 , and has 395 sheets of drawings .
The ‘ 275 patent was filed and issued on the same day as the ‘ 690 patent , and has 392 sheets of drawings .
So unlike many patents in business method or computer implemented process space , these patents are not wanting for disclosure .
As has become commonplace in such litigation , the defendants moved for Summary Judgment asserting that the patent claims are invalid , citing the Federal Circuit ’s decision in Bilski for the proposition that the machine or transformation test is not satisfied , therefore meaning that the invention as described is not patentable subject matter .
Of course , the plaintiff , Big Baboon , disagreed .
Upon reviewing the initial papers submitted by the parties the district court , On September 25 , 2009 , invited further briefing on certain Bilski issues .
The entire Order inviting further briefing , provided courtesy of the Docket Report , is worth a read if you are involved in Bilski litigation or working on patent applications where there is a Bilski rejection , but the Order of Judge Wilson said , in part :
In the course of examining the “ precise contours ” of the Bilski court ’s “ machine ” test , see 545 F.3d at 962 , the Court has identified in interesting precedent : O’Reilly v. Morse , 56 U.S. 62 ( 1853 ) .
The Morse case is not particularly obscure ; in fact , it is one of the bedrock cases in American patent jurisprudence .
However , in discussing Morse , courts often focus on Samuel Morse ’s eighth patent claim , by which he attempted to claim all uses of electromagnetism to transmit print and visual communication .
In contrast , courts have offered relatively little discussion of Morse ’s fifth patent claim .
But cf. In re Nuijten , 500 F.3d 1346 , 1357 n.9 ( Fed. Cir. 2007 ) ( discussing Morse ’s fifth claim ) .
This Court would like to focus the parties ’ attention on Morse ’s fifth patent claim , which claimed Morse code as used via telegraph .
*******
In examining Morse ’s fifth claim , the Supreme Court held : “ We perceive no well - founded objection . . . to his right to a patent for the first seven inventions set forth in the specification of his claims . ”
Id. at 112 .
In other words , the fifth claim recited patentable subject matter .
In the present case , the Court wishes to consider the parties ’ views on the question of whether Morse ’s fifth patent claim is analogous to the patents claimed by Plaintiff .
The Court notes that both cases appear to involve a patent for a method of communicating over a machine designed to enable communication .
The Court further notes that there may be some parallels between the electromagnetic telegraph in Morse ’s fifth claim and the “ Web - enabled computer ” in Plaintiff ’s various claims .
After reviewing the parties ’ submission of supplemental briefs on the Morse ’s fifth claim , Judge Wilson issued the following stay order on January 21 , 2010 :
The Court has carefully considered the parties ’ briefs regarding O’Reilly v. Morse , 56 U.S. 62 ( 1853 ) .
At present , the Court is not convinced that Morse is adequate precedent .
The possibility remains , however , that the Supreme Court ’s pending decision in Bilski v. Doll , No. 08-964 , 129 S. Ct. 2735 ( 2009 ) , may influence or affect this case .
Relevant parts of the Morse case were raised in the course of Supreme Court proceedings in Bilski .
See , e.g. , Oral Argument at 21–50 , Bilski , No. 08-964 ( Nov. 9 , 2009 ) ; Brief of Regulatory DataCorp , Inc. , et al. , as Amici Curiae in Support of Neither Party , Bilski , No. 08-964 ( Aug. 6 , 2009 ) .
Therefore , the Court finds that the prudential course is to stay its decision on the pending motion .
Accordingly , the Court STAYS the motion for summary judgment of invalidity based on patentable subject matter , pending the Supreme Court ’s decision in Bilski v. Doll .
The parties are ORDERED to inform the court within one week of the Supreme Court ’s decision , and the Court will issue such further orders as it deems necessary .
Now we sit and wait for the Supreme Court to issue a decision in Bilski .
How long we will have to wait is really anyone ’s guess , although it will be sometime between now and the end of June 2010 .
I personally suspect the ruling something between late March and early May .
If past karma has any relevance , the Bilski ruling is almost certain to be issued on a day when I am traveling or teaching .
I will be teaching the PLI Patent Bar Review Course in Chicago from March 17 – 21 , traveling out on March 16 .
I will be teaching the PLI Patent Bar Review Course in New York City from May 12 – 16 , traveling out on May 11 .
I will also be speaking to the Toledo Intellectual Property Law Association on April 13 , and out of the office for that trip from April 12 – 14 .
So if you have a Bilski pool at your office see if you can get one of those dates .
It seems when big news breaks I am on the road and unavailable to immediately write .

Stem cell researchers exploring a new approach for the care of respiratory diseases report that an experimental treatment involving transplantable lung cells was associated with improved outcomes in tests on mice with acute lung injury .
The lung cells were derived from human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) .
Findings by investigators at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston are scheduled to appear in the March issue of Molecular Therapy .
Mice receiving the transplantable lung cells lived longer , sustained less scarring in their lungs and had normal amounts of oxygen in their blood , said Rick Wetsel , Ph.D. , the study 's senior author and a professor in the university 's Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases ( IMM ) .
" Respiratory diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide , " wrote Wetsel and his colleagues in the paper .
" Current treatments offer no prospect of cure or disease reversal .
Transplantation of pulmonary progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells may provide a novel approach to regenerate endogenous lung cells destroyed by injury and disease . "
Giuseppe N. Colasurdo , M.D. , dean of The University of Texas Medical School at Houston and physician - in- chief at Children 's Memorial Hermann Hospital , said , " This research work will provide a useful model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of a variety of lung disorders .
I am confident future studies will advance our knowledge on the cellular mechanisms responsible for the improvement observed in the study . "
Colasurdo , who specializes in lung disorders in children and infants , said a better understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in the healing phase of lung diseases is critical to the development of treatments .
" These are diseases involving a variety of cells and cell products , " he said .

Much human embryonic stem cell research is focused on conditions like lung injury in which the body has difficulty healing itself .
Because these early stage cells can mature into many different cell types , they are being explored as a way to replace or repair missing or damaged tissue .
These cells also divide rapidly providing researchers with a large supply of cells .
Scientists compared the outcomes of mice with damaged lungs receiving the treatment to those not receiving the treatment .
Researchers reported that the experimental stem cell treatment " not only prevented or reversed visual hallmarks of pulmonary injury , but also restored near normal lung function to mice . "
Lung cells can be damaged by exposure to pollution and disease agents .
Wetsel and his colleague Dachun Wang , M.D. , an IMM instructor , used a genetic selection procedure they created to generate a type of lung cell known as alveolar epithelial type II , which secretes surfactant , a substance that keeps the lung inflated , and can turn into another important lung cell that regulates the transfer of oxygen into the blood and the removal of carbon dioxide .
Human embryonic stem cells in the research were approved by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) for study .
Wetsel called the results " promising " but added that additional tests in other animal models and eventually humans will be needed before these cell transplants can be used to treat respiratory diseases .
The scientists used mice with weakened immune systems to reduce the possibility that the human cells would be rejected .
Should research proceed to the clinical trial stage , there are at least two ways to address rejection issues , Wetsel said .
Patients could be treated with immunosuppressive drugs .
Scientists may also be able to take one of the patient 's own skin cells and convert it into " induced pluripotent stem cells " or iPS cells , which are believed to have many of the same capabilities as human embryonic stem cells .
Wetsel is holder of the William S. Kilroy , Sr. , Chair in Pulmonary Disease at the IMM .
He is also the director of the Hans J. Mueller - Eberhard & Irma Gigli Research Center for Immunology and Autoimmune Diseases at the IMM .
Wang was lead author .
Also collaborating were John E. Morales , IMM senior research assistant , Daniel G. Calame , UT Medical School , M.D. , Ph.D. , graduate student and Joseph L. Alcorn , Ph.D. , UT Medical School associate pediatrics professor .
The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health , the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at the UT Health Science Center at Houston and the Clive and Nancy Runnells Program for Embryonic Stem Cell Research .

A new report from the National Research Council lays out options NASA could follow to detect more near - Earth objects ( NEOs ) -- asteroids and comets that could pose a hazard if they cross Earth 's orbit .
The report says the $ 4 million the U.S. spends annually to search for NEOs is insufficient to meet a congressionally mandated requirement to detect NEOs that could threaten Earth .
Congress mandated in 2005 that NASA discover 90 percent of NEOs whose diameter is 140 meters or greater by 2020 , and asked the National Research Council in 2008 to form a committee to determine the optimum approach to doing so .
In an interim report released last year , the committee concluded that it was impossible for NASA to meet that goal , since Congress has not appropriated new funds for the survey nor has the administration asked for them .
In its final report , the committee lays out two approaches that would allow NASA to complete its goal soon after the 2020 deadline ; the approach chosen would depend on the priority policymakers attach to spotting NEOs .
If finishing NASA 's survey as close as possible to the original 2020 deadline is considered most important , a mission using a space - based telescope conducted in concert with observations from a suitable ground - based telescope is the best approach , the report says .
If conserving costs is deemed most important , the use of a ground - based telescope only is preferable .
The report also recommends that NASA monitor for smaller objects -- those down to 30 to 50 meters in diameter -- which recent research suggests can be highly destructive .
However , the report stresses that searching for smaller objects should not interfere with first fulfilling the mandate from Congress .
Beyond completion of that mandate , the report notes the need for constant vigilance in monitoring the skies , so as to detect all dangerous NEOs .
In addition , the nation should undertake a peer - reviewed research program to better investigate the many unknown aspects connected with detecting NEOs and countering those that could be a threat .
The U.S. should also take the lead in organizing an international entity to develop a detailed plan for dealing with hazards from these objects .
In addition , the report recommends that immediate action be taken to ensure the continued operation of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico .
NASA and NSF should support a vigorous program of NEO observations at Arecibo , and NASA should also support such a program at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex .
Although these facilities cannot discover NEOs , they play an important role in accurately determining the orbits and characterizing the properties of NEOs within radar range .
Scope of Hazard
Near - Earth objects are asteroids and comets that orbit the sun and approach or cross Earth 's orbit .
An asteroid or comet about 10 kilometers in diameter struck the Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago and caused global devastation , probably wiping out large numbers of plant and animal species including the dinosaurs .
Objects as large as this one strike Earth only about once every 100 million years on average , the report notes .
NASA has been highly successful at detecting and tracking objects 1 kilometer in diameter or larger , and continues to search for these large objects .
Objects down to sizes of about 140 meters in diameter -- which NASA has been mandated to survey for -- would cause regional damage ; such impacts happen on average every 30,000 years , the report says .
advertisement
While impacts by large NEOs are rare , a single impact could inflict extreme damage , raising the classic problem of how to confront a possibility that is both very rare and very important .
Far more likely are those impacts that cause only moderate damage and few fatalities .
Conducting surveys for NEOs and detailed studies of ways to mitigate collisions is best viewed as a form of insurance , the report says .
How much to spend on these insurance premiums is a decision that must be made by the nation 's policymakers .
Mitigating Damage
The report also examines what is known about methods to defend against NEOs .
These methods are new and still immature .
No single approach is effective for the full range of near - Earth objects , the committee concluded .
But with sufficient warning , a suite of four types of mitigation is adequate to meet the threat from all NEOs , except the most energetic ones .
Civil defense ( evacuation , sheltering in place , providing emergency infrastructure ) is a cost - effective mitigation measure for saving lives from the smallest NEO impact events and is a necessary part of mitigation for larger events .
" Slow push " or " slow pull " methods use a spacecraft to exert force on the target object to gradually change its orbit to avoid collision with the Earth .
This technique is practical only for small NEOs ( tens of meters to roughly 100 meters in diameter ) or possibly for medium - sized objects ( hundreds of meters ) , but would likely require decades of warning .
Of the slow push / pull techniques , the gravity tractor appears to be by far the closest to technological readiness .
Kinetic methods , which fly a spacecraft into the NEO to change its orbit , could defend against moderately sized objects ( many hundreds of meters to 1 kilometer in diameter ) , but also may require decades of warning time .
Nuclear explosions are the only current , practical means for dealing with large NEOs ( diameters greater than 1 kilometer ) or as a backup for smaller ones if other methods were to fail .
Although all of these methods are conceptually valid , none is now ready to implement on short notice , the report says .
Civil defense and kinetic impactors are probably the closest to readiness , but even these require additional study prior to reliance on them .
Given the significant unknowns about many aspects of the threat and its mitigation , the report recommends that the U.S. start a peer - reviewed , targeted research program on the hazards posed by NEOs , and how to deal with them .
Because this is a policy - driven , applied research program , it should not be in competition with basic scientific research programs or be funded from them , the report adds .
The study was sponsored by NASA at the request of Congress .
The National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering , Institute of Medicine , and National Research Council make up the National Academies .

Is n't life a bitch ?
The world is going to end .
You do n't even have to be a religious fundamentalist to see that 's true .
Some people collect postal stamps ; Exit Mundi collects scenarios of what could go wrong with the world .
Sure , our planet could get hit by an asteroid .
But hey , that 's nothing .
Did you know we could all be munched away by hungry molecules ?
Or that our physicists could unintentionally wipe us all out while tinkering with particles ?
` Oops , sorry ...'
Exit Mundi is n't in it for doom preaching , but strictly for fun .
It 's a fascinating thought : if that &*%# - comet did n't wipe out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , we would n't be here pondering about apocalypses and armageddons in the first place .
The dinosaurs roamed our planet millions of years longer than we did .
If it was n't for the comet , they still would .
That 's why this site is a tribute to floods , quantum explosions and awfully big chunks of space rock falling out of the sky .
If there 's a lesson to be learnt , it should be that within every end looms the dawn of a new beginning .
Sounds good , does n't it ?
Seattle ’s new city attorney to dismiss cases of pot possession
City Attorney Pete Holmes , who beat incumbent Tom Carr in November , said he dismissed two marijuana - related cases in his first day on the job , and several others are about to be dismissed .
In addition , his new criminal division chief , Craig Sims , said he is reviewing about 50 more cases .
Unless there are “ out of the ordinary circumstances , ” Sims said , the office does n’t intend to file charges for marijuana possession .
“ We ’re not going to prosecute marijuana - possession cases anymore , ” Holmes said Thursday during a public interview as part of Town Hall ’s Nightcap series .
“ I meant it when I said it ” during the campaign .
Sen. Roland Burris ( D - Ill. ) , is interviewed in his Capitol Hill office .
Will Burris budge on public option ?
Could Roland Burris become the next Olympia Snowe ?
In the nine months since he arrived in Washington , Burris has been best known as the guy former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich appointed to the Senate .
Advertisement
But that ’s about to change .
Burris has staked out a position on the public option that puts him at odds with Democratic leaders and the vast majority of the Democratic Caucus — and that could give the all - but - ignored junior senator from Illinois the sort of swing - vote status usually reserved for Snowe and other Republican moderates .
Last week , Burris told reporters that he would “ absolutely ” stand in the way of any Democratic proposal that lacked a sweeping public health insurance option .
And on Monday , a source familiar with Burris ’s thinking said that an “ opt - out ” plan like the one Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) is pushing so far has fallen short of what Burris is willing to support .
The questions facing Democratic leaders : How far will Burris go ?
And how far will they go to keep him in the fold ?
Burris made it clear last week that he was n’t committing to support a Republican filibuster of a Democratic bill , even one he finds lacking ; he was n’t about to begin “ telegraphing my moves on the procedural matters , ” he said during a C - SPAN appearance .
But , he added : “ I have stated it unequivocally that if the final package does not carry with it the strong public option that would allow individuals to have competition and to acquire health insurance that they cannot acquire or afford in the public sector , then I will not vote for that legislation .
That ’s what my position is because that ’s where my constituents are . ”
Of course , Burris ’s constituents are also the constituents of Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin , the Senate Democrats ’ chief vote counter , who urged Burris to resign in February when it appeared that he had given less - than - straightforward responses under oath about his contacts with Blagojevich ’s associates prior to his appointment to President Barack Obama ’s old Senate seat .
Blagojevich was indicted in the spring on federal charges that he tried to profit from the appointment , but Burris was not implicated by the indictment .
Durbin told POLITICO that he did n’t think his rocky past with Burris would stand in the way of their striking a deal , saying : “ I think we can talk it over . ”
“ Of course , we need 60 votes , so we need Sen. Burris ’s vote , ” said Durbin , who supports the public option but is open to compromise .
On Monday , Durbin told reporters that some liberals in the Democratic Caucus “ may disagree , ” but said there ’s a “ positive feeling about this . ”
Asked about Burris ’s feelings , Durbin said Monday he had n’t asked .
“ I think you ought to ask him that question , ” Durbin said with a smile .
But as Reid worked the phones during the past few days , a person familiar with the situation said he did n’t speak with Burris — and the White House also has yet to invite Burris to an Oval Office meeting with Obama , despite the fact that the president has already met individually with many other wavering senators .
A spokesman for Reid said the majority leader would reach out to Burris .
Reid said asking the White House to pressure senators “ has n’t been necessary to this point , ” and Durbin said the Democrats have yet to fully engage in whipping their members — suggesting that the full onslaught of pressure on wavering Democratic senators is yet to come .
Jim O’Connor , Burris ’s spokesman , said his boss is “ willing to look at ” other public options — but reiterated the senator ’s concerns that some of the compromises “ do not hold insurance companies accountable . ”
“ I ’m not supporting any other program where all these conditions are on it , ” Burris told reporters last week .
“ We need competition , we need costs down — that ’s the only thing I can see myself voting for .
No trigger — no anything . ”
Although Illinois prosecutors did not file charges against him , Burris has n’t been interviewed by investigators for the Senate Ethics Committee , which one person familiar with the matter said was a sign that the ethics investigation is still ongoing .
The controversy over Burris ’s appointment has been expensive ; his campaign committee ’s debt stands at $ 139,039 , much of the money owed to consultants who helped him handle his involvement in the Blagojevich mess , according to his latest fundraising report .
During the past several weeks , Burris has used the health care debate as a way to define himself differently .
He has thundered his views on the floor and in interviews , and he said he was the first Democratic senator to insist he ’d oppose a bill without a robust public option .
He added on C - SPAN that either the trigger plan or the opt - out provision represents a “ watered - down public option ” and a “ weakening position ” that will allow insurance companies to get around the tough rules of a nationally run plan .
Dick Simpson , professor of political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago , predicted that if Burris ’s tough rhetoric matches results in the final bill , he ’ll leave behind a “ much better legacy . ”
“ He ’s mostly been a team player , and he has n’t used his authority in the past to block things , ” Simpson said .
And Reid knows full well the power of any individual senator but thinks his caucus is close to coming together behind the plan .
“ We have 60 people in the caucus , ” Reid said Monday .
“ It ’s a comfort level .
...
We all hug together and see where we come out . ”
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia —
With much of the Muslim world beset by violence , Malaysia had prided itself on its “ clean ” record , with no major episode of terrorism on home soil .
That badge of distinction was forfeited in the early hours Friday when a Kuala Lumpur church was firebombed and two more attacked in a nearby suburb , apparently in response to a New Year ’s Eve court ruling that allowed a Catholic newspaper to use the word Allah to refer to the Christian god in its Bahasa Malaysia edition .
Allah is an Arabic word meaning “ one god ” that predates Islam and is used by Christians in a number of other Muslim countries without controversy .
Five more churches were attacked over the weekend into Monday , leaving the ruling United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) to fend off accusations that it has stoked ethnic and religious tensions for political mileage among the country ’s Muslims , who make up 60 percent of the population and dwarf the country 's 9 - percent Christian minority .
The Muslim majority in Malaysia , which is comprised mainly of ethnic Malays ( all Malays are Muslim ) , has undergone a sharp uptick of religious conservatism in recent years .
Prime Minister Najib Razak sharply denied that the ethnicity - based party instigated the unprecedented outbreak of anonymous violence .
“ Do not point the fingers at UMNO or anyone else , we have always been very responsible , ” he said at a press conference .
Najib introduced the concept of 1 M alaysia shortly after taking office last year so that “ Malaysia will be the sum total of all [ its ] races ” governed by “ mutual respect and not just tolerance . ”
But a number of his administration ’s actions and statements have flown in the face of the slogan ’s spirit .
Around the time that Najib introduced 1 M alaysia , he appointed his cousin Hishammuddin Hussein to home affairs minister .
It was a curious move considering Najib ’s stated aim of uniting Malaysia .
Hishammuddin had a history of inciting ethnic and religious tensions , most notably when as education minister he waved a traditional Malay dagger at UMNO ’s annual assembly that was read by many to be a threat to Malaysia ’s minority ethnicities — the Chinese and Indians .
In his nine months as home affairs minister he has opposed human rights rallies but defended Malays who paraded a severed cow head last year in protest of the construction of a Hindu temple .
No major UMNO leader urged restraint in the days leading up to the planned protests against the “ Allah ” court ruling , ” while the cousins — who have typically opposed freedom of expression on the putative grounds that it would threaten national stability — went as far as to defend the planned protest .
While no one has yet been arrested in connection with the church attacks , it can be said that the government ’s ethnicity - based double standards have fed notions of superiority and given license to the upsurge of intolerance plaguing the Malay community .
" The irresponsible conduct of fanning the emotions by UMNO leaders has brought about this dangerous situation , ” said Malay opposition politician Zaid Ibrahim in a press statement Friday .
“ What we see today confirms that this country is being governed not by engagement , consultation , sophistication or persuasion but by brute and mob force . ”
History emboldened UMNO up to this point .
Blessed with a docile citizenry , the party came to conduct its communal brinkmanship without fear of major consequence .
Now it finds itself in the unenviable position of having to rein in a situation that eerily hints at the tipping point Malaysians have long feared : a brazen spate of ethnicity - based violence that begets more of the same .
At a minimum the face - saving myth of harmony that Malaysians have clung to in a bid to impress the world now hangs in tatters .
That sanitized lie came by way of sloganeering , a tightly controlled media and billions spent on eye - catching infrastructure projects intended to make Malaysia appear both modern and progressive .
The myth now laid bare , tourist numbers may drop .
But it may also force Malaysians to look squarely at the depth of the rot in their midst and to take a more proactive approach to repairing relations between ethnicities and across religious groups .
The early signs are good .
One hundred thirty Muslim NGOs have reportedly volunteered to help ensure the safety of churches around the country .
The Muslim CEO of a bank donated RM100,000 ( around $ 30,000 ) on behalf of the bank for church reconstruction .
The government plans to hold an inter - faith dialogue , after having shot down the idea in the past .
It remains to be seen , however , whether these initial gestures of good will will correspond to a humbler more inclusive approach to nation - building .
Beyond the media glare , there are signs that Malaysians are retreating into the pattern of not talking through unsettling issues across ethnic lines .
That tendency helped maintain a tenuous peace but engendered deep ethnically - based resentments that appear to have played a hand in the recent spate of attacks .
It reminds me of something Prime Minister Najib told me three years ago when I pointed out to him that Malaysia ’s three major ethnic groups — the Malays , Indians and Chinese — have confessed to me some pretty awful feelings they have for one another .
Najib said that was fine , so long as each group kept their resentments within the four proverbial walls of its respective community .
This was to , in effect , treat the symptoms rather than the cause , and of course one day one of those walls would come crashing down .
The day of reckoning arrived on Friday .
UMNO and Najib will now have to look past the four walls for real solutions .

This composite image of M31 ( also known as the Andromeda galaxy ) shows X - ray data from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory in gold , optical data from the Digitized Sky Survey in light blue and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope in red .
The Chandra data covers only the central region of M31 as shown in the inset box for the image ( roll your mouse over the image above ) .
New results show that the Chandra image would be about 40 times brighter than observed if Type Ia supernova in the bulge of this galaxy were triggered by material from a normal star falling onto a white dwarf star .
This implies that the merger of two white dwarfs is the main trigger for Type Ia supernovas for the area observed by Chandra .
Similar results for five elliptical galaxies were found .
These findings represent a major advance in understanding the origin of Type Ia supernovas , explosions that are used as cosmic mile markers to measure the accelerated expansion of the universe and study dark energy .
Most scientists agree that a Type Ia supernova occurs when a white dwarf star -- a collapsed remnant of an elderly star -- exceeds its weight limit , becomes unstable and explodes .
However , there is uncertainty about what pushes the white dwarf over the edge , either accretion onto the white dwarf or a merger between two white dwarfs .
Your browser does not support the video tag .
A Type Ia supernova caused by accreting material produces significant X - ray emission prior to the explosion .
A supernova from a merger of two white dwarfs ( view animation above ) , on the other hand , would create significantly less .
The scientists used the difference to decide between these two scenarios by examining the new Chandra data .
A third , less likely possibility is that the supernova explosion is triggered , in the accretion scenario , before the white dwarf reaches the expected mass limit .
In this case , the detectable X - ray emission could be much lower than assumed for the accretion scenario .
However , simulations of such explosions do not show agreement with the observed properties of Type Ia supernovas .
Good cultures balance short and long - term goals . �
Focusing too much on the long - term can lead to overinvestment , and problems like Japan still faces .�
Focusing on the short - run can lead governments and companies to focus on manipulating budget and earnings numbers to fulfill their own selfish ends .
At present , we have no surplus of long - termism , but a surfeit of short - termism .�� �
Many economic players have decided that it is in their interest to play for time� — make things look good in the short run , and maybe a magical fix will appear for long run problems .
It seems that the EU thinks that if they can make Greece behave , that all will be right .�
Well , tell that to those that protest in Greece . �
Let each EU nation rather take a step back and ask , “ What is cheaper in the long - run , bailing out Greece , or bailing out my banks with Greece exposure ? ” �
The latter is probably cheaper , but not certainly so .�
Given the lack of unanimity , the situation would lean toward bailing out domestic banks , because bailing out Greece requires the cooperation of separate nations , many of which have electorates that strongly oppose a bailout of Greece .
But , that could mean a virtual dissolution of the Eurozone . �
Not necessarily .�
You could end up with a lot of nations in default , and shut out of the bond markets ( the PIIGS ) , while the rest do seemingly fine , as they quietly bail out their banks .
In that situation , the Euro would still exist , and might continue to be the currency of nations that are in default . �
They just could not borrow any more at any rate in Euros , and perhaps not in any currency .
But the Eurozone itself would be in tatters , at least from a marketing standpoint . �
What is good about being in the Eurozone ? �
Free trade ?�
Well Britain has that , even though they are a basket case , at least they control their own destiny , sort of .�
The veneer that being in the Eurozone means that you are a high quality borrower is shattered .�
Credit spreads over the German Euro benchmark will be high indeed for nations that have been undisciplined in their finances .

People and governments like stasis .�
No change .�
Why ?�
It makes policy simple .�
If something is in trouble , give it aid .�
But — what if the trouble is an indication that people do n’t want what is being produced by the one that is in trouble ? �
Capitalism is wonderful because it is dynamic .
It can quickly adjust to changing conditions , unlike socialist bureaucrats .�
Rather than volatility being a negative , with capitalism it is a positive .�
It shows that the economy needs to change , that losses on prior bad investments should be recognized .�
Failure to see things like this lessens the flexibility of the economy , and makes the eventual adjustments much larger than they would have to be if we did not interfere in the economy .
Now , this applies all over the world .�
China is creating some of the biggest white elephants in history , so it seems . �
Like Japan in the late 80s , they are building up useless industrial capacity . �
Naive Keynesianism says that it does not matter what one spends money on , what matters is that the money gets spent , and quickly .
We may as well throw bricks at every window we see with that logic , knowing that GDP will record that glassman ’s wages , but will not record the loss from a broken window .
Alas , we have too much automotive capacity , so we support automotive firms in the US . �
We have too many bankers and too much capacity to build homes , so we support that as well .�
Far better that we let firms fail , and let the assets be released to better uses .�
Why waste your life or capital in an industry where there is not enough demand ?
-==–==-=-=–==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
In one sense , my claim of cultural failure boils down to not being willing to recognize losses .�
In another sense , it is using the political process to invalidate economics .�
Why should the government bail out company A and not company B ?
The present political climate in the US could be summarized as a question of fairness .�
Why should some benefit from bailouts , and not others ? �
There should be some answer here that does n’t sound lame . �
Lame answer : we were protecting the whole economy by protecting banks .�
Better answer : we goofed in protecting the banks .�
We should have let them fail , and bailed out depositors . �
Do n’t bail out anyone ; let housing prices drop until ordinary people can afford them . �
But if you must bail out , go down to the lowest level , and bail out those with mortgages , which will benefit not only them , but everyone above them .
This leaves aside moral hazard — all bailouts are a mistake . �
Far better to let all fail , and let the system reset . �
Run a hard culture where failure is punished .�
That will cause people to avoid failure with greater assiduousness .
I will have more on this in the likely final segment for this topic .

The Obama administration and Democratic leaders in Congress have not so far succeeded in forcing big polluters to cut greenhouse - gas emissions .
But the U.S. EPA is about to force them to report their greenhouse - gas emissions .
Big whoop , you say ?
Well , actually , it might be .
The new Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule , which took effect last month , requires industrial facilities that release 25,000 metric tons of CO2 - equivalent a year to measure and report their emissions .
( For comparison , that ’s roughly what 2,200 average U.S. households emit annually . )
Initially the rule will affect about 1,200 sites — including factories that produce chemicals , cement , iron , and steel .
A facility can stop reporting if it emits less than 25,000 tons for five years or less than 15,000 tons for three years .
The emissions data collected will be made public starting in March 2011 .
Affected companies will find themselves in a searchable database — and maybe in the headlines too .
The data could well become fodder for “ the biggest polluters in Area X ” local and national stories .
Climate advocates hope the rule will inspire companies to cut their emissions voluntarily .
“ Some companies may have a light bulb turn on when they come face to face with their own emissions , ” said David Doniger , climate policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council .
Even if companies are n’t interested in doing the right thing for its own sake , they might act to avoid bad PR .
And the added attention on emissions could raise public support for regulations with teeth .
“ When the data becomes public in 2011 , it starts a critically important conversation in America about who the big emitters or greenhouse gases are , where they are located , and what commonsense steps they are taking to address their contribution to the climate crisis , ” said Vickie Patton , an air and climate specialist at Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) and a former EPA attorney .
There is historical precedent for this .
In 1985 , in the midst of President Reagan ’s assault on federal regulation , merely preserving clean - air and clean - water laws seemed to be the best hope , never mind expanding them .
In the wake of the Bhopal , India , chemical disaster in 1984 , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and others tried to close gaps in federal protection from airborne toxic pollution .
Their legislation was pared down to a mere requirement that firms measure and report their emissions — the Toxics Release Inventory ( TRI ) .
Chemical industry groups fiercely opposed even this , but it became law .
Waxman recounts what happened next in his book The Waxman Report : How Congress Really Works :
The National Toxics Release Inventory could not , of course , reduce air pollution .
But the invaluable information it provided became the basis for legislation that could .
The first report appeared in March 1989 and immediately become front - page news across the country .
It showed that a staggering 2.7 billion pounds of toxic air pollution was released into the air in 1987 .
The media coverage and public outrage spurred by the Toxics Release Inventory eventually pushed Congress to regulate 184 new toxics in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 .
The inventory is still up and running , with a community explorer searchable by ZIP code .
The law has also corresponded with a steady decline in toxic emissions :
Disposal of toxics measured measured by the Toxic Release Inventory , 1988 - 2008
EPA
Before you get your hopes up …
There is a key difference , though , between the new rule and the toxics rule .
The TRI told citizens which companies were causing measurable harm to their communities .
But greenhouse gases are n’t toxic and do n’t have direct regional effects , so there ’s less reason for locals to care about emissions from nearby factories .
Gases released in Denver and Beijing have the same effect in Denver .
This distinction may not matter in the minds of citizens , who like their local companies to be good corporate citizens across the board .
And climate change will carry toll on public health , even though the effects are less immediate : the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) expects it will promote the spread of infectious diseases like malaria , worsen the effects of asthma , make heat - related illnesses more common , cause extreme - weather disasters , and threaten food security .
The impact of the new rule could also be limited because not all of the data it collects will be new .
Large electric utilities have been reporting their greenhouse - gas emissions under the EPA ’s acid rain program since 1995 , and this has n’t led to significant reductions .
“ We have hour - by - hour emissions data for every big power plant , ” NRDC ’s Doniger said .
“ It ’s very good data and it ’s very important for understanding how to build a climate control program , but it has n’t inspired a lot of them to cut their emissions back . ”
The new rule also has some obvious gaps — like letting several key industry sectors off the hook .
About 40 agriculture sites emit more than 25,000 tons of CO2 equivalent , but they are excluded from the rule by a directive from Congress .
The EPA has not finished its reporting requirement for coal , oil , and natural gas extraction either , which has led to a lawsuit from EDF and Earthjustice .
And the agency must resolve legal challenges from as many as eight business groups opposing the rule , though an EPA official familiar with the program said the potential lawsuits were unlikely to stop the rule .
The new rule ’s greatest value is probably the information it will give to policymakers designing climate action plans .
“ Thoughtful , well - designed public policy requires rigorous data , ” said Patton .
“ This greenhouse - gas emissions data is the foundation . ”
The new rule took effect just before another big step in corporate transparency on climate issues — a Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that companies “ must consider the effects of global warming and efforts to curb climate change when disclosing business risks to investors . ”
This too could lead to more public understanding of just how disruptive climate change could be to U.S. businesses , and to more pressure for businesses to do their part to avert it .
In the big picture , of course , the planet continues heading toward tipping points beyond which scientists fear it will be too late to stop climate change .
Voluntary cuts from businesses are no longer enough , and even if the new information shines new attention on large polluters , there ’s no reason to wait for that .
“ Frankly , I hope we have [ climate ] legislation before those public reports come out , ” Doniger said .
Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia ( CNN ) --
For the first time , Malaysian authorities have caned three Muslim women under Islamic law for acts of adultery , the Malaysian national news agency Bernama said .
Home Minister Hishamuddin Hussein announced the canings Wednesday , saying the penalty was carried out February 9 at a women 's prison near Kuala Lumpur .
The canings -- a punishment that persists across Malaysian society since the British colonial era of the 19th century -- have been denounced by one Amnesty International official , who says " caning is tantamount to torture . "
But Hishamuddin said the punishment was carried out " to educate and make the offenders realize their mistakes and to return to the right path . "
" It is hoped that the issue will not be wrongly interpreted to the extent of tarnishing the sanctity of Islam , " he was quoted as saying .
He also said the punishment did not cause any injury and that the women were remorseful and repented , Bernama reported .
The women were struck with a rattan cane .
One woman was released Sunday after spending a month in prison , another will be released in the next few days , and the third will be released in June .
Malaysia , which considers itself a moderate Muslim country , has a dual - track justice system , in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil ones .
Muslims make up about 60 percent of the country 's population of 28 million .
Last year , a woman was sentenced to caning under Islamic law for drinking alcohol in public -- beer at a hotel bar -- and that case caused an uproar in the country .
Malaysia forbids alcohol consumption by Muslims , even those who are visiting the country .
The caning sentence of Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno has been postponed while the issue is under review , and she said that if she were to be caned , she wanted the flogging to occur in public .
" Let 's be transparent about it , " said Kartika , a mother and part - time model .
An Islamic court also fined her $ 1,400 for the act .
She has pleaded guilty and paid the fine .
Lance Lattig , a researcher on Malaysia for the human rights group Amnesty International , told CNN that the vast majority of canings are applied to illegal immigrants by civil courts , but the latest examples indicate that sharia courts happen to be picking up on the practice .
" It 's not Muslims on the march , " he said .
" It 's the tip of the iceberg of the bigger problem . "
No matter who does it , he says , the group considers caning to be " cruel , inhumane and degrading . "
The 1989 Revolution flag without the communist emblem is still a powerful symbol in Romania
By Nick Thorpe
BBC News , Timisoara
As the white paper was torn away from the yellow wall , a wave of applause passed through the crowd .
Beneath it , four words were sprayed in Hungarian in red paint : " Eljen Laszlo Tokes - Szabadsag " ( " Long Live Laszlo Tokes - Freedom ! " ) .
For this 20th anniversary of the start of the revolution in the western Romanian city of Timisoara , the Reformed Church chose to restore the original graffiti to its place under the window .
This was the window from which Pastor Laszlo Tokes , an ethnic Hungarian vicar , spoke to the crowds who came to try to prevent his arrest by the Securitate - the secret police - on 16 December 1989 .
The crowd swelled , and marched on Communist Party headquarters .
It then returned to the streets the next day , and the security forces opened fire .
The railway log details how special trains were used to ferry troops
As news of the massacre spread , people took to the streets in other cities , in solidarity with Timisoara .
By 21 December , the waves which began in this city had built up into the tidal wave of Bucharest .
And on 22 December the dictator , Nicolae Ceausescu , fled .
He was caught , tried , and executed by a firing squad on 25 December .
Secret archives 20 years on , the BBC has gained access to a remarkable document , the Timisoara station - master 's log from November and December 1989 .
Hand - written , it meticulously records the details of each train which arrived in Timisoara North railway station during the revolution .
Placed alongside the military log - books of the army , the testimony of eye - witness , and those pages of the secret police archives which were not destroyed , the railway notes will help historians get closer to the truth about the revolution .
They may also help prosecutors - if any of the 440 people identified so far by investigators as participants in efforts to suppress the revolution are ever brought to trial .
The log - book was hidden until this year , and was provided by an anonymous person .
" You never met me , " he told my colleague , as he handed it over at a late - night meeting .
" We never had this conversation . "
Whatever happened down in the street was the problem of the police and the gendarmerie
Radu Tinu
Grim legacy of the Securitate On 16 December 1989 , between 2040 and 2240 in the evening , single wagon train 15 / II arrived in Timisoara from Bucharest .
It was met by the station chief .
All other trains had to make way for it .
The timing is significant .
The protest gathering was still outside Pastor Tokes 's house - the marchers had not yet moved off into the city .
According to Radu Tinu - at that time the number two in the Timis county Securitate - the deputy police chief of Romania , the deputy chief prosecutor , and a Securitate general were on that train .
" I had a horrible week , with hardly any sleep , " he told me .
He watched the revolution unfold before his eyes , collecting information based on phone taps , bugged buildings and a wide network of informers ; and then details of the casualties .
He made daily reports to his superiors in Bucharest .
Uniformed security forces first opened fire on the crowd on the afternoon of 17 December .
To this day , former Securitate officers like Mr Tinu blame the army , and the army blames the secret police for the killings .
" We were just an intelligence service .
So what we had to do was to get our information and to analyse it .
" Whatever happened down in the street was the problem of the police and the gendarmerie . "
More than 1,000 people died during the revolution , including 72 in Timisoara .
In one of the most gruesome episodes , 48 bodies were taken from Timisoara hospital and driven to Bucharest .
There , their bodies were incinerated , and their ashes scattered in the snow .
The station master 's log book provides evidence of other efforts by the authorities to crush the revolt .
It tells how the electric power supply was cut " accidentally " between Timisoara North and Timisoara East stations .
It shows details of unscheduled trains arriving in the city from other parts of Romania , loaded with workers ' militia , armed with wooden bats distributed at army barracks , to punish the people for their disloyalty .
One of the first successes of the crowds was to persuade those workers to join the revolt .
After that , the army in Timisoara came over to the side of people too .
' Troops to disembark '
There is another intriguing entry , from 0755 on the morning of 21 December .
The protests had spread to other cities by then , but Ceausescu was still in power in the capital .
Supplementary train 1006 / A , with two brand new carriages , their windows blacked out , loaded with USLA - anti-terrorist troops - arrived in the outskirts of Timisoara .
" Comrade Captain Brustureanu will indicate where to stop , at the Aradului Boulevard bridge , where the troops will disembark , " reads the entry .
From there , they set out across the botanical gardens towards the city centre .
Were they sent to fight the army , and seize back control ?
The army and the secret police still blame each other for the killings
One of the tragedies of the Romanian revolution was that so many people died actually after the dictatorship fell , in battles between the army and unidentified " terrorists . "
Many were civilians , hit by stray bullets .
The youngest victim in Timisoara was just two years old .
Few people have ever been put on trial , and fewer still convicted .
Walking down the street , late in the evening , past the ground - floor flat where Laszlo Tokes used to live , we see two small children standing at the window from where he once addressed the crowds , gazing in wonder at the falling snow .
Instinctively , I raise a hand , in greeting .
They hesitate , then wave back .

Editorial
Launch of Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition
LAST WEEK saw the culmination of a series of discussions by participants in the ' No2EU - Yes to Democracy ' European election coalition to see whether another alliance could be constructed for the forthcoming general election .
The result is that there will now be an election challenge , under the newly - registered electoral banner , Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition ( TUSC ) .

No2EU was an alliance for a specific election , registered as a party as required by electoral law , involving the RMT transport workers ' union , the Socialist Party , the Communist Party of Britain , Solidarity - Scotland 's Socialist Movement , and others .
This time the RMT is not formally backing the coalition .
However , RMT branches and regional councils will be able to apply to the union 's national executive to support , politically and financially , individual candidates in their area .
And Bob Crow , general secretary of the RMT , is supporting TUSC in a personal capacity , and will serve on its steering committee .
Places have been reserved on the committee for the core organisations which participated in No2EU , who will now decide on their involvement in the new coalition .
Also involved in a personal capacity are other prominent trade unionists , including Brian Caton , the general secretary of the Prison Officers Association ( POA ) , and leading national officers of the PCS civil servants ' union .
While there is no formal involvement of a national trade union , this is still an important coalescing on the political plane of the most fighting trade union leaders in Britain today .
RMT

A number of local RMT branches , and other trade unionists too , have already declared that they intend to stand candidates in the general election but have not registered a ' party name ' .
Now , if they wish , such candidates will be able to appear on the ballot paper as Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition rather than as ' Independent ' .
Candidates from community campaigns , and other socialist organisations that have not been involved in the discussions to date , will also be able to stand under the TUSC banner .
The coalition has agreed a core policy statement which prospective candidates will be asked to endorse .
As a federal ' umbrella ' organisation , however , coalition candidates and participating organisations will also be able to produce their own supporting material .
This was the approach successfully adopted by the No2EU campaign , which allowed the different organisations involved to collaborate under a common banner .
The core policy statement reflects the differing perspectives of those involved in the discussions leading to TUSC 's formation .
It recognises that amongst potential coalition supporters there will be " different strategic views about the way forward for the left in Britain , whether the Labour Party can be reclaimed by the labour movement , or whether a new workers ' party needs to be established " , the latter being the position of the Socialist Party .
But with the coming ferocious attacks on public spending , wages , living standards and workers ' rights , regardless of which party ( Tory or New Labour ) forms the next government , the coalition aims to bring home the urgent need for " mass resistance to the ruling class offensive , and for an alternative programme of left - wing policies to help inspire and direct such resistance " .
Core policies
Core policies include opposition to public spending cuts and privatisation , photo Paul Mattsson
The core policies include , amongst others , opposition to public spending cuts and privatisation , calls for investment in publicly owned and controlled renewable energy , the repeal of the anti-trade union laws , and the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan .
The statement makes a clear socialist commitment to " bringing into democratic public ownership the major companies and banks that dominate the economy , so that production and services can be planned to meet the needs of all and to protect the environment " .
Coalition candidates will offer a credible challenge to New Labour , for example , in the contest between Socialist Party councillor and former MP Dave Nellist and the defence secretary Bob Ainsworth in Coventry North East .
But while in some cases its vote may be squeezed , in the context of a polarised election the coalition will still have a significant impact particularly inside the trade unions in forcing a debate on the crisis of working class political representation .
This itself is important preparation for the events to come .
The lack of formal endorsement of the coalition from even left - wing trade unions like the RMT , the POA , the PCS or the Fire Brigades Union will be a disappointment for many workers .
The trade union leaders involved in the coalition , who enthusiastically back it in a personal capacity , felt that more time is needed to convince a broader layer of their memberships to take such an important step at this stage .
This is a reflection of the ambivalent consciousness of many workers about the coming election , with a deep hatred of New Labour but also fear at the prospect of a Tory government .
But we can be confident that big events , both before the election and after , will at some point compel the unions to move decisively onto the political arena .
What is clear is that without a qualitative change in the situation in Britain , through the development of independent working class political organisation to initially at least check the pro-capitalist parties , the ruling class will have a freer hand to impose their austerity policies .
Many commentators have referred to the 2010 election as a ' turning point ' contest and for the working class it will indeed herald the onset of a new age of ' savage cuts ' , whichever establishment party wins .
The launch of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition is a modest but important step in the development of a movement of resistance .
See also the Socialist Party statement , Action needed to bring election coalition into shape , in The Socialist , No.600 , 4 November 2009 .
To sign up as a launch sponsor of TUSC , in a personal capacity , send the necessary details ( name , address , trade union / position , etc ) to TUSC , 17 Colebert House , Colebert Avenue , London E1 4JP or e-mail the electioncoalition@btinternet.com
Donate to the Socialist Party Coronavirus crisis - Finance appeal
The coronavirus crisis has laid bare the class character of society in numerous ways .
It is making clear to many that it is the working class that keeps society running , not the CEOs of major corporations .
The results of austerity have been graphically demonstrated as public services strain to cope with the crisis .
The government has now ripped up its ' austerity ' mantra and turned to policies that not long ago were denounced as socialist .
But after the corona crisis , it will try to make the working class pay for it , by trying to claw back what has been given .
The Socialist Party 's material is more vital than ever , so we can continue to report from workers who are fighting for better health and safety measures , against layoffs , for adequate staffing levels , etc .
Our ' fighting coronavirus workers ' charter ' , outlines a programme to combat the virus and protect workers ' living conditions .
When the health crisis subsides , we must be ready for the stormy events ahead and the need to arm workers ' movements with a socialist programme - one which puts the health and needs of humanity before the profits of a few .

Nurses for Reform have been featured on Liberal Conspiracy before .
They ’re a campaigning group with links to the libertarian Adam Smith Institute and ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation think - tanks .
Last month they met with David Cameron to discuss their ideas , which included wholesale privatisation of the NHS , the scrapping of national pay agreements for health workers and nurses being given brands like consumer products .
The idea of competing brands of nurses ( None of yer manky Tesco nurses working in our hospital .
We only use Sainsburys nurses ) might sound daft , but this weekend Nurses For Reform crossed the line from silly to downright offensive .
Their leading spokesperspon has been strongly implying the NHS was created along Nazi principles .
The claim was made by Dr Helen Evans , NFR ’s leading spokesperson and a health fellow at the Adam Smith Institute .
On the NFR ’s blog she pointed to a spoof video of the film Downfall , subtitled to make it appear that Hitler was endorsing Obama ’s health reforms .
She then added :
The problem is that for those who know their history this is all too close to the knuckle .
For in Britain the architect of the National Health Service , Sir William Beveridge , told the Daily Telegraph in November 1942 that his proposals would take Britain “ … half - way to Moscow ” .
More significantly , after the Second World War two papers marked ‘ secret ’ and providing a detailed commentary on Beveridge ’s plan were found in Hitler ’s Berlin bunker .
One ordered that publicity should be avoided but , if mentioned , the report should be used as “ … obvious proof that our enemies are taking over national - socialist ideas ” .
The other report offered a Nazi assessment of the plan as being no ‘ botch - up ’ .
The national socialist analyst wrote that the NHS would be “ … a consistent system … of remarkable simplicity … superior to the current German social insurance in almost all point ” .
Designed to take Britain half way to Moscow and simultaneously admired by Hitler ’s inner coterie , socialised medicine and the Fabian welfare state has a particularly unsavory heritage .
It is this history that makes the above film a comedy of human tragedy and one deeply rooted in the darker recesses of coercion .
This appears to be an attempt to import the “ socialised healthcare = Nazism ” rhetoric of the US Tea Baggers into British political discourse .
I ’m an NHS employee myself .
If the NHS is based on Nazi principles , what does that supposedly make me ?
An SS stormtrooper ?
Or perhaps Dr Evans feels that I ’m merely made to go along with their ideology , so maybe I ’m comparable to a Wehrmacht conscript ?
This sort of Reductio ad Hitlerum language is an insult to the many dedicated staff of the NHS .
If it was just some fringe group making these statements , then it would n’t really matter .
But these people are directly advising the man who may well be our next prime minister .
If David Cameron wants to show that he ’s serious about defending the NHS , he might want to make a start by disowning this bunch of wingnuts .

Rabid feline news now , with the erroneously spelled peripheral maker announcing " a new range of premium Cyborg gaming mice " expected to be in ( side ? ) consumer 's hands by Spring 2010 .
We feel like we can confide in you : we also assumed Mad Catz had finally done it , actually blended human flesh with a traditional gaming mouse to create a new class ( and species ! ) of PC gaming peripheral .
Alas , no – it's just the addition of four mice , ranging in price from $ 50 to $ 130 , to their currently keyboard - heavy existing Cyborg PC gaming lineup .
" The Cyborg mouse range was developed entirely in house and I believe they are the most comfortable gaming mice you 'll ever use , " said Mad Cat Darren Richardson .
" Also , upon contact with your hand , it will merge with your DNA and create an entirely new appendage blending the greatest aspects of the human body and the gaming mouse . "
Alright , we made that last part up ... but how about actual half - robot - half - rodent tech ...
Radley Balko posted about a woman in Wayne County who broke no laws yet had to pay $ 1,400 to get her car back when police seized it " after they mistook Vaughn 's co-worker for a prostitute . "
From a Detroit News article :
The Wayne County Sheriff 's Office , which helps run the prosecutor 's forfeiture unit , took in $ 8.69 million from civil seizures in 2007 , more than four times the amount collected in 2001 .
The Wayne County Prosecutor 's Office gets up to 27 percent of that money .
Obama 's Justice Department supports state asset forfeiture laws , says Balko :
It 's worth noting that Obama 's Justice Department filed an amicus brief on behalf of the state in that case .
They were n't obligated to .
Though the solicitor general 's office is charged with defending all federal laws , the law at issue in Alvarez is a state law , not a federal one .
In fact , federal civil forfeiture laws are much friendlier to property owners .
So you could make a decent case that the administration could have argued against the Illinois law .
At the very least , it could have kept quiet .
Instead , it argued that the state should retain the power to take property from people without ever charging a crime ( and not necessarily kingpins –the Illinois law in question applies only to property valued at under $ 20,000 ) , and keep that property for a year or more before affording the owner a chance to get it back .
Taking property from poor people without due process of law in order to enrich local police departments .
Seems like the sort of thing Barack Obama might have fought to change in his days as a community organizer .
You can thank us later for clarifying this confusing Market Saw article , but we ’ve finally gotten our finger on the pulse .
There may be a brand newfilm in the works and on its way to as many 3D compatible screens as it can get its furry mogwai hands on .
The rumor of an impendingin 3D comes incredibly early on in the process , which means there ’s no cast , no crew , no start date , and no release date anywhere in sight .
All we know is that somewhere someone is writing it , it may or may not be Chris Columbus who penned the original , and that Joe Dante will probably not be back to direct .
In 2006 , Dante said there would be a third installment to his series but that he more than likely would n’t be doing it since the studio “ would n’t ask him . ”
Dante seemed convinced that the charm of his movies was in the puppetry and now in a world ruled by CGI his slimy green creations would be ruined .
That ’s not to say that a studio would n’t be willing to make a pile of cash without him , but purists would side with Dante .
There ’s no denying that the 80’s was the horror / comedy hayday . , hell evenall took a page out of the Abbott and Costello handbook and brought horror to a new and hilarious level .
Now thatandare both getting sequeled , it ’s safe to say our safe haven of 80 ’s cinema is about to be fully pillaged for sequels and remake material .
Where do you guys weigh in ?
Are you excited to see some movies from your childhood getting sequels so late in the game ?
Or do you think the charm will be lost in the new technology ?
In a significant policy reversal , AT&T announced Thursday that it will allow Sling Media 's iPhone app to run on its 3G network .
That means owners of various Sling Box devices can watch live , streaming TV , as well as DVR - recorded content and movies downloaded at home , using an iPhone without a Wi -Fi connection .
Last May , AT&T claimed Sling 's iPhone app would " create congestion " on its 3G network .
It ran tests in December , and now concludes that " the optimized app can run on its 3G network " and said it has alerted both Apple and Sling to its decision .
What changed ?
In part , the Sling app itself , according to AT&T .
AT&T 's announcement claims that while the Sling iPhone app had always been optimized for 3G , AT&T " worked with " Sling to make it even more efficient ( i.e. , degraded video and / or audio quality until the Sling app consumed an acceptable amount of bandwidth ) .
In the future , when an app developer presents something consumers want , but which takes up too much of AT&T 's wireless bandwidth , AT&T plans to do the same .
" Just as we 've worked with Sling Media in this instance , we look forward to collaborating with other developers so that mobile customers can access a wider , more bandwidth - sensitive , and powerful range of applications in the future , " said AT&T mobility and consumer markets president and CEO Ralph de la Vega .
Some degree of AT&T oversight of apps makes sense , because its poor wireless performance is , to an extent , a casualty of the iPhone 's runaway success ( which could be why AT&T allows Sling to stream to other smartphones over 3G ) .
By working with developers to limit their apps ' bandwidth , AT&T hopes to give consumers what they want without further degrading its network .
Only yesterday , Skype announced that it will soon offer an iPhone app that operates on its 3G network .
That follows AT&T 's decision to allow VoIP apps to run over its 3G network , despite those apps ' ability to make calls without using voice minutes .
Skype says the reason it has yet to deploy one is that it is tweaking audio quality , likely so that it still sounds good despite AT&T 's restrictions on app bandwidth .
SlingPlayer Mobile is one of the most expensive on iTunes – $ 30 – and it works only if you have Sling hardware at home that costs hundreds of dollars .
But it integrates with any video system , including TiVo .
Slingbox aficionados have been watching their home channel lineup and programming anywhere in the world on their laptops using downloadable software and , more recently , via a web interface .
In addition , owners of selected Blackberry , Symbian , Blackberry , Palm , and Windows Mobile phones have been able to stream over 3G to their cellphones for over a year .
But there are no monthly fees and no new service to sign up for :
You simply run SlingPlayer and watch as if you were home .
You can operate your DVR to record programs , play movie rentals and call up video - on - demand , making it all available in your pocket .
AT&T's 180 - degree reversal on Sling 's streaming television app and Skype 's internet calling app for the iPhone did not happen in a vacuum .
First , this Federal Communications Committee has teeth .
The new sheriff in town has shown a particular interest in making sure the bond between device manufacturers and network operators does not unfairly reduce consumer choice .
Plus , AT&T needs a favor from the FCC in another area , as it seeks permission to switch from landline voice service to IP - based voice service ( an AT&T spokesman said the company wants the FCC to establish a timeline for the transition similar to the one it set for DTV ) .
FCC pressure forced AT&T to allow VoIP onto the iPhone , and fear of similar pressure in the media streaming area could have affected its decision about Sling .
( AT&T already allowed Major League Baseball to stream , as The New York Times points out , providing ammunition for Sling and consumer groups who complained to the FCC that AT&T 's refusal to support Sling was discriminatory . )
The iPad also played a role in AT&T 's not - so - sudden change of heart .
Apple did AT&T some big favors with the iPad not only by making AT&T the default service provider , but by using a micro SIM card instead of a normal SIM card , which will allow AT&T to charge separately for iPhone and iPad connections .
In return , Apple likely pressured AT&T to allow these apps , making the iPhone and iPad more attractive and fighting consumers ' growing impression that this limitless - seeming device is constrained by AT&T 's data service .
What matters today is that Sling will work on the iPhone through AT&T's 3G network .
What matters tomorrow is how the video looks , and how the audio sounds , following AT&T's " optimization " of the app .

Maple Leaf celebrates launch of new reclosable packaging with a For the Love of Bacon survey
MISSISSAUGA , ON , Feb .
3 /CNW / - According to a recent national survey , Canadians are passionate about bacon .
When asked to choose between bacon and sex , more than four in 10 ( 43 % ) chose bacon !
Maple Leaf commissioned this Angus Reid For the Love of Bacon survey to mark the launch of their newest product innovation , Maple Leaf Reclosable Bacon .
" We wanted to probe how deeply rooted Canadians ' passion for bacon is - and the For the Love of Bacon survey sure opened our eyes ! " explained Adam Grogan , VP Marketing , Maple Leaf Foods .
" Our research also told us that Canadians ' number one frustration with typical bacon packaging is that it can't be reclosed ( 71 % ) and that it 's too messy ( 52 % ) .
We know people love bacon , and now with Maple Leaf Reclosable Bacon , they 'll love the package too ! "
The packaging innovation should be welcomed , according to additional survey results , as nearly three out of four survey respondents ( 73 % ) said they love bacon .
In fact , nearly one in five Canadian men ( 18 % ) agreed that some days , they just can't survive without bacon .
Bacon :
The key to a man 's heart ?
Ladies , thinking about which fragrance will woo a man ?
Think bacon .
When asked to rank various aromas by preference , 23 % of men ranked bacon as number one .
And it seems bacon lovers think they are better lovers .
When asked if they are good lovers , four out of five respondents ( 82 % ) who said they love bacon , also said they are good lovers .
And when asked if they are romantic , four out of five respondents ( 81 % ) who said they love bacon also agreed they are romantic .
The survey also revealed some noteworthy regional differences .
It may be bacon trumps love in the Prairies .
Nearly one in four of respondents ( 23 % ) from Manitoba and Saskatchewan wondered if ' my partner loves bacon more than me ' .
Maybe a little more sizzle in the bedroom instead of the kitchen is in order ...
Of note - western Canadians are especially enamoured with bacon .
Of respondents from British Columbia , 50 % said they would give up sex before bacon , versus 37 % of respondents from Quebec .

Do you tear through tasty food , only to realize 20 minutes later that , well , your probably did n't need that much ?
Chewing big bits of food at least 25 times might help — and that 's nearly a full alphabet countdown .

The UK edition of Men's Health offers a few tips on eating without eating too much .
They cite this bit of science for the quirky suggestion of reciting the alphabet :
Masticating while mentally reciting the alphabet could help you feel fuller for longer , says a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
Participants who chewed nuts 40 times , rather than 25 times reported greater satiety .

But maybe you 're at a business lunch , or want to chime in on what your friend is telling you .
We 'd suggest reserving the 25 - count bites for when the other person is making a point — or combining the alphabet chew with the thoughtful sandwich pause technique .
Hitting 25 on every single bite might be very annoying , but every so often , it might help you realize just how much you 're putting down .

4 Winning food combinations [ Men's Health UK via Lifehacker AU ]
I ’ve just been reading about backscatter X - rays and airport security in my local paper : UK brings in full body scanners .
The UK is looking to push these into routine use , using the attempted attack at Christmas as an excuse .
In this attack , the perpetrator had an incendiary device strapped to his leg , and managed to set his own pants on fire .
There has been controversy over the scanners since their existence hit the media several years ago .
The full body scans show the body quite clearly – a bit like the images purported to be revealed by those “ X - ray Glasses ! ! ” advertised in old comic books .
Concern has largely centred around how the scanners might affect able - bodied cis people : that they will feel exposed , that the security people might be hur - hurring over their fat rolls or breasts , that the images might be saved .
Security “ experts ” have scrambled to refute the claims , saying that only “ same - sex ” people will read the scans ( as if this is supposed to be reassuring to non binary gendered people ) , that the scan reader will be in a separate room from the scannee , that the images will not be able to be saved with the technology .
They assure us that there will be “ privacy algorithms ” in place .
If anyone believes airline security operators for a second when it comes to future commitments to respect the privacy of airline travellers ?
I ’ve a harbour bridge I ’d like to sell you .
The same security experts have assured the media that the scans will be optional , provided as a purely voluntary alternative to a full body pat - down .
I ’m going to go out on a limb right now and guess that the images are not , for example , an option for wheelchair users who ca n’t stand up out of the chair .
Reassurance of options and choices are not particularly useful for the large swathes of the population who ca n’t access them .
Things that will likely show up in a full body scanner :
Urinary catheters .
Incontinence pads .
Colostomy and ileostomy bags .
PEG feeding tubes .
Mastectomy prostheses .
Certain medication pumps and implanted ports , such as insulin pumps .
TENS machines .
Pacemakers .
The bodies , including genitalia , of transgender and intersex and genderqueer people .
All of these are the signs of bodies already marginalised .
Some of these signs may be clear on current security screenings – some may not .
People with marginalised bodies already have major issues with air travel – with the uncertainty of the security process , with the practicalities of dealing with aids and needs while travelling , with the spoon - sapping of travel , with no option but unfamiliar foods that may affect the body unpredictably , with the difficulty of maintaining personal privacy in prolonged periods in close quarters with others , with unpredictable delays that affect health , with security threats when bodies do n’t ‘ match ’ identification documents .
Soon there may be one more element in the mix : the sure knowledge that one ’s personal business will be laid bare in front of security - theatre goons who will almost certainly be poorly trained in disability awareness and gender tolerance .
I give it 24 hours before clandestine mobile phone images of travellers with marginalised bodies show up on the Internet .
Is this worth it ?
The Vatican will announce the resignation today of an Irish bishop accused in a damning report on clerical child sex abuse of ignoring allegations from victims .
The bishop of Limerick , Dr Donal Murray , has been in Rome awaiting his fate for more than a week after claims in the Murphy report that he mishandled abuse allegations against priests in Dublin .
His expected resignation comes as calls grow from the victims of paedophile priests for a criminal investigation into how Murray handled the claims of abuse .
Mervyn Rundle said that Father Thomas Naughton was simply moved from one parish to another after allegations that he was abusing Rundle and other children in the 1980s .
Naughton was jailed yesterday for abusing a boy at least 70 times between 1982 and 1984 .
He was sentenced in 1998 to three years ' jail for abusing Rundle and other boys in the north Dublin area of Donnycarney .
The sentence was reduced by six months on appeal .
Rundle said of the church hierarchy after yesterday 's sentencing : " When are the guards [ Irish police ] going to act against these guys ? "
John Brennan , a retired Garda sergeant who sought to have Naughton removed from Valleymount in 1984 after complaints from parents , said Naughton was " a human being with a problem " and justice should be taken a step further .
" It was his superiors who , aware of this weakness , sent him around to other places , and I think they should n't be allowed at this stage to resign or retire , " he said .
" They should be the subject of a criminal investigation .
If there is neglect and evidence of a cover - up , it should n't be a question of somebody resigning .
They should be the subject of a criminal charge . "
Naughton , a 78 - year - old St Patrick 's Missionary Society priest , had pleaded guilty to five sample counts of indecent assault and yesterday received five three - year sentences , to run concurrently , with the final year suspended in each case .
Handing down the sentences at Wicklow circuit court in Bray , Judge Michael O'Shea said the abuse was " appalling , shocking and horrifying " .
The court heard that it started in 1982 on a six - year - old altar boy in Valleymount parish , where Naughton was curate .
Judge O'Shea said the abuse had an " absolutely catastrophic " impact on the victim 's life .
The archbishop of Dublin , Diarmuid Martin , a leading reformer in the Irish Catholic church , said after the trial : " Tom Naughton was an abuser who damaged the lives of many innocent young people .
I hope those involved in today 's proceedings will find some solace and justice in his having to serve a jail sentence for his crimes . "
Naughton is one of nine priests from Dublin's Catholic archdiocese to have been convicted of child sex abuse .
Four other priests of the diocese face similar charges .
Andrew Madden , who was abused by a former priest , Ivan Payne , last night called for the immediate resignations of five bishops mentioned in the Murphy report – Murray , Jim Moriarty , Martin Drennan , Éamonn Walsh and Ray Field .
" Their continued presence in office is an insult to every child sexually abused by a priest in the Dublin archdiocese .
They display a contemptible level of arrogance and a shocking lack of humility .
The Catholic Church in Ireland has totally failed to respond at all appropriately to the findings of the Murphy report , " he said .

The tarantula that did the damage
The owner of a tarantula spider has suffered severe eye inflammation from cleaning out his pet 's cage , doctors have reported .
They say the man had no idea his pet was the problem when he came to their clinic for treatment .
When they told him they could see tiny hairs sticking out of his eyeball he remembered his pet spider sending out a mist of hairs which hit his face .
The doctors say anyone working with spiders should wear eye protection .
Dr Zia Carrim , of St James 's University Hospital in Leeds , writing in the Lancet , says the man came to his clinic in February , having had a red , watery and light sensitive eye for three weeks .
I advise anybody keeping such tarantulas as pets to be aware of the danger
David Field , Zoological Society of London
It was when he was examined under a high magnification lens , that hair - like projections were spotted at various depths within the cornea .
When these findings were described to the patient , he immediately recalled an incident that had preceded the onset of his symptoms .
Cleaning
Three weeks earlier , he had been cleaning the glass tank ( terrarium ) of his pet , a Chilean Rose tarantula .
While his attention was focused on a stubborn stain , he sensed movement in the terrarium .
He turned his head and found that the tarantula , which was in close proximity , had released " a mist of hairs " which hit his eyes and face .
TARANTULAS New World tarantulas from North and South America have urticating hairs as their first line of defense
All have a venomous bite but it is not deadly to humans
Because other proteins are injected into the victim along with the venom some humans may experience a severe allergic reaction to their bites Dr Carrim said : " It was very obvious that the course of the inflammation was driven by these tiny hairs .
" We attempted removal of corneal hairs for our patient under the operating microscope but even with the smallest pair of forceps it was impossible .
" The Chilean Rose tarantula ( Grammostala rosea ) is one of the most commonly imported tarantulas .
It is believed to be hardy and docile , but it is venomous and has urticating hairs , which can cause a stinging pain , over the back end of its abdomen .
As a defence mechanism , the tarantula will rub its hind legs against its abdomen to dislodge these hairs into the air .
The authors said the spider was about 15 to 20 cm from his eye .
The hairs have multiple barbs that allow them to migrate through the eye tissue to various depths .
Patient 's inflamed eye
Their patient had both surface irritation and evidence that some had migrated through to the innermost endothelial layer of the eyeball provoking inflammation in the interior of the eye .
" He was treated with steroids to dampen down the response " Dr Carrim said .
" And he will remain on long - term treatment with steroids at a very low dose . "
Keepers at Whipsnade Zoo estimate that thousands of people in the UK are keeping tarantulas as pets .
David Field , director of the Zoological Society of London , said : " I advise anybody keeping such tarantulas as pets to be aware of the danger . "

MILAN ( Reuters ) - Dozens of immigrants from North Africa rioted during the night in a multi-ethnic district of Milan , smashing shop windows and overturning cars to protest at the knifing death of an Egyptian , Italian police said on Sunday .
It was the second episode of violence involving immigrants this year , after clashes in southern Italy in January brought about the worst racial violence in the country since World War Two and reignited a long - running debate on immigration .
The rioting began on Saturday evening after a 19 - year - old Egyptian man , identified by police as Hamed Mamoud El Fayed Adou , was killed , apparently by a group of immigrants from South America .
Police said the North Africans , most of them Egyptians , went on a rampage and some clashed with police in the northeastern neighborhood where some 70 percent of shops are owned by immigrants .
Milan ’s deputy mayor , Riccardo De Corato , called the area a “ Wild West between north African and South American gangs . ”
Police said they had identified more than 30 people involved , most of them Egyptian .
Ten Egyptians did not have regular residence permits , and four have been detained .
They were still searching for the South Americans believed to have been responsible for the killing , which they said took place after an argument on a city bus .
The Northern League , an anti-immigrant party in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ’s center - right coalition , called for the immigrants responsible for the violence to be expelled .
CALL FOR EXPULSIONS
One Northern League member called for stiff controls and “ expulsions house by house , floor by floor . ”
Milan , Italy ’s financial capital , is run by a center - right regional government and the opposition said that such riots showed that the government ’s immigration policy was in tatters .
“ They ( the center - right ) govern the country , the ( Lombardy ) region and the city , ” said Pierluigi Bersani , head of the largest opposition party , the Democratic Party .
“ They should accept the fact that their policy on integration and security has failed . ”
Italy ’s government last year approved tough legislation making it a felony to be an illegal immigrant or to help one .
Immigrants without regular papers risk expulsion to their country of origin .
In early January , riots broke out in the Calabrian town of Rosarno when immigrants burned cars and broke store windows to protest against an attack on African farm workers by a gang of local white youths .
At least 53 people , including 18 policemen , were injured in the unrest in the town , located in Italy ’s southern toe .
Authorities moved hundreds of people , mostly illegal temporary workers from sub-Saharan Africa , to immigrant centers in Italy for their protection .
La intención de abrir al Partido de la Revolución Democrática ( PRD ) para ir en alianzas con los partidos Acción Nacional ( PAN ) y Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) confrontó a los principales polos al interior del sol azteca
[ email protected ] OAXTEPEC , Mor. —
La intención de abrir al Partido de la Revolución Democrática ( PRD ) para ir en alianzas con los partidos Acción Nacional ( PAN ) y Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) confrontó a los principales polos al interior del sol azteca .
Desde Veracruz , Andrés Manuel López Obrador envió un mensaje al 12 Congreso Nacional del PRD .
El ex candidato presidencial reprobó una alianza con PRI o PAN y advirtió que ambos partidos representan a quienes son los responsables de “ la tragedia nacional ” .
Aquí , Alejandro Encinas consideró absurdo plantear una alianza con alguno de sus principales oponentes políticos cuando “ lo que se busca es privilegiar esa posibilidad ( de coaligarse electoralmente ) con las fuerzas democráticas progresistas con las que tenemos más identidad política ” .
El ala socialdemócrata de la corriente Nueva Izquierda , encabezada por René Arce , mantuvo un intenso cabildeo entre congresistas a fin de que , en la sesión plenaria del Congreso Nacional , avance la posibilidad de dejar a las directivas estatales decidir abrir sus alianzas electorales .
Jesús Ortega , líder del PRD y cabeza nacional de Nueva Izquierda , dijo que el PRD tiene la idea de crear grandes bloques opositores de contenido progresista , democrático y de contenido de izquierda , que no se limitan a los partidos políticos .
Acompañado por Alejandro Encinas y Carlos Navarrete , el dirigente partidista refirió que el objetivo fundamental del PRD es hacer alianza con la sociedad que piensa en la necesidad de transformaciones profundas en el país .
En las próximas horas , el Congreso Nacional debatirá en su sesión plenaria las dos propuestas presentadas en la mesa de Línea Política : una de René Arce que no prohíbe alianzas con PRI y PAN y la del bloque encabezado por Armando Quintero que cancela de tajo esa posibilidad .
López Obrador argumentó que no se podrían hacer alianzas con las dos fuerzas políticas porque representan a los potentados , a quienes se creen amos y señores de México , a la oligarquía .
“ Además nos robaron la Presidencia de la República ” y reforzó : “ Nosotros no tenemos que hacer nada con esa gente ” .
Recordó que desde el principio ha establecido que el movimiento de transformación está por encima de intereses partidistas porque aquí pueden participar simpatizantes del PRD , PT y Convergencia .
Contra gobiernos autoritarios
El presidente del partido del sol azteca , Jesús Ortega Martínez , planteó que hay una posición a fin de que la política de alianzas esté determinada por las condiciones específicas y concretas que se viven en cada entidad de la República y no tomar una determinación de manera genérica ni desde la dirigencia nacional .
Ortega comentó que el contenido fundamental del documento que se discute en el Congreso Nacional es una política de alianzas , de la construcción de grandes bloques opositores , progresistas , democráticos , de izquierda .
Alianzas , agregó , en las que se tomen en cuenta las características de las regiones , de los estados y de los municipios donde se dará la lucha político - electoral .
El dirigente nacional insistió en que el Partido de la Revolución Democrática quiere ser parte de los grandes bloques opositores contra gobiernos autoritarios que cancelan libertades individuales , políticas y constitucionales .
Encinas consideró que el partido debe ser “ muy congruente ” en su línea política y mostrar sensibilidad a los fenómenos locales que se presenten .
“ Lo digo abiertamente : ni alianzas con el PAN ni con el PRI , son proyectos muy distintos ” .
Last week , while practicing for the upcoming Winter Olympics Kevin Pearce suffered a traumatic brain injury after striking his head on a half pipe while attempting a tricky cab double cork , a maneuver he ’s landed in the past .
Since the fall , he ’s been listed as “ critical , but stable ” condition and has relied on a breathing tube .
After a week with really no news and no improvement , there ’s a glimmer of hope .
Kevin Pearce has now been upgraded to “ serious ” condition and doctors are optimistic :
Danielle Burch , a spokeswoman for Pearce ’s family , said Wednesday that Pearce has improved to serious condition .
Burch said Pearce remained in intensive care at University of Utah Hospital , but his breathing tube has been removed .
She said he is slowly regaining consciousness and is able to follow commands .
This is just awesome news .
Really , really awesome .

Tag Heuer is the third sponsor to distance itself from Woods
Swiss watch maker Tag Heuer is to drop golfer Tiger Woods 's image from its US advertising campaigns for the foreseeable future , a Swiss paper says .
The company acted following " recent events " surrounding the sportsman , chief executive Jean - Christophe Babin told the Swiss daily Le Matin .
Woods has been engulfed in a media storm since a disturbance outside his house three weeks ago .
He has since admitted being unfaithful to his wife .
Tag Heuer is the third sponsor to react to the news .
Management consultancy firm Accenture and shaving products giant Gillette have already said they will cut back Woods 's role .
" We recognise Tiger Woods as a great sportsman but we have to take account of the sensitivity of some consumers in relation to recent events , " the newspaper 's website quoted Mr Babin as saying .
Le Matin said Tag Heuer would continue to support Woods 's charitable foundation but would use other well known figures to advertise its brand in the US , such as actor Leonardo Di Caprio .
Nike , Woods 's biggest sponsor , has said it will stick with the golfer .
Woods is currently on an indefinite break from golf to try to repair the damage to his family life .
Ann Arbor - based real estate management firm Beal Properties is poised to sign an agreement with a tenant who will launch a 3,420 - square - foot medical marijuana facility at the Beal Building in downtown Detroit .
Beal Properties founder Stewart Beal said the tenant has signed a letter of intent to lease the second floor of the building for five years .
Beal Properties last year acquired the $ 3.5 million , eight - story , 103 - year - old building at 277 Gratiot in Detroit .

“ It is going to be operated by an attorney that will use the space for a medical marijuana facility and his legal office , ” Beal said in an e-mail .
The tentative deal would add to the state ’s steadily risingÂ base of caregivers who are growing marijuana for medical use .
Michigan voters in November 2008 legalized marijuana for certain medical uses .
As of Nov. 30 , the state had registered 2,440 caregivers , who are allowed to grow marijuana and give it to patients .
The caregivers can sell their medical services but not sell the marijuana , the Grand Rapids Press reported .
In Michigan , 5,873 patients are registered to use medical marijuana .

The World Health Organization declared three years ago that circumcision should be part of any strategy to prevent HIV infection in men .
The organization based its recommendation on three randomized clinical trials in Africa that found the incidence of HIV was 60 percent lower in men who were circumcised .
Although this " research evidence is compelling , " wrote the WHO panel assigned to the topic , there was little evidence explaining how circumcision might reduce a man 's risk of acquiring HIV .
Now comes an answer in a new study , published in the January 6 issue of PLoS ONE , which found that there are gross changes in the penis 's microbiome following circumcision , suggesting that shifts in the bacterial environment could account , in part , for the differences in HIV infection .
Families of anaerobic bacteria , which are unable to grow in the presence of oxygen , are abundant before circumcision but nearly disappear after the procedure .
The researchers suspect that in uncircumcised men , these bacteria may provoke inflammation in the genitalia , thereby improving the chances that immune cells will be in the vicinity for HIV viruses to infect .
" We never knew that there were that many anaerobic bacteria on the uncircumcised penis before [ this study ] , " says Ronald Gray , a reproductive epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and one of the lead authors on the current study .
According to a 2006 survey , 56.1 percent of boys in the U.S. are circumcised .
In its recommendation , the WHO panel stated that circumcision efforts would be most beneficial in parts of the world where less than 20 percent of boys are circumcised .
Gray , who is also working with one of the three randomized clinical trials on which WHO based its recommendation , adds that , " If we can show that these anaerobic bacteria are associated with HIV , then one could develop microbicides — antiseptics or targeted antibiotics — that might provide protection . "
In the current study Gray and his colleagues compared the microbiota of 12 HIV - negative Ugandan men ages 15 to 49 before and after they were circumcised .
It was important to limit the study to HIV - negative participants because infection itself can throw off the bacterial environment of the penis , says Lance Price , a research director at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Flagstaff , Ariz . , and co-author on the study .
The team collected swabs from an area between the head and shaft of the men's penises before and one year after circumcision .
Then the researchers performed polymerase chain reaction analysis of a gene that is shared by , although not identical in , numerous bacterial families .
The analysis allowed for identification of different bacterial families as well as abundance counts .
At 12 months after circumcision , the microbiome 's predominant bacterial population had shifted fromanaerobic to aerobic , which require oxygen to grow .
Whereas the researchers detected similar number of bacteria belonging to aerobic families in circumcised and uncircumcised samples , they found that the abundance of anaerobic family members plummeted after circumcision .
As the authors wrote , this decrease makes sense because there is an oxygen - deprived area under the foreskin that is lost after circumcision .
Whereas the current analysis could only detect gene sequences that were specific to bacterial families , the researchers are now working to identify the specific species that presumably cannot survive on circumcised penises .
Price says that the researchers should begin this PCR - based analysis in the next six months , as soon as they finish improving the databases of bacterial sequences and developing new PCR tools .
Once the researchers identify the anaerobic species , the plan is to determine which can create an inflammatory environment that favors HIV infection , Gray says .
Certain species of bacteria , both anaerobic and aerobic , can cause the release of inflammatory cytokines ( immunoregulatory proteins ) from cells present in the skin and body surfaces , such as the foreskin and vagina .
These cytokines then activate a type of immune cell , called Langerhans cells .
Scientists think that HIV transmission requires that the virus first infect activated Langerhans cells , which then pass the virus to T cells .
Even if the researchers demonstrate that specific species of anaerobic bacteria on the uncircumcised penis are potent activators of Langerhans cells , the microbiome is probably only one aspect of the environment that affects HIV infection .
As Gray points out , anatomical changes following circumcision also " almost certainly " account for part of the protection against HIV infection .
Specifically , the authors wrote , after the foreskin is removed the penis head develops extra layers of skin , which reduces the abundance of Langerhans cells .
In any case , changes that occur to the penis microbiome following circumcision could hamper the transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases .
Similar to HIV reduction , Gray 's clinical trial in Uganda found that the incidence of genital herpes and human papillomavirus were about 27 and 35 percent lower , respectively , in circumcised men .
Moreover , the current study found that two of the most abundant anaerobic organisms present on uncircumcised penises , Clostridiales and Prevotellaceae , have been associated with bacterial vaginosis , an uncomfortable condition in which the vagina 's bacterial balance is upset .
This finding could help explain why there are reduced rates of bacterial vaginosis in the wives of circumcised men , Gray says .
He adds that the microbiome study will help doctors understand the extent of the potential health benefits of circumcision .

UPDATE : The Yes Men come clean .
Read this , and watch the video :
Original post from Dec. 14 :
This has all the makings of a Yes Men project , which is too bad , because it would be wonderful news if it were true :
Canada Announces New Agenda For Climate and World Development COPENHAGEN , Denmark —
In a major development coming three days before the final round of UN climate change negotiations in Copenhagen , and responding to the recent concerns expressed by the G77 bloc of countries , Canada ’s Attaché for Environment and Planning announced today an ambitious plan for a new climate change framework that answers vital concerns voiced by developing nations .
Dubbed “ Agenda 2020 , ” the plan sets strict new emissions - reductions guidelines for Canada and fast - tracks financing for vulnerable countries beginning in 2010 .
“ Today the G77 has again made their voice very clear , ” said Jim Prentice , Canada ’s Minister for the Environment .
“ This policy is our answer .
Long in discussion , and slated for release later this week , Agenda 2020 is Canada ’s commitment to a science - based approach to climate change , and our way to assert our partnership with the developing world . ”
The “ announcement ” was posted on the website enviro - canada.ca , modeled after the real website of Canada ’s Department of Environment .
There ’s another seemingly fake site ( http://en.cop-15.org/) modeled after the official site for the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen .
It ’s got video of a congratulatory response to the Canadian proposal from the Ugandan delegation .
The Wall Street Journal has already reported the about - face as fact–no , scratch that , it ’s a fake Wall Street Journal page too .
The fake Journal even found someone to criticize Canada ’s new position :
“ Canadian business is fully committed to a responsible move towards a reduced carbon economy , but the drastic benchmarks announced today seem beyond the pale , ” said Ross Laver of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives .
“ We are still trying to learn more about the proposal , but it ’s clearly a major concern for our members .
This is not the way to create jobs for Canadians . ”
Canada would be a ripe target for this sort of prank from climate - change activists , as its conservative prime minister , Stephen Harper , has refused to commit to meaningful emissions cuts .
It ’s a policy largely driven by the oil - extraction projects in Alberta ’s tar / oil sands region , which result in massive carbon dioxide emissions .
Provincial leaders in Ontario and Quebec have publicly bashed Harper ’s position , saying Canada should offer something better .
There ’s a key hallmark of a Yes Men stunt here : this will force Canadian leaders to make the embarrassing announcement that , no , they have n’t put forward a new plan aimed at reaching a global climate - change treaty .
In the past , The Yes Men have forced Dow Chemical to state that no , it has not accepted financial responsibility for the toxic disaster in Bhopal , India .
This fall the pranksters forced the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to clarify that no , it has not stopped opposing a national climate - change bill .
Speaking of which , Canada ’s indignant response was just released ( it appears , though the response smells fishy too ) .
And Canadian officials do n’t realize it ’s a fake Journal report :
Spoof Releases Inhibit Democracy OTTAWA , Ont. — December 14 , 2009 —
One hour ago , a spoof press release targeted Canada in order to generate hurtful rumors and mislead the Conference of Parties on Canada ’s positions on climate change , and to damage Canada ’s standing with the international business community .
The release , from “ press@enviro-canada.ca , ” alleges Canada ’s acceptance of unrealistic emissions - reduction targets , as well as a so - called “ Climate Debt Mechanism , ” a bilateral agreement between Canada and Africa to furnish that continent with enormous sums in “ reparation ” for climate damage and to “ offset ” adaptation .
Unfortunately , the spoof release was reported in major international outlets .
The Office of the Environment Minister and Environment Canada confirm that this release and all statements within it are unequivocally false .
Worse , they risk heavily damaging the negotiating process .
Canada wishes to fully expose these efforts for the irresponsible deceit they represent , and shall seek the full measure of legal recourse against these criminals under Danish and international law .
Today as always , Canada ’s binding responsibility is to supply the world – including its burgeoning developing portion – with those means of transport , health , and sustenance that prosperous markets require .
Stopping short of these dictates would violate the very principles upon which our nations were founded , and endanger our very development .
Canada ’s current energy policy represents an elegant synthesis of the most advanced science , while remaining faithful to Canada ’s tradition of political pragmatism .
Experts note , for example , that the much - decried oil sands of Alberta , contrary to environmentalists ’ dire assertions , are enabling Canada to meet ambitious emissions goals by providing her , as well as her neighbors , with the energy resources needed to transition to a cleaner energy future .
“ Without the dynamism of our oil sands industry , ” says Bruce Carson , a special Adviser to Environment Canada , “ we in Canada would not have the energy – moral , financial and literal – to develop the alternative energy future the whole world craves . ”
“ Canada ’s line may not always be popular , but we do feel the scientific and political assumptions we ’ve inherited from the Kyoto Protocol no longer suit present physical or market realities , or a vigorous energy policy into the future , ” notes Michael Martin , Canada ’s chief negotiator in Copenhagen .
“ A 2006 baseline for emissions reduction targets , and a comprehensive re-examination of finance for developing countries in the context of a generous and efficient foreign - aid policy package , will guarantee an efficient , direct path to useful negotiations within our increasingly fast - paced energy market . ”
The Canadian government wishes to note that in addition to misleading the world on Canada ’s energy stance , today ’s impostors generated a cascading series of hopes that culminated in the delivery , by the Ugandan delegation , of an impassioned speech in today ’s COP - 15 press briefing .
“ It is the height of cruelty , hypocrisy , and immorality to infuse with false hopes the spirit of people who are already , and will additionally , bear the brunt of climate change ’s terrible human effects , ” said Jim Prentice , Canada ’s Minister for the Environment .
“ Canada deplores this moral misfire , while remaining confident in her critical role in the arena of the UNFCCC , and of the world .
Canada continues to seek dynamic new energy solutions every year , and its energy development research is second to none .
As for Canada ’s role on the international stage , it remains vibrant , strong , and appreciated by our numerous partners . ”
Today ’s stunt , with its short - sighted , unrealistic policy ideas and brutal disregard for the oppressed , should distract no one from the serious , energetic , and meaningful commitment of Canada to a shared sustainable future on this planet , which will guarantee all nations their due portion in accord with historical norms .
Microsoft will eliminate all data collected on Bing users after six months .
The software giant said it sent a letter to the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party , a collection of the EU 's top minds on data protection and privacy issues , today notifying it that the company would reduce the amount of time it stores IP addresses from searchers from 18 months to six months before deleting them .
Currently , Bing takes search data and separates the user 's account information ( such as e-mail or phone number ) from the non-personal information ( such as what the query was ) and only after 18 months does Microsoft take the additional step of deleting the IP address and any other cross session IDs associated with the query .
The only difference with the new policy is that the IP address will be removed completely at six months to provide greater user privacy protection ; the rest of the process will remain the same , since Microsoft says it needs the data to make search better for consumers .
The change will be implemented over the next 12 to 18 months .
The aim is to satisfy the European advisory group , which has been critical of how search engines collect and retain data on individuals for advertising purposes .
In April 2008 , the group issued a major report in which it said search engines can only hang on to European user data for six months , must generally treat IP addresses as " personal information , " and must comply with the rules even if they are based outside the EU .
The panel , which is comprised of national privacy regulators from each of the 27 countries , asked Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft to comply with these demands .
After changes made last year , Google keeps data for nine months while Yahoo is at three months .
The Article 29 group is only an advisory body at the EU level , meaning its members are the national data protection regulators from each EU country , and while it holds the power to fine companies , it has not moved to impose sanctions over the search data retention .
Microsoft 's announcement today tries to find the balance between studying trends in search queries to improve the quality of results and preserving consumer privacy and is likely to avert future problems in the EU .

The historic image shows a telltale bright reflection
NASA have revealed that a flyby of its probe Cassini past Titan , a moon of Saturn , has produced a historic image : the first photograph showing liquid on a world other than our own .
The picture shows a " specular reflection " from an extremely smooth surface , in this case a liquid .
Cassini has been trying to spot one since arriving in 2004 , and in 2008 used infrared data to prove that there were liquid methane lakes down there .
The northern hemisphere has only been visible since August 2009 , as before then it was covered by winter weather .
Most of Titan 's lakes are in the north .
" This one image communicates so much about Titan — thick atmosphere , surface lakes and an otherworldliness .
It ’s an unsettling combination of strangeness yet similarity to Earth , " said Bob Pappalardo , a Cassini scientist with NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
Titan 's atmosphere is , like Earth 's , mainly nitrogen , but temperatures on the icy world are around - 180°C .
This reduces the prospect of life , although the presence of liquid does increase the likelihood .
The lake seen in the photograph is called Kraken Mare , and at 150,000 square miles ( 400,000 square kilometers ) , it is n't the largest basin on north Titan , but it is bigger than the Earth 's biggest lake , the Caspian Sea .
Ralf Jaumann , another Cassini scientist , spoke of the team 's hopes for the future .
" Next , we want to find out more about Titan 's liquid .
Do we have some kind of weather there ?
Do we have changes with seasons ?
Does it rain ?
How does the liquid methane run across the surface ? "
A team of scientists are due to propose to NASA that the agency drop a boat into a Titan lake , with Kraken Mare and the similarly sized Ligeia Mare being hot candidates .
The Titan Mare Explorer ( TiME ) is projected to be relatively low - cost at US $ 400 million and would investigate the composition , density and shape of a Titan lake .
If launched in 2016 it could arrive in 2023 and spend several years floating on the moon .
However , several other projects are also keen to get themselves the next opportunity NASA is offering for the launch of a new project other than its own .

This interview is from February 24th .
At the time , Zenio was # 1 in platinum league division one in Korea , with a record of around 224- 50 .
Once an amateur Warcraft III player aspiring to make it as a pro , he switched his focus to Starcraft II .
Oh , he hit A - within a year of playing BW , so this guy has some talent .
YGosu : Hello , it ’s YGosu here .
Let ’s begin with a brief introduction .
Zenio :
Hi , my name is Choi Jung Min , and I ’m 20 years old .
I live in Uijeongbu , and I ’m currently unemployed ….
YGosu : Oh , 20 years old !
In the prime of your youth , I see .
You have a girlfriend ?
Zenio : Huk !
We broke up a week ago …
YGosu : T_T .
My condolences to you .
Zenio : T_T
YGosu :
If it was one week ago , that coincides interestingly with the release of the Starcraft 2 beta .
Does that have anything to do with your ridiculous win rate and # 1 ranking ?
Zenio :
Well I wanted to break up since before , and with the Starcraft II Beta coming out and all , I told her we should break up .
YGosu : Indeed …
You took those wise words to heart :
To achieve great things , distance yourself from women .
Zenio : Yup , lolz .
YGosu :
So , you ’re # 1 in division one of the platinum league , and have an amazing win rate with 224 wins and 50 losses .
In short , you ’re kinda good at Starcraft 2 .
So , you think you ’re pretty good then ?
Zenio : ; ; ; ; ; ( implies that he ’s flustered ) Nope .
It just looks like I ’m good because the Starcraft players are n’t playing yet .
If the Starcraft players start , I think I ’m gonna fall behind , they ’re scary !
YGosu :
Oh well then .
Then who do you think is the best player in the Starcraft II beta so far ?
For example , yourself … .
Zenio :
Well , I ’d like to say it ’s me , but I ’ll just say it ’s Hyungju hyung ( Check [ pooh ] , Warcraft III pro who is # 1 in another division ) , hehehe .
YGosu :
What a peculiar answer , humble and yet not so humble at the same time .
Zenio : LOL
YGosu : Starcraft II is a Protoss bonanza right now , but you ’re tearing stuff up as Zerg .
How are you spanking this overflow of Protoss players ?
Zenio : Oh , Protoss is strong ?
YGosu :
If you look at the platinum rankings , about 70 % of the players are Protoss .
I counted myself yesterday , I played 14 PvPs during a 20 game stretch yesterday .
Zenio : Protoss does n’t have anything to stop mutalisks with .
I play thinking that if I can just survive the best I can with sunken colonies and zerglings , I ’ll win when I get to mutas .
YGosu :
Oh , I think I ’ve lost to that a few times .
Do you mean the 13 pool -> Expand ->
Corruptor +
Mutalisk build ?
Zenio : Yeah .
As you make mutas , you ’ll have some extra minerals , while you do n’t have enough gas .
I just throw all those extra minerals into drones , and once I ’ve secured my second base I can make 5 hatcheries and mass roaches in a macro game .
Kind of like ZvT in Starcraft : Brood War .
YGosu : I 've lost to it , and it 's a really scary build .
There 's no real counter for that as Protoss ?
Werra : Nope .
You make mutas , and make a hatchery at your main , two at your natural , and two at your third base , a queen at each of them and then win like that .
If you eventually take 4 gas bases , you just can't lose .
YGosu :
You can run five hatcheries , all of them with queens ?
Zenio : Yup .
YGosu : I ’d like to tell you that you ’re kinda awesome .
So you ’re saying that as of now , the Phoenix , which are supposed to counter mutalisks , ca n’t really do much against them ?
Zenio : Yeah , I think so , and that it will probably be patched .
There ’s no good way to stop mutas right now …
YGosu : I guess so .
Even if you get Phoenixes , they die easily to Corruptors .
Even Archons are n’t like they used to be …
Zenio : Yeah , it ’s easy to dodge storm .
Storm is just too weak .
And if you make too many stalkers , you just die to zerlings and roaches .
YGosu :
What a clear explanation from the ZvP master .
I ’m worried that more Zerg players will start using this strategy now .
I ’m considering deleting this interview T_T
Zenio : Gasp !!!
YGosu : Onto the next question .
It ’s very hard to find a high ranking Terran in the platinum leagues , why do you think Terran is doing so poorly now ?
Zenio : Hmmm …
I need a clever answer for this one …
People might hate me if I answer this poorly , lol .
YGosu :
Do you visit our site ?
If you did , you ’d know it ’s our policy to act first , and deal with the consequences later .
Zenio : Really ?
YGosu :
Are you really a YGosu user ?
Zenio : Yes .
I ’m always checking the site out .
I also had the # 1 popular post a while ago .
YGosu : Oh , then you ’re an Elite YGosu-er .
In the spirit of our website , spit some truth .
Zenio :
Well in that case , Terran is strong , but no one knows how to use them .
YGosu : Wow , a pretty strong statement there .
So you mean the players are n’t used to the new Terran yet ?
Or that all the Terran users are chobos ?
Zenio : I mean …
I think so far that a lot of Warcraft III players are playing Starcraft II .
They ’re trying too hard to play the game like Warcraft III .
How should I say this … they focus too much on microing units with special abilities , or trying to fight major battles with an army they ’ve saved up .
That ’s not Starcraft .
You have to make stuff quickly , burn through it quickly , and expand all the while .
The Warcraft III players like to play off one base and complete their unit combinations .
YGosu :
So you mean they are too passive , and too focused on battles ?
Zenio : I ’ve tried Terran a little bit , and it seems like going 1 barracks expand is good , just like Starcraft : Broodwar .
No one uses this build though .
I think resource oriented play is good .
YGosu :
Most people seem to think that it ’s very difficult to protect a fast expansion in Starcraft II , but you think Terran can pull it off ?
Zenio : Yes , of course .
If you scout them trying to attack you early , you can defend easily by building bunkers in time .
If you defend a rush , then obviously you ’re ahead .
I think Terran can be very strong if they expand followed with a well timed attack , like Starcraft : BW .
YGosu :
Ah , spoken like a true gosu , breaking the existing notions .
Zenio :
No , I ’m not rewriting the rules or anything .
Think about it .
In a game that ’s been played for over ten years , and researched to death , standard play is n’t standard for nothing .
There ’s a good reason .
Starcraft II might be a different game from Starcraft : Broodwar , but classic play still works in the end .
I ’m kind of disappointed that people are missing that .
YGosu :
Do you have a lot of experience at Starcraft : Broodwar as well ?
Zenio :
Yes , I practiced a lot in preparation for Starcraft II .
YGosu :
So that ’s what it was , you did seem unusually good .
How did you prepare exactly ?
Zenio :
It was about this time last year , so it ’s been an entire year now .
I heard around then that the Starcraft II beta was coming out , so I stopped playing Warcraft .
At the time , I was actually practicing to be a Warcraft progamer .
To be honest , it was really tough .
I suffered so much because the bar was already set so high .
But when I heard the Starcraft II beta was coming out , I thought about hard it had been for me so far , and I decided to make a clean cut from Warcraft and take a shot at Starcraft II .
And in order to prepare for that , I started to play Starcraft : Brood War from March of 2009 .
But I did n’t know how to play Starcraft .
I started in public games on the Battle . net Asia server .
Then I learned about the “ op 345 ” channel .
I practiced there for a while , and then my friend told me about ICCup .
So I switched to ICCup and played there .
I managed to get to A - in about three seasons .
YGosu :
That ’s incredible .
Starcraft is hard to get good at , even if you play it for two or three years .
But you managed to hit A - in only a year .
You must have practiced really hard .
Did you feel discouraged at any point ?
Zenio :
Yes , it was hard .
It ’s a totally different game from Warcraft III , so it would be strange if it was n’t hard .
It was n’t really the gaming that was hard on me , it was some other things .
YGosu :
What was the hardest part ?
Zenio : I did n’t have a good environment around me when I was playing Warcraft III .
I was going to school , and had some family problems .
My heart was n’t all into it either .
But now I ’m out of school , and I ’ve made up my mind .
Now I can focus on Starcraft II completely .
Also , since I ’ve tasted failure with Warcraft III , I would really hate to fail at Starcraft II .
I ’m the youngest kid in my family , and I do n’t want to disappoint them when all eyes are on me .
Think about it , the little kid in the family , wasting all of his time on video games , how that would break his parent ’s hearts .
I ’m so sorry to them , so terribly sorry .
I really want to succeed at Starcraft II so I can make my parents happy .
YGosu :
That ’s some resolve and determination there .
You ’ve persevered through that pain and practicing hard right now , I know you ’re going to succeed .
You ’ll become the pride of YGosu !
If you ’d just do some One Piece ( an anime ) cos-playing , you could try and become not only the president of YGosu , but even the Emperor … ( YGosu in - joke I do n’t understand ) .
Anyway onto the next question .
So what do you think about Starcraft II ?
Do you think it can succeed just like the original ?
Zenio :
Of course .
I watched Starcraft I on TV recently , and I just could n’t watch it …
And I really like Starcraft .
YGosu :
What do you think the strengths of Starcraft II are ?
Zenio :
First off , it ’s still in the beta phase , yet Battle .
net works really well so even new players can start playing with ease .
The ladder system is great , too .
From an observer ’s standpoint , the tempo of the game is quick so it ’s fun to watch .
YGosu :
Were you thinking about E - sports with that last bit ?
Zenio : Yes .
There ’s a real joy to watching the game .
YGosu :
On the other hand , what do you think the weaknesses are ?
In terms of balance , or gameplay .
Zenio :
The sound effects could be better .
I think Zerg has the biggest problem there , there ’s just no energy behind the unit sounds .
It barely sounds like they ’re responding when you click on them , and you ca n’t tell what unit is making what sound .
There are n’t units that sound desperate or growl at you aggressively , and the “ You require more minerals ” sound is kind of off - putting ( the Korean dub of the Zerg lady is said to be pretty bad ) .
So it ’s kind of annoying .
YGosu :
We ’ll try to send your feedback to Blizzard .
What about the maps then ?
Do you think anything is wrong with them right now ?
Like , racial imbalances , or differences in starting positions ?
Zenio :
You know Desert Oasis , right ?
The main and natural are so far apart , so you have to defend them separately , which makes it difficult to expand .
Even if you do succeed at expanding , it ’s really hard to defend it , so I think the map forces you to play off your main .
Naturally , you do n’t get to make many units …
It would be nice if they got rid of maps like that .
I – I ’m not saying that because I ’m a Zerg user !
YGosu : … Thank you for your insightful ( selfish ) opinions .
( The quip about selfishness is YGosu ’s , not mine )
You do n’t feel that there ’s any imbalance in starting positions ?
Zenio : Nope , have n’t felt that yet .
YGosu :
Then what do you think is overpowered so far ?
Like , something like “ Warp Gates are imba ! ” or like the mutalisks in ZvP like you mentioned before .
Zenio : Overpowered , hmmm …
YGosu : For example , Warp Gates or Mutalisks …
Zenio : Hmm..
Like I said before , I think mutalisks are overpowered .
Besides that , I do n’t think anything is really overpowered .
I think the balance is pretty good overall , with the exception of mutas in zvp .
YGosu : Sharp observation , I hope it will be patched soon T_T .
Are you streaming on Afreeca ?
Most other gosus stream their games there .
Zenio :
No , my computer is pretty bad T_T .
I ’m playing on lowest settings .
I ’d have to go to a PC Bang in order to broadcast .
But it ’s a pain to do that , and it takes a lot of money .
I ’d love to stream , but I ’m not in the situation to do so right now .
YGosu : Laziness is fearsome indeed .
The answer might be obvious , but would you like to be a pro-gamer once Starcraft II is released ?
Zenio : Yes , of course .
For that , I ’ve dropped everything else and gone all - in with Starcraft II .
YGosu :
That shows in the insane amount of games you ’ve played .
Not even a week , and 300 games …
Zenio : 40 a day is my goal .
No more , no less , just getting in 40 games a day is my goal so far .
YGosu :
We really hope you become a Starcraft II pro .
Personally then , which progamer are you excited about making the possible leap from Starcraft I to Starcraft II ?
Zenio : Hmm… Flash or Jaedong .
I guess that ’s a pretty common answer .
YGosu : Yeah … A bit boring .
Just say Yellow .
Zenio :
No no no no no .
YGosu : Kong Gga Ji ma T_T ( do n’t bash Yellow ) .
Zenio : Lol .
Well just personally , it ’s Rock .
I met him while I was playing Warcraft a long time ago .
Since he ’s dabbled in Warcraft III , I think maybe he ’ll be okay at Starcraft II because they have a similar interface ?
Though should I be saying this about Rock ?
He ’s still playing Starcraft …
YGosu : Perfectly OK .
The commander of the major leagues ( Stork .
Refers to Rock ’s nickname , commander of the minor leagues .
Go look up his record in Challenge league or Survivor tournament , he ’s incredible there ) plays World of Warcraft , you know .
Zenio : …. Really ?
YGosu : …. Who knows ?
We ’re not sure either .
Someone out there must know the truth anyway .
Well , in conclusion , a word to the YGosu - ers from a YGosu - er who will go on to become a Starcraft II pro !
Zenio :
YGosu is such a familiar site to me , so it ’s an honor to be interviewed like this .
I ’ll try hard so you guys can interview me later when I ’m a Starcraft II pro .
YGosu :
When you ’re a pro , please plug our site .
Something like “ I start my day by browsing YGosu . ”
Zenio : ROFL
YGosu :
Ok , now pick the next interviewee .
Who should we interview , amongst the many Starcraft II players ?
Zenio : Hmm , who should I pick ?
YGosu :
Do n’t worry about it , just act .
Like I said before .
You ’re a YGosuer ?
Act first , think later .
Zenio :
Then I pick Kim Dong Su , Garimtoss .
He ’s like the only Starcraft player who ’s high in the ladder , so I think it would be great if you interviewed him .
YGosu : …. Thanks for picking such a difficult guy to get a hold of .
Anyway , thanks for the interview !
We hope to see you again as a YGosu - er progamer !
Zenio :
Thanks guys !

How are you spanking this overflow of Protoss players ?
Zenio : Oh , Protoss is strong ?
YGosu :
If you look at the platinum rankings , about 70 % of the players are Protoss .
I counted myself yesterday , I played 14 PvPs during a 20 game stretch yesterday .
Zenio : Protoss does n’t have anything to stop mutalisks with .
I play thinking that if I can just survive the best I can with sunken colonies and zerglings , I ’ll win when I get to mutas .

Do you mean the 13 pool -> Expand ->
Corruptor +
Mutalisk build ?
Zenio : Yeah .
As you make mutas , you ’ll have some extra minerals , while you do n’t have enough gas .
I just throw all those extra minerals into drones , and once I ’ve secured my second base I can make 5 hatcheries and mass roaches in a macro game .
Kind of like ZvT in Starcraft : Brood War .
YGosu : I 've lost to it , and it 's a really scary build .
There 's no real counter for that as Protoss ?
Werra : Nope .
You make mutas , and make a hatchery at your main , two at your natural , and two at your third base , a queen at each of them and then win like that .
If you eventually take 4 gas bases , you just can't lose .
YGosu :
You can run five hatcheries , all of them with queens ?
Zenio : Yup .
YGosu : I ’d like to tell you that you ’re kinda awesome .
So you ’re saying that as of now , the Phoenix , which are supposed to counter mutalisks , ca n’t really do much against them ?
Zenio : Yeah , I think so , and that it will probably be patched .
There ’s no good way to stop mutas right now …
YGosu : I guess so .

You have to make stuff quickly , burn through it quickly , and expand all the while .
The Warcraft III players like to play off one base and complete their unit combinations .
YGosu :
So you mean they are too passive , and too focused on battles ?
Zenio : I ’ve tried Terran a little bit , and it seems like going 1 barracks expand is good , just like Starcraft : Broodwar .
No one uses this build though .
I think resource oriented play is good .
YGosu :
Most people seem to think that it ’s very difficult to protect a fast expansion in Starcraft II , but you think Terran can pull it off ?
Zenio :
Yes , of course .
If you scout them trying to attack you early , you can defend easily by building bunkers in time .
If you defend a rush , then obviously you ’re ahead .
I think Terran can be very strong if they expand followed with a well timed attack , like Starcraft : BW .
YGosu :
Ah , spoken like a true gosu , breaking the existing notions .
Zenio :
No , I ’m not rewriting the rules or anything .
Think about it .
In a game that ’s been played for over ten years , and researched to death , standard play is n’t standard for nothing .
There ’s a good reason .
Starcraft II might be a different game from Starcraft : Broodwar , but classic play still works in the end .
I ’m kind of disappointed that people are missing that .
YGosu :
Do you have a lot of experience at Starcraft : Broodwar as well ?
Zenio :
Yes , I practiced a lot in preparation for Starcraft II .
YGosu :
So that ’s what it was , you did seem unusually good .
How did you prepare exactly ?
Zenio :
It was about this time last year , so it ’s been an entire year now .
I heard around then that the Starcraft II beta was coming out , so I stopped playing Warcraft .
At the time , I was actually practicing to be a Warcraft progamer .
To be honest , it was really tough .
I suffered so much because the bar was already set so high .
But when I heard the Starcraft II beta was coming out , I thought about hard it had been for me so far , and I decided to make a clean cut from Warcraft and take a shot at Starcraft II .
And in order to prepare for that , I started to play Starcraft : Brood War from March of 2009 .
But I did n’t know how to play Starcraft .
I started in public games on the Battle . net Asia server .
Then I learned about the “ op 345 ” channel .
I practiced there for a while , and then my friend told me about ICCup .
So I switched to ICCup and played there .
I managed to get to A - in about three seasons .
YGosu :
That ’s incredible .
Starcraft is hard to get good at , even if you play it for two or three years .
But you managed to hit A - in only a year .
You must have practiced really hard .
Did you feel discouraged at any point ?
Zenio :
Yes , it was hard .
It ’s a totally different game from Warcraft III , so it would be strange if it was n’t hard .
It was n’t really the gaming that was hard on me , it was some other things .
YGosu :
What was the hardest part ?
Zenio : I did n’t have a good environment around me when I was playing Warcraft III .
I was going to school , and had some family problems .
My heart was n’t all into it either .
But now I ’m out of school , and I ’ve made up my mind .
Now I can focus on Starcraft II completely .
Also , since I ’ve tasted failure with Warcraft III , I would really hate to fail at Starcraft II .
I ’m the youngest kid in my family , and I do n’t want to disappoint them when all eyes are on me .
Think about it , the little kid in the family , wasting all of his time on video games , how that would break his parent ’s hearts .
I ’m so sorry to them , so terribly sorry .
I really want to succeed at Starcraft II so I can make my parents happy .
YGosu :
That ’s some resolve and determination there .
You ’ve persevered through that pain and practicing hard right now , I know you ’re going to succeed .
You ’ll become the pride of YGosu !
If you ’d just do some One Piece ( an anime ) cos-playing , you could try and become not only the president of YGosu , but even the Emperor … ( YGosu in - joke I do n’t understand ) .
Anyway onto the next question .
So what do you think about Starcraft II ?
Do you think it can succeed just like the original ?
Zenio :
Of course .
I watched Starcraft I on TV recently , and I just could n’t watch it …
And I really like Starcraft .
YGosu :
What do you think the strengths of Starcraft II are ?
Zenio :
First off , it ’s still in the beta phase , yet Battle .
net works really well so even new players can start playing with ease .
The ladder system is great , too .
From an observer ’s standpoint , the tempo of the game is quick so it ’s fun to watch .
YGosu :
Were you thinking about E - sports with that last bit ?
Zenio : Yes .
There ’s a real joy to watching the game .
YGosu :
On the other hand , what do you think the weaknesses are ?
In terms of balance , or gameplay .
Zenio :
The sound effects could be better .
I think Zerg has the biggest problem there , there ’s just no energy behind the unit sounds .
It barely sounds like they ’re responding when you click on them , and you ca n’t tell what unit is making what sound .
There are n’t units that sound desperate or growl at you aggressively , and the “ You require more minerals ” sound is kind of off - putting ( the Korean dub of the Zerg lady is said to be pretty bad ) .
So it ’s kind of annoying .
YGosu :
We ’ll try to send your feedback to Blizzard .
What about the maps then ?
Do you think anything is wrong with them right now ?
Like , racial imbalances , or differences in starting positions ?
Zenio :
You know Desert Oasis , right ?
The main and natural are so far apart , so you have to defend them separately , which makes it difficult to expand .
Even if you do succeed at expanding , it ’s really hard to defend it , so I think the map forces you to play off your main .
Naturally , you do n’t get to make many units …
It would be nice if they got rid of maps like that .
I – I ’m not saying that because I ’m a Zerg user !
YGosu : …
Thank you for your insightful ( selfish ) opinions .
( The quip about selfishness is YGosu ’s , not mine ) You do n’t feel that there ’s any imbalance in starting positions ?
Zenio : Nope , have n’t felt that yet .
YGosu :
Then what do you think is overpowered so far ?
Like , something like “ Warp Gates are imba ! ” or like the mutalisks in ZvP like you mentioned before .
Zenio : Overpowered , hmmm … YGosu : For example , Warp Gates or Mutalisks … Zenio : Hmm ..
Like I said before , I think mutalisks are overpowered .
Besides that , I do n’t think anything is really overpowered .
I think the balance is pretty good overall , with the exception of mutas in zvp .
YGosu : Sharp observation , I hope it will be patched soon T_T .
Are you streaming on Afreeca ?
Most other gosus stream their games there .
Zenio :
No , my computer is pretty bad T_T .
I ’m playing on lowest settings .
I ’d have to go to a PC Bang in order to broadcast .
But it ’s a pain to do that , and it takes a lot of money .
I ’d love to stream , but I ’m not in the situation to do so right now .
YGosu : Laziness is fearsome indeed .
The answer might be obvious , but would you like to be a pro-gamer once Starcraft II is released ?
Zenio :
Yes , of course .
For that , I ’ve dropped everything else and gone all - in with Starcraft II .
YGosu :
That shows in the insane amount of games you ’ve played .
Not even a week , and 300 games … Zenio : 40 a day is my goal .
No more , no less , just getting in 40 games a day is my goal so far .
YGosu :
We really hope you become a Starcraft II pro .
Personally then , which progamer are you excited about making the possible leap from Starcraft I to Starcraft II ?
Zenio : Hmm … Flash or Jaedong .
I guess that ’s a pretty common answer .
YGosu : Yeah … A bit boring .
Just say Yellow .
Zenio :
No no no no no .
YGosu : Kong Gga Ji ma T_T ( do n’t bash Yellow ) .
Zenio : Lol .
Well just personally , it ’s Rock .
I met him while I was playing Warcraft a long time ago .
Since he ’s dabbled in Warcraft III , I think maybe he ’ll be okay at Starcraft II because they have a similar interface ?
Though should I be saying this about Rock ?
He ’s still playing Starcraft … YGosu : Perfectly OK .
The commander of the major leagues ( Stork .
Refers to Rock ’s nickname , commander of the minor leagues .
Go look up his record in Challenge league or Survivor tournament , he ’s incredible there ) plays World of Warcraft , you know .
Zenio : …. Really ?
YGosu : …. Who knows ?
We ’re not sure either .
Someone out there must know the truth anyway .
Well , in conclusion , a word to the YGosu - ers from a YGosu - er who will go on to become a Starcraft II pro!Zenio :
YGosu is such a familiar site to me , so it ’s an honor to be interviewed like this .
I ’ll try hard so you guys can interview me later when I ’m a Starcraft II pro .
YGosu :
When you ’re a pro , please plug our site .
Something like “ I start my day by browsing YGosu . ” Zenio : ROFLYGosu :
Ok , now pick the next interviewee .
Who should we interview , amongst the many Starcraft II players ?
Zenio : Hmm , who should I pick ?
YGosu :
Do n’t worry about it , just act .
Like I said before .
You ’re a YGosuer ?
Act first , think later .
Zenio :
Then I pick Kim Dong Su , Garimtoss .
He ’s like the only Starcraft player who ’s high in the ladder , so I think it would be great if you interviewed him .
YGosu : …. Thanks for picking such a difficult guy to get a hold of .
Anyway , thanks for the interview !
We hope to see you again as a YGosu - er progamer !
Zenio :
Thanks guys !

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s main security and human rights watchdog said on Monday that Turkey was blocking some 3,700 Internet sites for “ arbitrary and political reasons ” and urged reforms to show its commitment to freedom of expression .
Young people spend time surfing the internet in a cafe in Trabzon January 24 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Umit Bektas
Milos Haraszti , media freedom monitor for the 56 - nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , said Turkey ’s Internet law was failing to preserve free expression in the country and should be changed or abolished .
“ In its current form , Law 5651 , commonly known as the Internet Law of Turkey , not only limits freedom of expression , but severely restricts citizens ’ right to access information , ” Haraszti said in a statement .
He said Turkey , a European Union candidate , was barring access to 3,700 Internet sites , including YouTube , GeoCities and some Google pages , because Ankara ’s Internet law was too broad and subject to political interests .
“ Even as some of the content that is deemed ‘ bad ’ , such as child pornography , must be sanctioned , the law is unfit to achieve this .
Instead , by blocking access to entire websites from Turkey , it paralyzes access to numerous modern file - sharing or social networks , ” Haraszti said .
“ Some of the official reasons to block the Internet are arbitrary and political , and therefore incompatible with OSCE ’s freedom of expression commitments , ” he said .
Asked about the OSCE remarks , a Turkish transport and communications ministry official who asked not to be named told Reuters : “ Turkey provides unlimited and equal access for all parts of society .
It is above the EU average on this issue .
“ The regulations over Internet have a dynamic structure and necessary legal changes are made when problems are detected in implementation , ” the official added .
Haraszti said Turkish law was still failing to safeguard freedom of expression , and numerous criminal code clauses were being used against journalists , who risked being sent to jail as a result .
Fears for press freedom in Turkey have risen following state attempts to collect a $ 3.3 billion fine from major media group Dogan in a tax row , part of pressure on Dogan to obey a law limiting foreign ownership of Turkish firms .
In October , the European Commission ’s annual report on Turkey ’s progress toward EU membership urged Turkey to treat Dogan fairly and said Ankara needed to do more to protect freedom of expression and the press .
Google is prepared to alter the digital landscape of its Maps and Street View services by selling billboard and storefront advertising to the highest bidder .
According to a new patent granted to Google ( courtesy ReadWriteWeb ) , the search engine and online advertising giant may commandeer the rights of old signs and billboards in Street View and sell it to those seeking an upgrade , or , perhaps , a new advertising space to hock wares .
Google uses the example of a theater updating its marquee to promote shows that are n't 18 months old ( assuming said theater is still in operation ) .
Once Google identifies the " interest points " of an image , it will then morph virtual reality with a hyperlink or totally replace a previous Street View snapshot with a new one .
The patent 's language is clear :
" The link can be associated with a property owner , for example the property owner which owns the physical property portrayed .
The link can alternatively be associated with an advertiser who placed the highest bid on the image recognized within the region of interest ( e.g. , poster , billboard , banner , etc. ) .
Any portion of the geographic display image in which the region of interest is located can be selectable ( e.g. , hot - linked ) .
For example , the image of the coffee shop can be hot - linked to an advertisement for the coffee shop . "
This could be very cool , very evil , or very strange .
The cool part is scoping out a scene , seeing a movie ad , clicking on said ad , and then watching the movie trailer all in one swoop .
The evil part is the patent 's potential to favor those with stuffed pockets and undermine smaller entities .
Picture the indie coffee shop mentioned in the patent .
Now picture Starbucks buying a 40 - foot banner above said coffee shop and driving it into obscurity .
The strange part has to do with the program 's limitations .
Imagine searching for a local steak joint and coming across an eccentric billionaire 's glorified Craigslist m4f posting on the side of a skyscraper .
The story is also not new .
In fact , this same scheme , in various forms , is discussed almost every year .
Ads came to Google Local Maps in March 2006 .
Google added AdSense to its maps in May 2007 .
And , on a related note , in March 2007 , Google purchased an in - game advertising firm to penetrate the videogame market -- an industry that expects to reach $ 1 billion by 2012 .
So Google has had its hands on our virtual space for quite some time , but never to this degree .
It will be interesting to watch money exchange hands and glitzy signs appear out of nowhere , assuming Google maintains its " Do No Evil " credo .

“ I am not a hero , ” insisted Miep Gies .
“ I was just an ordinary housewife and secretary . ”
It was Mrs. Geis ’s habit to deflect accolades for defying Nazi occupiers of Amsterdam by helping to hide Anne Frank , her family and three other doomed Jews in a secret annex to the business office of Anne ’s father , Otto Frank .
But to accept that self - description would be to overlook the remarkable selflessness and courage Mrs.
Gies demonstrated , an example so powerful that it continues to inspire nearly 70 years later .

Mrs. Gies , who died on Monday at age 100 , was a trusted employee of Otto Frank in 1942 .
His family went into hiding that year in unused rooms that were hidden behind a movable bookcase , seeking to avoid the fate of thousands of Dutch Jews being deported to concentration camps .
Asked by Mr. Frank to help hide them , and to bring them food and supplies , she readily agreed , even though it meant risking her life .
After spending some time with the JooJoo , the new name of the embattled Crunchpad , I 'm more a fan of the device 's potential , than the device itself .
After spending some hands - on time with the JooJoo , the new name of the , I would say that I 'm more a fan of the device 's potential , rather than what it actually is .
The JooJoo is n't a mystery ; boot one up , and within eight seconds you 're staring at a somewhat clunky interface on the 12.1 - inch touch screen , with large , bold shortcuts to a number of Web sites and Internet apps .
But time and again , whatever I wanted to do with the JooJoo was frustrated either by the interface , or the hardware , or the Wi-Fi connection at the San Francisco hotel where Chandra Rathakrishnan , Fusion Garage 's chief executive , demonstrated the $ 499 device .
The Web tablet remains a white whale of the technology industry ; Microsoft tried it , but the 's dependence on handwriting recognition banished it to the shadows of convertible tablets ( or into the ) .
So far , remains a fanboy 's fevered dream .
Keep in mind that , in the JooJoo 's case , " Web tablet " means " Web consumption tablet , " and aggressively so .
Mild content creation , such as the addition of a picture to a Twitter tweet , is n't possible with the JooJoo unless the photo in question is already somewhere on the Web , such as Flickr .
Rathakrishnan calls the JooJoo 's price an appropriate one for the Web tablet space it has pioneered .
I can accept his argument that a customer may want to pay $ 499 for a trail - breaking product .
But the next time that customer visits an electronics store and sees all the netbooks and ultraportables priced at $ 499 or below , will he regret it ?
Simple and straightforward
I found the JooJoo comfortably light for such a large tablet , with rounded , molded corners that seemed easy enough to grip and rest in your lap .
An included stand also holds the JooJoo at one of two angles , depending on how it 's oriented .
Unfortunately , the startup screen is also the source of one of the tablet 's great annoyances : the irritating choice of background colors .
Instead of a fixed white background , the JooJoo cycles through annoying shades of green , purple , and yellow each time the home page is accessed .
Fortunately , unchecking an option box eliminates these hideous backgrounds .
Fusion Garage has aligned a series of icons on the home page , virtually all of which simply access the corresponding Web page .
The first category is " Connect , " with icons for Flickr , Facebook , Gmail , Twitter , and Linked In , among others ; next is " Have Fun , " with YouTube , last . fm , MySpace , and AOL ; " Be Informed " adds The New York Times '
Web page as well as Google News and Yahoo .
The latter category slides over to the right , off the page , prompting the user to slide over to the new page by swiping a finger near the bottom of the page .
And that 's annoyance number two , in my book .
I confess that I 'm not a veteran swiper ; I use an Android or BlackBerry Curve smartphone , rather than the ubiquitous iPhone .
Still , swiping should be intuitive enough that it should work , and it does sometimes .
I could n't always quite figure out where to swipe to move the screen left and right .
The real problem , however , is that the pinch gestures navigate up and down the navigation tree .
Pinch out , as if expanding the window , and the JooJoo jumps back to the home screen ; pinch in , and a user can access a different app or Web page that is already running via a tab .
As I 'm used to some hardware control in my mobile browsing , the pinch gestures frustrated me , and the touch screen seemed to lack the necessary sensitivity at times .
An additional gesture input may solve the problem , Rathakrishnan agreed ; in my book , if Apple has already broken up the border of the iPhone with a dedicated " Home " key , then Fusion Garage has license to do the same .
One mild success is the software keyboard : click a text entry box , and a large , touch - enabled keyboard pops up .
Data entry is straightforward , and the device helpfully adds a " .com " key when entering a Web address , something I wish Google 's Android phones would do .
The JooJoo 's screen rotates from portrait to landscape mode and back again , and Web pages reconfigure as well , as you might expect .
In portrait mode , for example , scrolling up and down each Web page is a pleasant experience .
But I noted that the home page GUI does n't rotate , leaving a gaping white void at the bottom of the screen .
Annoyance number three was the lack of response when browsing the Web .
The 4GB SSD hosts the Linux based OS , underneath a Webkit - based browser , pretty standard for mobile devices today .
Granted , the JooJoo I tried was surfing the Web on a shared hotel Wi-Fi connection , which Rathakrishnan said had become progressively slower as the night wore on .
Fair enough .
But he also said that the device slows down in the presence of Web sites with a number of pictures , such as eBay .
That seems to indicate that the JooJoo will work best with simple , straightforward sites like Gmail , with its minimalist interface .
But the JooJoo is a media - consumption device , and I think users will want to seek out graphically complex sites to entertain themselves .
As far as I could tell , browsing the Web works fine if a user wants to hopscotch from link to link on a Web page .
But the Webkit browser eliminates the URL field when loading the page .
Trying to load a random site ( say , www.toyota.com) from a completely unrelated one ( www.ibm.com) means pinch - widening back to the home screen , then typing in the new Web address .
That 's a bit of a pain .
I did n't see any way to add additional icons or bookmarks to the home page , but I suspect that capability will be added to the final production model , if it 's not there already .
Interestingly , Flash - based sites , such as Hulu and YouTube worked well on the JooJoo , although I did n't try out any Flash - based game sites to truly test the platform .
( Rathakrishnan said that the JooJoo will run Flash apps , but not how . )
It 's also not clear how plug-ins will be handled , although Rathakrishnan said that the JooJoo can save cookies , to eliminate the need to perpetually re-enter login information .
I would n't be confident in opening up a banking site without a more intensive investigation of how the JooJoo handles secured Wi -Fi connections .
Fortunately , Rathakrishnan promised that the JooJoo will offer software - based updates that will be pushed to the user , so even minor annoyances and bugs could be fixed quickly .
Will they ?
That 's one of the bets a first - adopter makes with an untested company .
I 've left the hardware specs until last , as Fusion Garage seems to want to downplay them .
The JooJoo 's hardware is minimal ; on one side a small power button boots the device , next to a USB connector for a keyboard , mouse , or combination of the two .
The USB connection could be used to load media onto the JooJoo as well , although Rathakrishnan said that that capability is on a future feature list , and not currently available .
The limited RAM and storage means that large files can't be copied onto the on - board 4GB SSD .
A card - expansion slot , currently present , wo n't be featured on the final device .
The current iteration of the JooJoo features 802.11g Wi -Fi ; the shipping version will use 802.11n , Rathakrishnan said .
A configuration screen on the pre-production model also listed Bluetooth as an option .
He declined to specify what processor the JooJoo uses , perhaps correctly arguing that the user will be focused on the experience of the device , rather than its processor  an argument Apple has used with some success in its own portable devices .
Rathakrishnan described the current iteration of the JooJoo as a preproduction model , close , but not quite finalized .
If nothing else , the parade of eager journalists will provide some useful feedback ; my appointment was at 7PM , and Rathakrishnan was scheduled to end his night with a 10 PM appointment .
It 's almost impossible to discuss the JooJoo without referring to the histrionics that has surrounded its evolution , from an intriguing concept to a to suddenly a .
According to Rathakrishnan , Fusion Garage has partnered with a second Taiwan ODM who will be able to meet the demand for any and all pre-orders , he said .
Although Michael Arrington , the owner of TechCrunch , has , Rathakrishnan reiterated what he : that no suit has been filed against Fusion Garage ( which has incorporated in the United States ) , that the company owned all of the intellectual property surrounding the device , and that Arrington 's role was simply to market and promote the device , nothing more .
( Arrington has since decided to let his lawyers settle the matter . )
All that aside , I 'd like to believe that there 's a market for a Web tablet , especially with the growing number of Wi-Fi enabled airplanes .
But for now , I 'm not sure that the bugs and issues with the JooJoo justify its price .
If nothing else , however , the TechCrunch tussle has rekindled interest in the JooJoo , and allowing hands - on time with the device was a shrewd move .
While I do n't claim to be the expert that some of our other analysts are , I think I know a successful device when I see one .
This is n't it .
But with the feedback from some of the industry 's top analysts and bloggers , the JooJoo may morph into the device people expect .
Black paint was thrown at a Baptist Church in Malacca state
There have been more attacks on churches in Malaysia , in a growing dispute over the use of the word Allah by non-Muslims .
The police say petrol bombs were thrown at a church and a convent school in the state of Perak , and at a church in Sarawak on the island of Borneo .
Another church in the south of the country was daubed with black paint .
The attacks come days after four churches near the capital , Kuala Lumpur , were hit by petrol bombs .
Religious tensions in Malaysia have increased since a court ruled last month that a Roman Catholic newspaper could use the word Allah in its Malay - language edition to describe the Christian god .
The petrol bomb thrown at a guard house of a Catholic convent school in the town of Taiping , about 300 km ( 185 miles ) from Kuala Lumpur , did not explode .
Several broken bottles and paint thinners were found at the church next to the convent and one of the country 's oldest Anglican churches , All Saints , also in Taiping , Reuters news agency reported .
Arson attempts were made at two sites in Taiping Police and church officials said bricks and stones were thrown at glass windows of the Good Shepherd Catholic church in Miri , a logging and oil town in Sarawak state .
In southern Malacca state , the outer wall of the Malacca Baptist Church was splashed with black paint , police said .
Sarawak and neighbouring Sabah state are home to most of Malaysia 's Christians , who account for 9.1 % of the country 's 28 million people .
" The situation is under control and the people should not be worried , " Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein was quoted as saying by state news agency Bernama .
Correspondents say some of Malaysia 's majority Muslim community suspect Christians of wanting to use the word Allah to encourage Muslims to convert to Christianity .
The government has appealed against the ruling , in contrast to countries like Indonesia , Egypt and Syria where Christian minorities freely use the Arabic word to refer to God.
General secretary of the Council of Churches of Malaysia , Rev Hermen Shastri , said Christians would not be intimidated by the attacks .
" We all have to stand together to stamp out terror perpetuated by these extremist groups , " he said , according to Associated Press news agency .

SPAMMERS ’ own trickery has been used to develop an “ effectively perfect ” method for blocking the most common kind of spam , a team of computer scientists claims .
Most of the billions of spam messages sent each day originate in networks of compromised computers , called botnets .
Unbeknown to their owners , the machines quietly run malicious software in the background that pumps out spam .
Researchers have now come up with a system that deciphers the templates a botnet is using to create spam .
These templates are then used to teach spam filters what to look for . …
In Brian Wood 's DC / Vertigo comic series DMZ , Manhattan is a shattered hellhole at the epicenter of the Second American Civil War .
In reality , New York City is Wood 's home and muse .
Here are Wood 's favorite spots for dystopian inspiration .

DMZ follows Liberty News photographer Matty Roth , who enters Manhattan on assignment but later becomes embroiled in the battle for the island .
During his tour of the DMZ , Matty encounters Chinatown gangs , militias in Central Park , and in the most recent arc " Hearts and Minds , " a stray nuclear warhead .
With DMZ entering its milestone forth year of publication ( and DMZ 49 hitting the stands today ) , io9 asked Wood to identify those locations in New York that have had the most impact on his life and work :
" Between my comic book series DMZ , Channel Zero , and The Couriers , I 've been immortalizing New York City in print for nearly fifteen years now .
Picking just five favorite locations is tough , and I 've leaving out a lot ( Crosby Street , I 'm thinking of you , here ) but in the interest of brevity and focus , here we go :

5. ) Chinatown – I used to take lunch breaks when working at Rockstar Games to run down for fried rice from the now - closed Sweet N Tart café , bootleg Johnnie To DVDs at that spot on Pell Street , and a few minutes at the video game arcade that used to have the live chicken game .
NYC's Chinatown is huge , and you can go deeper where the tourists are n't , but for me what I loved was the Canal Street crossing , from one world to another in 30 feet .

4. ) While attending Parsons School of Design , I worked as a bike messenger in the mornings .
It was probably a lot more dangerous than other parts of the city , but the Garment District ( 34th St. -42nd St. , 5th Ave. - 9th Ave. ) just felt so New York to me in the sense of a dingy , gloomy , bustling , sorta old school sense .
I 'd run the streets like an obstacle course , zigzagging around cube trucks , racks of clothing , and some of the worst maintained stretches of street in the city .
For nostalgia 's sake , I 'll watch the video for Sonic Youth 's " Sugar Kane " for that early - 90's look at the neighborhood .

3. ) More than any other neighborhood , the East Village feels like home , which is kind of remarkable considering how radically it 's changed since I lived there during college .
It 's almost too much to take now , the people , the proliferation of restaurants and bars , and the charm of it is completely gone .
But my old block , 3rd Street between 2nd and 1st Avenues , is still very much the same , and my favorite park in Manhattan is still Tompkins Square .

2. ) Brooklyn .
Is that cheating , naming such a general location as that ?
Maybe , but Brooklyn is where I 've lived since 1999 and its where I 'll stay ( with one possible exception , see # 1 ) .
I 've lived in Bed -Stuy , Bushwick , Park Slope , and now Ditmas Park and identify with this borough more than any place I 've lived in my lifetime .
Why ?
It 's hard to say ... but I know every time I head into Manhattan , which is not so often these days , some disgusting steel - and - glass monstrosity is going up on an otherwise familiar corner , and each time the city feels less and less close to my heart .
Brooklyn , with its small town feel , is grounded and feels like it's a city of people , not a city of corporate identity and influence .
The people in Manhattan do n't seem especially proud to be Manhattanites , but people from Brooklyn ?
C'mon ...

1. ) Nothing is more New York to me than the stretch of the West Side Highway heading south from the George Washington Bridge to Columbia University .
I do n't get a chance to drive it very often , but when I do , at the risk of being overly dramatic , it 's awesome and majestic .
There 's massive pre-war buildings towering over the trees , the stonework retaining walls drop down to the river , you have the river itself and the view across it to Jersey .
It 's quiet , its peaceful , it 's beautiful and it's the first view of the city I had , arriving by bus in 1991 .
The feeling 's never left me . "

Our health care has been memorably compared , by Jonathan Rauch of The National Journal , to the airline system .
That made me wonder :
What if the news industry were like our unreformed health care system ... ?
First , enjoy this column !
We Americans have the greatest news care system in the world , and we in journalism are proud of the cutting - edge punditry that we provide .
Columnists in other countries simply scribble illegibly in notebooks , but here in the United States we administer CAT scans to interviewees , just to rule out the chance that our subject is dead .
Expensive , yes  but we Americans must never settle for second - best .
But wait !

As you probably know , the California - based company Apple makes a portable communication device — a device that an acquaintance of mine whose first language is not English distinguishes as a “ self ” phone .
Though proper nouns conventionally begin with a capital letter , Apple spells the device ’s trademark with an initial lowercase i , followed by an uppercase P .
Thus styled , the word has a hump in the middle .
I could print it here to show you , but I refuse to allow my prose to be so disfigured .
On account of the hump , midword capitals are sometimes called “ camel case . ”
Other terms include “ intercaps ” and “ incapping . ”
There is some precedent for the unsightliness .
Dictionaries list a variety of apple known as a McIntosh , for example , and the language has long tolerated such identities as Ian McEwan , Louis MacNeice and even Myles na gCopaleen .
In my considered opinion , the juxtaposition of majuscule and minuscule in a personal name may be safely indulged as a prerogative of the human being , with all his individual strangeness , but to extend the same license to the fruits , literal and figurative , of human labor is another matter .
Steep is the descent into orthographic antinomianism .
It ’s hard to say when the humps began to multiply , but in the 1950s , Bank of America dropped its “ of ” and crushed the remaining two words of its name together , as William Safire recollected in this column some decades later .
( The bank has since thought better of the experiment . )
In 1979 the credit card formerly known as Master Charge changed its last name and relinquished its interstice .
In the 1980s and ’90s , word spacing became seriously endangered , probably because , as the magazine New Scientist has noted , the most charismatic capitalists of those decades came from Silicon Valley , where software languages often required them to omit word spaces .
To save their eyesight , programmers injected capitals into their compounds , and as they ascended to cultural hegemony , “ Word ” was sealed to “ Perfect , ” “ Quick ” soldered to “ Time ” and “ Power ” married to “ Point . ”
Camel case even infiltrated literature .
“ Deviance or innovation ? ” Ron Silliman asked in his 1996 poem “ Under , ” before imagining himself living the erotic life of the insertive capital : “ How sweetly , smoothly I slip inside of you where I belong . ”
Copy editors , meanwhile , were overwhelmed .
At first , sentries at The New York Times allowed interior capitals only when the second element of a compound was a proper noun — when the word crammed next to “ Bank ” was “ America , ” for example .
But in November 1999 , the newspaper capitulated ( as it were ) .
Thereafter every brand name was permitted up to three idiosyncratic majuscules .
Three !
And why not let the dog sleep on the sofa ?
“ Traditionalists , ” admitted the magazine Copyediting in January 2008 , “ have lost the battle . ”
Most authorities now instruct writers to capitalize whatever the corporations tell them to .
Writers of the world , fight back !
Science in Canada cannot realize its full potential without clear direction from government .
Canada is in many ways a powerhouse of academic science : its university researchers are prolific publishers and strong contributors to the national research and development enterprise .
Yet Canadian government policy does far too little to support and utilize this strength .
“ The government should designate a single person to be held accountable for science . ”
As described on page 159 of this issue , for example , the lack of a polar policy means that Canadian scientists working in the Arctic often find themselves with government grants to do research , but no funds for the helicopters and sea-planes needed to get people and gear to field sites .
Scientists ' calls for more coordinated funding through a national polar policy have been falling on deaf ears for decades , in governments dominated by both centre - left liberals and right - wing conservatives .
A similar lack of action has greeted Canadian scientists ' calls for a decision on replacing the ageing nuclear reactor at Chalk River in Ontario , which is not only their primary site for nuclear research , but is also relied on for much of the world 's supplies of medical isotopes .
The most recent national budget distributed a reduced portion of money in ways that dismayed the science community — not least because it provided no funds for Genome Canada , an internationally competitive genomics and proteomics programme .
More generally , Canada has no group comparable to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the United States for focusing attention on science policy .
Lobbying of the government bodies that have power over science is fragmented .
And Canada has nothing comparable to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , which is headed by a science adviser who reports directly to the US president .
Canada did have a science adviser to the prime minister during 2004 – 08 , but he was largely sidelined before the position was terminated .
( There is currently only a ' minister of state ' for science and technology , a junior post that lies within the industry ministry . )
The council that replaced the science adviser is entirely reactive to government queries , and produces reports that traditionally are not made public .
One reason for this apparent neglect of science may be that Canada is so big and its population so small .
Bodies that help to inform the government about science , such as the Council of Canadian Academies , have neither the membership of their US equivalents nor the historical clout of those in Britain .
Another reason may be that so much of Canada 's wealth comes from natural resources , including timber and the oil sands , rather than from technical innovation .
Perhaps this leads the government to see scientists as just another interest group , rather than as crucial contributors to the economy .
Whatever the reasons , Canada is failing to make the most of a key national resource .
Everyone involved needs to take responsibility .
The government should designate a single person to be held accountable for science — either a chief adviser or a fully fledged minister with sufficient power and initiative to set a strong national agenda .
Researchers , meanwhile , should find more effective ways of working together and making their voices heard , including becoming part of the political system themselves .
There are some hopeful signs .
The very first Canadian Science Policy Conference was held in October 2009 , attracting hundreds of participants .
Its organizer , Mehrdad Hariri , a postdoctoral fellow at Toronto 's McLaughlin - Rotman Centre for Global Health , hopes to build on that interest to create a formal network and centre for science policy .
Meanwhile , the Ottawa - based Partnership Group for Science and Engineering , a body of some 50,000 individuals from industry , government and academia , has advocated the creation of ' science pages ' , a programme that would distribute timely , independent and open information on crucial science issues , and provide internships for Canadian scientists to obtain experience in the world of politics .
Such ideas are well worth pursuing .
But so far they are only proposals , without funding .
Some critics say Canada has no science policy at all .
Others say it has unwritten laws that seem to let it muddle along .
But muddling along is n't good enough in today 's tough economic climate .
Canada needs a bigger vision of where its science is going : a vision informed by organized scientists , and voiced by a strong position in government .

Millimeter - scale , energy - harvesting sensor system developed
Press Release From : University of Michigan
Posted : Wednesday , February 10 , 2010

The U - M system 's processor , solar cells , and battery are all contained in its tiny frame , which measures 2.5 by 3.5 by 1 millimeters .
It is 1,000 times smaller than comparable commercial counterparts .
ANN ARBOR , Mich .-- A 9-cubic millimeter solar - powered sensor system developed at the University of Michigan is the smallest that can harvest energy from its surroundings to operate nearly perpetually .
The system could enable new biomedical implants as well as home - , building - and bridge - monitoring devices .
It could vastly improve the efficiency and cost of current environmental sensor networks designed to detect movement or track air and water quality .
With an industry - standard ARM Cortex - M3 processor , the system contains the lowest - powered commercial - class microcontroller .
It uses about 2,000 times less power in sleep mode than its most energy - efficient counterpart on the market today .
The engineers say successful use of an ARM processor -- the industry 's most popular 32 - bit processor architecture -- is an important step toward commercial adoption of this technology .
Greg Chen , a computer science and engineering doctoral student , will present the research Feb. 9 at the International Solid - State Circuits Conference in San Francisco .
" Our system can run nearly perpetually if periodically exposed to reasonable lighting conditions , even indoors , " said David Blaauw , an electrical and computer engineering professor .
" Its only limiting factor is battery wear - out , but the battery would last many years . "
" The ARM Cortex - M3 processor has been widely adopted throughout the microcontroller industry for its low - power , energy efficient features such as deep sleep mode and Wake - Up Interrupt Controller , which enables the core to be placed in ultra- low leakage mode , returning to fully active mode almost instantaneously , " said Eric Schorn , vice president , marketing , processor division , ARM .
" This implementation of the processor exploits all of those features to the maximum to achieve an ultra - low - power operation . "
The sensor spends most of its time in sleep mode , waking briefly every few minutes to take measurements .
Its total average power consumption is less than 1 nanowatt .
A nanowatt is one - billionth of a watt .
The developers say the key innovation is their method for managing power .
The processor only needs about half of a volt to operate , but its low - voltage , thin - film Cymbet battery puts out close to 4 volts .
The voltage , which is essentially the pressure of the electric current , must be reduced for the system to function most efficiently .
" If we used traditional methods , the voltage conversion process would have consumed many times more power than the processor itself uses , " said Dennis Sylvester , an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering .
One way the U - M engineers made the voltage conversion more efficient is by slowing the power management unit 's clock when the processor 's load is light .
" We skip beats if we determine the voltage is sufficiently stable , " Sylvester said .
The designers are working with doctors on potential medical applications .
The system could enable less - invasive ways to monitor pressure changes in the eyes , brain , and in tumors in patients with glaucoma , head trauma , or cancer .
In the body , the sensor could conceivably harvest energy from movement or heat , rather than light , the engineers say .
The inventors are working to commercialize the technology through a company led by Scott Hanson , a research fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
The paper is entitled " Millimeter - Scale Nearly Perpetual Sensor System with Stacked Battery and Solar Cells . "
This research is funded by the National Science Foundation , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the National Institute of Standards and Technology , the Focus Center Research Program and ARM .

Britain has got the shopping habit back : we may only now be clambering out of the worst recession in living memory , but John Lewis has scored its best Christmas ever , Next clocked up a healthy festive season , and Boxing Day kicked off with jostling queues of bargain - hunters outside shopping centres determined not to miss a moment of the sales .
For long - suffering retailers , and the gleeful shoppers themselves , that feels like good news , but should we welcome the return of the spendthrift habits that plunged us into crisis in the first place , or is it time to ask if traditional metrics of economic success – retail sales , house prices , even GDP growth – really point us in the right direction ?
As far as the politicians are concerned , the obsession with economic growth continues unabated .
Gordon Brown used to take great glee in reminding parliament at each budget how many quarters of consistent expansion had been achieved under his chancellorship .
Now , with that record cruelly shattered , Labour hopes that 26 January and 23 April ( assuming the election is held in May ) will be key in producing a feelgood – or at least , feel - less - bad – factor , as voters prepare to go to the polls .
These are the dates when GDP figures will be reported for the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010 respectively , and which are both likely to show positive growth after six consecutive quarters of contraction .
But with unemployment still rising , taxes going up and personal debt still high , the public may decide they do not feel any better just because of a couple of abstract numbers that do n't correspond to their own experiences .
And Britain is far from the only country to have discovered in the past two years that a record of rapid GDP growth does not guarantee long - term prosperity , let alone fairness or environmental sustainability .
Indeed , with the issue of climate change becoming ever more urgent and a growing recognition that economic growth does not make people any happier , there are growing calls for growth and the endless consumption of ever more material goods to be downgraded as political goals .
The pursuit of growth and endless rises in consumption every year have become part of the national psyche , since Harold Macmillan told the electorate they had " never had it so good " .
The idea that more , bigger and cheaper is better is a powerful one , and it will be hard to dislodge .
It affects the way we think , the things politicians aim for and how journalists report events .
Rises in economic output , a company 's sales or house prices are invariably considered good , rises in petrol prices bad .
But debate is growing .
Just as he sparked a furore last year about whether the activities of the City were good for society , Financial Services Authority chief Adair Turner last week questioned whether economic growth was a " false god " .
He said that not only did growth harm the climate by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases , but " all the evidence shows that beyond the sort of standard of living which Britain has now achieved , extra growth does not automatically translate into human welfare and happiness " .
This is an area some economists have tried to deal with for several decades , by attempting to subtract from GDP figures the social or environmental consequences of growth .
Cleaning up an oil spill counts towards GDP , but the environmental damage it causes does not ; pumping the oil out of the ground counts as economic activity , but the resource depletion it implies is not accounted for .
For years , the economists trying to come up with alternative measures of welfare or sustainability were treated by the mainstream of the dismal science as tree - huggers who were trying to value things that were impossible to count , and therefore best ignored .
This was partly because economics was going through an intensely mathematical phase , in which the goal was to prove everything with models and fancy equations .
But the limitations of conventional economics were brutally exposed by the recession – and critics say the time has finally come for a long - overdue paradigm shift .
One of the oldest advocates of an alternative approach is Herman Daly , an American ecological economist who decades ago developed a measure called the " index of sustainable economic welfare " and the idea of a " steady state economy " , which argues that the world has to develop a way to live within its means and the limitations of its resources .
Another is Chilean economist Manfred Max - Neef , who works on development and poverty issues , and argues that conventional models of development increase poverty and ecological disaster .
Professor David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College , New Hampshire – better known in Britain for being the only member of the Bank of England 's monetary policy committee to see the recession coming – has spent decades working on measures of happiness and wellbeing which , he says , offer politicians much more useful ways to think about what policy they should aim for , rather than merely expanding GDP .
Blanchflower rejects the idea that happiness is difficult to measure .
Not only are there huge amounts of survey data over decades asking people about how they feel , he says , but cross-checks with other disciplines such as psychology or medicine and their data on metrics such as blood pressure work very well .
And the fundamental truth the data reveal is that , despite decades of economic growth in the western world , people have not got happier .
Sensing that GDP measures might have outlived their usefulness , last September French president Nicolas Sarkozy commissioned a report by a panel of experts headed by Nobel prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz , to look at how to ensure governments take full account of their citizens ' happiness and wellbeing , not just the country 's economic growth .
In Britain the torch is being carried by the New Economics Foundation which , among other things , produces what it calls the " Happy Planet Index " .
Nef 's policy director , Andrew Simms , says this brings together both the wellbeing and environmental aspects of human activity as well as the growth to measure whether economies achieve sustainable , happy lives for their citizens , rather than simply growing strongly .
Under the HPI , Costa Rica is the world 's happiest , greenest country .
Many other Latin American countries feature high up in the table but Britain and the United States are down at 74th and 114th respectively .
The HPI shows , for example , that fast - growing economies such as the US , China and India were all greener and happier 20 years ago than they are today .
" Growth has failed on its own terms .
You can't have infinite growth in a world of finite resources .
Redistribution of the existing wealth is a far better way to go , " says Simms .
" It is now a case of paradigm shift or bust . "
Nef recently published a report outlining how this can be achieved called " The Great Transition " and will this month release a new report entitled " Growth is n't possible " .
The simple measure of GDP may soon have had its day .

Has anyone ever heard of Mini Days ?
It ’s a productivity system that streamlines your physical movements for optimum production , with no burn out .
The best example of the concept is Henry Ford ’s assembly line , where instead of having one person put the tires on , and then they go and work on the engine , and then go and tighten the bolts , and so on , each person is specified one specific physical movement at a time .
They might put only tires on many different cars for a period of 4 hours , and then might move to tightening bolts for a couple of hours , but they are not wasting time walking around , getting the tools they need for one job , and then going and doing the same thing with other jobs that need to be done , and wasting more time .
Each action is streamlined .
This is how Henry Ford turned the process of producing cars from a hundreds - a - day process to a thousands - a - day process , which we now call mass - production .
It can be the same for your phone calls , word processing , school work ect .
Define your tasks by the actual physical movements you make .
Select a set amount of time each day dedicated to that task .
Set up a time schedule for when you will perform each task each day .
An example might be Phone Calls , Operations ( could be anything ) , Meetings , in my case updating my website , ect .
Work only for that set amount of time on each task , and even if you do n’t finish what you start , move on to the next task when the time is up .
This way you are chipping away at many things each day , without getting worn out by any of them .
By the end of a week , you may have your whole list completely done , with no unneeded stress or seemingly hard effort .
These little spurts of productivity are called Mini Days because once your done with one , it ’s almost like starting a brand new day doing something completely different .
It can work wonders !
Remember it ’s all about streamlining your physical movements so you do n’t waste time for example typing something , then remembering you have to call someone , and then going back to typing .
Block everything into time slots so you can use your time as efficiently as possible .
Just thought I ’d share because no one seems to have ever heard of it and everyone I tell uses it and loves it .
I learned this trick in a pretty amazing book I ’ve read called Neo Tech , which means New Think .
I ’d definitely recommend looking into it .

The Bill Gates name is n't new to Twitter , but the real him has only just signed up and made his first tweets
Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has just joined Twitter with a verified account , having been preceded by numerous fakes .
Just to confirm it , he used the programmer 's standard : " Hello World " .
Gates tweeted that he was working on his letter for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , and tweeted Ryan Seacrest to say " thanks for your work on this , it will have a real impact for the people in Haiti who need it most . "
In about four hours , Gates picked up more than 25,000 followers and was added to more than a thousand lists , including one of mine , and now it 's something like 1,000 per minute .
A colleague commented : " he 's pulling people in at an astonishing rate .
It 's like watching a black hole in action . "
Whether he 'll outdo Oprah or Britney remains to be seen , but it seems unlikely .
Gates is following 40 accounts including Microsoft , GatesFoundation , Bing , The Economist , The Huffington Post , Queen Rania , CERN , eBay - founder Pierre Omidyar , several TED accounts and Ashley Tisdale ( 2.6 million followers ) .
No doubt Bill will thrill to Ashley tweets such as " Gettin my nails done with nessa !!!! " and " went grocery shopping and now cleaning the house !!!! " .

A lack of equipment has affected the performance of the air force India 's plans to improve its defence capabilities have suffered a setback because three highly publicised military deals have been delayed by years .
Among the big defence acquisitions which are at stake , two are for the navy and one for the air force .
The plan that has suffered the most is the navy 's ambition to secure India 's 7,500 km ( 4,660 miles ) coastline and police international waters in the face of a rising terrorist threat .
The plan to buy an old Russian aircraft carrier and get it refitted to serve the navy for another 30 years continues to defy every new deadline announced for its induction .
French Scorpene submarines , proposed to be built in India , are nowhere near fruition either .
Air force pilots training to operate supersonic jets were overjoyed when in 2004 decades of political inaction were transformed into an order to buy 66 jet trainer aircraft from British Aerospace ( BAE ) .
The Hawk Jet trainers were ordered to help budding pilots improve their skills before moving to a supersonic fighter jet .
Delayed
In the absence of a trainer aircraft that would help young pilots to graduate from subsonic to supersonic speed , several air force MiG fighters crashed , taking with them budding pilots .
Now all three high profile purchases have been delayed .
From rising costs of the aircraft - carrier Gorshkov to corruption charges delaying the induction of Scorpene submarines to closure of British Aerospace factories - India 's military plans have become hostage to delays .
MiG crashes have killed many trainee pilots " But the navy has learnt to manage with present resources , " says defence expert Ranjit Rai .
The story of India 's planned acquisition of a second aircraft carrier gets more curious by the day .
INS Viraat , the renamed British carrier Hermes , started showing signs of ageing some years ago and the need to procure a second one was felt .
India is building an indigenous aircraft carrier but it will take several years before it is complete .
So India 's old and dependable military supplier , Russia , came to its aid .
In turn , India rescued Sevmesh shipyard in northern Russia from closure by agreeing to buy Gorshkov and get it refitted - a deal which was hastily agreed in two days .
In this hurry , fine points including the ones relating to what was expected of Russia were overlooked .
The then naval chief Admiral Arun Prakash was made to believe that it was a " fixed price contract " .
Undue haste
But over five years the cost of the deal has risen from $ 974 m to $ 2.2 bn .
And it is still rising .
The haste with which the aircraft deal was signed continues to surprise many .
India agreed to buy and get a ship refurbished without Gorshkov 's design .
" It 's like buying a house without its layout design , " Mr Rai said .
It will be years before Scorpene will sail in India
When the ship was ripped open , it was found that the wiring was ageing and needed to be redone .
A Japanese contractor awarded the rewiring contract found the job overwhelming - given the costs involved - and left .
Now a new contractor has been found for the purpose .
Gorshkov 's steel plates and machinery , too , needed to be pulled apart and new ones fitted .
The combined total of the work required to refurbish and refit an ageing carrier has contributed to the rising costs .
India remains unhappy with the deal but has little elbow room given the importance of Russia for its military supplies .
With Gorshkov 's induction delayed , the government decided to refit its only aircraft carrier , INS Viraat , but it will not be operational till 2015 .
That leaves the Indian navy with no aircraft carrier for some time .
At the same time , the navy 's attempt to spruce up its submarine strength has not made much headway .
Sleepless nights India has 16 diesel - powered subs , but only nine are actually operational .
The nuclear powered submarine Scorpene that India is building with Russian help will also take a few years to sail .
Last month , Indian Defence Minister AK
Antony was forced to admit in parliament that plans to increase the number of submarines would be impacted .
Surya Kiran is a basic training aircraft Under a 2005 agreement , India was to build six Scorpenes for $ 3.9bn under license from France .
But there is no sign that the first Scorpene will get delivered in 2012 as agreed .
Another acquisition that has caused sleepless nights for the air force is the Hawk Jet Trainer deal with British Aerospace ( BAE ) .
For decades , senior air force officers had asked for a mid-trainer aircraft for fighter pilots to train on before they started flying supersonic jets .
In the past few years , many young pilots died as they transited from a basic Surya Kiran trainer aircraft to supersonic MiG - 21s .
Some could not manage to manoeuvre a MiG - 21 at supersonic speeds given the different judgement skills that were needed .
A much - hyped deal with BAE was signed five years ago under which 66 aircraft were to be supplied - 24 to be bought off the shelf and 42 to be manufactured in Bangalore by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ( HAL ) .
But now this deal is under threat after BAE closed down two of its factories .
" This has seriously impacted the operational preparedness , " says former commander - in - chief of Air Force Training Command Air Marshal JS Rai .
Officials say the government is now looking at other aircraft manufacturers to fill the gap .
The delay and cost overruns of these three major defence acquisitions have also seen the national audit watchdog criticise the government .
For its part , the government has been slow in responding to criticism - even from its auditing organisation .
When it comes to defence issues in India , speed does not seem to be of paramount importance .

Day after day , day after day ,
We stuck , nor breath nor motion ;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean .
-- The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , Samuel Taylor Coleridge
When we think about liberal and conservative , we tend to think of them in terms of political positions -- reproductive rights , labor 's ability to organize , the structure of taxes rates .
These days it 's hard to find politicians who will claim the liberal mantle even if their stand on these positions falls squarely in the progressive camp , but there have been times when many politicians -- and even political parties -- have squabbled over which of them was the true representative of liberalism .
Liberalism grew as a response to the changes in society brought on by the industrial revolution and the rise of industrial corporations .
Workers were no longer apprentices working directly with the people whose position they expected to hold some day .
Instead they were separated from the owners of these new industries by many levels , and often their work gave them no experience useful for moving up in this structure .
Liberalism formed around efforts to mend this new rift in society by using government as an instrument of egalitarianism .
Conservatism holds the opposite end of the field .
From its foundations in 18th century Europe through the violent sex fantasies of Ayn Rand , the position of conservatism has been the same : stop liberalism .
Rather than attempt to smooth out the inequities of society , conservatism seeks to maintain these chasms , and where possible to open them wider .
The whole basis of conservatism is that this structure -- a wealthy elite holding the reins -- is the natural , desirable state .
And that 's why conservatism always holds the advantage .
Always .
The framers of the Constitution may have fretted that they had given the poor the means of using government to topple the economic structure .
But with rare exceptions , conservatives have pressed their advantages , turning law and regulations into a system that locks down their gains .
The point of conservatism is the protection of privilege , the exacerbation of differences between the haves and have nots -- the preservation of power for those already in power .
Liberals are always on the outs , almost be definition .
Just as an example of the edge held by conservatism , the Sierra Club has an annual budget in the neighborhood of $ 100 million in 2008 ( we can argue about whether the Sierra Club is actually liberal , but I do n't think any would argue that 's a pretty good neighborhood ) .
As the largest and oldest environmental organization in the country , the Club carries a , um , big stick .
On the other hand , Exxon Mobil made that much by the end of the first week in January -- that much in straight profit , not revenue .
Which one do you think is more capable of spreading it 's message to the public ?
More capable of using the media to its advantage ?
You can get millions of people in this country to join into a chant of " drill , baby , drill " because they 've become convinced that more oil drilling in America will be beneficial -- even though the US passed peak production in 1972 and there is no doubt domestic production will continue to fall even if every inch of nation parks and wildlife reserves were opened for oil .
The only difference that additional drilling will make is addition billions to those who hold the power , but they 've successfully pushed the idea that this is a national benefit , not a money grab by an already wealthy few .
Why do many people still have doubts about something as straightforward as climate change ?
Because tens of millions are spent each year to see that they stay confused -- more by far than is spent trying to get across the truth .
Do n't think for a moment that corporations worry about the possibility that liberals might be right about addressing issues .
Maybe there will be millions of green jobs in energy .
Maybe in a decade it 'll make someone a fortune .
So what ?
The leaders of conservatism are already rich , and investing a little to make sure they can keep doing what they 're already doing seems to them a much more reasonable investment than sinking money into something that may pay off at some indefinite in the future .
Not only do they fully understand that a million now is better than a million later , they know the words of the great sage : " Always in motion is the future . "
They 're not taking any chances .
Conservatism is like an anchor .
It does n't propel either society or the economy .
It 's whole reason for being is to slow change of all sorts and keep the current situation in place for as long as possible for those who benefit most from the current system .
It 's not " I 've got mine , and you can do the same " it 's " I 've got mine , and hands off while I get some more . "
With the Supreme Court poised to make corporations not just super citizens , but unmatchable forces when it comes to campaign spending , politicians will find it more attractive than ever to hew the conservative line .
And it 's not as if conservatives are siting still .
Sure , Republicans in Congress have opted over the last year to plant a stake in the ground and try to hold things as fixed as the pitiful ship in Coleridge 's poem .
But conservatives are never shy when the have their turn .
They do n't care about actual deregulation .
They just want more regulation that 's designed to anchor the current system in place .
So ... conservatives represent the money and power .
That 's obvious .
One might even say ... duh .
But what does that leave for liberals .
Hope , that 's what .
Was there ever a word so disdained , so scoffed at , so utterly dismissed as " hope " ?
It 's a word no pundit can say without at least a hint of a sneer and a knowing roll of the eyes .
It 's a word that even its greatest proponents can feel embarrassed to trot out .
In a room full of security and patriotism , a room of righteous anger and bottom line numbers , hope can seem like a kid looking up from among the legs of adults .
But that 's all we have to sell -- hope that we can heal the inequities of society , hope that we can address the problems facing the resources on which we all depend , hope that we can step a little closer to that egalitarian ideal .
That 's how uneven the sides are in this struggle .
It 's pretty much everyone already in a position of power and privilege vs hope .
When you think about it , it 's a wonder we ever win .
For liberalism to exist at all requires a abundance of hope .
Lately the most extreme conservatives -- the shock troops of guarding the elite 's advantage -- have talked about " a second American revolution , " one that may even include violence .
They 're fond of quoting Jefferson 's appeal for regular overthrow of the existing order .
Of course , Jefferson did n't make that call when he was in office himself .
He made it before he was ever elected , before it was at all sure that the United States would be anything but the seating of New World aristocracy .
Jefferson worried that the control of power would not turn over often enough .
He did n't know at the time that we would hold a revolution every four years , and an uprising every two .
A mother accidentally smothered her four - week - old daughter to death after falling asleep while breastfeeding on a flight between the US and Kuwait , an airline says .
The 29 - year - old woman was taking her baby from Washington to meet extended family in Kuwait when the tragedy occurred on November 24 , London 's Daily Mail reports .
The woman appears to have fallen asleep while breastfeeding her daughter and woke to find her not breathing .
Crew members on the United Airlines flight were alerted to the situation by the woman 's screams .
The plane was diverted to London while a doctor on board the plane tried without success to revive the little girl .
SPRINGFIELD – No clothes , no minimum wage and no overtime either .
A group of exotic dancers has filed an unfair wages lawsuit in Hampden Superior Court against officers of five area strip clubs , arguing owners paid them no salaries , expected $ 40 to $ 100 kickbacks per shift and otherwise denied them standard worker benefits .

CHELSEA SUIT :
A trio of dancers , two disc jockeys and two bartenders recently brought a class - action lawsuit against " Mardi Gras Entertainment Inc. " and three corporate officers , according to the complaint : James Santaniello and wife Helen Santaniello , both of Longmeadow , and Anthony Santaniello , of Springfield .
Though that corporate name has since changed to The Worthington Shops , the lawsuit states it is the parent company for five clubs : the Mardi Gras , Lace , Fifth Alarm and Center Stage , all in Springfield , and Anthony 's Dance Club in South Hadley .
The class - action complaint follows similar lawsuits across the state challenging strip club compensation – which seems a system unto itself – under Massachusetts labor laws .
Three plaintiffs in the local lawsuit , Madeline Ruiz , of Bristol , Conn. , Paula Massa , of Springfield , and Andrea Walshaw , of Tampa , Fla. , argue they were full - time employees who were classified as independent contractors so owners could dodge worker benefits such as overtime pay and wages .
Tod A. Cochran , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said dancers were expected to pay between $ 40 and $ 100 per shift to the owners .
He estimates hundreds of dancers perform at all five clubs .
" That 's not legal under any circumstances , " said plaintiffs ' lawyer Tod A. Cochran .
" They called it a tip - out fee and it was higher for the better shifts .
Cochran also said the " independent contractor " label given to most employees at the clubs fails under fair labor practices law , and particularly so with the dancers .
The definition of an employee under state law says that an employer cannot exert control over a non-employee , according to Cochran , and that an independent contractor cannot work at the core of an employer 's enterprise .
However , the dancers said working for the Santaniellos was much more of a grind .
Cochran said " the girls " at the five area clubs had to agree not to perform anywhere else , had to conform to owners ' standards of wardrobe and music and follow other rules – all of which discount them from the contractor category .
A lawyer for the corporation would not comment on the details of the lawsuit .
" The company vigorously denies both the factual allegations and the legal claims and will respond in court in due course , " attorney Barry Miller , of Boston , said .
As an aside , businessman James Santaniello has always denied ownership of those bars and others , with his name conspicuously absent from corporate records .
He did not return a call for comment on Tuesday .
Disc jockeys Robert Bruso , of Springfield , and Robert Glavin , of Worcester also say in the complaint that they were denied wages .
Cochran said club owners tired of paying their salaries and passed the expense along to the dancers , who began paying " tip-outs . "
" Then the club decided it was too generous , so the club then decided they should give the DJ tip out to the club , and the owners would give them some of that money , not all of it , " Cochran said .
" When they complained the club fired them . "
Bruso began working at the Mardi Gras in 1995 , and said he was fired last year .
" The more money that was coming in , Jimmy realized the more money he could take , so he started charging us for everything , " Bruso said .
" It went from , like , a perfect state of capitalism – mutual trade for mutual profit – to a form of thievery . "
A lawyer for James Santaniello previously described Bruso as a disgruntled ex-employee with an ax to grind .
Former bartenders , Maureen Rushby , of West Springfield and Jessica Taylor , of South Hadley were paid minimum wage but also were charged a $ 25 " house fee " per shift – which could push their pay below the minimum depending on the shift .
Cochran concedes similar practices go on at most strip clubs , but he believes adult entertainment workers are starting to wake up to employment rights .
Plaintiffs prevailed in a similar class - action suit against King Arthur 's Lounge in Chelsea , and at least one other lawsuit is pending against a club in Salisbury .
Kel - Tech have developed a new pistol which chambers the .22 Magnum ( WMR ) rimfire cartridge .
The small size of the .22 WMR has allowed Kel - Tec to squeeze 30 rounds into the double - stacked magazine ( a new original design ) , yet maintain a comfortable grip size .
The PMR - 30 has a unique hybrid blow back / locked breech recoil system .
In order to accommodate a wide range of ammunition , the pistol automatically adjusts between locked breach and blowback based on internal pressure .
I look forward to seeing how this system works .
One problem with the .22 Magnum is that because it was designed as a rifle cartridge , the powder load is slow burning .
This maintains high pressure in the barrel for a longer period of time .
This high pressure can prevent extraction during recoil because the gas pushes out against the brass and presses it into the chamber wall .
Shooting Log report that the PMR - 30 has a fluted chamber to prevent this type of extraction problem .
The gas enters the flutes and counterbalances the pressure against the case wall and also acts as a lubricant .

The PM - 30 ′s frame is aluminum .
The slide and barrel are steel .
Interestingly , the barrel is fluted .
Regarding the .22 Magnum performance compared to the FN 5.7x28 mm round , read this article .
Specifications Caliber .22 Magnum ( .22WMR ) Barrel length 4.3 ″ Slide and Barrel 4140 Steel Frame 7075 Aluminum Magazine capacity 30 rounds Trigger pull 3.5 to 5 lbs Weight ( no mag ) 13.6 oz.
Length 7.9 ″ Height 5.8 ″ Grip Width 1.1 ″ Muzzle Velocity ( 40 gr ) 1230 fps Expected Availability Quarter 2 , 2010 MSRP ( Price ) $ 415
Oleg Volk has taken some photos of the pistol …
30 Rounds is a lot of ammo !!!!
UPDATE : Bill pointed out that the Grendel P30 , which was manufactured in the early 90s , was designed by George Kellgren , the founder and chief designer at Kel - Tec .
I suppose the PMR - 30 is an improved P - 30 .
Zach Galifianakis is a strange , funny man with a knack for landing jobs that do n't let those traits shine .
He 's had small roles in bad movies ( Out Cold , Corky Romano , Heartbreakers ) , he hosted his own funny - but - doomed sketch / chat show for VH1 ( Late World With Zach ) , and he even spent a season and a half on a ridiculous network - TV show about a time - traveling hottie who works in a morgue ( Tru Calling ) .
His stars have aligned better in recent years , with the funny - but - cancelled Comedy Central show Dog Bites Man , a starring role in a video for his friend Fiona Apple , and some greater recognition as a stand - up .
At least the Comedians Of Comedy Tour — which also featured Patton Oswalt , Brian Posehn , and Maria Bamford — gave Galifianakis ' personality room to breathe .
Galifianakis ' new DVD , Live At The Purple Onion , may be the first true distillation of his comedic sensibility :
It features a terrific stand - up set that veers between actual jokes , asides , audience - baiting , and , most importantly , the introduction of Galifianakis ' imaginary estranged twin brother Seth , a Southern rube who believes that Zach 's career path and life are essentially worthless .
Galifianakis recently spoke to The A.V. Club about his past work , his farm , and his role in an upcoming film directed by Sean Penn .
Then Zach handed the phone to his " twin . "

The A.V. Club : Did Late
World seem like a huge deal when you landed it ?
Zach Galifianakis : Not really .
I was n't sitting around going , " Oh man , this is it .
This is the big break . "
It was exciting , but it was like , " Here 's another job , let me see how I can screw this up . "
I never really realized that I was a producer of it until later , but by then , it was too late .
Also , I was eating a lot of pot cookies at the time ; I could 've been a little bit more professional .

AVC : It seemed to get much weirder toward the end , on the episodes where you make fun of getting cancelled .
ZG : I knew from day one , when the VH1 guys came in and said , " Do n't make fun of Cher , do n't make fun of Sheryl Crow . "
Whatever their rotation was at the time .
I was like , " Well , this is n't a good marriage . "
We started celebrating that we did n't belong on that channel .
Advertisement
AVC : Is there a chance the show will ever be officially released ?
ZG : I have all of the episodes in my attic .
I have a feeling there 's a possum in my attic , and I 'm really scared of possums .
So there 's this one possum in my attic that 's keeping me from going up there and releasing the show on DVD .
If that possum will go away , then maybe I will release it .
Advertisement
AVC : Is this possum a metaphor ?
ZG : No , no , no , no .
Well , it could be .
Yes .
It could be something in my mind .
I 'm not sure if I want it to be released .
There were some embarrassing things on the show that , even while I was doing them , I was like , " Oh my God , what am I doing ? "
So the possum is somewhat of a metaphor .
Advertisement
AVC : And Dog Bites Man is cancelled ?
ZG : Yes .
It 's gone .
I 'm like whoever the opposite of Midas is .
AVC : Is it true that the show sometimes made you uncomfortable ?
ZG :
There was one time where I actually started crying .
We were in a church , and this guy was so sweet .
He said something really sad , and I just could n't take it .
If you 're onstage and you 're screwing with someone , they know that there 's a comedy show going on .
These people had no idea .
And a lot of times , we were n't taking the piss out of people with power , we were just taking the piss out of regular folks .
And we have all these fancy lawyers behind us .
Sometimes it felt a little dirty .
But some of the hardest I 've ever laughed was on that show , because you were n't supposed to laugh , which made it kind of like laughing at a funeral .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you think audiences did n't realize that those were real people being interviewed ?
ZG : I think that was part of the problem .
People thought they were actors , and you have to know that they 're real people to appreciate it .
But it 's kind of flattering that they did n't know .
There was one episode that never aired where we went to a real KKK rally .
I got to ask the grand wizard of the KKK if he'd ever seen Big Momma 's House 3 .
Which was probably the highlight of my career .

AVC : So the new DVD — is this one of the first things you can be wholeheartedly proud of ?
Advertisement
ZG : I just wanted to show the rawness of stand - up .
A lot of times , people put out these DVDs that are just really polished , but I wanted to show some awkwardness .
But I think it 's good .
I think people should try to sit through it .
[ Laughs . ]
AVC : How often do you find yourself going off the rails onstage ?
ZG : It has to come organically .
I do n't do it just to do it .
It happens a lot .
If a crowd is quiet and I 'm not screwing up , then I wo n't do it that much .
But if I feel bothered by something in the audience , I have to comment on it , and that happens probably more than it should .
Advertisement
AVC : You do n't like people you know in the audience when you perform , right ?
ZG : I do n't like it at all .
I do n't know why .
Sometimes it can go so badly , and I will sabotage myself onstage .
And I just do n't want that awkwardness after the show where a family member says , " No , it was good ! " I feel bad for them , not for me .
Advertisement
AVC : You 're about to do a tour of big theaters .
To what do you credit that popularity surge ?
The Comedians Of Comedy ?
ZG : Yeah , I owe it to Comedians Of Comedy and Patton Oswalt .
If it were n't for that , I 'd probably still be playing the back of a pharmacy somewhere .
I never really did the club stuff ; I 'm really kind of a wimp that way .
I just stay mostly in Los Angeles and perform in front of people wearing ironic T - shirts .
That or a few goth chicks .

AVC : Is doing stand - up on this bigger level the ideal career situation for you ?
Or would you rather be doing more TV or movies ?
Advertisement
ZG : When I do stand - up for a long time , I 'll get burned out , then I 'll get an acting gig .
For me , the grass is always greener .
I 'd like to do a mixture of all of it .
My goal is just to do small movies that I 've written .
That 's what I 'm trying to do now , just write smaller movies .
AVC : And you 're dreaming of starting a writer 's retreat ?
ZG : I have a 60 - acre farm in North Carolina , and I have a tractor and a farmhouse .
As soon as I groom the land , I want to put cabins around and have a place where people can write and hang out .
It 'll be either that or an all - black nudist colony .
Advertisement
AVC : Would you be allowed ?
ZG : I would be allowed .
A lot of people have done blackface , I would be in black - penis .
That 's so stupid .
[ Groans . ]
I have a lot of goals for the farm .
I planted a few trees — I want it to be a sustainable farm .
I put a pond in and I 'm trying to figure out where to put my pot plants .

AVC : The whole idea seems the opposite of cynical , though you 're often pegged as cynical .
ZG : I 'm not cynical when it comes to things that are important .
I 'm cynical about pop culture and all that horseshit .
I 'm more at peace on that farm .
I love it .
I have no idea what I 'm doing at all , but it 's just fun …
There 's just something inside me that wants to cultivate land .

AVC : Do you still write jokes every day ?
ZG : I try to write three jokes every day .
I do n't sit down and write them , it 's just things that pop into my head .
Then I 'll go watch it fail onstage that night .

AVC : What did you write today ?
ZG : [ Hesitates . ]
Every weekday around 11 a.m. , it 's guaranteed that I 'll say to myself , " Now , that 's a good question , Tyra . "
Advertisement
AVC : My dad would n't get it .
ZG : My dad does n't get any of my jokes .
He laughs at them , but he does n't understand them .
He 's just laughing because people around him are laughing .
Advertisement
AVC : Does your family think you 're weird ?
ZG :
It 's funny that you bring that up , because I was talking to my mom the other day , and she called me a weirdo .
It was the first time I 'd ever heard her say that , and I told her that I thought she was weird .
So we got that out of the way .
I think that I could be in porno , but as long as I was flying my parents around , they would n't really care .
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : How did you end up in Sean Penn 's upcoming movie , Into The Wild ?
ZG : Sean Penn called my cell phone out of the blue .
He was like , " This is Sean Penn , " and I 'm like , " Uh - huh . "
And then I kept listening to him and thought , " That does sound like Sean Penn . "
He asked me what I was doing the following week , and I told him that I had plans to go to Arby 's , and he laughed at that .
And then the next week , I flew to South Dakota and he and I and Vince Vaughn were in a hunting lodge together for two weeks .
When I first got there , I asked Sean Penn , " How did you know who I am ? " and he said , " I 've seen the movie Out Cold about 20 times . "
It 's this horrible snowboarding movie that I 'm in .
His son had watched it over and over .
You never know what a shitty Lee Majors movie could turn into .

AVC : What 's your character ?
Are you funny in it ?
ZG : It 's a serious movie .
There were no scripted lines for me ;
Sean just said he was going to let the camera go and let me and Vince do what we wanted .
I guess it 's kind of a comic - relief thing .
I play a hunter who 's an alcoholic .
That 's really all I had to go by .
He tells me that I 'm still in the movie .

AVC : Is it possible to speak with your twin brother , Seth ?
ZG : He 's real weird about it , but I could get him for you …
Seth !
AVC : You were recently a guest on Jimmy Kimmel .
How was that ?
Seth Galifianakis :
He 's really nice and funny .
They put me in a nice hotel and I got a limousine car to come pick me up .
Have you ever been in a limousine ?
You know those Mini Coopers , those small cars ?
It 'd be kind of cool if they made that into a limousine .
I was telling Zach that , and he did n't say anything , but that 'd be so cool if they did that !

AVC : It sounds like your relationship with Zach has gotten a little better since the DVD was filmed .
Do you feel like you were portrayed accurately on the DVD ?
SG : I have n't seen it .
I do n't wanna watch it .
Zach and I … We had a great - aunt that died and we bonded a little bit over that .
It sounds weird , but she was in a bizarre butterfly accident .
I 'm in New York right now with Zach , and things are going a little bit better than usual .
If he'd just stop smoking so much cheeba , as he calls it .

SG : Oh , God no .
Jeez .

SG : There 's like these guys that walk around in New York …
They look like Zach ' cause they got these beards and stuff , and they 're dressed all in black .
And their hair comes over their ears and stuff !
Zach said they 're Jews , and I was like , " What ?!
They look crazy ! "

AVC : Is the lure of stardom exciting for you in New York ?
Have you ever considered following in Zach 's footsteps ?
SG : I 'll tell you something that 's really funny .
There 's this really big Applebee 's in Times Square , and I wanted to go because they have these virgin mojitos that you can drink .
So anyway , Zach and I , we 's sitting there — and I 'm used to people always going up to Zach — and this dude comes up to me and says , " Hey Seth !
I seen you on the TV ! "
And I was like , " Yeah !
This is my brother , " and he did n't even give Zach the once - over !

I was at the DMV and this colored lady was like , " Are you Seth Galifianakis ?
I seen you on TV ! "

It 's kind of alluring , you get free stuff .
I did n't pass my sight test , but she passed me .
If I had n't been on TV , it would 've never happened .

AVC : Are you a fan of any of Zach 's movies ?
SG : He did this one movie that was so funny .
It was with Chris Kattan ; it was called Corky Romano .
Zach did n't have to say much in it , and I did n't care much for his part , but that Chris Kattan was making all kinds of funny movements with his body and stuff !
And I thought , " This is the kind of stuff I can get into ! "

AVC : If Zach ever asked you for career or life advice , what direction would you point him ?

Our dad 's been trying to get us to open up a hot - dog stand .
I 'd love to do that .
Zach and I do n't get along , but I can work the register and he can cook a good hot dog , I 'll tell you that .
Just to make his life a little simpler would be nice .
He comes back to the farm and stuff , but all he does is smoke pot and ride around on his tractor .
He thought it was funny to wear Speedos the other day on the tractor .
He had a cape on , too .
My mom about had a heart attack .

But is it even possible to get the public to permanently reduce salt consumption ?
Researchers have had a hard enough time getting people to cut back during short - term supervised experiments .
Image Credit ... Viktor Koen
The salt reformers say change is possible if the food industry cuts back on all the hidden salt in its products .
They want the United States to emulate Britain , where there has been an intensive campaign to pressure industry as well as consumers to use less salt .
As a result , British authorities say , from 2000 to 2008 there was about a 10 percent reduction in daily salt consumption , which was measured by surveys that analyzed the amount of salt excreted in urine collected over 24 hours .
But the British report was challenged in a recent article in The Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology by researchers at the University of California , Davis , and Washington University in St. Louis .
The team , led by Dr. David A. McCarron , a nephrologist at Davis , criticized the British authorities for singling out surveys in 2008 and 2000 while ignoring nearly a dozen similar surveys conducted in the past two decades .
When all the surveys in Britain are considered , there has been no consistent downward trend in salt consumption in recent years , said Dr. McCarron , who has been a longtime critic of the salt reformers .
( For more on him and his foes , go to nytimes.com/tierneylab . )
He said that the most notable feature of the data is how little variation there has been in salt consumption in Britain  and just about everywhere else , too .
Dr. McCarron and his colleagues analyzed surveys from 33 countries around the world and reported that , despite wide differences in diet and culture , people generally consumed about the same amount of salt .
There were a few exceptions , like tribes isolated in the Amazon and Africa , but the vast majority of people ate more salt than recommended in the current American dietary guidelines .
The results were so similar in so many places that Dr. McCarron hypothesized that networks in the brain regulate sodium appetite so that people consume a set daily level of salt .
If so , that might help explain one apparent paradox related to reports that Americans are consuming more daily calories than they used to .
Extra food would be expected to come with additional salt , yet there has not been a clear upward trend in daily salt consumption evident over the years in urinalysis studies , which are considered the best gauge because they directly measure salt levels instead of relying on estimates based on people ’s recollections of what they ate .
Why no extra salt ?
One prominent advocate of salt reduction , Dr. Lawrence Appel of Johns Hopkins University , said that inconsistent techniques in conducting the urinalysis surveys may be masking a real upward trend in salt consumption .

Sharamag ePublishing .
Job Description : Developers are needed to work on the database portions of an open - use epublishing concept .
The current version is similar to a blog in that people can write & construct articles , as well as collect articles to create issues of publications .
Final rendition will have dedicated readers to each platform ( iphone , android devices , ipad , tablet systems ) that display the created content in a way best suited for that device .
The back end of this system is currently targeted to Google App Engine for the scalability .
The concept is to build an open community for publishing on electronic devices where the creation of content is as easy as writing a blog entry .
Contributors and collaborators will be able to work together towards creating issues of publications , and those publications will be readable on any device without having to download a complete application for every issue .
This idea came about because of the barriers to publishing on electronic devices such as the ipad and more capable mobile phones .
What Python is used for : Currently for database construction and manipulation , article entries , eventually including a visualizer for layout & design .

PyConference
Conference planning web application plus appropriate frontend ( conference website ) .
I do n't know if you know it , but there is an very good conference planning software written in Ruby on Rails , called " Pentabarf " - http://www.pentabarf.org/Main_Page - and I really would like to see it if we have something like that in python , too .
Its not a " NIH " - thing , but I am more into Python than into Ruby , as the most of you .
And a second reason for starting such a project is especially the planning of python - focused confernces .
There it would be a little be embarassing , if someone plans a conference in a RoR conference planning web application or - much worser - in PHP .
And using a half - baked Plone or Zope application wouldnt do the job right , also not the using of a wiki like MoinMoin , it isnt the right tool for such a job .
I did n't start the project yet , but if there are enough people for a good team I would start and host it .
Ruby has a good web framework doing this , Ruby on Rails .
But we got two !
PS : The most important thing - if you want to take part , mail me with subject " PyConference " at : mm ( A - T ) mpathy ( D - O - T ) de

E Screening Room ( San Rafael , CA , USA )
Job Description :
This is not for the faint of heart !
If you have time to hammer this out in the next three weeks let us know ...
We will be building an integration of " Broadcast Machine " with Paypal subscription services .*
We are looking for a volunteer web developer with a passion for documentary films and in support of the freedom of speech , with experience with perl , Python mysql .
We are using agile ( extreme ) programming methods .
We can't pay you anything but you get to create the cool feature to support the freedom of speech .
The non-profit E Screening Room is dedicated to connect independent documentary film makers with their audience .
We have on - line website dedicated to viewing unabridged independent documentary films at http://escreeningroom.org.
We are starting a new website http://indiewebfest.org which will be an online filmfestival based running on open source " Broadcast Machine " from http://www.getdemocracy.com/broadcast/.
The neat thing of the " Broadcast Machine " is that it is bittorrent based , and thus allows for unlimited band wide without significant funding .
In effect this means that you do n't have to come up with thousands of $ $ to distribute your idea or your film .
Independent documentary films are born out of the passion - often compassion - for the subject of the film .
Often these documentaries are self financed .
But there is little financial gain out of documentary film .
As a result , documentary producers get discouraged and often leave the field .
We think that 's a shame : to lose an independent voice , is a loss for a free society .
At the e screening room we are changing that by connecting documentary filmmakers with their audience .
Project :
The idea is to allow viewers to subscribe to a site through paypal .
The viewer would pay a low monthly fee to get assess to a subset ( subscription only ) of the films on the site .
The subscription fees are then redistributed to the filmmakers papal accounts based on viewer ship and will fund the site .
This project will take place independent of getdemocracy.com but application will be released as open source .
I expect that it will take about 40 hour over two months .

The New York Times has all but confirmed to The Electronic Intifada ( EI ) that the son of its Jerusalem bureau chief Ethan Bronner was recently inducted into the Israeli army .
Over the weekend , EI received a tip suggesting this had been the case and wrote to Bronner to ask him to confirm or deny the information and to seek his opinion on whether , if true , he thought it would be a conflict of interest .
Susan Chira , the foreign editor of The New York Times wrote in an email to The Electronic Intifada this morning :
“ Ethan Bronner referred your query to me , the foreign editor .
Here is my comment : Mr. Bronner ’s son is a young adult who makes his own decisions .
At The Times , we have found Mr. Bronner ’s coverage to be scrupulously fair and we are confident that will continue to be the case . ”
The Electronic Intifada also wrote to Clark Hoyt , the public editor of The New York Times , to confirm the information and ask for an opinion on whether this constituted a conflict of interest , but had yet to receive a response .
Bronner , as bureau chief , has primary responsibility for his paper ’s reporting on all aspects of the Palestine / Israel conflict , and on the Israeli army , whose official name is the “ Israel Defense Forces . ”
On 23 January , Bronner published a lengthy article on Israel ’s efforts to refute allegations contained in the UN - commissioned Goldstone report of war crimes and crimes against humanity during its attack on Gaza last winter ( “ Israel Poised to Challenge a UN Report on Gaza ” ) .
As ’ad AbuKhalil , a frequent critic of Bronner ’s coverage , blogged in response that “ The New York Times devoted more space to Israeli and Zionist criticisms of the Goldstone report than to the [ content of the ] report itself ” ( The Angry Arab News Service , “ Ethan Bronner ’s propaganda services , 25 January 2010 )
Bronner ’s pro-Israeli bias reporting on Israel ’s attack on Gaza last year was also criticized by the media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) ( See “ NYT and the Perils of Mideast ‘ Balance ’ , ” 4 February 2009 ) .
The New York Times ’ own “ Company policy on Ethics in Journalism ” acknowledges that the activities of a journalist ’s family member may constitute a conflict of interest .
It includes as an example , “ A brother or a daughter in a high - profile job on Wall Street might produce the appearance of conflict for a business reporter or editor . ”
Such conflicts may on occasion require the staff member “ to withdraw from certain coverage . ”
After Israel ’s invasion of Gaza last winter , Israeli military censors banned local media from printing the names of individual officers who participated in the attack for fear that this could assist international efforts to bring war crimes suspects to justice .
This followed the publication of a number of soldiers ’ personal testimonies in the Israeli press describing atrocities they had seen committed by the Israeli army in Gaza .
The Times ’ treatment of Bronner sets an interesting precedent .
Would the newspaper ’s policy be the same if a reporter in its Jerusalem bureau had an immediate family member who faced Bronner ’s son across the battlefield , as a member of a Palestinian or Lebanese resistance organization ?
It would appear that despite the highly sensitive nature of Palestine / Israel coverage , and the very high personal stakes for Bronner and his son that could result from full and open coverage of the Israeli army ’s abuses of Palestinians , The New York Times does not consider this situation to be a problematic case .
It had not even disclosed the situation to its readers — until now .
Editor ’s Note : On 6 February 2010 , The New York Times ’ public editor Clark Hoyt issued a response to this article , concurring that Bronner ’s position represented a conflict of interest and that he should be reassigned ( “ Too Close to Home , ” The New York Times ) .
California lawmakers are eager to harpoon the great white whale that is Amazon.com to force it to collect sales tax on every HDTV and Kindle it sells here .
But those efforts could ensnare scores of smaller fish : mom-and - pop Internet businesses that rely on Amazon and other e-tailers for their livelihood .
The e-commerce behemoth has avoided paying sales tax in California because it has no offices , stores or warehouses in the state .
But California contends that Amazon does have a presence here .
This week , the state Legislature is considering a bill that says California Web sites known as affiliates that send customers to Amazon and other e-commerce companies in exchange for a commission constitute a sales force , giving Amazon and others a physical presence , or " nexus , " here .
Under a 1992 Supreme Court decision , only retailers with a nexus in a state can be compelled to collect sales tax from its residents .
Cash - strapped California says it could garner $ 150 million a year from the so - called Amazon bill if out - of - state retailers collected tax on every laptop , Cuisinart and best - seller they peddle to folks here .
Consumers are supposed to pay that tax themselves , but it 's a rare shopper who does .
Scores of mom-and - pop California
Web sites that drive traffic to e-tailers say they would be unfairly ensnared by the state 's attempts to force Amazon to pay up .
Meanwhile , brick - and - mortar retailers say Amazon 's use of the Internet as a sales - tax haven is unfair to them .
Amazon ( which did not return calls ) , Overstock and other large out - of - state e-tailers say they will cut off their California affiliates to duck the sales - tax obligation .
The affiliates say that means they 'll lose their income and the state still wo n't get the sales tax revenue .
California has more than 25,000 affiliates , ranging from part - time Web - masters earning a few bucks to large enterprises pulling in millions , said the Performance Marketing Association , their trade group .
In 2008 they had revenues of $ 202.7 million and paid $ 18.9 million in state income tax , the group said .
Industry reports say e-tailers generate about 10 percent of their sales through online affiliates .
How it works
Nick Loper runs comparison shopping site ShoesRUs. net out of his Livermore townhouse .
When a customer visits ShoesRUs , clicks on an e-tailer 's link and places an order , Loper earns a referral fee of about 10 percent to 15 percent of that sale .
Last year the site generated $ 3.5 million in shoe sales for its two dozen e-tail clients , and $ 400,000 in revenue for itself , netting about $ 150,000 ( including his salary ) , he said .
" If the bill were to pass and some of my major advertisers dropped their California partners , it would be devastating for me , " Loper said .
About 95 percent of ShoesRUs clients are out - of - state Internet companies that now have no California sales - tax liability .
" It 's kind of scary , " he said .
" I would consider moving or setting up an entity in Oregon or Nevada to be able to continue my livelihood .
Obviously I 'd prefer not to have to go down that path . "
Loper considers himself an advertiser - " there are no shoeboxes in my garage , " he said - but supporters of the Amazon bill say Loper and his ilk really work as sales reps for e-tailers .
" Affiliates are effectively a sales force - they are promoting products and getting a commission on sales in California , " said Lenny Goldberg , executive director of the California Tax Reform Association , which is lobbying for the bill on behalf of independent booksellers .
Affiliates such as PTA chapters and church groups often market directly to friends and neighbors , meaning they are pitching directly to Californians , he said .
Unfair advantage
Bill Dombrowski , CEO of the California Retailers Association , said e-tailers ' use of the Internet to avoid sales taxes gives them an unfair advantage .
" It distorts the results ; we lose sales and we lose jobs , " he said .
His members include large " brick - and - click " players like Wal - Mart , Target and Best Buy , which have physical stores as well as online sites and therefore collect sales tax on online purchases .
He thinks Amazon 's threat to cut off California affiliates is a bluff because the state is too big and important of a market .
While Amazon dumped affiliates in Rhode Island and North Carolina when those states implemented similar bills , it maintained its affiliates in New York while fighting that state 's tax - collection laws in court .
" How much business is Amazon doing in Rhode Island ? " Dombrowski said .
" That 's why it happened there and not in New York , and that 's why it is n't going to happen in California . "
California 's legislation is still up in the air .
It passed the Senate last week and should reach the Assembly floor this week .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year and has n't yet said how he would handle this one .
Haphazard taxing
Players on both sides of the California bill said any Internet sales tax should be implemented uniformly , not state by state , and many want an exemption for small companies .
" If there 's a fair way to collect sales tax from everybody , I have no problem with that , " said Rob Smahl , chief marketing officer at San Francisco 's eBates.com , a cash - back shopping loyalty site .
The 40 - person company compiles deals from 1,100 e-tailers , collects a commission when it generates a sale , then splits that commission with the customer .
" This bill would force us to put the brakes on a growing business , " Smahl said .
" It does n't solve the real issue :
If you want to collect sales tax , find a way to do it without picking on a small channel .
Someone not in California will have an unfair advantage over me to do the same business model I have . "
We 'll cut to the chase : the 2010 Macworld Expo was a wild success .
This was despite the expectations of nearly everyone — the press ( yes , even those of us who still went to cover the conference ) , many of the exhibitors , and nearly the entire Internet .
The conference 's huge crowds ended up surprising everyone , all but guaranteeing a future for the Macworld Expo .
As the first Macworld San Francisco ( MWSF ) without Apple , IDG World Expo made huge efforts — arguably much more than in past years — to appeal to the Apple community .
Offering free expo passes , huge discounts , and bringing in an emergency celebrity contingency were just some of the stops that IDG pulled out in order to lure in attendees .
And it apparently worked — not only did David Pogue perform with the help of Levar Burton and the Autotune the News Crew , but Kevin Smith hosted a packed house and other , more techy Internet names ( such as John Gruber and Andy Ihnatko ) held court to huge crowds as well .
On the Expo floor , the crowds were so thick on Thursday and Friday that it was difficult to walk around at times , and many vendors told Ars that they had nonstop traffic through their booths .
One software maker said that he could n't talk fast enough to get through the customers waiting to check things out , and several developers showcasing their iPhone apps said that the response had been " phenomenal . "
Even those selling quirky items responded positively to our queries — the energy was high and everyone was feeling it .
Even some companies that did n't have any new announcements to share , such as VMware , said they were glad to have paid for a booth , as it was a great way to interact with customers face - to - face .
We asked representatives from practically every company on the show floor whether they would come back next year , and the responses were overwhelmingly positive .
( Most responded " Yes , definitely ! " without hesitation . )
It 's clear that the high levels of foot traffic were n't anticipated by all , though .
There was a 50 percent drop in registered exhibitors from last year 's event ( from over 500 to about 220 ) , but it turns out those exhibitors who backed out wished they had n't .
Many companies that chose not to pay for a booth still sent representatives to check out the 2010 Expo .
We managed to track down a few while wandering around the show floor , and they overwhelmingly told Ars that they actively regretted pulling out after seeing how much of a non-failure this year 's Expo was .
" We wish we anticipated this kind of opportunity to talk to our customers , " a representative of one ( pretty major ) past vendor told us .
Of course , the social aspect of Macworld Expo was never doubted — the parties ( official and unofficial ) were as packed as always and all the attendees we spoke to had a good time .
Having a beer with your fellow nerd or favorite developer will always be one of the biggest reasons for conference - goers to keep coming back ( it 's one of the primary reasons people go to SXSWi , also known as the " Spring Break for Nerds " ) .
For someone covering the conference , and for many exhibitors , parties were n't just a time to relax after a long day of work , they were really a more relaxed extension of the workday where one could continue talking to users and other insiders about Apple products , coding , business , and the world of technology as a whole .
This is n't to say that the perceptions of the crowd that some of us expressed in the beginning were wrong — a handful of vendors agreed with our earlier assessment that the crowd in general seemed a little more from the " hardcore , oldschool " Apple fanbase compared to recent years .
But not all of them saw that as a bad thing ; Omni Group spokesperson Naomi Pearce felt that Apple 's disappearance got rid of the more casual and less - interested users , keeping only the most interested and active user base .
Essentially , Apple leaving the Expo improved the signal - to - noise ratio .
That 's a comparison we can appreciate .
The question remains : how much longer can IDG keep this up ?
At this point , it 's all but guaranteed that MWSF 2011 will go off without a hitch , and probably with even more vendors than this year .
But at least part of the success of the 2010 Expo was undoubtedly due to the mere novelty of going to an Apple - free Macworld .
From here on out , the Apple community will have to evaluate whether it's a good enough show to keep attending , and it 's possible that interest may dwindle over time .
The key question , though , is whether Macworld is a good and viable show .
For 2010 at least , the answer was a resounding yes .
Members of a hit squad that assassinated a top Hamas military commander used Irish passports to enter and leave Dubai , it 's been claimed .
The suspected Israeli hit team , including at least one woman , entered the United Arab Emirates using Irish documents , police authorities said .
Mahmoud al - Mabhouh ( 50 ) , held responsible by Israel for the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers in 1989 , died in mysterious circumstances on January 20 in a Dubai hotel room .
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said yesterday : " We are aware of the media reports and we are in contact with authorities locally to try and determine the truth of the reports . "
Al - Mabhouh was said to have been shocked with an electric weapon held to his legs and then suffocated or poisoned .
Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing , but Israeli news media claimed al - Mabhouh had many enemies and could have been killed by other Arab factions .
Up to seven people were said to have been involved in al - Mabhouh 's killing , four of whom used Irish passports to enter Dubai and who later fled to a " European country " after the killing , according to police sources in Dubai .
Declining to reveal their identities , an official said UAE security personnel were co-ordinating with Interpol to have them extradited .
Al - Mabhouh had been out for most of the day and returned to his room only after 9 pm , police said .
Pathologists were said to have determined the cause of death as asphyxiation , probably with a pillow found near the body and stained with blood .
A room cleaner found his body the next day .
He had travelled to Dubai under another name .
The victim was said to have been in charge of weapons procurement for Hamas and was on a mission in Dubai .
His brother said it was not the first attempt on his life .
Six months ago , he was rushed to hospital in Dubai in a coma and treated for poisoning .
Mr Mabhouh 's funeral was held in Damascus , where he had lived for 20 years with his wife and children .
In 1986 , US officials , including Oliver North , reportedly used Irish passports to travel to Iran to offer missiles for hostages .

Next year , despite the lack of any public demand for it , we will be voting on the electoral system .
While the public seems quite happy with MMP , big business is n't .
Results which actually reflect the way people voted , permanent minority government , a need for consensus and compromise and consequent limit of government power - democracy , in other words - is seen as a barrier to " reform " , which they want but the people do n't .
And so there will be a referendum , where they will try and buy the outcome , in order to give us a less democratic electoral system where politicians will be less accountable to us .
They have to be stopped .
And so a group of people who support democracy have come together ( or in many cases , rejoined ) to campaign for MMP .
At the moment , they 're focused on ensuring a fair referendum , with an unbiased question and spending limits to prevent big business from buying the outcome ( as they almost did last time ) .
Later on they 'll move on to serious campaigning .
If you 're interested , then you can sign up here .
There are already regional groups in Auckland , Wellington , Dunedin , Nelson , Palmerston North and Hamilton ; hopefully Christchurch and other areas will be coming soon .
We can't take our democracy for granted .
I 'm old enough to remember the days of unrepresentative elections , when a few hundred voters in marginal seats determined the outcome , parties became government despite winning fewer votes than their rivals , and governments did what they liked , unconstrained by public opinion .
I do n't want to go back to them .
If we want to keep our democracy , we need to speak up for it .
So , sign up , and do your bit to defend MMP !
Razer , Sixense and Valve Bringing Motion Controls and Gesture Recognition Hardware to PC Games
Razer , Valve , and Sixense , along with a selection of PC OEM partners , are aiming to produce , " ... ultra -precise one - to - one motion sensing controllers that use electromagnetic fields to track precise movements along all six axes . "
Each controller will reportedly track its orientation within a single degree , and detect positioning within one millimeter .
Thankfully , the device will be compatible with both current and future generation PC games .
The new technology is being demonstrated at CES this week using Valve 's Left 4 Dead 2 and a controller prototype , with the software development kit currently available on Steam , Valve 's PC digital distribution service .
Left 4 Dead 2 team lead Chet Faliszek threw a gauntlet at the feet of other motion - control efforts , stating that he believes , " ... this release represents motion - enabled gaming that 's more integrated and visceral than any platform has so far achieved . "
Avi Arad , chairman and co-founder of Sixense commented that the unnamed device , " ... will not only enhance the entire gaming experience , but will truly revolutionize how games are played on the PC . "
On an interesting side - note , Arad also owns the movie rights to Mass Effect and is currently assigned as a producer on the Uncharted and Lost Planet films , in addition to having worked as a producer on several Marvel comic book movies .
Valve is no stranger to interesting controller technology , as evidenced by their fairly recent support of the Novint Falcon Controller .
Considering the players involved in their latest partnership ( and Faliszek 's fighting words ) , this new doodad might be one to keep an eye on leading up to its release sometime in 2010 .

CNBC ’s Charlie Gasparino tells the desk that Bank of America is going to repay $ 45 billion and get out of the TARP program .
And they will raise capital over the next few days , he adds .
That suggests to host Melissa Lee that there will be an offering - although Karen Finerman says she would be surprised if it 's entirely done with common equity .
Later in the broadcast Gasparino says Bank of America will use $ 26.2 billion in available cash and will also sell $ 18.8 billion in preferred stock - with the offering coming on Monday .
" This is not just some intellectual argument between people who think they know the answer , we are talking about the future of the globe .

... there was abundance of wood in the mountains .
Of this last the traces still remain , for although some of the mountains now only afford sustenance to bees , not so very long ago there were still to be seen roofs of timber cut from trees growing there , which were of a size sufficient to cover the largest houses ; and there were many other high trees , cultivated by man and bearing abundance of food for cattle .
Moreover , the land reaped the benefit of the annual rainfall , not as now losing the water which flows off the bare earth into the sea , but , having an abundant supply in all places , and receiving it into herself and treasuring it up in the close clay soil , it let off into the hollows the streams which it absorbed from the heights , providing everywhere abundant fountains and rivers ,

... the virtues and the laws of their predecessors , they knew only by obscure traditions ; and as they themselves and their children lacked for many generations the necessaries of life , they directed their attention to the supply of their wants , and of them they conversed , to the neglect of events that had happened in times long past ; for mythology and the enquiry into antiquity are first introduced into cities when they begin to have leisure , and when they see that the necessaries of life have already been provided , but not before .
Plato , critias , 360 BCE
A speculation on the possibility of the accurate prediction of future , hind - sight based , historical worldviews , and the application of such prediction to the current climate change debate .
Pragma - mass noun : the practical outcome of a decision - based action as viewed from a historical perspective .
Pragma is to science and politics as karma is to spirituality .
Russian roulette uses one bullet and five empty chambers .
The odds are in favor of the player .
On that basis I am forced to conclude that Professor Liss has committed a ludic_fallacy : he is being unduly optimistic about our future chances of survival .
There are some aspects of human decision - making processes which are not amenable to purely scientific and logical discussions or solutions .
Different people have different grounds for supporting one side or the other of a debate .
The classic instance is debate between people of scientific and people of religious persuasions .
In parallel with the science vs religion debate has been what I would call the ' small human - big planet ' debate : people are divided as to whether or not we small humans can adversely affect our relatively big planet .
The debate about whether or not humans can affect the planet as a whole is not of recent origin .
It goes back a very long way in written human history , and even longer in myths and legends .
Sometimes neither side of a debate can conclude the argument by convincing the other side of the truth .
In such cases the only option seems to be to ' wait and see ' , after which one side can say to the other : " I told you so ! " .
There is another option , however , the pragma option .
The two sides can examine all possible practical outcomes of accepting one or another viewpoint as being true .
The two sides can look at all possible outcomes of action or inaction based on their opposing views .
They can look at the possible and reasonably likely outcomes of being right or wrong .
They can then perform a cost - benefit analysis of these outcomes .
Put informally : our descendants will view our current policy choices according to whether they enjoy the fruits or bear the burdens of our current actions .
More formally : when the parties to a debate cannot or will not resolve alternate views of reality for the purpose of policy - making , it is entirely predictable that history will reveal which policy would best have been adopted .
By analysing the reasonably predictable alternative choice - based outcomes it is possible for the different parties to make a combined , rationally informed policy choice in the shared belief that hindsight will reveal that policy to have been well chosen .
We can convert the pragma hypothesis into a form for practical and general application .
Undebatable issues can be addressed with a rationalisation model , or pragmatic assessment model .
The model , a generalisation of Pascal 's wager , shows : Hypotheses H , H ... H- the disputed realities as believed or hypothesised ; Actions A , A , ... A- the alternative forms of action or inaction ; Results R , R ... R- the possible resultant outcomes .
Having charted the disputed facts or beliefs we can now choose the pragma option : a pragmatic choice of policy based on a cost - benefit risk assessment of each possible policy adoption .
This is somewhat equivalent to viewing the problem using the ' exact science ' of hindsight .
In our distant future , if humans survive whatever hazards the future brings , what will people know or say about their past ?
Will they thank this age of wisdom , or curse this age of stupid ?
Will they remember us only in myths and legends ?
Do we still have a say in the matter ?

There is a desire among publishers to do for the PC what Xbox Live does for the Xbox and the Playstation Network does for the PlayStation .
Everyone has a sense that digital distribution and / or social networking is the key to the future and that there is a great deal of money to be made in setting up shop early and securing your own share of the market , even before the market takes shape .
Nobody is quite sure how games will be sold and played ten years from now , but they all know they want to be the ones running the community or selling the titles .
We can already see this process at work .
On the sales side we have platforms like Direct 2 Drive , EA Store , and Impulse .
On the networking and matchmaking side we have things like Games for Windows Live and Gamespy .
And then we have Steam , which does both .
Over a year ago , I predicted that the imitation of Steam would lead to a crazy mess where every publisher would have their own content delivery system for the PC , and every game would be linked to one .
Remember how these systems usually work :
The program sets itself up to run when Windows starts , and it must be running if you want to play the game .
If you follow this scheme to its logical conclusion , you 'll see that the system tray of every gaming PC would eventually end up clogged with loaders , patchers , helpers , and monitors .
Every publisher would have a program for serving up content , connecting players , managing digital licenses , performing patches , and ( most importantly ) selling stuff .
Some people do n't mind having " just one more " program running in the background .
But what happens when you have programs from Valve , Stardock , Activision , 2 k Games , Take - Two , Codemasters , Microsoft , Eidos , and Ubisoft ?
Sure , you could disable them .
But then when you fire the thing up to play a game , it will want to spend fifteen minutes patching itself and the game before it will let you in .
And imagine how fun it would be juggling accounts for all of them .
This was the horror I forsaw last year , but now I can see that no matter how pessimistic and cynical I get , the games industry is always one step ahead of me .
While having lots of programs running at once is a terrible prospect , it is nothing compared to the nightmare of having multiple programs all connected to a single game .
This Christmas I picked up Grand Theft Auto IV through Steam ( in my defense : I knew the PC version was a train wreck , but it was super , super cheap ) and I got a glimpse of the coming digital delivery spamocalypse .
GTA IV ran under Games for Windows Live .
But I do n't know why , because as far as I could tell it did n't use any GFWL features .
For multiplayer , it used the Rockstar Social Club .
And all of this ran under Steam .
Steam , GFWL , and Rockstar Social Club all have their own unique login systems , which means the game basically wanted three sets of login credentials .
( On the other hand , only the Steam one is mandatory .
On the other other hand , Social Club is a hateful , pestering bastard . )
Anna Eshoo says she will offer an amendment to the Intelligence Reauthorization bill .
| REUTERS Rep. targets CIA moonlighting
Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) says she will offer an amendment to the Intelligence Reauthorization bill later this week that would put new rules into place on the practice of intelligence officers who take second jobs in the private sector .
POLITICO revealed on Feb. 1 that the CIA has a little - known policy allowing active duty officers to take part - time work at private sector companies so long as they have the approval of their supervisor and satisfy their superiors that there is no conflict of interest with their intelligence jobs .
Advertisement
But Eshoo , who has questioned intelligence officials about the practice , says she ’s skeptical that the intelligence community is monitoring the moonlighting .
“ My sense is that it is a rubber stamp deal , ” she said of the approval process .
“ No one ’s really looking at it or keeping a close eye on it . ”
Eshoo says she is soliciting Republican support for the measure , but so far has four additional Democrats on the Intelligence Committee as cosponsors : John Tierney ( D - Mass . ) , Dan Boren ( D - Okla . ) , Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill. ) , and Mike Thompson ( D - Calif . ) .
Her amendment , which could come up for a vote before the end of the week , requires the Director of National Intelligence to work with the Office of Government Ethics to issue regulations prohibiting moonlighting if it creates a “ conflict of interest or appearance thereof . ”
And it would mandate that the Director of National Intelligence – who oversees the entire intelligence community including the CIA – to disclose all moonlighting to congressional intelligence committees each year .
Finally , it would block intelligence operatives from owning “ an entity that markets or sells for profit the use of knowledge or skills that such officer or employee acquires or makes use of while carrying out the official duties of such officer or employee . ”
Michael Birmingham , a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence , said Tuesday he could n’t comment on the Eshoo amendment .
“ The Intelligence Community will work with Congress as the Intelligence Authorization Act is considered by the House , ’ Birmingham said .
“ We do not comment on specific amendments that are being considered . ”
In a statement to POLITICO in early February , a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence said that employees are carefully vetted before being allowed to moonlight in the private sector : “ Multiple levels of review are in place to determine whether any security or legal issues would arise and whether the employment would create conflicts of interest , counterintelligence issues or related concerns , ” the spokesperson said .
“ The review process is both rigorous and comprehensive . ”
Sources familiar with the moonlighting policy – which is similar to policies found throughout the federal government – say the CIA uses it as a retention tool to keep high skilled CIA officers from leaving for high - paying corporate jobs .
But Eshoo said that the CIA has never told the House Intelligence Committee that it ’s having trouble retaining officers , and never asked for additional salary increases to keep employees in government jobs .
Eshoo said that she did n’t pursue a blanket ban on outside employment because she did n’t want to block activities she sees as legitimate .
“ There are federal employees who teach classes , or tutor in foreign languages , or who write fiction , or other activities that are unrelated to their employment , ” she said .
And there are lower - paid employees who take second jobs to make ends meet – a GS1 only makes $ 17,000 per year . ”
POLITICO ’s revelation of the moonlighting policy came in an excerpt of a book by the author , entitled : “ Broker , Trader , Lawyer , Spy : The Secret World of Corporate Espionage . ”
Stranded on Machu Picchu : 2,000 tourists trapped after heavy rains and mudslides seal off Inca city
Heavy rains and mudslides in Peru have blocked the train route to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu , stranding some 2,000 tourists .
Perurail spokeswoman Soledad Caparo says the train operator suspended service on Monday and is working to clear rock and mud covering the tracks .
Rail is the only means of transportation on the last leg of the trip to Machu Picchu from the city of Cuzco .
2,000 tourists are currently stranded at the ancient Inca capital of Machu Picchu after heavy rain has caused slides and flooding
Tourism Minister Martin Perez says the government may send helicopters to evacuate tourists and locals from Machu Picchu Pueblo , the town next to the citadel .
Heavy rains have battered the region in the past three days .
Floods and slides have also killed two people and damaged stone walls at archaeological sites .

As a professional lifer in college coaching I am unhappy about the current state of my profession .
The big money and media attention has altered the pressures and the dynamics of the job .
The word " coach " has been a title of respect .
A college or high school coach has a great responsibility ; he or she needs to remember that the sport is a part of a larger academic life for the student - athlete .
The word " coach " should encompass the roles of educator , mentor , guidance counselor and manager of on - field duties .
Years ago many of the men got into coaching in spite of the low pay .
To give you some perspective , in 1966 Joe Paterno shook hands with Penn State President Eric Walker and was told the pay was $ 20,000 a year .
There were no negotiations , no agents , no buyout clauses , and he was a tenured member of the faculty .
Tenure was a bit of a safety net — and a reminder that the coach was part of an academic institution and not bigger than the institution .
A coach with tenure .
That idea seems quaint by today ’s standards .
Who needs tenure when you can pack your bags and bolt for the next job ?
The past few days have seen seismic movements in the world of college football coaching where vacancies have occurred at two of the more notable programs in the country .
Pete Carroll bolted USC for the NFL .
Some have suggested it is because the NCAA posse is heading towards campus to sort out a myriad of allegations .
Pete Carroll has asserted the fact that it was time to move on to a new challenge .
The vacancy at USC did not last long .
A year ago The University of Tennessee took a shot at a young coach who had been fired following a 5 - 15 stint with the Oakland Raiders .
That coach , Lane Kiffin , rewarded Tennessee for its hiring of him by bolting after one 7 - 6 season for the vacancy created at USC .
The University of Tennessee paid out more than $ 5 million in coaching salaries ( not to mention several million dollars to buy out the previous coach ’s contract ) .
At a time when universities are cutting staff and faculty , Tennessee spent more than $ 7 million to win seven games .
A year later it is right back where it started .
This profession has lost touch with the reality of the world around us , and some coaches have lost touch with what the mission of our profession should be .
It was n’t too long ago that we saw head coaches ' salaries go past the $ 1 million dollar mark — they have now surpassed the $ 5 million mark with no sign of slowing down .
We are starting to look as arrogant as the Wall Street bankers raking in seven - figure bonuses .
The astronomical explosion in coaching salaries continues at a time of 10 percent unemployment in America and exploding tuition costs burdening working class families .
I am not saying that every coach should take a vow of poverty or stay at his school for three decades , but we must remember what has made ours a noble profession .
It is the mission of our profession : the use of sport to help young men transition from high school and prepare them for the world that awaits them after college .
Coaches walk into a recruit ’s home and talk about how they will look out for that young man ’s future .
When the parents or guardians pass their boy on to college , they put his welfare into that coach ’s hands .
The expectation is that the coach will help to guide him through a very formative time .
A year later the same coach is off to another job for more money and left behind are the young men he promised to nurture towards their future .
The coach talks about a “ dream job ” or a new challenge , and everyone gobbles it up .
To be fair , you can not solely blame the coaches .
On the flipside , we have seen coaches fired after just two or three years — not even enough time to recruit a class that reaches its senior year .
In football it is hard to put your own stamp on a program until you have a senior class that has risen through the ranks of your system .
Both university administrators and coaches know the contracts are n’t worth the paper they are written on .
From the moment the contract is settled , the cost of the buyout is set .
Schools and coaches all know what it will cost for either side to get out of the contract .
As coaches we can complain about the hair trigger firing of administrators , but the more we skip town , and the more we bail on the student - athletes the more we should realize that we are adding to our own problems .
The freedom to move around and the big paydays all come with a cost — you never get anything for free .
What we ’ve lost is the stability of our profession .
In the end , the student - athletes are the ones left holding the bill .
Mrs Gregory was seen on the deck of the QM2 , with the QE2 behind A couple who lost their camera when it fell overboard from a cruise ship have been traced after a trawlerman hauled the device from the Atlantic seabed .
Benito Estevez , of Spain , found the camera in his nets with five of the photos still intact on the memory card .
Barbara and Dennis Gregory , from South Africa , were en-route from New York to Southampton on the QM2 in 2008 when they lost their camera in the ocean .
Mrs Gregory said she had never expected to see the camera or the photos again .
" It 's literally a dream come true , " she told the BBC .
" There 's no way we could ever have imagined that this thing would ever turn up again .
It sunk to the bottom of the Atlantic . "
Mr Estevez caught the camera in his nets off the west coast of Europe .
Somebody spotted dolphins in the water and the two of us jumped up and that was it
Barbara Gregory
He wanted to trace the owners and posted the pictures online .
Speaking through a translator , Mr Estevez told the BBC : " It makes me really happy to see that they have recovered the memories they had lost .
" If it had been any other thing we would have thrown it back into the sea .... but these circumstances were different .
" I think it 's because of destiny . "
' Absolutely mindboggling '
The photographs show Mrs Gregory posing on the deck of a ship , with the now out - of - service QE2 in the background and in another her husband is wearing a woolly tourist hat from Oxford .
The story was broadcast on BBC programme South Today on Wednesday evening and a friend of the couple , who lives in Chalgrove , Oxfordshire , was just about to switch off her television when she spotted the pictures of her friends .
Mr Estevez believed it was destiny that the camera had been found Mrs Gregory told the BBC the camera dropped into the sea had been the couple 's second of their holiday - after the first was dropped and damaged in New York before the cruise .
She said : " Dennis had had the camera strung around his neck because he did n't want to drop the second one .
" Everything was fine until he sat down on a lounger on deck and took it off his neck .
Somebody spotted dolphins in the water and the two of us jumped up and that was it .
" It literally bounced off his lap , across the deck and into the water with hardly a splash and it was gone .
" We were devastated .
We 'd lost every photograph from New York . "
The Gregorys , from Edenvale near Johannesburg , were on the QM2 as it joined its sister ship QE2 , which was making its last ever transatlantic round trip between Southampton and New York in October 2008 .
Mrs Gregory said : " Dennis 's dream had always been to sail on the Queen Elizabeth but when he went to book it was fully booked because it was its final voyage .
So we settled for the Queen Mary .
" You daydream that it might happen that these pictures are going to pop up somewhere , but you do n't think it 's ever going to happen .
" It 's absolutely mindboggling . "

Van Crashes Then Tons Or People Run Out Of It
More 4 plans to make its first original comedy series , picking up the David Cross sitcom The Increasingly Poor Decisions Of Todd Margaret .
A pilot aired during Channel 4 ’s Comedy Showcase season in November , and now the digital sister channel is reportedly in talks with a US co-producer to bring it to a full six part - series .
Arrested Development star Cross , who co-wrote the show with Shaun Pye , plays the title character : a hapless American office drone who flukes his way into a top management job in Britain .
Fellow cast members including Sharon Horgan , Russell Tovey and Will Arnett are set to return for the full season .
Channel 4 comedy head Shane Allen told trade magazine Broadcast that More 4 was the show ’s natural home , alongside Curb Your Enthusiasm .
He said : ‘ It ’s a real passion piece for David , who ’s been feverishly writing away since the pilot . ’
It is not the only Comedy Showcase pilot to have been picked up .
The university - set Campus , from by Green Wing creator Victoria Pile , is to be extended from the half - hour format into six 45 - minute episodes to air this autumn .
Allen told Broadcast : ‘ It felt constrained as a 30 - minute sitcom . ’
Fellow Comedy Showcases Pete v Life and Phoneshop have already been picked up for series by Channel 4 and E4 respectively .
Channel 4 has now commissioned all its comedy shows for 2010 .
Here is a clip from The Increasingly Poor Decisions Of Todd Margaret

The popularity of Blu-ray players appears to be rising , just a year after doubters predicted that the devices -- which launched three years ago for $ 800 - $ 1,000 each -- would fade into oblivion because of their marginal improvement over standard DVD players .
Much of that negative thinking has changed , and as you might expect , it has a lot to do with the plummeting cost of buying a Blu-ray player .
Blu-ray Price Drop One of Many in Tech Market
When the devices first launched three years ago , many cost nearly $ 1,000 -- a lot of money for most U.S. families , even in a pre-recession North America .
Compounding that concern over price was the fear that rival high definition video format HD - DVD might win a bitter fight that continued until 2007 .
Even more troubling was the price of HDTVs , which until late last year were still very expensive to buy .
Thankfully , not only have Blu-ray players dropped in price , but so too have HDTVs .
A 40 " 1080 p high definition television can be had for around $ 500 - $ 600 right now , and with the advent of budget - priced Blu-ray players like the Insignia NS - WBRDVD ( available for about $ 180 ) , the cost of investing in an HD - infused home theatre is dropping big time this holiday season .

New Features Reinvigorate Once - Troubled Blu-ray
Helping Blu-ray to succeed are new players , many of which cost less than $ 200 , that offer unique and very useful features .
Some of these include the ability to stream content from the Internet , such as through online rental company Netflix Inc.
Users can also stream TV shows and movies through Google 's YouTube and Pandora .
The proof of Blu-ray 's rising popularity is right there in the sales figures : according to research analysts NPD Group Inc. , Blu-ray players jumped 53 per cent in total sales over 2009's Black Friday shopping bonanza compared to the same day last year .
Another research firm , IDC , predicts that about nine million Blu-ray players will ship this year , an increase of 54 per cent over 2008 .

Sony's PS3 Help Put Blu-ray on the Map
Part of the reason for Blu-ray 's success must be attributed to the video game industry .
Even when it appeared as though Blu-ray would n't make it past rival HD - DVD , Sony 's inclusion of a Blu-ray player in its PlayStation 3 helped put the format on the map .
Blu -ray may have never survived the opening format war or the fallout of HD - DVD 's decline were it not for Sony .
At $ 299 , it 's worth noting that the PlayStation 3 still represents one of the more economical options for upgrading from standard definition DVD .
As deaths in Haiti approach a quarter of a million and misery , violence , sickness , homelessness , and pestilence rule the streets of Port - au - Prince , only CNN does n't avert its eyes .
Americans would rather watch aid concerts , a few happy orphans being brought to the United Sates , and the occasional individuals rescued from the rubble that covers much of the city .
But kudos to CNN - we need to confront the reality of the situation " on the ground . "
The Stanton Peele Addiction Website , January 24 , 2010 .
This blog post also appeared on Stanton 's Addiction in Society blog at PsychologyToday.com .
The Unbearable Heaviness of Truth
If you watch network and cable news , you see the rescue of a few survivors from the rubble in Haiti , the smiling orphans brought to the United States ( along with press conferences by the politicians and orphanage executives who brought them here ) , the resilience of the Haitian people , the generosity of Americans , the devotion of international aid forces .
But that 's not the truth - or certainly not the majority of the truth .
We know this because the Haitian government now estimates that there have been over 100,000 deaths due to the earthquake - and the dying continues .
For the truth , you must watch CNN , most notably Cooper Anderson and medical director Sanjay Gupta ( whom the Obama administration wanted to serve as Surgeon General )
It 's as though CNN occupies a different reality from NBC , Fox , et al .
Their coverage is almost unbearable .
Cooper has covered rioting and looting - in one incident , a boy was hit by a rock thrown from a rooftop , and Cooper carried him , bleeding heavily , to safety - otherwise it appears the boy would have died in the street .
Cooper describes watching the dead being carried to graveyards , where crypts are broken open and bodies stacked in piles .
Sanjay Gupta describes at first being unable to register the sight of dead bodies everywhere upon entering Port - au - Prince .
Both he and Cooper have been shocked at the " stupid deaths " - people dying who could readily be saved by basic medical care .
Gupta and his crew watched - unbelievingly - as doctors simply deserted a facility they had set up , leaving the injured and dying patients to their own devices !
( Gupta and his crew stepped in to do what they could . )
" My faith in humanity has been completely trashed , " Gupta declared .
He noted miserably , " There is so much medical aid in the city - but it 's stuck at the airport . "
He and his crew actually went to the airport to fetch and distribute supplies themselves .
Other CNN correspondents have presented no less unflinching reports .
One heard shots , and saw two police shooting two young men they had in custody .
But one boy , as he lay dying ( was his life less valuable than the young man recently rescued from building debris ? ) , denied the accusation that he had looted , and a bystander supported his claim .
This reporter showed some of the families ( 600,000 Haitians have been displaced ) with their few possessions , their lives entirely destroyed , wandering like zombies through the streets .
Another CNN reporter described bringing water to a girl whom he watched die from her injuries and resulting infections .
" I 'll always wonder if there was more that I could have done . "
Yet another described children crying at the sight of the dead on the street .
He also showed sick and dying survivors of a collapsed nursing home , demented elderly people living in the street in soiled diapers .
As we watch celebrities perform at concerts and donate money for supplies to be sent to Haiti , CNN shows that , when food is delivered , strong young men push women and children to the ground and take food from the trucks .
A CNN reporter saw a distribution truck abandon starving people to escape the violence - a symbol of the futility of our happy delusion that we are helping Haitians .
What 's the matter with CNN - do n't they know Americans are sensitive souls who do n't like to watch suffering ?
We want to focus on happy events .
Of course , no one is immune to the charm of the man emerging after 12 days buried in a collapsed building .
Keep in mind that he was only saved because his brother , who heard his voice , persisted for days in seeking help - which finally was made possible when a Greek reporter took up his cause .
Is there a better way to do this ?
Gupta's - and CNN's - wrenching honesty is hard for any human being to watch .
But it is a necessary precursor to improving how we deal with this tragedy and future ones - because what we 're doing is n't working well .
Thank God he - and CNN - remain to do this thankless , horrifying reporting .
" We , the members of the Tea Party movement , you , the members of this movement , have come to take our government back from the special interests , from the lobbyists , from the pork barrel politicians who continue to spend our country into oblivion . "
I have decided , after much thoughtful deliberation , to leave the GOP after 15 years of activism and campaign involvement at all levels .
My political career began as a highschool student , where I served as the state chair of the Teenage Republicans .
Since then , I have consistently continued my involvement by working both as a volunteer and as staff in Republican organizations and campaigns .
This step , therefore , is not taken lightly , but I deem it morally necessary .
After all , it was Rand Paul who caused me to " see the light " about Mitch McConnell and the GOP establishment , both of whom Rand has now forbidden campaign members and grassroots supporters to attack .
Rand now says he can't win by attacking McConnell .
Rand has changed his message of reform , so I can not be further involved in this effort with a clear conscience .
If we are not working to reform the GOP , we are only helping the establishment .
Teabaggers and even libertarians are starting to get fed up with Rand Paul as he 's become a more serious contender for the open Kentucky Senate seat .
Remember , the undisputed boss of Kentucky 's Republican Party machine , Mitch " Miss " McConnell , cynically maneuvered incumbent Jim Bunning out of his re-election bid in favor of his hapless protégé , Secretary of State Trey Grayson .
But with Rand Paul , the son of the anti-Establishment firebrand Ron Paul , absolutelythe bloodless , vapid and colorless Grayson , McConnell and Paul seem to have come to an accord .
Two radical right teabagger types have resigned from Paul 's campaign in the last 2 weeks , key supporter and accused racist Christopher Hightower and lunatic fringe Christi Gillespie , who claimed it was " morally necessary " to resign because Paul has prohibited campaign staffers and his supporters from attacking the Republican Party or GOP Sen .
Mitch McConnell .
Paul , who , like his dad , appeals to anti-tax fanatics ( as well as angry , pissed - off - at - everything teabaggers ) has raised a huge amount of grassroots money -- close to $ 2 million so far -- from donors who , basically , are enamoured of his anti-tax , Ayn Randian platform .
( He was named for Ayn Rand . )
Although he 's backing away from criticizing the ultimate Establishment Insider , Miss McConnell , he 's still trying to rally teabaggers by claiming " career politicians " have sold taxpayers " down the river . "
Last week at a press conference on McConnell 's turf -- the Kentucky Republican Party headquarters in Louisville -- Paul played up to teabaggers : According to the most recent poll ( December 22 ) by PPP , Paul is leading Grayson 44 - 25 % among likely GOP primary voters .
Grayson has a slighter better lead among Republican moderates but among hard core rightists , Paul is winning 47 - 20 % .
" Paul is having a particularly good amount of success with folks who think that the Republican Party in Washington has become too liberal - his lead with them is 54 - 18 . "
He seems determined to also appeal to the corrupt and clueless Republican Party establishment and their mindless followers .
Here 's an excerpt from Gillespie 's resignation letter last week , as she explained why she has re-registered as a Libertarian :

Ahmad Chalabi , the onetime Pentagon darling who helped the Bush administration make the case for invading Iraq , is in a good mood as he settles into the back seat of his armored SUV to head out on the campaign trail .
He ought to be .
As chief architect of the move to disqualify hundreds of candidates accused of ties to the outlawed Baath Party , Chalabi has defined the agenda for the upcoming Iraqi national elections .
In doing so , he has thwarted five years of U.S. policy in Iraq aimed at reconciling the Sunni and Shiite Muslim sects and gotten his revenge against America for dumping him as its favorite back in 2004 .
Now , with events all going his way , the former exile has a good chance of reentering parliament as a leading candidate for the main Shiite coalition , and perhaps to secure a top job in the next Iraqi government .
Chalabi , a secular Shiite , does n’t downplay the significance of his estranged American allies ’ failure to get the disbarments , mainly of Sunni Arab and secular candidates , overturned .
“ It ’s a watershed , ” he says , citing the intense U.S. diplomatic efforts aimed at persuading Iraqis to allow the barred candidates to run , including an intervention by Vice President Joe Biden .
“ It became evident to the people that on a critical issue the will of the Iraqis prevailed over the desire of the Americans . ”
Some would go further , and cast the events of the last few weeks as a victory for Iran ’s will over that of America .
The top U.S. commander in Iraq , Army Gen. Ray T. Odierno , fumed in Washington this month that he had evidence that both Chalabi and Ali Lami , his right - hand man at the anti-Baath commission , are directly influenced by Iran .
Chalabi , once the choice of Washington neoconservatives to run Iraq , acknowledges having “ many friends ” in Tehran , just as most of Iraq ’s current top Shiite leaders do .
But he denies acting on behalf of Iran .
It is clear , however , that Chalabi ’s role as chairman of the Accountability and Justice Commission , the body charged with purging Baathists from public life , has given an enormous boost to his political fortunes just as Iraq is heading into crucial elections .
That is something Chalabi , 65 , does n’t deny .
Gripping the handle on the roof of his SUV as his 12 - vehicle convoy veers wildly through Baghdad ’s dense traffic , he identifies de-Baathification as the top issue on which his election campaign will focus .
Iraq ’s Shiite majority , whose votes Chalabi is courting as a candidate for the Iraqi National Alliance , remains deeply embittered by the memory of Saddam Hussein ’s brutal Sunni Arab - led regime .
Shiites , he says , were only waiting for someone to reverse the last several years of efforts to reintegrate former Baathists into public life .
The U.S. had initially dissolved and banned the Baath Party and forbidden senior members from public sector employment .
It also formed the first de-Baathification panel in 2003 , with Chalabi as head , before changing its stance .
But Iraqi officials , including Chalabi , resisted efforts to disband the commission and continued the de-Baathification efforts .
“ There was a ready - made public opinion which required leadership to express itself and the U.S. underestimated that , ” Chalabi says .
“ On the issue of the Baath , I do n’t think anyone can match me . ”
The heavily protected convoy leaves behind the paved highways of central Baghdad and starts bumping along a rutted track .
Chalabi ’s destination on this day is a place called Maamel , a forgotten Shiite slum on the easternmost edges of the capital where the roads are unpaved , the taps run dry and people live crowded together in poorly constructed concrete huts .
“ Look at how they live , ” he says , gesturing toward the dusty , garbage - strewn landscape .
“ There are millions of people in Iraq living like this . ”
The Shiite poor are a constituency that Chalabi has earnestly been courting since his humiliating failure to win a parliamentary seat in the last elections , in December 2005 .
Then , his Iraqi National Congress Party ran alone , its defeat demonstrating that in decades of opposing Hussein ’s regime he had failed to develop a key ingredient of success in even the most rudimentary of democracies : popular support .
That embarrassment compounded the indignity of his fallout with his former American friends in 2004 .
After introducing the Bush administration to informants on Hussein ’s purported weapons of mass destruction program , Chalabi had been tipped to lead Iraq ’s first post - occupation government .
Instead , U.S. officials say , he was caught passing information to Iran , which Chalabi denies .
The U.S. military raided his home , he was ostracized , and in his place , the U.S. appointed a political rival , Iyad Allawi , as prime minister .
But though Chalabi was down , he was never quite out .
He remained in the country , unlike many other elected politicians , and was put in charge of delivering services to Baghdad , giving him the opportunity to press flesh and pound pavements in some of the most downtrodden Shiite communities .
This , he says , is his fourth visit to Maamel in recent years , a fact that he impresses upon the audience of about 100 tribesmen and unemployed youths awaiting him outside a small mosque .
Giant portraits of the fiery Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr adorn the mosque walls in Maamel , a Sadr stronghold .
The chances are high that these people will vote for a pro-Sadr candidate , and not the urbane , silver - haired politician who addresses them in a navy blue suit .
But the Sadr supporters , with whom Chalabi has warm relations , are running as part of the Shiite alliance , and under Iraq ’s system of proportional representation , a vote for them will also help him .
Should the major Shiite parties be unable to agree on a candidate for prime minister , there ’s even a chance Chalabi could emerge as a compromise choice , diplomats say .
It ’s an outside shot .
Chalabi remains a controversial figure , and there ’s still scant evidence that he has popular support .
On the streets of central Baghdad , many Iraqis are dismissive of his prospects .
“ I feel he ’s sectarian , ” said Islam Adel , 28 , who otherwise supports the Shiite alliance .
But Chalabi is trying hard .
As the sun sets over the little mosque in Maamel , he delivers his stump speech , focusing on his “ victory ” as the man who banned the Baathist candidates , and promising more purges of former Baathists from public life .
“ Therefore I call for your support , for preventing the return of the Baathists , ” he says , before adding a final , ominous - sounding pledge to his Shiite audience , one that leaves little doubt as to the tone of his campaign .
“ We support your sect and we will protect it , ” he says , before being hustled back into his vehicle by his bodyguards for the journey home through the slum , now shrouded in darkness .

Caesar Ahmed of The Times ’ Baghdad Bureau contributed to this report .
We have been warned .
Prepare for a broader war in the Middle East , as plans are being laid for the next U.S. - led regime change  in Syria .
A UN report on the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri elicited this comment from a senior U.S. policymaker : “ Out of tragedy comes an extraordinary strategic opportunity . ”
This statement reflects the continued neoconservative , Machiavellian influence on our foreign policy .
The “ opportunity ” refers to the long - held neoconservative plan for regime change in Syria , similar to what was carried out in Iraq .
This plan for remaking the Middle East has been around for a long time .
Just as 9/11 served the interests of those who longed for changes in Iraq , the sensationalism surrounding Hariri ’s death is being used to advance plans to remove Assad .
Congress already has assisted these plans by authorizing the sanctions placed on Syria last year .
Harmful sanctions , as applied to Iraq in the 1990s , inevitably represent a major step toward war since they bring havoc to so many innocent people .
Syria already has been charged with developing weapons of mass destruction based on no more evidence than was available when Iraq was similarly charged .
Syria has been condemned for not securing its borders , by the same U.S. leaders who cannot secure our own borders .
Syria was castigated for placing its troops in Lebanon , a neighboring country , although such action was invited by an elected government and encouraged by the United States .
The Syrian occupation of Lebanon elicited no suicide terrorist attacks , as was suffered by Western occupiers .
Condemning Syria for having troops in Lebanon seems strange , considering most of the world sees our 150,000 troops in Iraq as an unwarranted foreign occupation .
Syrian troops were far more welcome in Lebanon .
Secretary Rice likewise sees the problems in Syria  that we helped to create  as an opportunity to advance our Middle Eastern agenda .
In recent testimony , she stated that it was always the administration ’s intent to redesign the greater Middle East , and Iraq was only one part of that plan .
And once again we have been told that all options are still on the table for dealing with Syria  including war .
The statement that should scare all Americans ( and the world ) is the assurance by Secretary Rice that the president needs no additional authority from Congress to attack Syria .
She argues that authority already has been granted by the resolutions on 9/11 and Iraq .
This is not true , but if Congress remains passive to the powers assumed by the executive branch it wo n’t matter .
As the war spreads , the only role for Congress will be to provide funding lest they be criticized for not supporting the troops .
In the meantime , the Constitution and our liberties here at home will be further eroded as more Americans die .
This escalation of conflict with Syria comes as a result of the UN report concerning the Hariri death .
When we need an excuse for our actions , it ’s always nice to rely on the organization that our administration routinely condemns , one that brought us the multi-billion dollar oil - for - food scandal and sexual crimes by UN representatives .
It ’s easy to ignore the fact that the report did not implicate Assad , who is targeted for the next regime change .
The UN once limited itself to disputes between nations ; yet now it ’s assumed the UN , like the United States , has a legal and moral right to inject itself into the internal policies of sovereign nations .
Yet what is the source of this presumed wisdom ?
Where is the moral imperative that allows us to become the judge and jury of a domestic murder in a country 6,000 miles from our shores ?
Moral , constitutional , and legal arguments for a less aggressive foreign policy receive little attention in Washington .
But the law of unintended consequences serves as a thorough teacher for the slow learners and the morally impaired .
Is Iraq not yet enough of a headache for the braggarts of the shock and awe policy ?
Are 2,000 lives lost not enough to get their attention ?
How many hundreds of billions of dollars must be drained from our economy before it ’s noticed ?
Is it still plausible that deficits do n’t matter ?
Is the apparent victory for Iran in the Shi’ite theocracy we ’ve created in Iraq not yet seen as a disturbing consequence of the ill - fated Iraq regime - change effort ?
When we have our way with the next election in Lebanon and Hezbollah wins , what do we do ?
If our effort to destabilize Syria is no more successful than our efforts in Iraq , then what ?
If destabilizing Syria leads to the same in Iran , what are our options ?
If we ca n’t leave now , we ’ll surely not leave then  we ’ll be told we must stay to honor the fallen to prove the cause was just .
We should remember Ronald Reagan ’s admonition regarding this area of the world .
Ronald Reagan reflected on Lebanon in his memoirs , describing the Middle East as a jungle and Middle East politics as irrational .
It forced him to rethink his policy in the region .
It ’s time we do some rethinking as well .
