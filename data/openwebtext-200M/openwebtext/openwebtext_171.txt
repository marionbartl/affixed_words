BRANFORD , Fla . —
“ Lots of artillery out there , ” an old man hollered from the safety of the Suwannee River ’s edge , and he was right .
The sturgeon were jumping high and fast , twisting their armored girth in midair and returning to the depths with a stunning splash .
On the water , there was reason to be anxious .
Florida ’s season of “ sturgeon strikes ” — law enforcement ’s term for collisions between the state ’s largest freshwater fish and hapless boaters — was already well under way .
It may seem bizarre , but it is no joke .
Leaping sturgeon have injured three people on the Suwannee this year , including a woman on a Jet Ski and a girl whose leg was shattered when one of the giant fish jumped aboard her boat .
Eight others were hit last year , and with traffic growing on the storied river , sturgeon are joining alligators and hurricanes on the list of things to dread in Florida .
“ These injuries are very impressive , ” said Dr. Lawrence Lottenberg , director of trauma surgery at the University of Florida College of Medicine in nearby Gainesville .
“ You ’ve got people sitting on the front of an open boat , and the boat is going 20 , 30 , 40 miles per hour .
The fish jumps up and usually slaps these people right across their face and upper chest .
Almost every one of them universally has been knocked unconscious .
If you ’re not wearing a life jacket , you ’re going to fall in the water and potentially drown . ”
Too much is j u s t right ...

Author Jack Kerouac relaxes at a friend 's home in Lowell , Massachusetts . *
Photo : AP / Stanley Twardowicz * Sal Paradise knew what it meant to be young , with no money in your pockets but no obligations either , completely at loose ends .
It meant you were free .
Even if you were also a bit lost .
Paradise is the autobiographical protagonist in On the Road , Jack Kerouac 's exuberant , stream - of - consciousness novel that celebrates its 50th anniversary next week .
With shiftless soulmate Dean Moriarty ( based on Kerouac 's own real - life pal Neal Cassady ) leading the way , Paradise crisscrosses America on the ultimate road trip , a pursuit of enlightenment and kicks splashed across a canvas of easy sex and dago red nights with some poetry and bennies thrown in and a cool solo saxophone playing in the background .
On the Road has spoken to every generation since it appeared , and it 's still got plenty to say in a society where consumer conformity is sold as rebellion by savvy marketers and the tyranny of the pop-culture machine smothers any truly iconoclastic voice .
Although not published until 1957 , the book was set in the late ' 40s and written in the early ' 50s – then , as now , troubled , conflicted times in the United States .
On the one hand , this country had emerged from World War II as its clearest winner .
We were , by far , the richest , most powerful nation on earth .
But then the Russians got the bomb , and we all got scared .
All those backyard bomb shelters aside , though , we had plenty of our own demons to deal with right here .
The war may have established American hegemony , but it also shook the country 's social structure to its core .
Women who had tasted the workplace for the first time were now sent home , as the men came back to reclaim their jobs .
A lot of those gals did n't want to go , and a lot of the boys coming home decided that " home " was n't necessarily where they wanted to be : Soldiers and sailors had discovered that an entire world existed outside the confines of their hometowns .
Blacks who had left the largely rural South during the war , looking for work in northern factories and shipyards , found themselves marooned in urban ghettos , feared and despised .
A largely static , stifled prewar population had scattered to the four winds .
The '50s , to a large extent , were about the establishment trying to stuff the toothpaste back into the tube .
In the end , it could n't be done .
The result was a creeping estrangement between the old order and a growing number of Americans who felt alienated in their own country .
The Beat movement was a conspicuous manifestation of this alienation , and if Allen Ginsberg was its literary heart , Kerouac was its soul .
On the Road was – and remains today – an eloquent , if unpolished , anthem for the dispossessed , the outsider , the one who does n't quite fit in .
Kerouac himself never fit in , although he spent a good part of his life trying to .
He died young and unhappy , but to measure
On the Road against the bitterness of its author 's life is to miss the point .
The novel is about the yearning for freedom .
What you do with that freedom once you 've attained it ... well , that 's up to you .
It was then .
It is now .
Whether Kerouac was a " great " writer is certainly debatable ( define " great , " for starters ) ; that he was one of America 's most influential writers is beyond dispute .
On the Road , at 50 , sells more copies in a given year than most new fiction does , so it evidently still strikes a chord somewhere .
Kerouac gets kicked around pretty good in academia and by other writers , mostly East Coast snoots who wrinkle their noses at the idea of automatic writing .
It was Truman Capote , remember , who dismissed Kerouac with one of the bitchiest literary putdowns of all time : " That 's not writing , that 's typing . "
Without a doubt , writing on a scroll in a nonstop , three - week frenzy of Benzedrine - fueled inspiration does n't represent the height of literary craft .
But
On the Road is a banshee cry for freedom , not pop literature , so in this case Kerouac 's improvisation thoroughly guts Capote 's measured prose .
While you 're digesting that morsel , try this one :
On the Road is as deserving of a place in the geek 's literary canon as anything penned by Tolkien , Gibson or Dick .
Kerouac did n't invent alien civilizations or futuristic worlds , but he helped break down the walls of convention in the real one .
If the modern geek is the maverick he often claims to be , then he owes at least a cursory nod backward to a genuine maverick , one who helped pave the way while on a hopeless struggle to find himself .
Fifty years along ,
On the Road still resonates for those of us possessed of a restless spirit , who see gray conformity as spiritual death , who place the value of the individual above the mere possession of things .
For us , Sal Paradise 's odyssey stands as the antidote – and as a warning to keep a close watch on our souls .

Internet Smackdown : The Amateur vs. the Professional
Suddenly , the Paranoids Don't Seem So Paranoid Anymore
By Duncan Kennedy
BBC News , Mexico
Protesters took the streets on Monday
They acted after unidentified gunmen opened fire on a government radio station already under their control .
The strikers used the stations to tell parents to ignore Monday 's start of the school year and keep children at home .
Teachers have been striking since May to demand higher wages and Oaxaca Governor Ulises Ruiz 's resignation .
Roads blocked
The shooting began at a government - owned radio station already in the hands of the striking teachers .
Striking teachers set buses on fire on Monday
The attack prompted a violent retaliation by the teachers , and a number of buses were overturned and set on fire .
Dozens of the protesters also took over the privately - run radio stations and started broadcasting messages of defiance .
Others armed with crude weapons blocked off some of the main roads into Oaxaca .
A spokesman for President Vicente Fox blamed the state government for attempting to take back the radio station by force .
He said the attack was carried out without consulting the federal authorities and described it as a unilateral decision by the governor of Oaxaca , Ulises Ruiz .
Widening protest
Governor Ruiz has become a key target for the teachers .
Although their dispute started out in May as a campaign for more pay , it has since transformed into an attempt to get the governor to resign from office .
The teachers say he is guilty of rigging the state election two years ago and of using heavy - handed tactics to deal with the strikers .
The governor , who belongs to the former ruling party , the PRI , has refused to step down .
Last week a number of people were taken hostage by activists after gunmen opened fired on a teachers ' march .
They were later released .
The protests have also taken on a much wider context and have become woven into the continuing row over who won Mexico 's presidential election .
Four months into this round of tension and parts of Oaxaca are starting to look ungovernable , and that could be a real challenge for the country 's new leader .
Nobody wants to see its animal sick .
But just like us , they can get health problems and each particular breed of dogs has its own [… ]
Jim and Robyn Dahlin knew replacing the roof of their home in Greenbrae , Calif. , would be expensive .
But they had n't planned to spend an extra $ 15,000 on solar panels .
For that , they have their 8 - year - old son , Luke , to thank .
After Luke acted in a school play about global warming , he went on a campaign to get his parents to install the panels .
He routinely lectured his dad from the backseat of the minivan about how reducing their energy consumption could help save the planet .
Mr ....
Is a computer worth more to a company than a female executive who makes six figures and has loads of client relationships ?
It might be , according to a New York Times
article on Sylvia Ann Hewlett ’s recent book , “ Off - Ramps and On - Ramps , ”
about women re-entering the workforce after time off to care for children , parents or other reasons .
“ If a $ 2,000 desktop computer disappears from an employee ’s desk , I
guarantee that there ’ll be an investigation , ” Maury Hanigan , a
consultant , tells Dr. Hewlett , adding that “ if a $ 100,000 - a- year
executive with all kinds of client relationships ” quits “ to stay home
with the kids — there ’s no investigation . ”
Corporate Giants Lead the Way
According to a blog - post by Hewlett at The Huffington Post :
Do You Know What You 're Worth ?
GET A FREE PAY REPORT
At the heart of the challenge is a “ male competitive model ” that evolved to fit the life rhythms of middle class while males in the 1950s and 1960s — decades when access to well - paying jobs was primarily limited to this privileged group .
The success of this model relied on a traditional division of labor between men and women — men were breadwinners , women were homemakers — and two key characteristics : a strong preference for cumulative , lockstep careers and a continuous linear employment history ; and the expectation that the steepest gradient of a career occurs in the decade of one ’s thirties .
That is the time when an ambitious professional either “ catches a wave ” or does n’t .
There are no second chances .
While this career model suited the needs of Jack Welch and his peers , it ’s exceedingly problematic for women .
Not that some women did n’t and do n’t bend their lives to fit into the constraints of this male model .
A minority of them do .
But a majority either can’t , or do n’t choose to .
It seems we ’re just beginning to move our workforce away from an outdated structure .
It ’s about time .
Some corporate giants like Ernst & Young , Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs are leading the way , Hewlett ’s research shows , offering on - ramping workers flexible setups .
This is more proof that flexible work is becoming the coin of the workaday realm .
On her blog at Harvard Business Online Hewlett explains :
They ’re doing this because a “ war for talent ” is heating up .
The danger signals are everywhere : a recent study by the Washington - based Corporate Executive board found that the quality of candidates has declined 10 % since 2004 , but starting salaries for newly minted MBAs have increased 17 % and signing bonuses have proliferated .
Add in the fact that growth rates are robust — particularly in Asia — and it ’s easy to see why companies are newly in the business of wooing female talent .
And in the book Hewlett writes :
This shift is being driven by two factors .
First , business leaders are newly aware of just how many talented women are being forced off the career track .
New data–much of which I have helped develop–shows that two - thirds of highly qualified women either leave the workforce or languish on the sidelines .
Second , demographic and other structural shifts are giving an urgent edge to this challenge of better utilizing women .
Baby busts and global expansion mean that companies these days are heavily reliant on female talent .
As Isaacs [ Jeremy Isaacs , Lehman Brothers ’ CEO for Europe and Asia ] pointed out , it ’s a question of competitive strength and economic survival .
Employers are beginning to feel the squeeze for talent , driving increased flexibility and attention to on - ramping women .
Earlier this year a source told me employers would become more flexible when it suited them .
I think that ’s true .
While I ’d like to believe employers are suddenly becoming enlightened , that we ’re in the midst of an American workplace renaissance –I ’m just glad the road is beginning to rise a bit , and meet women where we are .
The more that happens , the more our nation stands to gain .
It ’s Broken , But There ’s No Rush to Fix It
The first chapter in Hewlett ’s book , “ Why Mess with the Male Competitive Model ? ” offers her theory about why the male competitive model–broken , as far as many women are concerned –has n’t yet been fixed :
The Overall Narrative :
Every good story has a theme .
When millions of voters go to the polls and make their choices for public offices , they often have a 15 - 60 second narrative in their minds that dictate their choice .
Republicans have done a tremendous job of creative false themes which only gain traction when Democratics cowtow to those themes or remain silent .
( False themes can also backfire if people can point out concrete facts and anecdotals which ridicule those themes . )
You can be the brightest bulb in the closet or have every fact on your side but if you can't appeal to people 's emotions / heart , your knowledge is worthless .
The following three narratives must be used to describe Republicans .
( And they are accurate . )
Republicans have a long history of failed foreign policies which makes America less safe and less secure .
They put wealthy corporate money interests ahead of national security , the needs of the military , and the safety interests of Americans .
You can't trust Republicans to keep Americans safe .
Every single foreign policy issue ( Iraq , terrorism , the military , health care for the troops , etc ... ) can be woven into this simple three sentence frame .
And there are a million plus facts that back it all up .
But you get nowhere citing those facts in isolation .
You need this narrative first .
Republicans do not value our freedoms and our Constitution .
On social issue after social issues , Republicans prefer to have big government bureaucrats determining what individuals can or can not do instead of trusting and permitting individuals to make free , harmless choices which do n't affect others .
When it comes to issues of justice and fairness , Republicans have the crass mentality that wrongdoings are okay if you are a Republican while simultaneously using the mechanisms of government to unfairly punish people who do n't cowtow to the right wing company line .
Because of this disdain for individual freedoms , Republicans often resort to hate and bigotry by trying to exclude people from the American dream .
Each of the hot button social issues are framed by me in terms of values and freedom .
Republicans can never win that debate .
Republicans believe in an elitist two class society which helps the top 1 % but hurts the bottom 99 % .
The conservative class warfare society denies people opportunities , punishes hard work , and is contrary to the American spirit and American way of life .
This two sentence frame covers education , the environment , health care , Hurrican Katrina , bridges , taxes , etc .
Phrases like voucher schemes , corporatized medicine , anti-environmentalism , etc ... all fit within this narrative .
Three simple narrative frames .
60 seconds or less .
And we 'll win millions of new voters by using them .
I spend a lot of time on the phone every day here at Dell in the Austin call center in the customer care department .
We get some of the craziest calls from our customers but this one needed posting , it begged for it .... okay ... so here it is ... i am on the phone with this guy for like 25 minutes .
he was calling about buying more ram and was trying to get me to diagnose his computer problems and why it has become slow lately ... so whatever ... then he starts talking about how he thinks his wife screwed up the computer and how he thinks he really does n't need ram , but that there may be a virus on the computer ... then he goes into how his wife may have given HIM a virus too ... at first i did n't catch it ... but he started talking about how she came home from work late like two weeks ago and how she never comes home late - on account of the kids ... she was very frisky and so they had sex and since then they had sex a few times and to cut a long story short ... lately he has been itching down there .
he told ME this - did I mention that I am a customer care rep at Dell ??
I stopped him ... and told him i was sorry about his situation and encouraged him to download trend micro to see if he had a virus on his computer - he did n't get the hint ... well ... and it turns out that his wife walked into the room while he was describing his " virus " to me ... she asked him - who are you talking to ?
and he said - oh nobody its about the computer - and she said - but you just said you were itching - you told the computer guy that ???
apparently she did n't hear that he told me that he thinks she was sleeping around ... well he fixed that .
he says ... yeah and i told him how i think i got the itches .
i heard a gasp on the other end of the phone ... and he starts laughing and goes on about something ... a minute later i hear these crashing sounds and his wife screaming " you asshole ... you asshole .. you asshole ! " i stayed on the phone to see if i could hear anything ... and like two minutes later he gets back on the phone and says i guess i do n't need help with the virus anymore .
turns out she came back with a baseball bat and took apart the computer piece by piece .
i guess he was luck it was not his head .
Conversation with Kip Hawley , TSA Administrator ( Part 4 )
This is Part 4 of a five - part series .
Link to whole thing .
BS : What about Registered Traveler ?
When TSA first started talking about the program , the plan was to divide people into two categories : more trusted people who get less screening , and less trusted people who get more screening .
This opened an enormous security hole ; whenever you create an easy way and a hard way through security , you invite the bad guys to take the easier way .
Since then , it ’s transformed into a way for people to pay for better screening equipment and faster processing — a great idea with no security downsides .
Given that , why bother with the background checks at all ?
What else is it besides a way for a potential terrorist to spend $ 60 and find out if the government is on to them ?
KH : Registered Traveler ( RT ) is a promising program but suffers from unrealistic expectations .
The idea — that you and I are n’t really risks and we should be screened less so that TSA can apply scarce resources on the more likely terrorist — makes sense and got branded as RT .
The problem is that with two million people a day , how can we tell them apart in an effective way ?
We know terrorists use people who are not on watch lists and who do n’t have criminal convictions , so we ca n’t use those criteria alone .
Right now , I ’ve said that RT is behind Secure Flight in priority and that TSA is open to working with private sector entities to facilitate RT , but we will not fund it , reduce overall security , or inconvenience regular travelers .
As private companies deploy extra security above what TSA does , we can change the screening process accordingly .
It has to be more than a front - of - the - line pass , and I think there are some innovations coming out in the year ahead that will better define what RT can become .
BS : Let ’s talk about behavioral profiling .
I ’ve long thought that most of airline security could be ditched in favor of well - trained guards , both in and out of uniform , wandering the crowds looking for suspicious behavior .
Can you talk about some of the things you ’re doing along those lines , and especially ways to prevent this from turning into just another form of racial profiling ?
KH : Moving security out from behind the checkpoint is a big priority for us .
First , it gives us the opportunity to pick up a threat a lot earlier .
Taking away weapons or explosives at the checkpoint is stopping the plot at nearly the last possible moment .
Obviously , a good security system aims at stopping attacks well before that .
That ’s why we have many layers of security ( intel , law enforcement , behavior detection , etc. ) to get to that person well before the security checkpoint .
When a threat gets to the checkpoint , we ’re operating on his / her terms — they pick when , where , and how they present themselves to us .
We want to pick up the cues on our terms , before they ’re ready , even if they ’re just at the surveillance stage .
We use a system of behavior observation that is based on the science that demonstrates that there are certain involuntary , subconscious actions that can betray a person ’s hostile intent .
For instance , there are tiny — but noticeable to the trained person — movements in a person ’s facial muscles when they have certain emotions .
It is very different from the stress we all show when we ’re anxious about missing the flight due to , say , a long security line .
This is true across race , gender , age , ethnicity , etc .
It is our way of not falling into the trap where we predict what a terrorist is going to look like .
We know they use people who “ look like ” terrorists , but they also use people who do not , perhaps thinking that we cue only off of what the 9/11 hijackers looked like .
Our Behavior Detection teams routinely — and quietly — identify problem people just through observable behavior cues .
More than 150 people have been identified by our teams , turned over to law enforcement , and subsequently arrested .
This layer is invisible to the public , but do n’t discount it , because it may be the most effective .
We publicize non-terrorist - related successes like a murder suspect caught in Minneapolis and a bank robber caught in Philadelphia .
Most common are people showing phony documents , but we have even picked out undercover operatives — including our own .
One individual , identified by a TSO in late May and not allowed to fly , was killed in a police shoot - out five days later .
Additionally , several individuals have been of interest from the counter - terrorism perspective .
With just this limited deployment of Behavior Detection Officers ( BDOs ) , we have identified more people of counterterrorism interest than all the people combined caught with prohibited items .
Look for us to continue to look at ways that highlight problem people rather than just problem objects .
BS : That ’s really good news , and I think it ’s the most promising new security measure you ’ve got .
Although , honestly , bragging about capturing a guy for wearing a fake military uniform just makes you look silly .

When Matej Kus 's teammates heard him talking after he was knocked out in a speedway accident , they were relieved he was conscious .
But they were also a little surprised .
For although the 18 - year - old Czech knew only the most basic English phrases , he was conversing fluently in the language with paramedics .
Scroll down for more ...
Peter Waite , the promoter for Kus 's team , the Berwick Bandits , said : " I could n't believe what I was hearing .
" It was in a really clear English accent , no dialect or anything .
Whatever happened in the crash must have rearranged things in his head .
" Before his crash Matej 's use of the English language was broken , to put it mildly .
" He was only just making a start on improving it and struggled to be understood , but was keen to learn .
" Yet here we were at the ambulance door listening to Matej talking to the medical staff in perfect English .
" Matej did n't have a clue who or where he was when he came round .
He did n't even know he was Czech .
" It was unbelievable to hear him talk in unbroken English . "
Alas , Kus 's new - found language skills did n't last .
The teenager , who injured a knee in Sunday 's accident in Glasgow , is once more struggling to make himself understood in English .
After flying home to the Czech Republic to recover , he said - through an interpreter - that he remembered nothing of the accident or of the following two days .
Yesterday he added : " It 's unbelievable that I was speaking English like that , especially without an accent .
" Hopefully I can pick English up over the winter for the start of next season so I 'll be able to speak it without someone having to hit me over the head first .
" There must be plenty of the English language in my subconscious so hopefully I 'll be able to pick it up quickly next time . "
After the accident , team spokesman Lawrence Heppell said : " He was out cold for 45 minutes and he has been told by the medics to rest for at least a month .
" Matej could only string two or three words of English together and now he can speak it like a native , it 's incredible . "
Mr Waite added : " I 've heard of other people getting knocked out and waking up talking fluent Italian or in one case even developing a Welsh accent .
" I never really believed it was possible but this incredible thing was happening in front of us . "
As the presidential hopefuls of 2008 were working state fairs and stumping cross-country last month , the Federal Election Commission was revisiting the presidential election of 2004 .
Specifically , it was levying one of its biggest fines ever against a " 527 " political organization for spending more than $ 100 million in unregulated contributions .
But even at $ 775,000 — the third - largest penalty in the fec's 33 - year history — critics say the fine was not nearly big or swift enough .
And they are using it to push for strict rules and higher penalties to ensure that 527 groups comply with the law during the next presidential campaign .
" The stakes involved are enormous , " says Fred Wertheimer , president of the watchdog group Democracy 21 , noting that the fine against America Coming Together was a mere fraction of the millions the organization spent .
" Illegal expenditures of $ 100 million can decide a presidential election and delegitimize the integrity of the result . "
Named after a section of the tax code , 527 groups played a major role in the 2004 election , spending more than $ 600 million on campaign activities .
Unlike political action committees , which come under the $ 5,000 per - donor limit , the tax - exempt 527 groups can — and do — receive millions from single donors or organizations .
But unlike political action committees , 527s are banned from spending money to tell people to vote for or against specific candidates .
Instead , they can finance generic activities like voter registration drives .
Reformers have long warned that some of these organizations are breaking the rules against direct advocacy .
The fec agreed when it reached the $ 775,000 settlement with act , a Democratic - leaning organization active in the last presidential election .
The agency found that most of the group 's expenditures should have been regulated as " hard money , " since they went for telemarketing , political advertisements , and door - to - door canvassing in 17 battleground states that clearly targeted President George Bush .
One Ohio ad , for example , said that Bush had cut education and healthcare spending in that state while spending billions to rebuild Iraq .
Confusing .
The 527 groups see things differently .
Act , financed in part by billionaire George Soros and labor unions , says that its activities were legal and that it did its best to comply with confusing rulings .
The group , since disbanded , said that it was " vindicated " by the fec because the agency " found no deliberate violations " of federal election campaign law and dismissed allegations that it had unlawfully coordinated activities with the John Kerry campaign .
The settlement with act follows other penalties against 527 groups , including the Republican - leaning Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and the Democratic - leaning MoveOn.org .
The Swift Boat group , which ran a 2004 ad saying that Kerry " cannot be trusted , " was fined $ 299,500 by the fec , which said the group should have registered as a political committee .
The 527 groups argue that their messages are " issue ads " that aim to educate voters and that putting restrictions on such ads violates free - speech rights .
So far , the courts have tended to agree .
Rep. Christopher Shays , a Connecticut Republican , and former Rep. Martin Meehan , a Massachusetts Democrat , sued the fec in 2004 to force it to develop a strict and clear policy on 527 groups .
They said the organizations should be required to register not just with the Internal Revenue Service but also with the fec .
But in August , a federal court ruled that the agency can continue to monitor the groups on a case - by - case basis .
On a related track , Shays is trying to rein in these groups with a bill that would require certain 527 organizations to register as political committees .
" We need legislation to force 527s to play by the same campaign finance rules that apply to all other organizations seeking to influence federal elections , " he said .
Whether we are seeking a mate or sizing up a potential rival , good - looking people capture our attention nearly instantaneously and render us temporarily helpless to turn our eyes away from them , according to a new Florida State University study .
“ It ’s like magnetism at the level of visual attention , ” said Jon Maner , an assistant professor of psychology at FSU , who studied the role mating - related motives can play in a psychological phenomenon called attentional adhesion .
His findings are published in the September issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
The paper , “ Ca n’t Take My Eyes Off You : Attentional Adhesion to Mates and Rivals , ” is one of the first to show how strongly , quickly and automatically we are attuned to attractive people , he said .
FSU graduate students Matthew Gailliot , D. Aaron Rouby and Saul Miller co-authored the study .
In a series of three experiments , Maner and his colleagues found that the study participants , all heterosexual men and women , fixated on highly attractive people within the first half of a second of seeing them .
Single folks ogled the opposite sex , of course , but those in committed relationships also checked people out , with one major difference :
They were more interested in beautiful people of the same sex .
“ If we ’re interested in finding a mate , our attention gets quickly and automatically stuck on attractive members of the opposite sex , ” Maner said .
“ If we ’re jealous and worried about our partner cheating on us , attention gets quickly and automatically stuck on attractive people of our own sex because they are our competitors . ”
Maner ’s research is based on the idea that , through processes of biological evolution , our brains have been designed to strongly and automatically latch on to signs of physical attractiveness in others in order to both find a mate and guard him or her from potential competitors .
“ These kinds of attentional biases can occur completely outside of our conscious awareness , ” he said .
Biology or not , this phenomenon is fraught with potential romantic peril .
For example , even some people in committed relationships had difficulty pulling their attention away from images of attractive people of the opposite sex .
And fixating on images of perceived romantic rivals could contribute to feelings of insecurity .
Modern technology has enhanced these pitfalls .
Although there are people of striking beauty in real life , singer Frankie Valli ’s pronouncement that “ you ’re just too good to be true ” may be the case when it comes to images in movies and magazines or on the Internet .
“ It may be helpful to try to minimize our exposure to these images that have probably been ‘ doctored , ’ ” Maner said .
“ We should pay attention to all of the regular - looking people out in the world so that we have an appropriate standard of physical beauty .
This is important because too much attention to ultra- attractive people can damage self - esteem as well as satisfaction with a current romantic partner . ”
In the experiments , study participants -- 120 people in the first study and 160 and 162 in the second and third studies , respectively -- completed questionnaires to determine the extent to which they were motivated to seek out members of the opposite sex .
They then took part in a series of “ priming ” activities before they were shown photos of highly attractive men , highly attractive women , average - looking men and average - looking women .
After a photo of one of the faces flashed in one quadrant of a computer screen , the participants were required to shift their attention away from that face to somewhere else on the screen .
Using a precise measure of reaction time , Maner found that it took the participants longer to shift their attention away from the photos of the highly attractive people .
Maner said he was surprised that his studies showed little differences between the sexes when it came to fixating on eye - catching people .
“ Women paid just as much attention to men as men did to women , ” he said .
“ I was also surprised that jealous men paid so much attention to attractive men .
Men tend to worry more about other men being more dominant , funny or charismatic than they are .
But when it comes to concerns about infidelity , men are very attentive to highly attractive guys because presumably their wives or girlfriends may be too . ”

Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a machine learning algorithm .
Basic tactical optimizations are covered well elsewhere , but I have n’t seen a reasonable guide to higher level optimizations , which are the most important in my experience .
Here are some of the higher level optimizations I ’ve often found useful .
Algorithmic Improvement First .
This is Hard , but it is the most important consideration , and typically yields the most benefits .
Good optimizations here are publishable .
In the context of machine learning , you should be familiar with the arguments for online vs. batch learning .
Choice of Language .
There are many arguments about the choice of language .
Sometimes you do n’t have a choice when interfacing with other people .
Personally , I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code .
This ( admittedly ) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher level languages .
( Sometimes I prototype in Ocaml . )
Choosing the wrong language can result in large slowdowns .
Avoid Pointer - Based Representations .
The way your represent information in your program can have a dramatic impact on performance .
My rule of thumb is “ for fast programs , it ’s all arrays in the end ” .
As an example , consider maps .
STL provides map ( a tree - based datastructure ) and hash_map ( an array - of - pointers data structure ) .
Where a hash_map works , it ’s common to observe an order - of - magnitude improvement in performance over a map .
( Sometimes you must futz with the hash function to observe this ) .
The Google dense_hash_map replaces the array of pointers with a plain old array and ( unsurprisingly ) is even faster .
What ’s fundamentally happening here is locality : dereferencing pointers is a very expensive operation on modern computers because the CPU runs much faster than the latency to RAM .
By converting everything into an array , you compute rather than dereference the location of data .
Converting things into an array is not always easy , but it is often possible with a little bit of thought and care .
Cached Parsing .
Fast algorithms are required for large quantities of data .
Unfortunately , the computational process of reading and parsing the data is often intensive .
By caching parsed examples in a machine representation format ( either in RAM or on disk ) , a substantial performance boost is achievable .
This comes from two sources :
You avoid the work of parsing again .
The machine representation can be more concise implying improved system caching effects .
Deshuffle .
Avoid copying information .
It ’s easy to end up copying data from one place to another .
Commonly , the best implementation avoids this , which has strong implications on representation choice .
Write less Code .
There are many reasons to write less code where you can .
For the purposes of optimization , having less code in the bottleneck is the surest way to reduce work in the bottleneck .
There are lots of techniques for doing this — some of them are purely syntactic transformations while others involve redesigning the algorithm itself .
Do n’t trust libraries .
In particular , do n’t trust library calls inside the bottleneck .
It ’s often the case that a library function is general purpose while you can get away with a much faster hand - crafted ( and inlined ) function .
Buffered disk I /O .
There is a huge difference in performance between reading and writing directly from the disk and doing this through a buffering layer .
In general , it ’s not obvious which I /O library functions buffer properly .
You can experiment , or implement your own buffering system .
C++ I/O libraries seem to handle this better than C libraries in general .
Amortization .
Amortization is a very powerful technique for algorithm optimization .
The basic idea is to always make sure that one computation ( a secondary one ) is amortized by another ( your primary computation ) .
Optimize while you wait .
There is always a question about how much time should be spent on optimization vs. other aspects of programming .
A reasonable rule of thumb is to spend time on optimization when you are waiting for the program to finish running .
This is ammortization , applied to yourself .
In all program optimization , it is critical to know where the bottleneck is , and optimize preferentially there .
This is fairly tricky on a modern computer because there are many ways that hidden latency can creep in .
Tools like gprof and Valgrind can be helpful here , but there is no substitute for having a basic understanding of how a computer works .
For Windows users setting up and sharing printers on Windows Computers , the process is simple .

The poisonous rhetorical legacy of Karl Rove
Even Fox ’s Chris Wallace wants to know why Bush ’s newly departed advisor had to paint Democrats as traitors .
Excerpt :
‘ [ Chris ]
Wallace followed up by asking Rove to justify the notorious June 22 , 2005 , speech he gave before the New York Conservative Party , in which he alleged that Democrats were soft on terror .
It is worth recalling at length what Rove said on that occasion : “ Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks and prepared for war ; liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers .
In the wake of 9/11 , conservatives believed it was time to unleash the might and power of the United States military against the Taliban ; in the wake of 9/11 , liberals believed it was time to … submit a petition . ”
Rove ’s diatribe depended for its effect on a series of deft substitutions , both explicit and implied .
First , he misrepresented liberals by coding MoveOn.org , the grass - roots Internet activists who did urge alternatives to a frontal assault on the Taliban , as representative of liberal opinion generally .
Then , by mentioning Democratic Party figures such as Howard Dean and Illinois Sen .
Dick Durbin , he implied that he was speaking about that party .
Unless we assume that most Democrats are not liberals , then the attack was certainly partisan .
It was also false .
In polling soon after the 2001 attacks , 84 percent of self - identified liberals supported military action in response , and 80 percent of Democrats favored war against Afghanistan .
Democratic members of Congress largely supported the Afghanistan war as well , with the senators voting for it unanimously . ‘

Ok , got it
WASHINGTON – Rep. Charles Rangel yesterday blasted Dick Cheney as a “ son of a bitch ” after the vice president said the Harlem lawmaker would raise taxes and destroy the economy if Democrats take control of the House .
The bitter war of words escalated to the point where the bombastic Rangel even questioned whether the tightly wound Cheney needed professional treatment – and mocked him for accidentally shooting his hunting buddy ealier this year .
Cheney fired the first shot when he predicted that Rangel – who is poised to chair the powerful House Ways and Means Committee if the Democrats seize the House next week – would n’t continue “ a single one ” of President Bush ’s tax cuts .
“ I think that would be bad for the economy , ” Cheney said on CNBC News .
“ I do n’t know if the stock market would like it . ”
He then got in a major hit , saying on the Fox News Channel , “ Charlie does n’t understand how the economy works . ”
Many of Bush ’s 2001 tax cuts are set to expire in 2011 – meaning rates would jump back up again , boosting taxes by well over $ 1 trillion , unless Congress acts to continue the cuts .
“ So if a man like Charlie Rangel were to be chairman of the committee , and sitting there with the gavel , all he has to do is not act , just do n’t call up the legislation , and there ’ll be a big tax increase , ” Cheney said .
The vice president ’s stinging comments were the latest in a series of White House statements intended to raise fears about Rangel , as well as other prominent Democrats , as a way to convince voters to stop them from taking over the House .
Contacted by The Post for a response , Rangel unloaded .
“ He ’s such a real son of a bitch , he just enjoys a confrontation , ” Rangel fumed , describing himself as “ warm and personable . ”
Rangel said Cheney may need to go to “ rehab ” for “ whatever personality deficit he may have suffered . ”
“ When you have those sorts of problems , you ’re supposed to seek help , ” Rangel advised .
“ He ac- knowledged that he has problems with communication . ”
Asked whether he was resurrecting over - the - top charges he made last year that he believes Cheney is mentally ill , Rangel cracked , “ I do n’t think he ’s shot anyone in the face lately , so I ’ll give him the benefit of the doubt . ”
The vice president accidentally shot his hunting companion , then - 78 - year - old Harry Whittington , with a shotgun early this year .
Rangel ’s digs on Cheney recalled his statements last year that the vice president , who has had four heart attacks , was too sick to work .
“ I would like to believe he ’s sick rather just mean and evil , ” Rangel , 76 , told cable channel NY1 .
“ Sometimes I do n’t even think Cheney is awake enough to know what ’s going on .
[ Defense Secretary Donald ]
Rumsfeld is the guy in Washington . . . running the country . ”
Cheney , 65 , responded then , “ I ’m frankly surprised at his comments . . .
They were so out of line it almost struck me that . . .
Charlie was having some problem .
Charlie is losing it , I guess . ”
Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride would n’t respond directly to Rangel ’s latest broadsides .
“ The vice president has been discussing tax policy , the fundamental difference in Republican and Democrat views on how to keep taxes low and the American economy growing , ” she said .
Cheney once famously told Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) on the Senate floor to “ go f- – – yourself ” while Rangel once had a confrontation with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas ( R - Calif . ) where the Capitol Police were called in .
Rangel said he is focused on Social Security , tax simplification and the Alternative Minimum Tax that is squeezing even some middle - income families – not what to do in 2011 , when the Bush tax cuts expire .
“ The president ’s not going to be around in 2010 .
I may not be on the committee , ” said Rangel , who recently said he ’d quit Congress if the Democrats do n’t win control of the House .
“ It ’s quite possible that I might want to extend the tax cuts , ” he said , without naming any specific tax cut that might continue .

Is there a cure for a healthy person , or how to live happily without pills
Robyn Williams :
What if you 'd invented a gadget to save the world or developed a process that would be a boon to millions ?
Can you expect nice , helpful folk with money bags and good advice to beat a path to your door and lay out the red carpet ?
Not quite , and this is why Dr David Mills took his solar power technology from here to the United States this year .
And now Dr Prame Chopra has been negotiating another set of snags to get his geothermal technology up and running .
His saga begins back in 2001 when Dr Chopra was still at the Australian National University in Canberra .
Here 's how he told the story in Ockham 's Razor .
Prame Chopra :
This tale begins when my colleague and I discover that Australia has a huge untapped green energy source .
It could meet all the nation 's energy needs for thousands of years , and it wo n't create greenhouse gases , because it uses naturally occurring hot rocks in the sub- surface .
Cold water is pumped down and hot water is brought back up , to run a power station .
As we 'll see , this science seems easy when compared with the nightmare of commercialising it .
The beginning :
We kick the ball off by writing a report for the Federal Government 's Energy Research and Development Corporation .
They praise our report and this stimulates radio and press interest in our hot rock energy project .
Then we get a great opportunity .
ABC TV asks us to do an item for Quantum ; a whole half - hour program .
Now lots of people start asking us , ' When will the power be available ? '
Pretty soon , we think , because we realise that the know - how already exists to make hot rock power .
The problem is , the key people and their results are all in Europe , Japan and the US .
It dawns on us then that getting Australia to sign an international treaty is the only way we 'll get access to the crucial R&D .
So , step 1 : Learn how to lobby the bureaucracy .
We launch a myriad of letters , forms and proposals , and what do you know ?
Result !
Australia signs the international agreement in Paris in 1997 .
Step 2 : Learn how to talk money .
The government is very interested in the project , as long as it does n't cost them .
They tell us to get industry support .
We 're excited , but how do you get millions of dollars out of big business ?
After all , this is a country that 's notorious for having to commercialise its innovations overseas .
We quickly discover that you can't get this kind of money unless you 're a company .
Step 3 : Quick lessons in business law .
We invite anyone in business interested in developing hot rock energy to join us in a working group .
Scientists and engineers from some of Australia 's largest resource companies come out of the woodwork .
So do business consultants , infrastructure managers , investors and multinationals .
But having open slather like this was mistake number one .
The working group was a hotbed of hidden agendas and latent greed .
Eventually there 's agreement to form a new company .
Fourteen of the participants decide they want in , and we raise $ 140,000 in start - up capital .
It feels pretty good .
To top it off , a very attractive offer is made by some of the consultants .
They 'll set up a company for us , do all the paperwork , form an interim board of directors , and what 's more , they 'll do all of this for us for just $ 10,000 worth of free shares .
Our second mistake ; we accept their kind offer .
Step 4 : Look for the big bucks .
We approach the bank to see if they 'd like to finance a pilot plant .
They love the concept , but they tell us , ' The risk is too high .
We 'll tell you what ; you build the first power station and we 'll pay for the next ten . '
Knocked back at the bank but still optimistic , we start approaching venture capital funds .
But the large funds say , ' Your pilot plant is too small .
We normally like to invest more than $ 100 million at a time . '
So we go chasing the smaller funds .
They 're interested but ask us , ' Who owns the resource ? '
Good question !
Step 5 : Learn to read mining legislation .
We check the law that might cover energy from hot rocks across Australia .
Surprise , surprise !
We find it 's different in every state and territory .
So to test the law , we choose an ideal site in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales and we write to the Minister for Mineral Resources ; ' Dear Minister , Does the Mines Act in New South Wales cover geothermal energy ? '
' Yes , ' comes back the reply , ' naturally occurring steam and hot water is covered . '
But our sighs of relief are short - lived as we read on , ' But , ' continues the Minister , ' you want to recover heat , not mine a natural substance from the ground .
So the Mines Act does n't cover what you want to do . '
What a pity , it would have been so easy !
Step 6 : Return to base .
Two years after our first approach to the Minister , the two words , ' and artificial ' are added .
Now the Mines Act covers ' naturally occurring and artificial steam and hot water . '
As usual though , our celebrations are short lived .
Our hope that mining permission is imminent is dashed again .
Now the government announces that it will call for competitive tenders for ' our ' site .
They explain to us that ' there 's been a lot of interest in this new hot rock technology , and in particular , in the site that you 've picked . '
It seems that we 've done our publicity job a little too well !
After two years , the possibility that we might completely lose the site raises its head for the first time .
Our company will have to compete for it .
Step 8 : Learn to get your company 's house in order .
Meanwhile we keep asking our ' kind consultants ' for copies of the paperwork for the new company .
These requests are met with assurances that ' they 'll be posted any day now . '
Months drag on .
Eventually , after many phone calls and much badgering , a copy of the Articles of Association finally arrives .
We start peering at the legal phrasings .
Slowly it begins to dawn on us that these Articles are n't the standard legal boilerplate normally used by small companies .
Struth !
The consultants have appointed themselves directors for life , and have handed themselves the only shares .
Step 8 : Dealing with despair .
' Dear Sirs ,
We regret to inform you that your application for the lease has been unsuccessful . '
We 've lost !
The company has granted the lease to one of its own power corporations .
What 's more , the power corporation refuses our offers of research assistance .
Depression ensues .
It looks like it 's all over .
Step 9 : Bring in the anti-depressants and take a crash course in advanced lobbying .
We start discreet inquiries with state and federal politicians and discover that they think that ' perhaps the state tendering process appears less than perfect . '
At the same time , the winning tenderer investigates internationally and discovers the R&D might be a bit easier said than done .
To cap things off , the bosses of the power corporation suddenly pull in the financial reins .
Managers are told to cut project spending .
The power corporation relents .
We 're back in !
Our earlier offer of academic assistance , including an $ 800,000 grant is taken up , and our company is sounded out about coming on board .
But there 's still one problem ; there are serious reservations expressed about some of the directors .
Step 10 : Learn advanced company law and business politics .
Now it 's really time to put our house in order .
What we need is a coup d'etat .
We decide to get sneaky and quietly count the numbers .
Calmly we lobby shareholders who we think are on our side .
We send out proxy forms to each of them , with a motion to remove the directors .
Then , anxiously we spread the net wider to other shareholders who we are less certain of .
Everyone 's sworn to secrecy .
Nervously we wait and count the proxies as they come back in .
All the time we hope that word wo n't leak out .
Eventually we reach the magic target !
Now we hold enough proxies to remove the directors , no matter how everyone else votes .
Then we get really sneaky .
We wait another ten days until Christmas Eve .
Now the fax machine starts to run hot .
We send out all the paperwork for the extraordinary general meeting and the motion to remove the directors .
And then we quickly disappear on holidays .
Well , it 's now five years since we set out on this road to commercialisation , and research works at the site is in full swing .
The power corporation holds exclusive rights to the lease but we 're actively involved in the project as academics .
Our company , though , has fallen on hard times , and is being wound up .
The catch - 22 got us ; without ownership of a lease , you can't get finance .
But things have moved on too .
Now another Australian state has resolved the ownership issue for geothermal resources , so we 're setting up a new company .
We 've learned a tremendous amount from our journey between the worlds of science and business , some bad , some good .
Robyn Williams : Dr Prame Chopra in 2001 .
So what 's happened six years on ?
David Fisher .
David Fisher : Getting an idea to market is a series of big hurdles , in areas often new to people who 've spent their careers in academia .
As we 've heard , there are issues with risk management , funding , the ownership of intellectual property , licensing and patents , all intertwined with a hopefully ongoing relationship with the university .
For Prame Chopra , one of the problems in getting development funds for his energy from hot rocks idea was with legislation .
You could take out a lease and have exclusive ownership of land if it contained gold or coal or any other mineral you might think of , but not hot rocks .
He needed legislation to be changed .
We heard some of the problems for innovators six years ago , so for people with new ideas today , are the hurdles still present ?
Prame Chopra .
Prame Chopra :
It 's every bit as difficult today as it was then , I think .
The same sorts of issues that cropped up then are still alive today .
There have been some developments though , and I think one of the stellar things is the response that 's come from the state governments .
One of the necessary requirements was the need to have what 's called title to the geothermal resource .
Until you could actually say to a financial organisation , a bank or whatever it was that you own the resource , they 're not going to be interested in giving you any money to finance it .
So the first step was really to get the governments to move heaven and earth to set up legislation , and they 've done a terrific job , frankly .
The first to move was NSW , South Australia was hot on their heels , and subsequently the Tasmanians , the Queenslanders , the Victorians have all moved in with legislation .
South Australia is going through a new version of it now , they 're updating it even further , and the Northern Territory and Western Australia are both moving as well .
David Fisher : Prame Chopra worked for many years at the Australian National University as a research scientist in geology but was forced to give up his position in March 2006 .
He was told to choose between his university position and his involvement in the company Geodynamics which was commercialising his energy from hot rocks idea .
So why was this necessary when there was a university policy to cover this situation ?
Prame Chopra :
What happened was the senior management in the university decided that they actually did n't like the policy , but rather than going through the process of getting the policy changed and then causing those changes to be implemented , they set about changing that in effect without changing the policy first .
So I was told , in no uncertain terms , you know , you will resign immediately from the board of Geodynamics ... it was an ultimatum , basically .
And when I said , well , there 's a policy in place here and the policy says that I can be a director and I believe I 'm following all the requirements of that policy and in fact it 's been approved previously , they said , ' Well , the policy could be changed . '
David Fisher :
And has it been ?
Prame Chopra :
No , as far as I know it has n't .
In fact there are still academics at the university ... at least one I know of anyway , who is still a director of a major company .
In fact he 's the chairman of it .
The university decided , and I think quite appropriately , that some kind of protocol , as they called it , needed to be established to make sure that in the future no conflicts would arise .
And that was fair and appropriate , that 's the typical response and fine .
But what it meant in reality was that the protocol would effectively oversee everything that I , as an academic , could do in terms of research at the university , and because of the risk - averse nature of the administration ( and it 's probably typical of all universities to a degree ) this protocol would effectively have become very draconian .
To put this into perspective with an example ; in February of last year , just before I left the university , I was invited to be the chairman of one of the two days of the second Australian Hot Rock Energy Conference which ran in Adelaide .
As part of my duties on day one of the conference , I had to invite the South Australian minister to come and open the conference and thank him appropriately , then give a keynote address to the first talk of the conference and then run the proceedings for the day .
The senior administration at the university said to me that because the protocol was n't yet in place I was allowed to go to the conference and do these things , but it was expressed to me ( and this is a direct quote ) that in the event that the protocol was in place , I certainly would n't be allowed to chair a conference like that , I probably would n't be allowed to give a keynote address at a conference like that , and quite possibly I would n't be allowed to attend a conference like that .
David Fisher :
It sounds as if the universities would be just scared of the unknown and that nothing would ever get done if people are sitting around dreaming up what might happen and having people like you leave .
Prame Chopra :
Well , leaving me out of it , I think you 're right .
There is an issue of risk aversion .
Really , successful commercialisation is a fraught business , it is difficult , and really what you need to do in commercialising an idea is to recognise that there will be pluses and there will be potential minuses and you need to balance those risks rather than a blanket attempt to deny all risk because that 's a completely unrealistic expectation ; you 're never going to be able to cancel all possible risks .
David Fisher :
It sounds as if we 're being deprived of a lot of development here .
What needs to change ?
Prame Chopra : I think different universities have tried different approaches , but they 've all tried , to varying degrees , to deal with this conundrum of how to commercialise things in a responsible way .
I think really what 's needed is a mix of both academic skills and business skills at the cutting edge of where this is all trying to be done .
To put the task of commercialisation in the hands of a few academics is not an appropriate response .
David Fisher : Sounds as if we need a whole new degree course here !
Prame Chopra : I think that 's right .
It would be interesting to see whether you could actually teach this or whether you have to learn it on the job .
There are a lot of really good ideas that are not reaching commercialisation because of structural problems in the way in which universities try to commercialise their research .
David Fisher : Prame , Geodynamics has been drilling in South Australia but there 's been a problem .
Prame Chopra :
That 's right .
It 's not a simple business , these hot rocks .
The concept is very simple - cold water down , hot water up - but you rely on a lot of different technologies and lots of different contractors to make it all work .
The site in question is near the little town of Innamincka in the north - eastern corner of South Australia where it pokes into Queensland and it's actually in the cso it's a very dry area and fairly remote .
In that area the company has drilled two wells that go down 4,300 metres and are six - inch diameter at the bottom .
The whole system has been tested and cold water was sent down and indeed steam and hot water was produced at the surface , so that was all very good .
But unfortunately the last step of the process with the production well involved the setting of a thing called a bridge plug ; this is a bit of kit that 's used regularly in the petroleum industry and its purpose is just to isolate the well in order to make it safe while the drilling rig is taken off and valves and control devices are put on the surface , a thing called a ' Christmas tree ' .
Unfortunately what happened was , with removal of this bridge plug , it was n't done successfully by the contractors brought in and in the end it ended up falling to the bottom of the well where it has now effectively obscured most available fractures bringing fluid into the well .
David Fisher :
It fell down thousands of metres ?
Prame Chopra :
Yes , it fell down to 4,300 metres from where it was set originally at about 1,000 metres , and it 's fallen all the way down .
David Fisher : Can it be retrieved ?
Prame Chopra :
A great deal of effort was expended by the company and by contractors trying to get it out and in the end it was n't successful .
So the company has decided ( and this is all on the public record ) that it will drill a new well , Habanero # 3 , so it set about trying to find a drilling rig to do this .
The gear that 's used in this game , because it 's all so deep and so difficult , is petroleum industry equipment .
So we needed a petroleum rig for this job , and looking around Australia for what was available , there really did n't seem to be the kind of rig or quality required .
Trying to get a rig from overseas turned out to be virtually impossible because of the incredibly buoyant situation of the petroleum industry worldwide at the moment because of the high price of oil .
So in the end Geodynamics concluded that the best approach would be to buy its own rig , and that 's what the company has done .
It 's bought a rig and it is due to arrive in the port of Brisbane early in June and to be on site and drilling early in July .
David Fisher :
That 's great news .
And when will electricity flow ?
Prame Chopra :
The intention is that a 40 - megawatt power station will be build at the Habanero site called Hot Rock 40 , and this is supposed to be online in 2010 .
David Fisher :
And where will the electricity go ?
Prame Chopra : Initially there is a small market locally .
Innamincka has got a population of ten , so they need some beer in the fridge to be kept cold , I guess .
But more practically there 's the large gas processing production facility at Moomba which is about 80 kilometres away as the crow flies .
More long - term , 40 megawatts and beyond , we need a power connection to the national grid , basically , and the most likely place to put that is the closest point in the grid which is the Olympic Dam mine site in South Australia , the Roxby Downs uranium and copper mine run by BHP Billiton which is a huge energy consumer , and it's on the grid .
David Fisher :
And how many megawatts might go to that site ?
Prame Chopra :
The site in the Cooper Basin is large enough to provide many thousands of megawatts of power to the Australian grid .
Not just to Olympic Dam but beyond that into Adelaide and Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane .
Ultimately there would probably be a need for high voltage DC connections , perhaps to both Brisbane and Adelaide , and perhaps even to Sydney .
A million - volt or 1.5 million - volt DC connections are very low loss and could bring the power very efficiently to the grid .
Robyn Williams : Dr Prame Chopra was talking to David Fisher .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States is developing a proposed $ 20 billion , 10 - year arms sales package for Saudi Arabia , a senior administration official confirmed on Saturday .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , left , and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will meet with Saudis next week .
The proposed sale , first reported in The New York Times , is intended to upgrade the Saudi military 's ability to counter possible Iranian aggression in the Persian Gulf region , the official said .
" This is all about Iran , " said the official , who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because discussions with the Saudis are still going on and the arms sale deal has not been completed .
Israel is expected to raise objections to the arms package , and has expressed concerns about previous Saudi arms deals .
The official said the Bush administration is mindful that Israel must maintain its " qualitative edge " in the region .
Besides Saudi Arabia , other countries in discussion with the United States about arms sales include the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain and Oman .
One of the more controversial proposals will probably be selling the Saudis , for the first time , satellite - guided bombs known as JDAMs .
The sale may include a 500 - pound and a 2,000 - pound version of the aerial bomb .
The Israelis are said to be very concerned about the Saudis having that precision - strike capability , so the United States will discuss basing the weapons as far away from Israel as possible , the official said .
Other elements under discussion are new naval vessels , an advanced version of air - to - air missiles already used by the United States , and advanced Patriot missiles .
The proposed sale is expected to be a major topic of discussion next week when U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meet with Saudi officials .
The sale would have to be approved by Congress .

The lies of Alan Greenspan
Alan Greenspan has come back from the tomb of history to correct the record .
He did not make any mistakes in his 18 - year tenure as Federal Reserve chairman .
He did not endorse the regressive Bush tax cuts of 2001 that pumped up the federal deficits and aggravated inequalities .
He did not cause the housing bubble that is now in collapse .
He did not ignore the stock market bubble that subsequently melted away and cost investors $ 6 trillion .
He did not say the Iraq war is " largely about oil . "
Check the record .
These are all lies .
Greenspan 's testimony endorsing the Bush tax cuts was extremely influential but now he wants to run away from it .
In the instance of Iraq , Greenspan is actually correcting his own memoir , " The Age of Turbulence , " which just came out .
Last weekend , newspapers reported provocative snippets from the book , including this : " I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . "
Wow , talk about your " inconvenient truth . "
Greenspan was blithely acknowledging what official Washington has always denied and the news media faithfully ignored .
" Blood for oil . "
No , no , no , that 's not what he meant , Greenspan corrected in a follow - up interview ( with Bob Woodward in the Sept. 17 Washington Post ) .
He was only saying that " taking out Saddam was essential " for " oil security " and the global economy .
Are you confused ?
Welcome to the world of slippery truth that Greenspan has always lived in .
He was the Maestro , as Woodward 's loving portrait dubbed him .
Wall Street loved the chairman best because the traders and bankers knew he was always on their side and would come to their rescue .
The major news media treated him like an Old Testament prophet .
Whatever the chairman said was carved on stone tablets , even when it did n't make any sense , as it often did n't .
Some of us , who followed his tracks more closely , were not so kind .
Harry Reid , now the Democratic Senate leader , said Greenspan was " one of the biggest political hacks in Washington . "
Amen .
I called him " the one - eyed chairman " who could always spot reasons to stomp on the real economy of work and production , but was utterly blind to the destructive chaos in the financial system .
No matter .
The adoration of him was nearly universal .
Until now .
The economic consequences of his rule are accumulating , and even the dullest financial reporters are stumbling on crumbs of truth about Greenspan 's legendary reign .
It sowed profound and dangerous imbalances in the U.S. economy .
That 's what happens when government power tips the balance in favor of capital over labor , favoring super - rich over middle class and poor , then holds it there for nearly a generation .
Things get out of whack and now the country is paying enormously .
A pity reporters and politicians did n't have the nerve to ask these questions when Greenspan was in power .
He retired only a year ago , but is already trying to revise the history - to explain away blunders that are now a financial crisis facing his successor ; to rearrange the facts in exculpatory ways ; to deny his right - wing ideological bias and his raw partisanship in behalf of the Bush Republicans .
The man is shrewd .
He can see the conservative era he celebrated and helped to impose upon the American economy is in utter ruin .
He is trying to get some distance from it before the blood splashes all over his reputation .
Of course , he also came back to cash in - an $ 8 million advance for a book that is sure to be a huge bestseller .
I do n't want to be unkind , but Greenspan could have avoided all the embarrassing questions if his book was posthumous .
I have n't read it yet .
I have a hunch I am not going to like it .
Have you ever had that sinking feeling when you realize — just a split second too late — that you should n’t have clicked “ Okay ” in the “ Are you sure you want to quit ? ” dialog ?
Article Continues Below
Yes ?
Well , you ’re in good company — everybody has had a similar experience , so there ’s no need to feel ashamed about it .
It ’s not your fault : it ’s your software ’s fault .
Why ?
Because software should “ know ” that we form habits .
Software should know that after clicking “ Okay ” countless times in response to the question , we ’ll probably click “ Okay ” this time too , even if we do n’t mean to .
Software should know that we wo n’t have a chance to think before accidentally throwing our work away .
Why should it know these things ?
Because software designers should know that we form habits , whether we want to or not .
Habit formation is actually good thing : it saves us the trouble of having to think when confronted with interface banalities and it lessens the probability that our train of thought will get derailed .
In the case of the “ Are you sure you want to quit ? ” dialog , our hands have memorized close - and - click as a single continuous gesture .
That ’s good , because most of the time we do n’t want to think about the question — we just do the right thing .
Unfortunately , our habits sometimes make us do the wrong thing : we do n’t even have time to realize our mistake until after we ’ve made it .
So , as designers we are led to a general interface principle :
If an interface is to be humane , it must respect habituation .
Possible solutions #section2
What about making the warning harder to ignore ?
A subtle warning will get passed by , so let ’s pull out all the stops : we ’ll blink the screen and play a loud stretching noise to ensure that the user is paying attention .
Try as we might , it still wo n’t work .
The more in - your - face the warning is , the faster we ’ll want to get away from it ( by clicking “ Okay ” ) and the more mistakes we ’ll make .
The thing is , no matter how fully in - your - face the computer presents the warning , we ’ll still make the same mistake — clicking “ Okay ” when we do n’t mean to .
But it ’s still not our fault : as long as it ’s possible to habituate to dismissing the message , we ’ll habituate , and then we ’ll make mistakes .
What about making the warning impossible to ignore ?
If it ’s habituation on the human side that is causing the problem , why not design the interface such that we cannot form a habit .
That way we ’ll always be forced to stop and think before answering the question , so we ’ll always choose the answer we mean .
That ’ll solve the problem , right ?
This type of thinking is not new :
It ’s the type - the - nth - word - of - this - sentence - to - continue approach .
In the game Guild Wars , for example , deleting a character requires first clicking a “ delete ” button and then typing the name of the character as confirmation .
Unfortunately , it does n’t always work .
In particular :
It causes us to concentrate on the unhabitual - task at hand and not on whether we want to be throwing away our work .
Thus , the impossible - to - ignore warning is little better than a normal warning :
We end up losing our work either way .
This ( losing our work ) is the worst software sin possible .
It is remarkably annoying , and because it always requires our attention , it necessarily distracts us from our work ( which is the second worst software sin ) .
It is always slower and more work - intensive than a standard warning .
Thus , it commits the third worst sin—requiring more work from us than is necessary .
In the Guild Wars example , points two and three are n’t particularly apropos because deleting a character is an infrequent action .
However , if we had to type the name of a document before being allowed to exit it without saving , we would find it very burdensome .
What have we learned ?
That interfaces that do n’t respect habituation are very bad .
Making the warning bigger , louder , and impossible - to - ignore does n’t seem to work ; any way we look at it , warnings lead us into a big black interface pit .
So let ’s get rid of the warning altogether .
Undo to the rescue#section3
Merely removing warnings does n’t save our work from peril , but using an “ undo ” function does .
Let me say that again :
The solution to our warning woes is undo .
With a robust undo , we can close our work with reckless abandon and be secure in the knowledge that we can always get it back .
With undo , we can make that horrible “ oops ! ” feeling go away by getting our work back .
1
Because we form habits , we ’ll never be able to guarantee that we wo n’t have an “ oops ! ” moment .
Instead , designers must accept that it will happen and design for it .
Whenever we have the opportunity to throw away work , the computer must allow us to undo our actions .
This leads to one of the most basic and important mantras of interface design :
Never use a warning when you mean undo .
Google Mail is a outstanding example of this mantra .
When you delete an e-mail , it immediately gives you an option to undo that action .
How humane !
This neatly sidesteps the issue of warnings ( as well as the visibility issue of undo ) .
When we make a mistake ( which we are bound to do ) it is n’t very costly because we can just undo it .
With undo , we spend less time worrying and more time doing work .
fig .
1 . It ’s not too late .
Gmail gives users the option to undo their deletes .
Of course this is only one layer of undo — and Gmail goes even further .
After you delete a message , it is n’t gone forever … it sits in the trash so that you can retrieve it if you decide later that you did n’t actually want to delete it .
Alas , this is a lesson that Google Calendar has n’t learned yet .
And , as predicted , I ’ve deleted events that I did n’t mean to .
Sometimes I ’ve deleted the wrong event , which is particularly bad because then I ’m not even sure what I ’ve deleted .
Without undo , there is no way to find out .
fig .
2 . Be careful !
Google Calendar does not allow users to undo accidental deletes .
Actually , even Google Mail has n’t fully embraced the lesson .
When you remove a label from Gmail , up comes one of those wretched warnings .
Why is it that Google can get it so right in one place , and mere clicks away get it so wrong ?
Perhaps because “ warn - think ” is so ingrained that it takes a heroic effort to break free .
Even companies which are generally bastions of good design , like 37 Signals , get this one dead wrong .
fig .
3 . 37 Signals ’ application , Highrise , provides warnings but no undos .
Using a warning instead of an undo is the path of least resistance from a programmer ’s standpoint , and it does n’t require any new thinking from a design standpoint .
But that is n’t an excuse for our computers to be inhumane .
Warnings cause us to lose our work , to mistrust our computers , and to blame ourselves .
A simple but foolproof design methodology solves the problem : “ Never use a warning when you mean undo . ”
And when a user is deleting their work , you always mean undo .
Oh , and the next time you see a warning used instead of undo , send the designer of the application / website a nice e-mail suggesting that they implement an “ undo ” feature instead .
Send them a link to this article .
Let ’s see if we ca n’t change the way people design on the web — and in the process make everyone ’s computing life more humane and less frustrating in one little way .
Let the war on warnings begin !

Hurricanes have become more frequent over the past century
The study says that warmer sea surface temperatures and changes in wind patterns caused by climate change are fuelling much of the increase .
Some researchers say hurricanes are cyclical and the increase is just a reflection of a natural pattern .
But the authors of this study say it is not just nature - they say the frequency has risen across the century .
Two - decade rise
Hurricanes are a spinning vortex of winds that swirl around an eye of low pressure .
Thunder clouds surround the edges of these storms and they can wreak devastation on people and property when they hit land - most famously in the case of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 .
Scientific analyses in recent years suggest hurricane numbers have increased since the mid-1980s .
This new study , published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in London , looks at the frequency of these storms from 1900 to the present and it says about twice as many form each year now compared to 100 years ago .
The authors say that man-made climate change , which has increased the temperature of the sea surface , is the major factor behind the increase in numbers .
" Over the period we 've had natural variability in the frequency of storms , which has contributed less than 50 % of the actual increase in our view , " said Dr Greg Holland from the United States National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado , who authored the report .
" Approximately 60 % , and possibly even 70 % of what we are seeing in the last decade can be attributed directly to greenhouse warming , " he said .
Experts say that 2007 will be a very active season with nine hurricanes forecast , of which five are expected to be intense .
It ’s understandable that Susan Collins is lashing out via her campaign staff , she is after all in increasing danger of losing her job because of her staunch support for George Bush and the war in Iraq .
Susan Collins represents everything that is wrong with the Republican party today – it ’s people like her who forced me to leave the GOP over a decade ago .
She thinks her only job is to be a rubber stamp for George Bush ’s failed war and failed administration .
So , yes , Susan now thinks that anyone who disagrees with her about the war is a hate - filled , quasi-violent extremist ( sounding a bit like Bush and Cheney , demonizing anyone who disagrees with you , eh Susan ? ) .
Also , note her staffer ’s use of the word “ quasi- violent ” .
Classic Susan Collins .
She simply ca n’t take a clear position on anything .
Always trying to split the baby in half .
So it ’s not “ violent , ” it ’s “ quasi ” violent , whatever the heck that wishy - washy word means .
It will be nice next November when Maine replaces Susan with a real Senator .
Susan Collins , the quasi-Senator .
PS Susan ’s staffer also got the JetBlue story wrong , they have n’t pulled their sponsorship of the annual blogger conference .

ALGORITHMS sound scary , of interest only to dome - headed mathematicians .
In fact they have become the instruction manuals for a host of routine consumer transactions .
Browse for a book on Amazon.com and algorithms generate recommendations for other titles to buy .
Buy a copy and they help a logistics firm to decide on the best delivery route .
Ring to check your order 's progress and more algorithms spring into action to determine the quickest connection to and through a call - centre .
From analysing credit - card transactions to deciding how to stack supermarket shelves , algorithms now underpin a large amount of everyday life .
Their pervasiveness reflects the application of novel computing power to the age - old complexities of business .
“ No human being can work fast enough to process all the data available at a certain scale , ” says Mike Lynch , boss of Autonomy , a computing firm that uses algorithms to make sense of unstructured data .
Algorithms can .
As the amount of data on everything from shopping habits to media consumption increases and as customers choose more personalisation , algorithms will only become more important .
Algorithms can take many forms .
At its core , an algorithm is a step - by - step method for doing a job .
These can be prosaic — a recipe is an algorithm for preparing a meal — or they can be anything but : the decision - tree posters that hang on hospital walls and which help doctors work out what is wrong with a patient from his symptoms are called medical algorithms .
This formulaic style of thinking can itself be a useful tool for businesses , much like the rigour of good project - management .
But computers have made algorithms far more valuable to companies .
“ A computer program is a written encoding of an algorithm , ” explains Andrew Herbert , who runs Microsoft Research in Cambridge , Britain .
The speed and processing power of computers mean that algorithms can execute tasks with blinding speed using vast amounts of data .
Some of these tasks are more mechanistic than others .
For instance , people often make mistakes when they key in their credit - card numbers online .
With millions of transactions being processed at a time , a rapid way to weed out invalid numbers helps to keep processing times down .
Enter the Luhn algorithm ( see below ) , named after its inventor , Hans Luhn , an IBM researcher .
The numbers on a credit card identify the card type , the issuer and the user 's account number .
The last number of all is set to ensure that the Luhn algorithm produces a figure divisible by ten .
If it is , the card number has been properly entered and the processing can go ahead .
The Luhn algorithm performs a simple calculation .
But the real power of algorithms emerges when they are put to work on much more complex problems .
As far as most businesses are concerned , these problems typically fall into two types : improving various processes , such as how a network is configured and a supply chain is run , or analysing data on things such as customer spending .
UPS uses algorithms to help deliver the millions of packages that pass through its transportation network every day in the most efficient way possible .
The simplest routes are easy to draw up .
If a driver has only three destinations to visit , he can take only six possible routes .
But the number of possible routes explodes as the destinations increase .
There are more than 15 trillion , trillion possible routes to take on a journey with just 25 drop - off points — and an average day for a UPS driver in America involves 150 destinations .
The picture is further complicated by constraints such as specified drop - off and pick - up times for drivers or runway lengths and noise restrictions for aircraft .
“ Algorithms provide benefits when the choices are so great that they are impossible to process in your head , ” says UPS 's Jack Levis .
Go here , go there
Solving this “ travelling - salesman problem ” means a lot to UPS .
For its fleet of aircraft in America , the company uses an algorithm called VOLCANO ( which stands for Volume , Location and Aircraft Network Optimiser ) .
Developed jointly with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , it is used by three different planning groups within UPS — one to plan schedules for the following four to six months , one to work out what kind of facilities and aircraft might be needed over the next two to ten years , and one to plan for the peak season between Thanksgiving and Christmas .
Getting the scheduling wrong imposes a heavy cost : flying half - empty planes or leasing extra aircraft is an expensive business .
UPS reckons that VOLCANO has saved the company tens of millions of dollars since its introduction in 2000 .
Logistics firms are far from the only ones working on “ optimisation ” algorithms .
Telecoms operators use algorithms to establish the quickest connections for phone calls through their networks or to retrieve web pages speedily from the internet .
Manufacturers and retailers use them to fine tune their supply chains .
Call centres decide where to place an incoming call , based on things such as the customer 's location , the length of queues that operators have to deal with and the reason for people calling .
Jeff Gordon , who looks after innovation for Convergys , a call - centre operator , says that the efficiency of algorithms is as crucial to his industry as the quality of call agents :
“ If you get the algorithm wrong and put customers into the wrong hands you degrade the experience .
No one likes being handed off to someone else . ”
The most powerful algorithms are those that cope with continual changes ( see article ) .
The delivery schedules for online grocers have huge “ feedback loops ” in which the delivery times chosen by customers affect the routes that vans take , which in turn affects the choice of delivery slots made available to customers .
UPS is working on a real - time algorithm for its drivers that can recalibrate the order of deliveries on the fly , in much the same way that satellite - navigation systems in cars adjust themselves if a driver chooses to ignore a suggested route .
In the world of the internet , operators are looking at ways of marrying up the algorithms that find the shortest path through a network and those that control the speed with which information flows .
At the moment , the routing algorithm does not talk to the flow - control algorithm , which means paths do not change even when there is congestion .
According to Marc Wennink , a researcher at Britain 's BT , combining the algorithms would mean that tasks such as downloading files could become much more resilient to network disruption .
It would also allow BT to make better use of its existing network capacity .
Airports also have a keen interest in dynamic algorithms .
Passengers at London 's Heathrow and other congested airports often sit in a long queue of planes waiting near the runway to depart .
Delays happen because air - traffic controllers need to leave a safety margin between aircraft as they take off .
This margin depends on the size and speed of an aircraft , and re-ordering the queue can minimise the delay before all the planes get into the air ( mathematicians call this the departure problem ) .
Air - traffic controllers have always reordered planes in the departure queue manually , but researchers are working on algorithms that would be more efficient .
Just as optimisation algorithms come in handy when people are swamped by vast numbers of permutations , so statistical algorithms help firms to grapple with complex datasets .
Dunnhumby , a data - analysis firm , uses algorithms to crunch data on customer behaviour for a number of clients .
Its best - known customer ( and majority - owner ) is Tesco , a British supermarket with a Clubcard loyalty - card scheme that generates a mind - numbing flow of data on the purchases of 13 m members across 55,000 product lines .
To make sense of it all , Dunnhumby 's analysts cooked up an algorithm called the rolling ball .
It works by assigning attributes to each of the products on Tesco 's shelves .
These range from easy - to - cook to value - for - money , from adventurous to fresh .
In order to give ratings for every dimension of a product , the rolling - ball algorithm starts at the extremes : ostrich burgers , say , would count as very adventurous .
The algorithm then trawls through Tesco 's purchasing data to see what other products ( staples such as milk and bread aside ) tend to wind up in the same shopping baskets as ostrich burgers do .
Products that are strongly associated will score more highly on the adventurousness scale .
As the associations between products become progressively weaker on one dimension , they start to get stronger on another .
The ball has rolled from one attribute to another .
With every product categorised and graded across every attribute , Dunnhumby is able to segment and cluster Tesco 's customers based on what they buy .
Where to put the biscuits
The rolling - ball algorithm is in its fourth version .
Refinements occur every year or two , to add new attributes or to tweak the maths .
All these data then feed into a variety of decisions , such as the ranges to put into each store and which products should sit next to each other on the shelves .
“ All this sophisticated data analysis and it comes down to where you put the biscuits , ” laments Martin Hayward , director of consumer strategy at Dunnhumby .
Fraud detection has a touch more glamour to it .
SPSS , another data - analysis firm , uses algorithms to scrutinise customer data and to build propensity scores that predict how people will behave .
One of its clients is ClearCommerce , which provides payment - processing services to online merchants .
SPSS helped ClearCommerce to build a system that looks at a customer 's past transactions and learns what hints at fraud — it might be the amount of money being spent , the shipping details and the time of day , and so on .
Transactions then get a fraud - propensity score based on these characteristics ; merchants decide which scores should ring alarm bells and how to respond .
Algorithms are most commonly associated with internet - search engines .
“ The tussle between MSN , Google and Yahoo ! is about whose algorithm produces the best results to a query , ” observes Microsoft 's Mr Herbert .
Ask.com , another search engine , has even tried to popularise the term in an advertising campaign .
Few other types of companies are so obviously dependent on algorithms for success , but the role that they play is rising in importance for two reasons .
The first is the sheer amount of data that is now available to companies .
The information floodwaters are rising everywhere .
Smart meters give utility firms data on consumption patterns inside households .
Digital media will make it easier for firms such as Dunnhumby to see how what people read online and watch on television affects what they buy .
Online shopping means that internet merchants now know what customers are browsing as well as buying .
Search engines are mining their own information on the relationship between queries and clickthroughs so as to improve their ranking algorithms .
“ For the first time in business history there is more information than many organisations ' capacity to deal with it , ” says Dunnhumby 's Mr Hayward .
Algorithms are a way to cope .
The second reason why algorithms are becoming more important is that companies inevitably want to use all this new data to do more complicated things .
In particular , they want to respond to each customer in a personalised way .
Tesco does this by using its analysis to tailor direct - marketing offers to each Clubcard member .
As well as segmenting its customers on how they live , the data also enable the supermarket rapidly to spot shifts in their consumption patterns ( caused by children going to university , say ) .
Tesco 's response rates to such targeted marketing stands at 10 - 20 % , against an industry average of only around 1 % .
Convergys wants to bring more real - time data to the operation of call - centres .
Mr Gordon gives the example of a customer who calls an electricity utility from an area that has suffered a power failure and , because of where they are speaking from , is automatically put through to an operator who can deal with his queries .
Such algorithms help firms to tease simplicity from complexity .
Algorithms are not for everyone .
Some companies will always generate more data than others , of course : retailers , utilities and telecoms firms process many more transactions than house insurers , whose deals tend to happen once a year .
Some will also be more focused than others on how algorithms can shave costs or maximise capacity .
Firms that enjoy high margins and strong demand are going to be less worried about the efficiency of their supply chains , says Hau Lee , of Stanford Graduate School of Business .
Rocket science for non-boffins
What is more , lots of things have to fall into place for algorithms to work .
They tend to be highly complex : it is not easy to find people with the right skills to develop and refine them .
The systems within which the algorithms run — the user interface — need to be intuitive to non-boffins .
“ This is rocket science but you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to use it , ” says Jack Noonan , boss of SPSS .
The inputs have to be right .
One UPS planning model routed all the packages in the system through Iowa , which perplexed everyone until they found an error in the data that made it appear to be free to send packages via Iowa .
The algorithm was right , in other words , but the data were wrong .
Mr Noonan says that SPSS 's “ secret sauce ” lies in its ability to deal with missing or unreliable data , rather than the algorithms themselves .
Above all , human judgment still has a role — a point perhaps reinforced by the recent performance of algorithmically driven quantitative funds in the financial markets .
In fraud detection , for example , algorithms can eliminate the majority of transactions that are above suspicion but a human is still best placed to analyse the dodgy ones .
Dunnhumby is trying to overlay attitudinal research on top of purchasing data to understand why people buy things as well as what they buy .
Even so , Autonomy 's Mr Lynch is convinced that algorithms are on the march .
Algorithms process data to arrive at an answer .
The more data they can process the more accurate the answer .
For that reason , he says , “ they are bound to take over the world ” .

MONTEBELLO , Quebec , Aug 20 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush met the leaders of Canada and Mexico at a luxurious cedar chateau on Monday to bolster economic and security ties , but protesters decried the gathering ’s secrecy and shouted for Bush to go home .
Dubbed the “ Three Amigos summit , ” the two - day meeting of Bush , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Felipe Calderon was also expected to look at the credit crunch and turmoil gripping global financial markets .
One uncertainty concerning the summit ’s schedule arose as Hurricane Dean threatened to batter Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula , raising speculation that Calderon might leave Canada early .
Mexican officials said there were no immediate plans for Calderon to return home but they were looking into it .
Canada and Mexico have been frustrated that growth in trade among the partners to the North American Free Trade Agreement , or NAFTA , has been held back by the U.S. crackdown on the border following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 .
To try to tackle that problem , the countries have developed the Security and Prosperity Partnership , or SPP .
But the agenda has upset activists on the left and the right who contend it will erode national sovereignty .
As Bush and Calderon arrived at the resort in Montebello , Quebec , more than 2,000 demonstrators descended on the village as well and squared off with police in riot gear .
Some were dressed in black with their faces covered by kerchiefs .
They banged on drums and chanted , “ Arrest the criminals inside the fence ” and “ George Bush go home . ”
But Harper dismissed the demonstrations .
“ I ’ve heard it ’s nothing .
A couple hundred ?
It ’s sad , ” the Canadian prime minister said just before leading Bush into the log-cabin resort .
Further raising the ire of the summit ’s critics is a 3 - metre ( 10 - foot ) fence put up around the hotel to keep protesters at bay .
Protesters said the talks were being carried out behind the backs of ordinary citizens and without any votes planned in the Canadian Parliament or U.S. Congress .
They also criticized plans for consultations with corporate leaders .
“ I particularly oppose war criminal Bush seeking to annex Canada and Mexico , to put the armed forces and police services under U.S. command .
It ’s all very dangerous , ” said Dean Lawveri , 39 , of New York state .
Late in the day , a small group of protesters began to hurl rocks , bottles and cans at police , who fired tear gas to break up the crowd .
HURRICANE STIRS UNCERTAINTY OVER SCHEDULE
Calderon had been scheduled to spend an extra day in Canada , visiting with Harper in the Gatineau hills in Quebec and then addressing a business lunch in Toronto , but there was speculation he could cut his visit short .
Forecasters said Hurricane Dean had the potential to be catastrophic and it was expected to hit Mexico ’s border with Belize early on Tuesday .
Bush and Calderon were meeting for the first time since legislation to overhaul U.S. immigration policies collapsed in Congress , in a blow to an issue of key concern to Mexico .
The Bush administration has moved to increase scrutiny and set heftier fines on businesses that hire illegal immigrants .
Bush and Calderon were also expected to discuss a package of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid the United States is considering for Mexico to help fight drug cartels , but a deal was not expected to be announced at the summit .
A senior Canadian official told reporters that Harper and Bush , in a one - on - one meeting , discussed Canada ’s role in Afghanistan , and the Canadian leader reiterated that any future role for Canada in Afghanistan would need the endorsement of parliament .
Harper is keen to discuss Canada ’s concerns about Russia ’s symbolic laying of claim to the North Pole , where it placed a flag on the seabed .
( With reporting by Caren Bohan and Randall Palmer in Ottawa and Alister Bell in Mexico City )
One of my interests , dating back 25 years to when I was a member of my local FFA land judging team , is soil conservation .
I have long been interested in things like terra preta and composting because of their ability to build topsoil .
But I never thought much about how difficult it can be to build up topsoil until I read Kim Stanley Robinson 's Mars Trilogy - Red Mars , Green Mars and Blue Mars ( great books , by the way ) .
The books trace a future hypothetical terraforming of Mars , and one of the major difficulties the characters face is producing topsoil on the planet .
It was then that my interest in the mechanisms for topsoil erosion and topsoil production greatly increased .
" We stand , in most places on earth , only six inches from desolation , for that is the thickness of the topsoil layer upon which the entire life of the planet depends . "
R. Neil Sampson in Farmland or Wasteland : A Time to Choose
While I would eventually like to get some experience with producing terra preta , earlier this year I got a flyer from Waste Aware Scotland for discounted composters .
So , I bought one , and started to experiment .
I wish I had done so years ago , because it has really been a fascinating exercise .
My 330 Liter ecoMax
I got the larger 330 L ( 87 gallon ) model shown above and started dumping all things cellulosic into it .
There is quite a little tropical ecosystem inside the composter .
Even when it is cold outside , the waste is always steaming .
And not only has it attracted numerous earthworms , but there are beetles , slugs , and lots of insects I have n't been able to identify .
Besides being an interesting science experiment , there are major environmental benefits from composting .
According to the most recent newsletter from Waste Aware Scotland :
• It reduces waste sent to landfill Scotland produces 900,000 tonnes of organic waste a year .
That ’s enough to fill Hampden Stadium more than 18 times .
We could divert a large amount of organic waste from landfill by using it for home composting .
• Reduce global warming Organic waste sent to landfill cannot decompose properly because it does n’t have access to air .
As a result , it produces methane , which is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
•
Your garden benefits Compost improves soil , so plants in your garden become healthier and more pest and disease resistant .
They will produce better fruit and vegetables and more beautiful blooms .
As I explained to my daughter , who recently told me she wants to become more environmentally responsible , there are two ways in which composting combats global warming .
The first is the reduction of anaerobic digestion , which results in methane production as explained above .
Because methane is such a potent greenhouse gas , this is not something you want occurring in an open landfill .
But the second benefit is that home composting reduces the mass of material that would be transported ( via fossil fuels ) to the landfill .
So home composting is much more environmentally responsible than throwing your waste in the trash .
So , what can you compost ?
Again , referring back to the newsletter :
Kitchen waste : ✔ Fruit scraps and vegetable peelings
✔ Tea leaves / bags and coffee grounds
✔ Egg shells
✔ Paper items which can include scrunched up cardboard , egg boxes , toilet roll tubes , vacuum cleaner bags , cereal boxes and paper towels Garden waste : ✔ Cut flowers
✔ Garden and house plants
✔ Grass cuttings
✔ Young annual weeds
✔ Shredded twigs
✔ Hedge trimmings
✔ Straw and hay
✔ Wood chippings and sawdust
✔ Hamster or other pet bedding
If you start to segregate your garbage , you will find that these items make up a substantial portion of what would normally go to the landfill .
Inside My Composter - Yuck
In the picture above , the composter contains about 30 gallons of composting material .
But I have filled it to the top at least 10 times and have n't taken anything out of it .
In other words , that 30 gallons of material was originally around 1,000 gallons .
It is amazing how much the volume is reduced as it decomposes .
But that also goes to show how much material it takes to produce an inch of topsoil .
So get yourself a composter ( or make one ) and do a bit more for the environment .
You may even find that you enjoy it .
The US government has released its first official list of detainees at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp .
The list of 558 people comprises three - quarters of the total number of detainees who have passed through the camp , which was set up in 2002 after the end of the war in Afghanistan .
Secrecy surrounding the camp , and persistent reports of human rights violations , have attracted notoriety for the prison , in the US naval base in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The people named on the detainee list come from 41 countries , although nearly two - thirds are from Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia and Yemen .
Former officials of Afghanistan 's Taliban regime are particularly prominent on the tally .
The Taliban 's former defence ministry chief of staff Mullah Mohammed Fazil is still in custody along with intelligence officials Abdul Haq Wasiq and Gholam Ruhani .
Kabul 's former ambassador to Pakistan , Abdul Salam Zaeef , is also included , although he was released from the prison camp late last year .
Also included on the list is David Hicks , an Australian for whom lawyers are currently fighting to establish British citizenship via his mother , who was born in south London .
The court of appeal last week rejected a home office claim that he was not entitled to register his citizenship on account of his previous alleged membership of al - Qaida .
The Guardian today reported that foreign secretary Jack Straw had written to US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice demanding the release from Guantánamo Bay of UK resident Bisher al - Rawi .
Mr Rawi , an Iraqi citizen , took the British government to court last month claiming he had been hired by MI5 to track an alleged Muslim extremist and was only arrested after British intelligence passed false information to the US .
Another detainee named on the list is Muhammed al - Qahtani , accused of being the 20th hijacker in the September 11 attacks .
The Saudi citizen was stopped as he tried to enter the US in Orlando , Florida , shortly before the attacks .
Details of Qahtani's interrogation caused outrage and shed fresh light on the techniques used in Guantánamo Bay when a logbook was leaked to Time magazine last year .
He was frequently awoken at 4 am and interrogated until after midnight , with requests for toilet breaks refused until he wet himself , while Christina Aguilera music was played at him if he dozed off .
The list has previously been seen by members of the Red Cross , but was only publicly released after the Associated Press news agency sued US authorities under the freedom of information act .
It numbers all the detainees who have appeared at hearings in Guantánamo Bay to determine their combatant status .
The hearings took place between July 2004 and January 2005 .
All detainees at the prison between those dates received a hearing , but only 38 of them were determined to be " no longer enemy combatants " by the military tribunals , and only 29 of those were released .
A total of around 750 people are believed to have passed through the camp , and 490 are currently believed to be in custody there .
Groups working for the release of detainees welcomed the release of the list .
Sayeed Sharif Youssefi , an official from Afghanistan 's independent peace and reconciliation commission , said it would help in his efforts to obtain the release of Afghan detainees .
" This is very good news and it helps us because now it is easy for us to identify the Afghans in Guantánamo , learn how many there are and from which provinces they come from , " he said .
Bill Goodman , legal director of the Centre for Constitutional Rights said : " This is information that should have been released a long time ago , and it 's a scandal that it has n't been . "
In recent years , there have been reports that the area around the Chernobyl nuclear plant had become something of a wildlife playground .
The reports suggested that animals like wild boar , wolves and moose had flourished in the 40 - mile - diameter “ exclusion zone , ” which was contaminated by low - level radiation from the disaster in Ukraine 21 years ago .
But Timothy A. Mousseau , a biologist at the University of South Carolina and co-director of the university ’s Chernobyl research initiative , said there had not been systematic studies of wildlife there .
“ When we sat down to review the literature , we realized that most of these claims were just that — claims , ” he said .
So Dr. Mousseau and his co-director , Anders P. Moller of Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris , decided to systematically study the animals they know best : birds .
Wearing a protective suit , Dr. Moller conducted simple bird counts throughout the zone .
Radiation levels were measured at each site .
Close to 1,600 birds were counted , representing 57 species .
But as the researchers report in Biology Letters , both the number of species and abundance of individual birds declined with increasing radiation levels .
For example , the most contaminated sites had about two - thirds fewer birds than those with normal levels of radiation .

“ I ’ve never seen people avoid ideas as much in such an obvious way , ” says the woman who wears the same slinky black dress to every interview and every speech , presumably to show off her legs and her cleavage ( though it ’s possible she ’s simply doing an extended walk of shame from a decade - long one - night stand ) , and who every interview makes some outrageous comment , like wishing that John Edwards were assassinated or mocking the death of his teenage son in a car crash , in order to get attention .
Yes , Ann Coulter never tries to avoid ideas .
She is a walking caricature of herself .
But what ’s most telling is how thin - skinned she is ( which is a lesson that everyone should take to heart – responding to Coulter does n’t help her cause , it drives her crazy AND she is a walking embarrassment to the GOP and the conservative cause ) .
Listen to the tape .
She ’s on the verge of losing it , even though she ’s hardly being challenged at all .
She walks around calling people “ fags , ” mocking their dead children , wishing that they were murdered , then when people respond by saying “ uh , you ’re kind of mean , ” Ann flips out over the level of venom that ’s directed against her .
The lady is a tramp .
UPDATE : Greg Sargent notes that the article that Ann cites as “ one of the greatest columns ever written ” is the one in which she mocks the death of John Edwards ’ son .
Real class act .

■ M-20エミュレータ -2009年7月29 日(水) 21時50 分
Google CodeでM-20エミュレータ開発プロジェクトを見つけた。
http://code.google.com/p/m20/
これは、旧ソ連の1950年代後期の汎用機、M-20のエミュレータを作ろうというプロジェクトである。
M-20は1958年に登場した語長45bit、メモリ空間4096ワードのコアメモリと、12288ワードの容量を持つ磁気ドラム、その他磁気テープ等の外部記憶装置をサポートした汎用コンピュータである。高信頼性小型真空管1600本とゲルマニウムダイオード多数によって構成され、浮動小数点演算をサポートして0.02MFLOPSの性能を持っていた。
1958年はアメリカで最初の全トランジスタ機IBM7070が生まれた年である。ただ、この時期のソ連の技術が大きく遅れていたと一概に決め付けることはできない。例えば、M-20は、自動ミサイル迎撃システム用のスペシャル機M-40の民生化バージョンだったのだが、M-40は1956年に0.04MIPSの性能を達成している。当時の最高速機というと、1955年に登場したIBM704で、性能は同じく0.04MIPSである。
M-20の基本的な命令構成はソ連における極初期のコンピュータ、BESMとほぼ同じものだったが、アーキテクチャは命令の一部同時実行と非同期出力によって大幅な性能向上を達成していた。桁上がりも高速化され、1,2,4bitのシフト命令が追加されて、加減算と積算は大幅に高速化されている。プログラムのうち次に使用される命令はROMから予めRAMに呼び出された。
動作の遅い出力装置の動作終了を待つことなく次の命令を実行できる非同期化は、磁気ドラムにバッファメモリを搭載することによって実現されていた。
このようなアーキテクチャ改良は、同時期のIBMのコンピュータ709にも見られた。特にプログラムの先行読み出しは、その後のパイプラインやキャッシュメモリといった高速化技法のはしりとして評価できる。M-20ではそのために、命令を固定長化し、柔軟なインデックス操作演算を可能としていた。
開発はソ連コンピュータの祖であるレベデフ(С.А.Лебедев)を総責任者とし、論理及びコマンドセット設計をシュラブラ(М.Р.Шура-Бура)が、渉外交渉をスルム( М.К.Сулим)が担当した。
この開発 はITMVIT(精密機械およびコンピュータ研究所)が中心となっていたが、開発へのSDB-245(第245特別設計局)の参加が政府から働きかけられた。ITMVITはアーキテクチャ及び回路設計とコンポ−ネント開発を担当し、
SDB-245 はドキュメント管理と試験モデルの製作を担当した。
1957年初頭に、M-20の試験モデルが組み立てられ、予想に反して複雑なものになったことが判明した。改良が必要である事は明白であったがコンピュータに対する需要は切迫したものがあったため、レベデフはとりあえずM-20用に開発したコンポーネントをBESMのそれと交換した機種、BESM-2を場つなぎの量産機としてリリースした。
M-20は改良ののち1958年に量産が開始された。M-20ではハードウェアと一緒にシュラブラによって作られたソフトウェアが提供され、これらは性能の高さと相俟って非常な人気を呼んだ。よく考えられた命令セットはプログラマーに特に好評だった。
カザンでの商業生産は1965年まで続き、その後は半導体化され2MIPSまで性能を向上させた近代化互換機、M-220とM-222の生産に切り替えられた。
M-20がソ連のコンピュータ史において重要であるのは、ユーザーグループの結成されたソ連最初のコンピュータであり、ソ連のソフトウェア開発史においても一つの結節点となった存在だからである。
M-20のユーザーグループは、1961年にシュラブラをその会長としてソ連科学アカデミーによって結成された。ユーザーグループの結成は、アルゴリズムとプログラムの研究、標準化されたソフトウェアとプログラム言語の開発、そしてそれら成果の効率的な相互交換を目的としていた。ユーザーグループにより情報交換の機会が現れたことは、ほぼ即座に多くの成果へと繋がっていった。
ALGOL-60の完全な仕様記述が西側で出版されるとすぐに、M-20への実装プロジェクトが彼らの中で3つ平行して開始された。
S. Lavrov は TA -1コンパイラを開発した。TA-1にはある程度の再帰を実現すると同時に、再帰でメモリを食い潰さないよう安全装置が組み込まれていた。同時に、最適化をOFFにするクイックコンパイルのオプションが用意されていた。
シュラブラと Lyubimsky はTA - 2コンパイラでALGOL-60の完全な実装を目指した。
このコンパイラでは完全な再帰がサポートされ、柔軟な型指定と数学的に抽象化されたメモリ空間が実現されていた。
シュラブラは更にIS-2インタプリタを作った。整備されたライブラリサブリーチンは、このインタプリタをある種のオペレーティングシステムにしていた。やがてIS-2は人気のある言語となっていった。
A.P. Ershov 、 G.I. Kozhukhin と l.V. Pottosin はALPHAコンパイラを開発した。彼らはALGOL-60を拡張し、ALPHA言語を創造した。
ALPHAは変数宣言時の初期値代入や複素数のサポートを機能として持っていたが、再帰をサポートしなかった。ALPHAコンパイラは中間言語を生成するマルチパスコンパイラで、これでメモリの節約とライブラリ使用の高速化を実現した。
さて、このプロジェクトでは、M-20エミュレータのみならず、Cコンパイラ、アセンブラ、ディスアセンブラまで作ろうとしている。M-20にCコンパイラが存在していたとは聞いたことが無いし、その歴史において存在もしなかっただろう。ただ、ソースの中にはIS-2インタプリタ言語のバイナリイメージがあるようだ。但しサンプルではまともな応答が得られていない。
シミュレータの動作は確認できた。テキスト出力が化けるのは仕方が無い。アセンブラは……アセンブラソースはUTF-8のロシア語表記で書かないといけないようだ。
BESM-6のエミュレータのほうは相変わらず開発が進んでいるようだ。
http://sourceforge.net/projects/besm6/
上記プロジェクトは、以前紹介したhttp://www.mailcom.com/besm6/のソースとは系統が違うようだ。割とすんなりとコンパイルできた。新しいプロジェクトのエミュレータは、UTF-8を含む複数の文字コードをサポートしている。ウェットストーンがさくっと実行できた。完成度はかなり高い。

■ NOTSNIK # 2 - 2009年6月16日(火) 22時40 分
1948年7月4日に、まず地上からの発射試験が行われた。これは一段目の4本束ねた固体モータのうち2本をダミーにして、残り2本で点火と安定飛翔ができるかを試したのだが、これは点火1秒後に爆発した。7月18日に同じ試験を行ったが、これまた同じ結果に終わっている。機体はほとんど飛翔することなく爆発したのだ。
しかし、こんなザマの代物を飛行機に乗せてフルシステム、本番の飛行が8月25日に行われた。カリフォルニアのインヨカーン基地から飛び立ったF4Dは問題なくNOTS-EV-1を分離、NOTS-EV-1は爆発することも無く飛翔を続け、F4Dはそのままムグ基地に降りた。全ては完璧に動作したように見えたが、しかし、衛星からの信号は確認することは出来なかった。
8月12日に二度目の飛行が行われた。しかしNOTS-EV-1は点火直後に爆発した。
チャイナレイクでは地上試験が続けられていた。8月16日の試験は、点火3.2秒後に機体破壊により失敗。翌17日の試験では点火3秒後に再び機体破壊。
こんな有様でもフルシステム打ち上げ飛行は続行された。地上でよく飛ばないような代物をよく航空機に搭載するものだと思うのだが、チャイナレイクの連中はもともと機載ミサイルの開発が専門で、サイドワインダー空対空ミサイルも彼らが作ったものだった。だから彼らにとって空中発射こそがやりたいことであって、リスクが少なく安全で大型化が見込める地上発射には興味が無かったのだ。
8月22日の飛行では、再びNOTS-EV-1の正常な動作が確認できた。が、結局衛星からの信号は確認することは出来なかった。疑わしい信号がニュージーランドの地上局で2,3例捕捉されたが、本物であるという確証は全く無い。
8月25日の飛行では、NOTS-EV-1は飛行開始0.75秒後に爆発した。8月26日の飛行ではNOTS-EV-1は分離後一段目に点火せず、そのまま太平洋上に落下した。8月28日の飛行では一段目の固体モータペアのうち1つに点火せず、そのまま構造破壊してしまう。
こうしてNOTS-EV-1の6回の打ち上げは全て失敗し、プロジェクトPilotは終了した。
しかしNOTSNIKは亡霊として蘇った。今度は母機をF-4ファントムIIに変更し、先代の最大の失敗原因だった一段目をクラスタではない単体の新造固体モータに変更したのだ。ちなみにF4Dはその頃の海軍の命名規則改定で、F-6ということになっている。
プロジェク トCaleb、新型機NOTS-EV-2はサウンディングロケットHi-Hoeとして、またASATプロジェクトSIP( Satellite Interceptor Program ) として生きてゆくことになる 。
NOTS-EV-2は一段目が新造固体モータNOTS-500、二段目は改良型のABL X248、三段目と四段目は変化無しだった。四段目の改良型が開発されていたが、但し三段目と四段目は現実には搭載されず、フルシステムの飛行はついに行われなかった。
Hi-Hoeは弾道飛行ミッションとして、1960年7月から1962年まで、空中発射5回、そして成功は最後の一回のみだった。
SIP計画ではNOTS-EV-2は地上打ち上げで運用されることとなった。こちらは二度の打ち上げはいずれも成功したものの、フルシステムの試験に進むことなく開発は打ち切られた。この計画は後のASAT開発の嚆矢として評価する向きもあるようだが、ASATは上段に誘導システムがなければ成立しない。コールドガススラスタを持ち恐らくレーダーで誘導される誘導弾頭衛星が開発されていたが、この目標は当時の技術水準を越えたものである。また、SIPは地上発射で、しかも二回中途半端な試射をしたきりで中断されている。SIP計画は後のASATに殆ど影響を与えていないというのが、正直なところの自分の評価である。
こうして衛星打ち上げの夢、NOTSNIKの夢はきっぱりと絶たれ、逆に衛星を攻撃するASAT機への切ない転進を果たしたNOTS-EV-2は、最後にはもうありとあらゆる夢破れた残骸に成り果てたのだった。

■ NOTSNIK # 1 - 2009年6月15日(月) 22時08 分
スプートニク打ち上げは世界に様々な影響をもたらしたが、そのうちの一つ、プロジェクトPilot、通称NOTSNIKは、フォン・ブラウンらとは違う知られざるアメリカの宇宙への挑戦だった。
プロジェク トPilotで開発された空中発射式衛星打ち上げシステムNOTS-EV-1は、F4D戦闘機から空中発射される5段式全固体打ち上げ機である。システム全重量は(F4Dを含まないで)900kg、ペイロードは最上段込み(燃焼終了後)
で1.05kg、赤外線センサを積んで地上監視を行うことを目的としていた。
この計画はカリフォルニア州チャイナレイクの海軍兵器テストステーション( NOTS )で提案され、1958年初めに開発は承認された。これは1958年8月の高々度核実験オペレーションArgusに間に合わせることを目指していた。ペイロードである衛星の通称がNOTSNIK、これはNOTSとスプートニクの合成語である。
F4Dスカイレイ戦闘機は打ち上げ機NOTS-EV-1を翼パイロンにぶら下げて飛び、高度12500m、時速740km(マッハ0.7)で50度機首を上げてズーム上昇から分離、発射する。そのためF4Dを初段とする6段式システムだと言う人もいる。しかし初段としては200m/s程度しかデルタVを稼いでおらず、高度も0.2気圧とまだまだ高いところでの分離なので、正直空中発射も大して嬉しくない。
しかも、所詮下段は既成品の固体モータを4つ束ねただけの代物で能動姿勢制御も無く、まっすぐ飛べるのは尾翼のおかげである。これではあまり高空で分離しても無意味だっただろう。チャイナレイクの連中は基本的に空中発射の利点を理解しないまま開発をおこなっている。特に一段目モータを4つ束ねることは高膨張ノズルの使用を制限していた。このシステムの利点は射点を自由に設定できること位しか無い。
一段目/二段目は4本束ねられたUMM-44サブロック用固体モータHOTROCなのだが、一段目はそのうちの対称位置の2基、これが分離3秒後に5秒燃やされ、更にそこから12秒後に、残り2基の固体モータがまた5秒燃やされるという具合で、一段目と二段目は分離されない。だから純正のロケット屋的、ツィオルコフスキー的には、これは変な燃焼の仕方をする一段目でしかない。
三段目(ツィオルコフスキー的二段目)が点火する頃には高度は80kmを超えている。ようやく一段目と二段目が分離され、恐らくここで全体を覆うフェアリングが投棄される。ここから上の段はスピンで姿勢安定を図った筈で、三段目点火前にスピンモータか何かで機体にスピンをかけたと思われる。
三段目 はABL X241モータで、これの燃焼が一番長く36秒である。四段目の新造NOTS-100固体モータの燃焼は5.7秒、そして衛星でもある五段目の、3インチ径500グラムの球状固体モータのひと押しで1.05kgの衛星は軌道に乗る筈だった。ちなみに五段目は進行方向に対して逆噴射の位置に向いている。全てにおいて能動姿勢制御は無い。F4Dからの分離時角度が50度で、重力損失を差し引いて大体弾道飛行する筈であり、弾道飛行の頂点で水平に噴射するのが最も効率的だが、タイミングを計ればこの位置でも衛星は軌道に乗る。
ロケットは分離時の姿勢のまま真っ直ぐ加速していることを思い出して欲しい。ロケットはそのままの姿勢を保つが、地球を周回するおかげでロケットの対地角度は時間が経つにつれてどんどん変わる。噴射して軌道に乗ることができるベクトルがやがてやってくることが理解できただろうか。五段目が横に噴射できれば話は簡単だったのだろうが、ノズルが横向きではなく上向きなのは、スピンしている(筈の)NOTS-EV-1打ち上げ機で姿勢が確定しているのは機軸方向だけだからである。他に選択肢は無いのだ。
スピンしていなければ絶対姿勢安定が取れないNOTS-EV-1だが、五段目は見るからにスピン姿勢安定を意識した姿になっている。バーベルの重りの一番小さな円盤の真ん中の穴にノズルを生やした形状で、直径20センチの円盤の、側面の一箇所にセンサ用の穴が開いている。この中央に球状固体モータが埋め込まれていた。
衛星は遠地点高度2400km、近地点高度60kmという、極端に近地点の近い楕円軌道に乗る筈だった。この低さでは1周回できるかも怪しい。この軌道は狙ったものではなく、システムの限界からきたものだろう。衛星の赤外線センサは初期の極めて原始的なものだったが、イメージを取得して地上に送信可能だったとされている。また、オペレーションArgusにあわせて上空の大気密度を取得する筈だった。
■ 日本における大陸間弾道ミサイル開発史#2 -2009年4月1 日( 水) 00時07 分
日本が配備した第二世代目の弾道ミサイルは、十式対地弾道弾の後継として開発されていた、いわゆる" G-XI " ではなかった。それはそもそも別の必要から生まれたミサイルだったのだ。
北朝鮮の弾道ミサイルに対する日本のパニックにも似た感情は、偵察衛星の配備に続いて、独自の早期警戒衛星の開発と配備に踏み切らせた。これは短期的には北朝鮮の弾道ミサイルを、中長期的には中国とロシアのものを監視対象とするものとなり、そしてとにかく近々の脅威、すなわち北朝鮮の弾道ミサイル発射を探知する事を至上命題として開発が開始された。
開発は開発スケジュール策定の段階で大きな問題に直面する事となる。試験の最終段階では実際の弾道ミサイルの発射を探知しなければならない。当初、最終試験を2014年下半期、日米共同開発のスタンダードSM-3の迎撃試験にあわせて、ウェーク島から打ち上げられるオービタルサイエンスSR-19/SR-19固体二段式ロケットターゲットを観測することで行なう方向で、日米の政府間調整が行なわれていた。実際のところ、衛星配備予定の東経140度付近の静止軌道から打ち上げを観察できるアメリカの射点は、ウェークしか無かったのだ。
しかし、この迎撃実験は、アメリカ西海岸のムグ射点から打ち上げたものをハワイ東沖合で迎撃するというものに変更された。これでは弾道ミサイルの発する噴射炎を衛星から観測する事ができない。この変更は日本側からの抗議にも関わらず強行された。これは日米共同開発であるスタンダードSM-3ブロックIIと違い、日本独自開発である早期警戒衛星の開発を手助けするべきではないという論調が米議会にあったことが原因だった。これはこの時期、日本の衛星開発の最大手ベンダーにロッキードマーチン及び長城工業総公司が早期警戒衛星の売り込みを行なっていたのと無関係ではあるまい。
主センサの航空機での基礎実証試験に2011年度に成功した日本は、衛星の独自開発を強行した。これは国家の安全保障のために不可欠な衛星には公開入札の必要は無いとする日本政府に対し、中米両国が”実用衛星に関して公開入札を行なう”という約束を遵守するよう求めたため、最悪中国製の衛星を買う羽目になることを恐れて早期警戒衛星を技術開発衛星扱いにしたためである。同時に情報収集衛星も技術開発衛星扱いであるとされた。
一時は、衛星の静止軌道上の位置を変更して試験を行なう事さえ考慮されたが、最終的に試験用ターゲットは内製することとなった。試験用ターゲットとして関係者の脳裏にあったのは種子島に保存されているJ-Iロケット二号機だった。
防衛省技術研究本部に移管されたJ-I 二号機から二段目以上が取り払われ、代わりに1.5トンの模擬弾頭が取り付けられた。もともとのJ-I 二号機の誘導方式は無線誘導だったが、地上設備の都合で慣性誘導に変更された。この"早期警戒衛星機能実証試験ターゲット"( EWSTT-1)の打ち上げは、2014年11月に新島射場から行なわれ、目的の機能実証試験共々成功した。しかし、ここで関係者は、図らずも射程2000km超の単段固体弾道ミサイルを作ってしまった事に気が付いてしまった。これは二段目を付けるとアメリカのMGM-118Aピースキーパーに匹敵する性能になる。
日本が本格的な核武装に踏み切ったのは2016年初頭の頃と思われる。日本の核兵器開発の最大の障害は国民感情と核実験場の確保だったが、これを同時に解決する方法を政府は発明したのだ。
日中冷戦が深刻化する中、日本政府は突如として北朝鮮に対する従前の方針を放棄し、北朝鮮の立場に理解を示す発言を行い、金融と食料、エネルギーを含む広範囲の支援を約束した。これには日本による緊急エネルギー支援の約束が大きな力となったとみられる。2017年には歴史的な日朝平和条約が締結されたが、この時に秘密条約が締結されたとみる筋は多い。金正日死去後の混乱状況で北朝鮮の指導体制は日本の強圧を受け入れざるを得なかったとみられる。
2019年4月、北朝鮮は大型固体燃料タイプの新型弾道ミサイルの試射を行なった。試射は北朝鮮平安北道の鳳東里射場からほぼ真南に向けて行なわれ、黄海上を飛翔して南シナ海の、中国本土と沖縄本島のほぼ中間地点の公海上に着弾した。この試射に対し、日本を含む周辺諸国は抗議したが、直後に既に、弾道ミサイルが日本製ではないかという疑いが持ち上がっている。その後9月にも同様の試射が行なわれ、これは南硫黄島沖に着弾したが、これは二号早期警戒衛星の打ち上げ三ヵ月後というタイミングだったことを特記したい。
最初の日本製核弾頭が北朝鮮に搬入されたのは2020年4月だという説と6月という説がある。複数の、恐らく複数種類の再突入対応爆縮型弾頭が北朝鮮に搬入された。2020年11月、咸鏡北道の地下核試験場と目される地点を中心にして、複数の15キロトン級の核爆発と見られる振動が確認されている。2021年11月には5キロトン級の核爆発が観測されている。
2023年4月、350キロトン級の、恐らく熱核爆弾の爆発と見られる振動が観測され、日本が北朝鮮を核実験場として使用しているという憶測はほぼ裏付けられる事となった。
この核弾頭搭載弾道ミサイルは " 弾道ミサイル模擬ターゲット" ( BMD - TEST-T ) と呼ばれるモバイルランチャー一式という形で、およそ20機が秘密裏に北朝鮮各地に展開しているものと思われている。これらは建前上全て”北朝鮮の核”であり、日本が配備、保有しているものではない。しかし、北朝鮮のIAEA査察拒否に関して、日本も非難された事に抗議して、2029年4月、日本は国連を脱退し、以後戦争への道をひた走る事となる。

■ MirのMSX - 2008年9月2日(火) 22時22 分
旧ソ連/ロシアの宇宙ステーション・ミール(Мир)で8ビットマイコンMSXが使用されたという話が、時々思い出したかのように話題になることがある。そこではまず事実関係が明確にされることも無く、酷い場合には、ミールはMSXで動かされていた等という与太が展開される事になる。
ミールは各モジュール毎に旧ソ連/ロシア製の宇宙用コンピュータを複数台搭載していた。コアモジュールはSalyut-5Bというウクライナ製の主制御コンピュータと、ロシア製Argon-16コンピュータを副制御コンピュータとして、以下に姿勢制御用のTsVM-1、各モジュールのMorion等がぶら下がる構成だった。
MSX の存在はドキュメント等からは確認することは出来ない。「宇宙の傑作機」を書く際に探したのだが、NASAの資料にも、MIRNEWSのアーカイブにもそれらしき記述は無かった。しかし複数の映像が残っており、MSXが確かにミールに積まれていた事を疑う余地は無い。では一体いつ、何のために使用されたのだろうか。
搭載されていたのは 、Sony 製MSX2、HB-G900である。この機種はSony MSX2 HB - F900 のプロユース版で、ビデオタイザ
G900AP というボックスが付属する。このボックスは画像処理用で、取り込んだPALビデオ信号にCGをスーパーインポーズできる。発売は1987年であり、ミールの運用初期には間に合わない。また、1990年12月のTBS特派員、秋山豊寛のミール訪問時には、そこにHB-G900は見掛けることは無かった。
HB -G900がミールで見出されるのは1993年前期からで、コアモジュールのコンソール上という一等地を占めていた。本体とビデオタイザは白い補強材で一体に加工してあるが、特徴あるフロントパネルはそのままで、だから2基のFDDスロットもROMカートリッジスロットもそのままだ。残念ながらモニタの機種は不明で、ソニー推奨の組み合わせでは無い。いかにも80年代風のモニタは色の加減から2種類あるようにも見えるが、照明の加減でそう見えるだけで恐らく一種一台のみであろう。
その後、HB-G900は少なくとも1997年まではその位置に存在したことが判っている。
また、コアモジュール奥の壁際の位置に配置されていた時期もあることが判っている。シャトル-ミールミッション中は一貫してコンソール上にあったから、それ以前か以降か、以前だとしたら、同時に映っている宇宙飛行士の船内服にエネルギヤ社のパッチがあるから、これはソ連崩壊後である。
Mirの廃棄以前の2000年頃に 、Mirを軽く内部空間を広くするためにHB-G900は廃棄されただろう。Mir廃棄時までHB-G900が軌道上に存在したとは考えにくい。
秋山豊寛のミール訪問時、コアモジュールのコンソール上、後にHB-G900が置かれる位置には大型のボックスとプラズマディスプレイのラップトップパソコンが置かれていた。ラップトップは恐らくソ連製である。当時ソ連でも、軍事などの非民生用途にはソ連製のIBM
PC互換ラップトップ機が使用されている。少なくとも1987年製のMSX2よりは上等で信頼性もあっただろう。
後 に1997 年 、 「ドラゴンフライ」で描かれる機内状況では、そこは手動ドッキングシステムTORUのコンソールのあった場所である。TORUはソニー製モニタと臨時に取り付けられる操縦桿から構成されていたと記述にある。
これまで、少なくともこの時までにHB-G900はTORUコンソールに場所を明け渡したと思っていた。ソニー製モニタとはモニタ本体のみを指すものとばかり思っていたが、しかし実はHB-G900と一体で解釈されていたのかも知れない。もしNASAの宇宙飛行士たちに、マイナーな8bitマイコンの知識があれば、もっと様々な記録が残っていただろう。
HB -G900は1993年以前に導入された事は判った。では、何に使われたのだろうか。
1990年12月と1993年の間に何があったか、思い出せるだろうか。そう、ソ連邦崩壊である。
崩壊後ミール運営側、つまりロシアは、ウクライナ製ドッキングシステムの入手性に深刻な問題を抱えることになった。自動ドッキングシステムKursは、ウクライナのユージュノエ設計局とキエフラジオ工場製で、そしてソユーズ/プログレス宇宙船1機につき一台必要な、使い捨て品だった。つまりウクライナがKursを売ってくれなければ、ドッキングは手持ちの台数分で終わりという事だ。
TORU の開発の経緯にはこういう状況があったのだが、もしかすると、TORU以前に即席のドッキング補助システムがあったとしたらどうだろうか。
そして、ロシアは更にドッキングに問題を抱える事になる。アメリカのスペースシャトルとのドッキングミッションだ。このドッキングは旧ソ連の拡張計画の範疇外の代物であり、そして当時のロシアは経済的困窮のどん底にあったわけだが、それでもミール側にもモニタは必要だっただろう。1993年にHB-G900と共に写真に写った宇宙飛行士パリッシュ( А.Ф.Полещук)は、Soyuz-TM16に乗ってやって来たが、これはAPAS-89両性具有ドッキング装置を用いてドッキングした。APAS-89はシャトルとのドッキングにも用いられ、すなわちSoyuz-TM16ドッキングはシャトルドッキングのリハーサルを兼ねていた訳だが、HB-G900はこれ以前に用意されている必要があっただろう。
HB -G900のスペックからして、それがドッキング補助システムの一部であった事は間違いないものと思われる。考えるに主コンソールの上という位置は、ドッキング補助システムの指定席ではなかったかという推測ができると思う。
ロシアは急いで安価にドッキング補助システムをでっち上げる必要があった訳だが、HB-G900はそういう用途にうってつけの機械である。ミールのコンピュータシステムからドッキングに必要なパラメータを受け取り、ドッキングモニタのビデオ画像に数値などをスーパーインポーズする、ただそのためだけにHB-G900は存在したのではないだろうか。
実際の使用のためには多少の改造は必要である。例えばHB-G900はAC-DC変換器を内蔵して、AC電源をコンセントから取る仕様だった。しかし当然だがミールにはAC100Vコンセントは無い。電源モジュールを取り除き、代わりにDC-DCコンバータを加える必要があっただろう。
宇宙用という点では、幸いにもHB-G900 はCMOS
IC をほとんど含まないコンピュータで、SEUの心配をしないで済む。
HB - G900が 、Kursの補助か、シャトルドッキングの補助か、もしくはそのその双方を兼ねていたかは不明である。そしてその終わりもまた、不明のままである。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#10 - 2008年4月10 日( 木) 02時01 分
小型の固体推進剤打ち上げ機开拓1型は、東風31型ICBMを転用したものである。50kgのペイロードを極軌道投入可能で、2002年と2003年にそれぞれ一回づつ打ち上げに使用されたが、双方とも上段の不具合で失敗している。以降打ち上げは無いが、能力増強型とあわせて商業打ち上げの売り込みを現在も行なっている。
中国の大型固体ロケットは、1967年の潜水艦打ち上げ弾道ミサイル巨浪1型の開発開始にまで遡ることができる。文革のさなかで目標はいきなり固体で水中打ち上げである。最初の打ち上げは1982年までずれ込んだ。実質的には開発の本格開始は長征1号三段目の開発が一段落した後だと思われる。陸上打ち上げの固体弾道ミサイル東風21型は、これを元にしたもので、1985年に最初の打ち上げを行なった。ただ巨浪1型そのものは1981年に地上からの打ち上げ試験を行なっている。
東風31型もやはりSLBM巨浪2型の陸上打ち上げ型である。これら固体ロケットのSRBとしての使用は、現在のところ考慮されていないようだ。
長征五号は、民生宇宙打ち上げに新規開発される中国最初の打ち上げ機である。打ち上げ能力は低軌道に最大40トン、GTOに10トンと桁違いのものとなる。当初2008年に最初の打ち上げを予定していたが、予定は2012年、更に最新のものでは2014年へと順調に後退している。
長征五号は液酸ケロシンのLRBを実質一段目とし、5メートル径の液酸液水コアステージと、二段目(実質三段目)の17.6トン推力再着火可能液酸液水ステージから構成される。LRB用の120トン推力エンジンYF-100は既に600秒の連続燃焼試験に成功している。LRBはこのFY-100を1つ使用する2.25m径のものと、2つを束ねた3.35m径の二種類があり、ペイロードによって組み合わせを変える。また二段目を使用しない組み合わせもある。
コアステージの液酸液水エンジンYF-77の推力は50トンで、難しい規模のものではない。開発の遅れはやはりYF-100エンジンに原因があるのだろう。2007年9月の時点で燃焼試験の累計燃焼時間は13500秒に達している。
実機ではLRBを最大4本束ねて、コアステージも最大2基クラスタ化して、全体で離床推力は最大1000トンオーバーとなる。将来的には更に高推力の液酸ケロシンエンジンの開発によって有人月ミッションにも対応可能な伸び代を残している。
中国ではこの打ち上げ機を環境に優しい " 緑色 " ロケットと呼んでいる 。
この打ち上げは、新規に建設される海南省文昌の射点のみを使用して行なわれる。文昌は中国で最も南に位置し、一段目落下点は公海上となり、更に台風の影響も少ない。文昌へのロケットの輸送は海路を用いることとなる。
更に中国は、2.25m径LRBを一段目に、既開発の15トン液酸液水再着火エンジンを二段目に組み合わせた小型打ち上げ機を開発計画に乗せている。この打ち上げ機は高度700キロの極軌道に500キログラムの衛星を投入可能である。中国は小型衛星の打ち上げ需要を年20機から30機と見込んでいて、これも商業打ち上げ機のラインナップに現れるだろう。
最初の有人打ち上げを半年後に控えた2003年3月、月探査計画" 嫦娥工程"
の詳細は承認された。予算は200億円だった。月探査計画そのものは863研制のなかでも謳われていたが、具体的な議論が始まったのは1997年になってから、検討に入ったのは2001年半ばのことだったらしい。
月探査機嫦娥一号は東方紅三号をベースに、自律航行システムを大幅に強化し、観測機材を搭載したものである。つまるところ深宇宙探査用に新規設計された機体では無い。外見的には短いブームの先のハイゲインアンテナの追加が目立つ。搭載コンピュータには西安微電子研究所（771所）製の三重多数決化されたものが使用された。PFMは2005年に完成し、試験ののち、2007年10月24日、西昌射点から長征三号Aによって打ち上げられた。その後新規に整備された地上局網で軌道を精密に割り出し、11月1日に月への遷移軌道に乗った。11月には月周回軌道に入り、観測を開始したが、最近、2008年6月には全ての観測を終えるとの発表があった。
但し、運用は必ずしも順調なものでは無いらしい。打ち上げ時にフェアリングが早期分離したのではないかという説がある。11月半ばには探査機とのコンタクトが途絶えたという噂が飛んだ。嫦娥一号が最初に取得した月面写真はクレメンタイン探査機の取得写真のコピーだという疑惑が持たれた。中国は昔、資源探査衛星の取得画像として公開したものが実はアメリカの公開衛星写真そのものだったという事があり、疑われるのは仕方が無い。また、搭載探査装置に対応した成果がほとんど公表されておらず、運用状況も11月末以来ほとんど出てこなくなった(一月末にはレーザ高度計の成果が一応出ている)。中国国内ではセレーネとの比較で、嫦娥一号の搭載探査装置の性能が低い事が問題とされた。
そのような中でも、嫦娥二号の打ち上げは2009年に予定され、第二期月探査計画も承認された。第二期では2013年までに月軟着陸を目指す。まだ承認されていない第三期工程ではサンプルリターンが予定されている。また、火星探査機荧火一号も2009年に打ち上げられる。
他の中国の宇宙計画では、航法衛星北斗シリーズがGPSとの関連で論じられる事が多い。北斗システムは位置決定制度は10mとされている。衛星そのものは大型のスピン衛星である。
神舟以外の有人システムについては、20トン級の小型の空間站つまり宇宙ステーションを当初打ち上げる予定だったようだが、宇宙ステーションに関する話題は最近現れていない。
中国の宇宙開発は、古く多彩な歴史と豊富な実績、広範囲に進行している計画を持っている。日本の宇宙開発との比較は興味深い主題だが、ここでは論じない。
中国の宇宙開発には評価すべき点が多いが、同時に問題点もある。最大の問題点は情報公開のポリシーである。中国の宇宙開発に関する情報は実に多様な公開がされている。情報量だけなら日本よりも多いが、都合が悪い事が起きると、情報は完全にシャットアウトされてしまう。中国は情報公開というものを完全に誤解しており、こういったポリシーで問題無いと考えているフシがあるが、情報を隠せばそれが何であれ、隠したという事実ゆえに外部から信用されなくなる。
また中国の内部でも、不具合情報という最高の知識がほとんど共有されないために、信頼性は一定以上に向上することは難しいだろう。
海外から信用されていない中国の宇宙開発が商業打ち上げで成功していくためには、価格競争力しか武器は無い。かつてはこれが極めて優れていたが、中国の経済力向上とシステムの高度化は必然的に生産コストを押し上げることになる。今後難しい局面が待っている訳だが、ただ、中国の宇宙開発は過去にも様々な難しい局面を乗り越えてきている事を忘れるべきではないだろう。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#X -2008年4月1 日( 火) 01時15 分
2007年1月11日、中国は東風21号固体中距離弾道弾を用いて、極軌道気象衛星である風雲一号Cを破壊した。いわゆるASAT実験である。風雲一号Cは1999年に打ち上げられた後、2002年に打ち上げられた風雲一号Dに代替わりして現役を退いた衛星だった。
この実験は中国の軍事システムの、具体的な対外脅威の存在しない中での空母や原潜開発に見られる、いわゆる覇権主義的傾向の一環として従来見られていた。ただこれは、かなり大掛かりな軍事費を宇宙開発分野に注いでいながら、専用の偵察衛星の整備も行っていない中国の現状からすると、順番としてちぐはぐな感がするのも事実だった。
中国の偵察衛星としては、初期の長空一号、尖兵一号といったFSW系のものを除けば、近年ブラジルと共同開発したCBERS資源探査衛星の次の世代、資源二号の三機のうち資源二号Aと資源二号Bが偵察衛星として相乗り運用されたと思われている。要するに軍が運用の権限を握っている訳では無いのだ。恐らく、軍の予算の中では、偵察衛星に関する予算より、有人宇宙開発に関するものの方が大きいだろう。
このような宇宙への人民解放軍の歪んだ関与の仕方には、当然理由が存在する。
1970年代初頭、中国独自の有人宇宙飛行の取り組みの中で、技術力に劣るなかで計画を成功させるために、宇宙飛行士の身体能力の、それも超常的な能力の強化が検討された。これは西側における超能力研究と同じ文脈で捉えて良いだろう。但しこれは中国では気功だった訳である。中国における本格的な気功研究はここに原点を持っている。
この研究の成果は明らかではない。しかし宇宙開発関係者に気功研究の擁護者が多数存在する事は、例えば銭学森が在野でも気功研究を続けた事でも明らかだろう。
更に、文革の中、権力に保護された聖域である宇宙開発の現場で維持され続けた民主主義思想が気功と結合したとき、法輪功の原型が誕生したものと思われる。林彪事件の際、七机部が反革命の巣窟と目されたのには、何も全くの無根拠という訳では無かったのだ。
この原初法輪功の思想的特長として、宇宙において人類は気功によって神仙へと進化するという、いわゆる志温( Zhi Won ) 的思想が挙げられる。アメリカ人やロシア人が宇宙に行っても何も起こらないのは、気功の鍛錬を積んでいないからだと彼らは考えている。この隠された思想的背景を理解して初めて、中国の有人宇宙開発を理解することができるだろう。
中国の有人宇宙開発は国威発揚を目標としているのではない。中国の有人宇宙開発がロシアやヨーロッパとの共同ではなく独自路線であるのは、気功に関する成果を独占する為である。またFSW衛星の継続的な打ち上げも、気功研究の一環であると思われる。1986年に中国において有人計画が再び認可されたとき、最終目標として宇宙ステーション建設が挙げられていたのは、気功による神仙進化の実現の為なのだ。
恐らく原初法輪功は比較的早い段階で中国のテクノクラートとその子弟の間に秘密結社として浸透したものと思われる。現在表に出ている、李洪志を始祖とする法輪功の活動は、秘密結社活動とは距離を置いた、氷山の一角に過ぎないものであろう。秘密結社のコアは間違いなく共産党中枢まで届いている。例えば有人宇宙船の名前を神舟とした一例を取ってみても、それは明らかだろう。従来ならこのような宗教的色彩の有る名前が選ばれる事は無かった筈だ。神仙の乗り物即ち神舟、その名前の意味は明白である。
人民解放軍の宇宙開発に対する関与のうち、有人宇宙開発関係者は間違いなく気功秘密結社のサイドであるが、もう一つの関与である弾道ミサイル運用部隊である第二砲兵は、歴史上常に彼らと対立する関係にあったと言える。銭学森を追放し、有人宇宙開発を中止させた彼らは、現在でも有人宇宙開発と対立関係にあると思われる。
第二砲兵で忘れてはならないのが、彼らが少数民族自治区やその近辺で活動する駐屯部隊であるという点である。酒泉ではウィグル族、西昌ではイ族、海南島では黎族及び苗族(チベットにも青海鉄道の延長としてリニアモータによるカタパルト打ち上げ線が計画された事がある)に対して、漢族の覇権主義を代表する存在として君臨しているのだ。更にはスターリングレポートに見られる、いわゆるタクラマカン施設などの少数民族抑圧政策への荷担も特筆せねばなるまい。
こういう文脈を踏まえて、中国のASAT実験を眺めると、第二砲兵による法輪功攻撃という別の一面が見えてくる。
気功を通じた改善運動である法輪功は1992年、有人宇宙計画921研制の決定と時を同じくして公式にその存在を認められたが、1997年7月に邪教として当局の弾圧が始まった。
2002年6月23日、鑫诺一号( Sinosat-1) のKuバンドトランスポンダ数個が乗っ取られ、法輪功の文字が中国全土の家庭用TVに映し出された。9月9日には3つのトランスポンダが乗っ取られている。翌年8月12,13日には反法輪功番組に割り込む形で、江沢民政権を批判する放送が流された。このような放送ジャックは以降も年二回程度の頻度で継続され、Sinosatのみではなく、他の衛星でも、Cバンドトランスポンダに対しても行なわれた。最近では2007年5月と7月に行なわれている。しかしそもそも衛星をそんなに簡単に乗っ取れるものだろうか。中国の衛星は日本のそれよりオープンであったりするのだろうか。
しかしこれも、気功秘密結社の中枢が宇宙開発関係者であることを考えれば説明は容易である。そして恐らく、中国の衛星のうち、かなりの数が法輪功、そして気功秘密結社の支配下にあるものと考えられる。風雲一号Cは法輪功の衛星であり、ASAT実験は北京オリンピックを睨んだ衛星戦争の先触れだったのだ。恐らく北京オリンピックは大規模な衛星放送乗っ取りと衛星破壊という、宇宙を舞台とした情報内戦の主戦場となるだろう。
このように中国の現状は、国内の各勢力が公然と戦火を交える、極めて危険な状態にある。中国の有人宇宙開発の失速は即ち民主化勢力の失脚を意味するだろう。逆に民主化勢力の暴走は、対する第二砲兵に核があることを考えると、恐ろしい可能性も考慮に入れざるを得ない。第三天安門は最悪の事態となるだろう。
それに、もし民主化勢力が勝利し、中国の宇宙開発における究極目標が達成されたとき、これは極めて特別な特権階級を生む危険な罠となる。中国は地上と宇宙とに引き裂かれるだろう。
……いや、事態は中国だけに留まるまい。中国の新たな神仙に、世界は宇宙から支配される事となるのだ。おもに気のせいで。
-------------------------------------------------------------------
はい、毎年恒例ですが、上記でっかい嘘です。
衛星放送はアナログなら、放送局より強いアップリンクを上げてやれば簡単に乗っ取る事ができるようです。
■ 中国の宇宙開発史#9 -2008年3月29 日( 土) 09時51 分
1986年、順調に経済力を増した中国は先端技術研究の必要を認め、863研制として国家として重点的に研究する分野を定めた。そしてその中にはスーパーコンピュータの開発等と並んで、有人宇宙開発も謳われていた。
世界ではチャレンジャーの事故があった直後であったが、レーガン政権は宇宙ステーション建設を推進しており、シャトルの輝きも決して失われた訳では無かった。要するに中国もシャトルや宇宙ステーションが欲しくなったのだ。しかしそれら目標はあまりにも遠かった。その後の中国は、小型スペースプレーンや、これと組み合わせるフライバック有翼機などの風洞実験をやる位で、本格的な開発まではしばらく足踏みがあった。
本格的な開発フェーズに入るに当たり、有人計画の進め方は議論となった。有翼再利用機の技術的困難と、目標とされた宇宙ステーションの運用を考えたとき脱出ボートとしてのカプセルが必要となるという指摘、そしてコストの問題が取り上げられた。最終的に彼らは段階的開発という当たり前の結論に達した。1988年のことである。全目標達成のゴールを2010年、最初の有人打ち上げは2000年に目標を定められた。
打ち上げ機は長征二号Eが仮定され、宇宙船重量は最大8トンと見積もられた。液酸ケロシンの新型打ち上げ機開発の提案は蹴られた。空間技術研究院( CAST)は3つのデザインを提案していた。一つは再突入モジュールをサービスモジュールと軌道活動モジュールで挟むソユーズスタイルの構成、二つ目は再突入モジュールの耐熱シールドを貫通したハッチで後ろの大型サービスモジュールと連絡するTKS/ブルージェミニ構成、最後の一つは大型の再突入モジュールと小型のサービスモジュールの構成である。运載火箭技術研究院( CALT)はまた別の考えをもっていたが、これもソユーズスタイルだった。そして上海( SAST )もソユーズスタイルだった。最終的に設計はソユーズスタイルの3モジュール、但し全てのモジュールが自律性を持つこととなった。
ロシア/旧ソ連技術の獲得の努力は1991年5月から始まった。ここで中国は莫大な技術を安価に手に入れることに成功した。中国は、当時ロシアが開発中だった(が結局キャンセルされた)ザーリャカプセルの資料さえ閲覧している。1992年には宇宙飛行士たちが訓練のために星の街を訪問するようになった。当時日本にもロシア宇宙開発技術購入の呼びかけがあったのだが、日本の宇宙開発機関ははそれを悉くスルーした。日本の民間企業にすらソ連宇宙開発の成果物が流れる状況で、中国が本気でそれらを獲得しようとすれば、どこまで可能だったかは想像に難くない。中国は少なくとも2機のソユーズ再突入カプセル実機を手に入れたと思われる。
有人宇宙船の最終設計は1992年4月に承認され、921研制となる。有人飛行の期限は二年延長され、2002年までとなった。恐らく中国はソ連式の、二回の連続無人飛行成功を有人飛行の前提条件と仮定したのだろう。
921研制は広範な課題を抱えていた。有人宇宙船の開発、打ち上げシステムの安全、宇宙飛行士の養成、新造する追跡船艦隊と着陸支援、試験設備、そして酒泉の新たな大型VAB。しかしこれらの大掛かりな動きは、1997年まで外部に漏れなかったし、確度の高い噂となるのは1999年になってからである。
命名だけが1993年に行なわれていたが、有人宇宙船の最初の熱構造試験モデル及び電気試験モデルが完成したのは1995年のことだった。それからひと通りの問題が解決したのは1997年で、そこから重量を削減し、打ち上げ機と統合したアボートタワー等の試験をこなすと、もう1999年になっていた。
1999年11月19日、有人宇宙船試験機は酒泉射場から長征二号F打ち上げ機によって打ち上げられた。長征二号Fは長征二号Eのフェアリングをソユーズ打ち上げ機のものと取り替えたような機体だった。実際には一割がた長征二号Fのもののほうが大型である。フェアリング上部には、自律性を持ったことで重量を増した軌道上モジュールの分も補うべく、アボート用の固体モータが追加されている。
追跡船は種子島の南東沖、フィジー沖、オーストラリア西沖、そして南アフリカのナミビア沖に配置された。有人宇宙船にはダミー人形と植物が数種搭載されていた。ダミー人形は酸素を吸収し二酸化炭素と熱を放出するよう作られていた。宇宙船は20時間後、ナミビア沖上空で追跡船からのコマンドで再突入シーケンスに入った。高度10キロでパラシュートハッチが投棄される。パラシュートは巨大なもので、中国にとってこれも大きな技術的挑戦だった。高度6キロで底部のヒートシールドが投棄され、ガンマ線高度計と4つの大型固体モータが活性化する。中国は信頼できる陸地軟着陸システムをソユーズからほぼ丸ごとコピーした。但し固体モータの点火高度はソユーズと違い1mとなっている。
着陸したカプセルは密封されたまま北京へと運ばれた。江沢民総書記は祝賀式典で、有人宇宙船のカプセルから取り出された、その宇宙船の名前が書かれた紙を掲げた。
有人宇宙船 " 神舟 " の構成要素は基本的にこの時から変わっていない。ソユーズ宇宙船との類似性に目が行くが、再突入カプセルの類似性を除けば、似ているのは姿勢制御スラスタの位置と構成程度である。神舟のスラスタ構成はソユーズのスラスタ構成の要点を理解した上で再構成されており、基本的に二重×二系統の構成となっている。
更に後端の大推力スラスターは4基構成で、並行ではなく全て別々の外側に向いた並べ方がされている。4基というのは推力の対称を保ったまま冗長性を保つことが出来る最小の構成である。どれか1基が故障しても、対称位置の1基を停止して、残りの2基で推力軸線を保って推進することが可能であろう。
軌道モジュールは自立能力を与えられており、切り離して単独で運用可能である。先端の奇妙な形状は地上観測用のアンテナアレイとバーアンテナの組み合わせらしい。大型の観測窓とエアロックの存在も確認できる。更に将来、ロシアが開発しアメリカもISSで採用したAPAS-89規格ドッキングポートを装備した型が現れると見られている。
各種センサの配置は独特である。目視地球センサVzor相当のものも搭載されているようだが、ペリスコープ状の突出部は存在せず、前方視認の機能は削られているようである。自動赤外地球センサは3つの同型のセンサが三軸直交するように組み合わされており、これが機械モジュールと軌道モジュールにそれぞれ1つづつ存在している。
神舟は４枚の太陽電池パドルを持っている。パドルは根元に回転フランジを持ち、宇宙機の姿勢制御無しに太陽方向への追尾が可能である。このパドルは東方紅三号シリーズに採用されたものと基本的に同じ物である。
再突入モジュールはソユーズの単純なコピーではない。特に直径を増した、全体として三割増の大きさであり、三人の宇宙飛行士に窮屈でない内部環境を提供することができる。注目したいのは神舟がサーマルブランケットを軌道モジュールのみにしか使用していない点である。ソユーズとは熱設計が全く違うのだ。
カプセルの断熱手法の詳細は不明である。これは明らかに、ソユーズと大幅に違う点である。但し構造はコピーで、しかも製造の資料抜きでのコピーであるため、開発と製造では珍妙なねじれがあったようだ。ほかでも例えば中国はガンマ線高度計やフェアリングの格子翼を採用する必要は必ずしも無かった筈だが、この再現にかなり苦労したらしい。
自立する軌道モジュールは、中国独自の改良と受け止められる事が多いが、これは改悪だろう。太陽電池パドルとバッテリ、自前の温度制御と姿勢制御を持つための重量増は、非常時のアボートタワーの動作マージンを確実に狭めている。
次の打ち上げはすぐだった。2000年1月9日、神舟二号は打ち上げられた。今度は6匹のネズミを始めとする動植物を積んでいた。また蛋白質結晶の成長装置なども積まれていた。この打ち上げで宇宙船は徹底した試験を受ける筈であったが、これはもはや単なる試験飛行ではなかった。神舟二号は6日間飛行して帰還したが、着陸のどこかで問題が発生したと思われる。何が起こったのか中国側は明確にしていないが、結果として、有人打ち上げまでの間に、更に一度の試験打ち上げが追加される事となった。
神舟二号の軌道モジュールはその後260日自律飛行により運用されたが、軌道低下の結果再突入して燃え尽きた。
その次の打ち上げは当初2000年8月に予定されていたと思われる。実際、7月には神舟三号は酒泉に運ばれ、射点では打ち上げ準備が始まったが、その後打ち上げ準備は中断され、宇宙船は北京に戻っていった。これらの動きは民間の商業偵察衛星により確認された。
神舟三号は2001年3月25日に打ち上げられた。今度は動物を積まず、苗木と種、ワクチン等を積むだけだった。6日後再突入モジュールは帰還し、その回収の光景は、今回ほぼ即座にインターネットを通じて公開された。軌道モジュールはその後半年軌道上で運用された。神舟四号は2002年12月末に打ち上げられた。再び様々な実験装置で満杯になった機体は六日後の翌年初めに帰還した。
神舟五号は2003年10月15日、楊利偉を乗せて打ち上げられ、軌道を一周して帰還した。神舟六号は2005年10月12日に聶海勝と費俊竜の二名を乗せて打ち上げられ、五日後に帰還した。
神舟七号は2008年中に打ち上げられ、乗員による船外宇宙活動を行なうものと思われる。この三年のブランクは今だ秘密のままである船外宇宙服に関連したものだろう。宇宙飛行士の船外活動訓練の実体も不明なままである。更に神舟八号以降にドッキング実験が予定されているのは、間違いないだろう。宇宙ステーションそのものは長征五号による打ち上げを予定しているものと思われる。
■ 中国の宇宙開発史#8 - 2008年3月16 日( 日) 00時29 分
四川省西昌は古代中国史で言うところの蜀のすぐ裏手である。山あいの地であるが人口密度は決して低くない。ここに射場が建設されたのは、低緯度でありながらロケットの一段目及び二段目が自国内に落下する位置であったからである。1970年代後半の中国の対外政策は慎重を極めたものだった。
中国の商業打ち上げは、FSWの搭載ペイロードやピギーバックを除けば、全て西昌射場から行われている。ここは純粋に民生打ち上げの射点であり、外国人にも公開された観光地となっている。
1992年3月22日、西昌射点でオーストラリアの通信衛星Optus-B1を打ち上げる筈だった長征二号Eは一段目エンジンに点火後、推力が出ず離床に失敗、まるでコンロの上で赤黒い炎で料理されているような、恐ろしい状況となった。
この危機的状況は現場の保安係員たちによって食い止められたが、彼らは燃焼不良のヒドラジンと四酸化二窒素の煙の中に酸素マスクも防護服も無しで飛び込んだ為に、全員が吐血して病院送りとなった。幸いにもこの時は死傷者は出なかったようである。
衛星は8月に改めて打ち上げられ、これは成功したのだが、12月の通信衛星Optus-B2打ち上げは失敗に終わった。衛星は打ち上げ後およそ一分あたりの時点で、フェアリングの中で粉々に砕け散っていたのだ。軌道に乗ったのは衛星の破片だった。
失敗の原因に関して、中国と衛星の製造元であるアメリカは責任をなすり付け合い、終いには失敗の原因はロケットでも衛星でも無かったという共同声明を発表するという茶番で締めたが、無論これは肝心のOptus社にとっては何の慰めにもならなかった。
1994年7月の長征三号による香港のApstar-1衛星打ち上げ、8月の長征二号EによるOptus-B3打ち上げは成功だったが、1995年1月26日の長征二号EによるApstar-2衛星の打ち上げは失敗し、大惨事となった。
打ち上げ はTVで中継されており、近隣の住人は屋外に椅子を出して見物していた。しかしロケットは離床後51秒で爆発し、近隣に有害な推進剤を撒き散らしたのだ。このときの犠牲者は公式には死者6名、負傷者23人である。しかし死者は最低でも20人以上出ただろうと思われている。公式の犠牲者数が信用されていないのは、更に次の大惨事の公式発表が全く信用されていないからである。
この爆発はエンジンではなく、ロケットの最上部で始まったように見えたため、中国とアメリカの非難合戦が再開された。現在でも中国では公の場以外では、この失敗と1992年の失敗はアメリカの衛星が原因だという見方を示すことが多い。ただ言えるのは長征二号Eのフェアリングはあまり衛星を保護していないという事である。
双方の非難合戦の間も打ち上げは続いた。1995年11月、12月の長征二号Eの打ち上げは成功だった。これが最後の長征2号Eの打ち上げとなる。但し、1994年4月に西昌では、恐らく長征三号による国産気象静止衛星風雲二号の打ち上げ作業中に、一人が死に31人が負傷する事故を起こしている。
1996年2月14日、長征三号Bによるインテルサット708の打ち上げは失敗し、更に大規模な惨事となった。この打ち上げ失敗は1960年旧ソ連においてR-16試射作業中の爆発により122人が死んだ、いわゆるネデーリン大惨事に匹敵する、恐らくはそれ以上の惨事であったと考えられている。
長征三号Bは、長征三号から更に改良を加えられた三段目エンジンYF-75を持つ長征三号Aから、さらに三段目タンクを大型化した機体で、これが最初の打ち上げだった。この頃にはクリントン政権下のアメリカは中国に対し規制を緩め、衛星打ち上げ枠及び価格下限を緩和すると共に、輸出許可の管轄を国務省から商務省に移していた。中国はこの打ち上げを七千万ドルで請け負っていたが、これは中国にとっても余裕のある額ではなかった。少なくとも、新型機の試験打ち上げの余裕が無い程度には。
長征三号Bは離床直後、タワーをクリアする前から明らかに姿勢を傾斜させ、TV中継される中、近隣の山あいのどこかに墜落した。中継はすぐに中断され、現場にいた外国人は5時間足止めされた。彼らが次の朝目撃した集落破壊の惨状は、中国の公式発表の死者6人、負傷者57名という数字と明らかに食い違うものだった。
このバレンタインの大惨事は、アメリカの宇宙開発ロビーに新たな火種を与えた。衛星開発元だったロラール社がアメリカ国防関係者の関与無しに中国に事故原因に関しての助言を行ったことが問題とされ、更には外国人が現場に足止めされた5時間の間に衛星の残骸が漁られ、機密技術が漏洩したのではないかという疑いがかけられた。
1998年、アメリカ議会は中国への技術漏洩に関する特別委員会を設置した。その調査は小規模な赤狩りじみたものとなった。1995年の打ち上げ失敗の際にロラール社がフェアリング改良に関する情報を与えたのが問題とされた。またロラール社は民主党への献金により衛星輸出の便宜を期待したとして共和党の攻撃対象となった。ヒューズ社は機密漏えいの嫌疑により国防省に告訴され、中国の打ち上げ機による2機のヒューズ社製の衛星打ち上げがキャンセルされた。
特別委員会の最終成果である、いわゆるコックスレポートは、中国による大規模な組織的スパイ活動が行われ、あらゆる先端技術が不正な方法で中国に持ち去られていたと結論していた。しかしその扇情的な内容には基本的な数字の間違いなどが散見されたため、その信頼性は疑問視され、結局まともに取り合われることもなく騒動は終息した。
中国製打ち上げ機の信用は完全に地に墜ち、顧客たちは予約をキャンセルしてプロトンやアリアンに移った。が、中国は外交と政治的影響力を駆使して、打ち上げを維持しようとした。香港などの中国系アジア企業の衛星打ち上げを確保するのに成功し、7月にはApstar-1Aを打ち上げている。しかし8月には長征三号は三段目不具合によりアメリカから購入した衛星を静止軌道に投入するのに失敗した。
平行して中国は信頼性問題に対して抜本的な努力を始めた。大規模な更迭人事が行われ、ISO9000のサポートキャンペーンが始まった。機器改良と平行して海外の、主にヨーロッパのコンサルタントを招いて品質管理システムが構築された。
1997年5月に長征三号A、6月に長征三号で国産衛星の打ち上げを成功させ、8月に長征三号Bはフィリピンのアグリア2衛星の打ち上げに成功し、中国は商業打ち上げに復帰した。以来中国の打ち上げ機は極めて高い打ち上げ成功率を誇っている。
コックスレポートはここにほぼ全文が公開されている。

「 これこれこういうタイミングでスパイ活動が行われた可能性はゼロではない。ホラココでも！ココでも！そして漏洩の結果はこんなひどい事になる可能性が(ゼロでは無い)！」というような、陰謀論の手本みたいな内容である。
■ 中国の宇宙開発史#7 -2008年3月13 日(木) 04時08 分
中国においても、通信、気象、地上観測などの実用衛星の必要性は認識されてはいたが、実際に予算が付くのは東方紅一号打ち上げの後だった。それも林彪事件によって打ち切られることになる。それらに予算を付けたのは林彪だったのだ。
1975年4月に毛沢東は個人的に通信衛星開発の計画に許諾を与え、これによりようやく通信衛星開発はスタートした。通信衛星の実現方法として検討の結果、静止衛星の使用が決定され、そのために新たな高性能上段エンジンを持つロケットが必要とされた。
中国の液酸液水エンジンの開発着手は1965年と、日本の1971年と比べてもかなり早い時期である。日本最初の7トン級液酸液水エンジンの燃焼試験が1980年、中国は最初の燃焼試験を1971年に行なっている。1978年には爆発事故で死傷者を出したようだ。
液酸液水4燃焼室のYF-73エンジンは4.5トン級の再着火可能エンジンで、1979年には燃焼試験を開始し、1983年に試験を終了した。このエンジンは静止衛星用打ち上げ機、長征三号の三段目に使用された。更に静止軌道投入のために固体アポジキックモーターが新たに開発された。
1977年、�ｹ小平指導下において、通信衛星の実現は優先事業と位置付けられたが、1978年に入って宇宙開発予算は大幅に削減された。
この時、軍事費はGNPの12%というこれまでの水準から一気に5%まで引き下げられ、100万人の兵員削減が行なわれた。宇宙開発予算はGNPの0.035%まで削減された。この時の中国のGNPは3624億元、大体宇宙開発予算は1億ドル程度という事になる。ちなみに現在の中国の宇宙開発予算は20億ドル前後とみられ、これに更に倍近い軍事費からの予算が投入されて不透明なものとなっている。中国の経済規模がおよそ30倍となったことを考えればおよそ適正な成長率と言えるだろう。
一方で新たに気象衛星の開発も承認された。気象衛星は極軌道打ち上げのために新たな射場を必要としていた。また静止衛星も低緯度に射場を必要としていた。FSWの打ち上げは中断され、風暴ロケットの搭載ペイロードもキャンセルされ、太原と西昌の射場建設が始まった。
中国の宇宙開発のペースは遅いものにならざるを得ず、一方で中国は急速な経済成長期に入っていた。改革開放路線は中国の民生宇宙開発を根底から変質させた。
まず優先されたのは通信衛星である。最初の電気試験モデルは1979年に完成したが、様々な深刻な問題を抱えている事が明らかになった。この時期中国はアメリカに衛星技術の購入交渉を行なっているが、この行方は定かではない。新しい環境試験設備が作られ、最終的なフライトモデルが試験をパスしたのは1983年春のことだった。
1984年1月、長征三号によって中国最初の国産静止通信衛星は打ち上げられた。長征三号は長征二号に液酸液水三段目とアポジキックモーターを搭載した、静止軌道打ち上げ用の機体で、いわるる長二パッケージのバリエーションの一つである。
この打ち上げは、三段目燃焼がわずか3秒しか行なわれなかったことによって失敗したが、衛星はアポジモーターで長楕円軌道に投入され、各種運用試験が行なわれた。
4月の打ち上げは成功し、441kgのスピン衛星、東方紅二号は運用に入った。Cバンドトランスポンダを2つ持つだけの衛星だったが、この衛星は4年の寿命を全うした。
次の東方紅二号甲はトランスポンダを倍の4つ搭載し、5チャンネルのTV中継、3000チャンネルの電話中継能力を持っていた。東方紅二号甲は1988年3月、12月、1990年2月にそれぞれ打ち上げられ、中国全土をカバーするサービスを開始した。4機目が1991年12月に打ち上げられたが、三段目の失敗で静止運用できなかったため、アメリカから寿命切れ直前の中古の衛星を購入し、静止位置を移動して使用した。
この時期から中国の通信衛星需要は爆発的に増大し始め、このため外国衛星の回線を買って使用するようになった。現在の中国の衛星通信需要のほとんどを賄っているのがこのレンタル回線と購入衛星である。
三軸衛星となった第三世代の東方紅三号の開発には、メッサーシュミット・ベルコウ・ブローム社の協力があった。同社は太陽電池パドルとハイゲインアンテナ等を担当したが、この技術移転は大きな影響をもたらした。東方紅三号に使用された太陽電池パドルは以降の中国国産衛星の標準的なパドルとなり、似たものが神舟にも採用されている。
東方紅三号は2.2トン、24個のトランスポンダを持ち、マルチビームで中国全土に6チャンネルのTV中継放送をおこなう能力を持っていた。ただ1994年、この衛星の打ち上げは静止軌道への投入に失敗し、その運用は技術検証に留まった。二機目の東方紅三号の開発から、ダイムラー・ベンツの技術協力が行なわれるようになっている。この機体は1997年に打ち上げに成功した。東方紅三号はその後量産衛星のバスとして使用されている。
東方紅四号は5.1トンの重量で、最大52個のトランスポンダを搭載する。アルカテル社の技術協力もあり、設計衛星寿命は最長15年にも及ぶ。この衛星により、中国は米国製部品を使わず国際級の通信衛星を商業的に製造、供給できる能力を証明した。
東方紅四号は2006年10月に最初の衛星が打ち上げられ、二機目も2007年5月に打ち上げられた。中国は自国で使用している通信衛星を全て国産衛星で置き換える計画を持っており、それが済み次第、国際衛星市場に中国製衛星が現れるものと思われる。
直接TV放送衛星鑫诺二 号( Sinosat-2) は東方紅三号ベースの衛星で、22個のトランスポンダと最長15年の設計衛星寿命を持つが、2006年10月の最初の打ち上げでは、パドルとアンテナの展開に失敗した。後継の鑫诺三号( Sinosat-3)は2007年6月に打ち上げられている。
中国最初の気象衛星風雲一号は上海で開発され、1988年9月に太原から打ち上げられた。打ち上げ機は上海で開発された長征四号である。長征四号は長征二号をベースに独自の三段目を追加したもので、軌道投入能力は低いが、ヒドラジン系のYF-40エンジンと共通隔壁タンクの三段目の信頼性は高い。打ち上げは太原からの極軌道打ち上げに限られ、ペイロードも国産衛星に限られている。初期型の長征四号甲はその後1990年に風雲一号の二機目を打ち上げて運用を終了した。この二度目の打ち上げで三段目は、役目を終えたひと月後、軌道上で爆発しデブリを極軌道に撒き散らした。風雲一号の初期の二機は放射線障害に悩まされたが、モーメンタムホィールを含む多くの技術的挑戦を搭載していた。
改良型の長征四号乙は1999年より打ち上げサービスを開始し、現在も使用されている。
静止衛星である風雲二号は、最初の機体が1997年に打ち上げられた。風雲一号と二号は相互補完的な関係にある。以降このシリーズはおよそ4年おきに定期的に世代交代している。
1984年の静止衛星打ち上げ成功を受けて、中国は国際衛星打ち上げサービスへの参入を決めた。中国の宇宙開発はもはや、実用的であるだけでは不十分だった。慢性的な予算不足の中で宇宙開発が生き残るためには、外貨を獲得するしかなかったのだ。
1985年にその決定は正式発表され、日本の筑波科学万博に長征三号の模型を出展し、打ち上げサービスをアピールした。
1986年、チャレンジャーの事故の後、世界の打ち上げ事情は激変し、中国の打ち上げサービスも真剣な考慮の対象となった。最初の中国の宇宙システムの外国の利用は、FSWの使用だったが、1989年、アメリカは1994年までに9機の衛星を中国が打ち上げる事を認可した。この打ち上げ認可という偉そうな仕組みは、アメリカが世界の通信衛星の殆どを製造し、ほぼ全ての衛星にアメリカ製部品が使用されていることから可能になっていた。それでもまだ、中国で衛星を打ち上げるにはアメリカの輸出許可が必要だった。更に米中間の協定で、中国の打ち上げ価格には下限が設定された。
最初の商業打ち上げは1990年4月に行なわれ、成功により中国は一億ドルの収入を得た。7月にはパキスタンの衛星を打ち上げた。
しかし、中国の商業打ち上げはやがて相次ぐ問題に見舞われることとなる。

中国の曙光一号及 びFSW 機に関して、幾つか訂正と、追記を。
まず、FSWは曙光一号の原型機ではないようだ。FSWは材料等の技術試験機だったかも知れないが、まず純粋に再突入回収の実現のために開発されたものらしい。
曙光一号はアメリカのジェミニ有人宇宙船の縮小コピーというコンセプトで開発を開始したが、ほとんどその開発は進んでいなかったようだ。概略図からその構成が読み取れるが、FSWとは違い揚力再突入を意識したベル型のカプセルである。
曙光一号の機体開発が行われていなかったと考えられるのは、まずパラシュートシステムの試験がFSW用のものに留まっていること、FSW以外の再突入試験機が見られないこと、そして概略図が単なるイメージ以上のものでは無いことが挙げられる。概略図では固体モータの固定方法が曖昧だし、そもそも位置もおかしい。これでは機械モジュールを切り離した後、固体モータも別に切り離す必要が出てくるため、機体が実質三分割構造になってしまっている。
ただ、宇宙飛行士の養成と平行して宇宙服等の開発は進んでいたようだ。当時宇宙飛行士の訓練現場を取材したドキュメンタリーが作成され、放送されたことがあり、これには毛沢東語録を掲げて建物に続々入っていく人民服姿の宇宙飛行士候補たち、検査や訓練を受ける宇宙飛行士候補たち、毛沢東語録を唱和するスタッフ、R-2のRD-101とおぼしきエンジンを整備するスタッフ(これに関してはエンジンのみ隠せばあとはいくらでも撮影してよい、と銭学森が言ったという話があり、明らかに時代遅れのエンジンを撮影しているのはこの反映であると思われる)、そして開放された真空チャンバ内の宇宙服姿が見られる。
更に、FSW機の源流には、旧ソ連のあまり知られていない再突入帰還機MP-1(МП-1 ) が存在する可能性がある。
MP-1はチェロメイのOKB-52が構想開発していたロケットプレーン( Ракетоплан)の技術試験機である。
チェロメイは、コスモプレーンという妄想のような機体を1959年頃に構想している。原子力エンジンを用い水平離陸し、電気推進で惑星間を飛行して、コーン型の耐熱シールドを使って水平帰還する機体である。その後これからある程度現実的なラケートプレーン構想が派生した。通常の化学ロケットで打ち上げられる有人機で、鋭角なコーン型の耐熱シールドの後端が傘のように開く機構を採用し、再突入の熱的に一番厳しい領域を過ぎた後でシールドを廃棄し、中の有翼機で水平着陸するというものだ。これは明らかにコロリョフのカプセル有人機への対抗であるが、コロリョフは同様のコンセプトを既に飛ばして試した上で放棄していることを指摘したい。
MP-1はこのような鈍頭円錐形状の再突入回収体で、重量1750kg、黒鉛ベースの耐熱材を用い、窒素ガスのコールドガスジェットで能動姿勢制御をおこない、パラシュートで回収可能だった。これは再突入帰還機の耐熱材料等の試験のために、1961年11月27日にプレセックからR-12を用いて高度405kmまで打ち上げられ、弾道飛行をして帰還した。使用された材料技術は、ラムジェット巡航ミサイル開発で得られたものをベースとしていた。
MP-1のスペックは、知られているFSW-0機に極めて似ている。どちらも鈍頭円錐形状の再突入回収体で、重量も誤差範囲の近似、材料も似ている。MP-1の開発時期は中ソ蜜月期に重なっており、R-12の技術資料と一緒に中国にもたらされた可能性がある。その経路には(考えにくいが)ソ連側からの資料提供から留学生によるスパイまで、様々な可能性が考えられる。
OKB-52はその後更にM-12という機体を1963年に打ち上げたが、これは再突入時に熱防護の問題から破壊、再突入に失敗した。
その後OKB-52はR-1,R-2という再突入宇宙機を設計するが、フルシチョフの失脚によってその活動を大きく減じることとなり、ロケットプレーンの開発も終焉した。
FSW 機は2008年3月現在までに25機が打ち上げられ、22機が無事帰還した。2機が打ち上げに失敗し、1機が再突入逆噴射に失敗した。FSW機には4バージョンあり、1987年まで9機が打ち上げられたナンバー無しのいわゆるFSW-0、1987年から1993年まで5機が打ち上げられたFSW-1、1992年から3機もしくは4機打ち上げられたFSW-2、しばらくの中断を経て2003年から打ち上げが始まり、6機が打ち上げられたFSW-3というシリーズに分類される。
FSW の用途は様々である。軍事用が最も多いが、無重量実験、生物実験用途にも多く使用されている。最も多い軍事用途でも、初期のFSW-0は写真偵察を意図してたものと思われるが、FSW-0でも後期利用においては地上観測や、外国にペイロードを売ったりもしている。その後は使用目的はバラバラだ。軍事用途でも、最大の利用目的は技術実証だと推測されている。FSWの打ち上げは一貫して酒泉で行われている。
FSW の飛行可能時間はバッテリー容量によって制約を受けていたと見られる。FSW-0シリーズでは最大5日間だった飛行時間はFSW-1では10日間に伸び、FSW-2では最大18日にまで、FSW-3では現在のところ49日間が最大飛行時間である。
FSW-0の最後の機体は1987年にフランス企業の微小重力生命実験に利用された。FSW-1は180キロのペイロードを搭載可能で、ドイツの結晶成長実験を搭載した。FSW-2では早稲田大学の結晶成長実験装置を搭載している。
継続的にFSWの開発と使用が継続しているところを見ると、中国は有る程度高い評価を帰還回収機に与えているようだ。
FSW-0は1978年の三号機の打ち上げの後、4年間打ち上げを中断した。次の打ち上げは1982年で、この4年の間に中国の宇宙開発は大きく体制と性質を変えることになる。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#5 - 2008年3月1日( 土) 00時31 分
現在の中国の宇宙開発の主力打ち上げ機、長征二号及び三号は、大陸間弾道弾東風五号を宇宙用にモディファイしたもの、なのだが、そうとも言い切れない部分がある。
東風五号は1964年にその開発が始まった訳だが、同時に開発開始した東風三号、四号より更にレベルの高い技術が要求されており、1969年に東風四号が初飛行に漕ぎ着けてからが実質的な東風五号の開発開始時期だったと思われる。
エンジン開発は少しだけ先行していた。YF-20エンジンは1969年には北京郊外の燃焼試験設備で動作に漕ぎ着けていたが、やはり燃焼振動の問題に悩まされた。東風五号の一段目に使用されたのは、このフライト型であるYF-21である。YF-21は四酸化二窒素とUDMHを使用し、推力300トン比推力286秒の4燃焼室エンジンである。この燃焼室はそれぞれがジンバリングすることができた。二段目のYF-22はこれの単一燃焼室版である。二段目には姿勢制御用に小さなYF-24スラスターが付属した。
1971年9月、最初の東風五号の試験打ち上げが行なわれ、これは部分的に成功だったと伝えられている。しかし東風五号が最初に完全な試験を行なったのは1980年5月と、大幅に遅れることになる。
1970年1月、上海で有人機打ち上げ用の大型打ち上げ機" 風暴"
を開発するという701研制が始まった。これは毛沢東の上海びいきのためと思われ、これまでの北京での開発成果を用いたこの機種が実質、長征二号及び東風五号の原型機となった。風暴一号には様々な新規技術が取り入れられた。姿勢制御はディジタルコンピュータによって行なわれ、構造材はアルミニウム合金の溶接構造となり、タンクは推進剤そのものを蒸発させることで加圧制御された。必要な試験設備もわずか10ヶ月で揃えられ、1970年11月には最初のGTO試験が酒泉で行なわれた。
風暴一号の最初の打ち上げは1972年8月に行なわれた。これは完全な成功とは言いがたかったため、更なる改良が加えられ、搭載ペイロードも最大1.5トンから1.9トンまで増やされた。
二度目の打ち上げは1973年9月でフルスケールのものだったが、二段目姿勢制御の失敗で軌道投入に失敗した。翌年7月の打ち上げでは衛星が二段目に追突されてまた軌道投入に失敗し、以降二段目は以降長征二号用のものを転用することとなった。
風暴一号の開発は文革の干渉に常に晒されてきた。科学者は労働者階級の敵とみなされ、失敗すればサボタージュの罪状で吊し上げられた。1974年7月の打ち上げ失敗では四人組に批判されている。
1975年7月、打ち上げは遂に成功し、1.1トンの技術試験衛星"
長空一号 "
が軌道に投入された。実用的な性能は得られなかったであろうが、長空一号は写真電送型の偵察衛星の試験機とされている。中国最初の三軸姿勢制御衛星で、各種センサを地表に向けて長期間観測する事ができた。但し、長空一号は50日で動作を停止した。
有人計画は中止された後も、風暴一号の打ち上げは続いた。12月に打ち上げられた長空二号は42日、1976年8月の長空三号は817日動作した。11月の打ち上げは失敗し、これで長空シリーズの打ち上げは終了した。
長征二号は明らかに風暴一号と同じ設計を基礎にしているが、1972年以来別々に開発が行なわれた。実際のところ、どこまで共通の設計なのかはよく判らない。初期の共通設計は北京で行なわれていたものと思われる。
最初の打ち上げは1974年11月に行なわれ、打ち上げ後わずか20秒で爆散した。テレメトリは冗長化されてない姿勢制御系ハーネスの断線を示していた。
張翼翔はこれを機に品質に関して大掛かりな調査と対策を行なった。冗長化と試験が徹底され、二度目の打ち上げが1975年11月に行なわれたが、打ち上げ後130秒で一段目エンジンはシャットダウンし、二段目は正しく動作したものの衛星は予定よりも低い軌道に投入された。近地点は高度わずか176kmだった。
投入された衛星は再突入回収型衛星 " 尖兵一号 " だった。海外で はFSWと呼ばれる事が多いが、FSWとは返回式遥感衛星の発音を略したもので、以降この機種に特別なシリーズ名称が与えられた事は無い。またその開発目的が正式に示された事も無い。FSWは上海で開発されてきた有人機と基本的には同じ物だと思われる。"
尖兵一号"
は中国最初の軌道変更可能な宇宙機だった。
テレメトリは姿勢制御用のガスの圧力減を示していた。しかしこれは予定と違う軌道に入れたことによる機体温度の上昇に伴うものだと考えた地上側は、打ち上げ三日後に予定よりも早く再突入を行なう事とした。
再突入コマンドは中国領の西端から送られたが、その後地上は衛星を見失った。予定では四川に着陸する筈だったが、カプセルは貴州で発見された。食堂で昼食をとっていた四人の炭鉱夫は赤熱した塊が落ちてくるのを目撃し、着陸した真っ黒に焦げたカプセルに石を投げてみたりした後で当局に連絡した。
カプセル内部は明らかに高温に晒されていた。この時期既に有人計画は中止されていたため、カプセル内部のレイアウトには徹底的な変更が加えられた。この時期にFSWは回収型写真撮影偵察衛星として位置付けられたものと思われる。中国では初期シリーズのFSWにはナンバリングをしておらず、位置付けは中国でも不明確なのだと思われる。
FSWは3から5度という極めて浅い再突入角度を使い、特殊耐熱材としか公表されていない、非アブレータ系の恐らく炭素系複合材で再突入加熱を凌ぎきる。高度20から10キロのあたり、速度が200m/sを切ったところで小型の補助減速パラシュートを開き、高度5キロでメインパラシュートを開く。最終降下速度は10m/sほどである。
1977年に政権を握った�ｹ小平は、人民解放軍を縮小し軍事費を縮小すると共に、宇宙開発も縮小する考えを示した。復権した張翼翔は宇宙開発と弾道ミサイル開発に関して、整理した新しい開発体制を築こうとした。
1977年と1978年の風暴一号の打ち上げはペイロード無しの試験打ち上げとなった。
宇宙開発に関して 「我々は月へ行く必要がありません」と�ｹ小平は述べ、有人宇宙開発を停止し実用衛星の打ち上げを優先する考えを示した。この緊縮は、科学者たちの名誉を回復し、軍には大陸間弾道ミサイル開発の優先権を与えるものだったため、文革の終わりを意味するものとして実質歓迎された。
1978年12月の中国共産党第11期中央委員会第3回全体会議で4つの近代化、すなわち工業、農業、国防、科学技術の近代化向上を最重要課題とする政策方針は正式に承認された。改革開放路線が始まったのだ。
1979年1月、東風五号の試験打ち上げが再開された。翌年2月まで国内を着弾点とした試験をその後5回繰り返し、1980年5月、南太平洋上を着弾点とした試験を二度行い、成功させた。中国はこうして大陸間弾道弾を手に入れたのだが、実質、宇宙用打ち上げ機を転用した物だとも言える訳だ。
1979年5月、風暴一号によって科学衛星実践二号が打ち上げられた。250キロの実践二号は、箱型の構体を持ち展開式のパドルを持つ中国最初の近代的な衛星である。
1981年9月、風暴一号によって科学衛星実践二号、実践二号甲、実践二号乙の三機が同時に打ち上げられた。この実践二号は前回打ち上げられたものと同型だが、実践二号甲は長空一号に似た電離層観測衛星で、実践二号乙は金属球と風船をワイヤーで結んだ、大気密度を測るものだった。この三機同時打ち上げというのは所謂MIRVとは関係無い。ただ単に衛星重量に対して打ち上げ能力が過剰だったために思いついた、という事らしい。この打ち上げは" 一箭三星"
と呼ばれ賞賛されたが、これ以降風暴一号の打ち上げは終了し、ロケット開発は北京に集中される事になった。上海が再びロケットを作るのは1988年、長征四号である。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#4 - 2008年2月27 日( 水) 06時20 分
中国最初の衛星は1966年5月に、名前を東方紅一号とし、その名前の元となる楽曲をテープから再生、ラジオ放送するだけのものとするよう決定された。
1958年以来、概念設計と基礎研究に留まっていた上海と北京の衛星開発者たちは、ようやく実機に取り掛かる事となった。東方紅一号の開発者は北京に集約された。
衛星の重量は170キログラム、科学機器は一切積まず、太陽電池も積まず、バッテリのみで動作することとした。できるだけ海外で観測されるよう軌道傾斜角は70度が選ばれた。
完成した衛星は直径1mの72面体で、ほぼ球体の形状は大気密度の測定を意図したものだった。衛星構造はアルミ合金の本体の上にグラスファイバーを巻き、その上にアルミの薄板の多面体のカバーで覆ったもので、断熱を意識していた。バッテリは銀亜鉛バッテリ5個から成り、20MHzで設計では20日間、音楽のみを繰り返し放送する。
科学機器などを積むのは二号機の実践一号からで、これには太陽電池と、これにより充電可能なニッカドバッテリが搭載されていた。衛星構体は東方紅一号と同一だが、機械式シャッターによる能動熱制御を搭載するとともに、宇宙線探知器、X線探知器と磁力計を搭載し、20MHzと19.995MHzの二つの送信機から16チャンネルのテレメトリを降ろした。実践一号の開発は上海で行なわれた。
しかし開発はほとんど即座に、文化大革命に突入することになる。科学衛星開発を主導していた地球物理学者趙九章が紅衛兵に殺されたのは、極めて大きな影響を持っていたに違いない。中国の宇宙開発は科学界からの支援がほとんど期待できない状況に突入し、その影響は続く時代へと及んだ。
衛星開発は遅ればせながら保護されたが、科学と教育が大弾圧を受けていた時代においては、それはただ単に死ななくて済む、程度のものでしか無い。宇宙開発は軍の保護下に置かれ、軍に支配されるようになる。
1969年には科学衛星や次の再突入回収型衛星のためのコンポーネントや、東風五号用の大型エンジンYF-20の試験が本格化した。7月には衛星打ち上げシステムの結合試験が行なわれ、翌年4月1日、バックアップを含む2機の東方紅一号衛星と、ロケットコンポーネントの全てが酒泉射場に到着した。
周恩来は関係幹部を招集し、報告を受けた。毛沢東の認可のあと射場作業が始まり、4月24日には打ち上げ準備が完了した。
午 後9時35分、長征一号は打ち上げられた。ロケットは問題なく衛星を軌道に投入し、成功の確認後の午後10時、周恩来は毛沢東に成功の報告をした。東方紅一号の電波は直ぐにアメリカの追跡網に拾われた。公式発表は翌朝だったが、ベトナム、ラオスとカンボジアの外交官たちには、国際会議の席上で衛星打ち上げの成功を明かした。
この衛星打ち上げ成功のニュースは、各国からの祝賀メッセージとして中国に帰ってきた。国際的な孤立状態にあった中国にとって、それは大きな価値を持っていた。国内ではお祭り騒ぎが続き、メーデーには毛沢東が銭学森らを賞賛する演説をした。
この成功のあと、毛沢東は有人衛星計画を許可した。
東方紅一号は28日間動作して、現在も軌道を周回している。実践一号の開発は関係者の下放などで遅延したが、翌年3月3日に無事打ち上げられ、以後8年以上正常に動作し続けた。
宇宙飛行士の選抜が始まった。1840名の推薦された戦闘機乗りから88名が選抜され、翌年5月に20名に絞り込まれた。北京の航天医学工程研究所で選抜と訓練は行なわれ、また宇宙食などの開発も行なわれた。
宇宙船の設計は上海で行なわれ、曙光一号と呼ばれた。宇宙船のデザインはマーキュリーカプセルに似た漏斗型という表現があるが、揚力再突入を意図した形跡は無い。アメリカのコロナ再突入回収カプセルに似た鈍頭円錐形状のカプセルと機械船の二つから構成されており、カプセルの耐熱材の詳細は明らかではないが、アブレータを使ったという説と、アブレータではなく炭素系複合材が断熱材として採用されたという説の二つがある。
この宇宙船の詳細は明らかではないが、いわゆるFSW衛星は当初有人宇宙船として開発された事が知られている。FSW衛星の重量は1.8トンである。マーキュリーカプセルの1.3トンより十分に大型だ。曙光一号は恐らく一人乗りであろう。再突入は揚力を利用しないため、逆加速度は最高8Gにまでなった筈である。
1970年7月に初めてパラシュートの試験が行なわれた。カプセルを空中投下し、そしてカプセルは開かなかった。次の試験、更に10月の再試験でも失敗し、担当者はサポタージュの罪で刑務所に入れられた。パラシュートシステムの試験に成功するのは1974年になってからである。
1971年4月、有人計画714研制は正式に発足した。最初の打ち上げは1973年末に予定された。
1971年9月、宇宙開発を巡る情勢は一変する。林彪事件である。
林彪は十大元帥にも列せられた軍人で、毛沢東に次ぐナンバー2、主席空席の状況での唯一の副主席として正式には中国トップの地位にいたが、毛沢東との対立の結果、暗殺を試みて失敗、林彪はソ連への亡命の途上で墜落死した。
東方紅一号の打ち上げ後、林彪は過剰な衛星打ち上げ計画を認可し、宇宙開発に支配力を及ぼそうとしていた。
事件後、七机部と宇宙開発関係者は粛清の対象となった。1976年、四人組の逮捕と�ｹ小平の復権まで、宇宙開発は停滞することになる。弾道ミサイル開発は続行していたが、東風五号の開発は難航し、衛星打ち上げ機の開発の中心はこの時期上海に移った。
更 に1975年、有人計画の打ち切りが決まった。有人計画よりまず地上の経済問題の解決が先だと、毛沢東と周恩来は合意した。中国を巡る国際情勢は大きく好転していた。中国の国力について虚勢を張る意味は薄れていたのだ。
1975年暮れ、銭学森は自分の上司にあたる張翼翔中将、人民解放軍における戦略ミサイル軍にあたる第二砲兵部隊のトップを、排他主義の廉で批判した。張翼翔は長征二号の打ち上げ失敗に関する調査を行なっており、銭学森と対立したのだ。
これを取り上げた四人組は、同時に�ｹ小平も攻撃した。銭学森はこの尻馬に乗り、�ｹ小平を革命の道をゆく全ての科学者の敵として非難した。更に翌年の四五天安門事件の責任を問われ、�ｹ小平は再び失脚したが、10月に四人組は逮捕され、翌77年に�ｹ小平は復権、ほどなく最高権力者の地位についた。
銭学森にとって、宇宙開発を巡る状況の袋小路を打破するための行動だったのだろうが、それは完全に裏目に出た。銭学森を中国に招き、保護し続けていた周恩来は既に亡く、張翼翔は復権し、銭学森は宇宙開発の最高指導者の地位を追われた。"
両弾一星" の権威は地に墜ちたのだ。
銭学森はその後、気功の研究などに手を出す事となる。彼が気功を科学の研究対象であると宣言した事により、中国で気功はブームとなる。いわゆる法輪功の祖とも言えるだろう。
銭学森自身は、その後1989年の六四天安門事件において、�ｹ小平と李鵬らを支持する声明を発表する事により、再び露骨に権力側にすり寄った。その甲斐あってか、1991年には、国家に貢献した科学者たちの列に銭学森は再び加えられている。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#3 - 2008年2月21 日(木) 02時27 分
弾道ミサイルの開発は主に北京で行なわれていた。
弾道ミサイルの開発は、国家の経済的困難にも関わらず、毛沢東と周恩来によって強力な庇護を受けていた。
1960 年11月5日、最初の1059号弾の打ち上げは成功した。1059号弾は東風一号( DF-1)と名づけられた。
1962年3月21日、R-5のコピー、東風二号(DF-2)の最初の打ち上げは、69秒後に失敗に終わった。
失敗の原因はエンジンと誘導の問題と分析された。銭学森が全力を尽くさねばならないのは衛星計画ではなく、まず弾道ミサイル開発だった。彼は完全に新規に慣性誘導システムを開発する事を決意した。
銭学森が開発したのはディジタル慣性誘導システムであったが、当時の中国の電子工学の水準は極めて低かった。トランジスタの生産技術はソ連から供与があり、1958年には国産化に成功しているものの、その後の生産は質、量共にお粗末としか言いようがない水準に留まっていた。中国最初の全トランジスタ化コンピュータ、109Bは1965年にようやく実現している。
銭学森は中国の電子工学とコンピュータ技術に大きな投資をしてこの問題をクリアした。東風二号の打ち上げは1964年6月になってようやく成功する。同年、中国最初の核実験が行なわれた。次の目標は弾道ミサイルに核爆弾を搭載する"
両弾結合" となった。
11月には東風二号の改良が始まり、65年にはこの射程を延長した改良型が前線に配備された。1966年、核を搭載した東風二号の試射が酒泉で行なわれ、搭載された12キロトン核は800キロを飛んで炸裂した。
この成功は当時国際的に孤立していた中国にとって、極めて大きな意味を持っていた。核を搭載した東風二号は日本をその標的として配備された。いまだ日中国交は正常化しておらず、中国にとって日本は政体がどう変わろうが相変わらず敵国であった訳だが、現実の脅威である米ソに対する阻止力には、東風二号はなっていなかった。
1964年、東風二号の打ち上げ成功後、続いて東風三号(DF-3)の開発も始まった。東風三号は外見上は太った東風二号に過ぎないが、中国最初の純独自開発のミサイルで、貯蔵可能推進剤を使い、倍の重量と推力、そして射程も倍の2800kmに増えていた。
1966年の東風三号の打ち上げは、離床111秒後に突然の推力低下によって失敗した。更に翌年の試験打ち上げでも同様の現象によって打ち上げは失敗し、そして以後試験打ち上げは中断された。
面白いのは、東風三号の開発が1980年代に入って再開されている事だ。改良型の東風三号甲の打ち上げ成功は1985年だった。
東風三号の開発開始と同時に、東風四号の開発も始まっている。
東風四号は東風三号を二段式にして射程を更に延ばしたもので、これに固体三段目を追加したものが中国最初の衛星打ち上げ機である長征1号である。同時に東風五号の開発も決定された。東風五号は最終目標即ち大陸間弾道弾である。東風二号甲から五号までの四種類を8年で開発する、この計画は"
八年四弾" と呼ばれた。
中国最初の独自開発大型液体エンジンYF-1は、ソ連のR-12用エンジンRD-214によく似た4燃焼室構成のエンジンで、ソ連のイサーエフ設計局で考案された燃焼室構造によく似た再生冷却構造になっていたようだが、ターボポンプはソ連系ではなく、燃焼剤と酸化剤のターボポンプの間にガスタービンの来る、V-2由来の方式だった。ターボポンプの駆動はガスジェネレータ方式が用いられた。中国では以来この方式がずっと使用されている。
1957年頃の中ソ蜜月時代、ソ連側から技術を提供した主体はヤンゲルのSKB-586だと思われる。彼らがR-1,R-2,R-5を生産しており、更に抑制赤煙硝酸とUDMHを使ったR-12をその時期に開発している。当時中国は留学生らによって活発なスパイ活動を行なっており、R-12の開発資料が中国に流出していた可能性は大きい。
YF-1は最初トリニチルアミンとトリエチルアニリンの混合物を燃焼剤、抑制赤煙硝酸と四酸化二窒素の混合物を酸化剤として開発を始めたが、燃焼剤をUDMHに変更し、更に燃焼振動の問題に対処するためにインジェクタ構造を工夫すると共に、三種のインジェクタの配置によって燃焼振動を抑制する、インジェクタバッフルと同様の工夫に辿り付いている。
東風四号に採用されたのは改良型であるYF-2だった。YF-2は推進剤に抑制赤煙硝酸とUDMHの組み合わせを採用していた。更に2段目用に、YF-2の燃焼室クラスタを単一燃焼室にしたYF-3が開発された。開発順序が通常の逆である。彼らのスケジュールは切迫していたのだ。
通常、二段目エンジンは一段目分離後しばらくして点火される。さもないと一段目が遮る噴射炎で自分が損傷を受けるからだ。しかしこれは無重量状態での点火と推進剤移送の問題を生じる。東風四号では一段目分離直後に二段目が燃焼を開始する。噴射炎は段間部のトラス構造から逃げることが期待されていた。分離と二段目燃焼のタイミングは際どいものとなったが、無重量状態で点火する必要は無くなった訳だ。だからYF-3は高真空での動作のみを考慮すれば良かった。
これら開発の最大の障壁は、エンジンでも制御でも品質管理でも無かった。
文化大革命が始まったのだ。1966年5月に始まったこの原理主義政治運動は、保護されていた筈の宇宙開発、弾道ミサイル開発の分野でも容赦なく荒れ狂った。七机部はその活動を停止され、地球物理学者の趙九章や冶金学者の葉渚沛などの科学者や医者、教育関係者が紅衛兵によってリンチの末に殺された。
銭学森は1967年初頭に平職員の地位まで降格され、自己批判文への署名を強要された。多くのスタッフが下放され、溶鉱炉での労働を割り当てられた幹部もいた。管理体制の破綻のため第五研究院の活動は事実上停止した。
周恩来は衛星開発を救おうと、1967年3月に衛星開発を軍の管轄下とする事を党幹部に納得させたが、ここで保護下にあると宣言できたのは、わずか15名に過ぎなかった。
弾道ミサイルの開発の破綻も時間の問題だった。4月、人民解放軍は中国科学院そのものを保護対象とすることを宣言し、中国空間技術研究院が設立された。これにより、中国の宇宙開発と弾道ミサイル開発は、文化大革命の悪夢からようやく距離を取る事ができるようになった。
しかし、落ち込んだ経済と産業は、開発の継続を困難なものにしていた。
1969年11月16日、東風四号の最初の打ち上げは失敗に終わった。彼らは文革で中断した東風三号の開発を飛び越え、いきなり四号に挑戦したのだ。二度目の打ち上げは翌年1月30日で、これに成功した事で衛星打ち上げは一挙に大きなハードルを越えたことになる。
東風四号に固体三段目を追加したものが長征一号である。この固体三段目は柳南生によって開発されたものだった。
中国最初の宇宙開発による死者は、この固体ロケット開発の現場で起きたものだった。1962年12月6日、固体推進剤の混合中に起きた爆発で、技術者4名が死んでいる。1964年に固体ロケットの開発進捗のために会議が開かれ、問題の分析が行なわれ、開発は一挙に進んだ。しかし、1968年1月26日に死傷者は出なかったものの再び爆発事故は起きた。固体ロケットの製造現場では1974年に再び爆発事故を起こし、一人が死んでいる。
三段目エンジンはコンポジット推進剤を使い重量5トン、うち推進剤重量3.7トンという大型エンジンである。その後エンジンは試験を繰り返し、東風四号に統合される時がやって来た。
1970年4月24日、長征一号は最初の打ち上げで重量173キログラムのペイロード、東方紅一号を軌道に投入した。日本が衛星打ち上げに成功したわずか二ヵ月後のことであった。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#2 -2008年2月15 日(金) 03時32 分
もう一つの開発拠点が、上海の上海机電設計院である。上海交通大学を基盤として1953年に設立されたここでは、独自ロケット開発が1957年末から58年にかけて衛星開発の拠点として配置転換された人材によりスタートしている。代表的なメンバーは柳南生、王季希の二人であると思われる。柳南生はイギリスで博士号を得て帰国したばかりのエリート、王季希は上海交通大学の力学系副主任という立場だった。581研制が中止された後、中国の宇宙開発はただ此処だけが生き残っていた。
彼らは独自の小型ロケッ トT-1,T-3, T-4と試作を続けたが、打ち上げまで至っていない。T-5はV-2の技術を導入したとあるが、これはつまりR-1のことだろう。しかしこれも打ち上げに至っていない。大躍進政策の失敗による逆風の中、後継のT-7(探空七号)でようやく打ち上げに漕ぎ着けたが、しかしこれは本来のT-7の縮小版、探空七号模型( T-7M)であった。
最初 のT-7Mは1960年2月19日に上海郊外の浜辺、南匯区老港に設けられた簡易射場から打ち上げられた。追跡アンテナは手動で動かし、推進剤タンクに内圧をかけるために自転車の手押しポンプが使われた。
T-7Mは全長4.21m、直径0.25m、全備重量190kg、推力2トン、最大到達高度は10kmである。推進剤はフルフリルアルコールとアニリンの混合物と、白煙硝酸だった。これは混合によって自燃する。推進材選択の独自性には注目すべきだろう。
1960年3月、南京の北、安徽省と江蘇省の境の山地(安徽省广�ｺ)に、603基地と呼ばれた射場は建設された。60年の3月に作られたから603基地。中国では暫くこんな命名がメジャーだった。国内奥地に基地が建設されたのは、ひとえにT-7の開発に目処が立ったからであろう。T-7を海を越えて飛ばせば、国際間でミサイルとして名指しされる危険を孕む事になる。もしロケットが他国に落ちた場合、それは面倒な事になるだろう。
1960年5月、毛沢東は上海を訪れ、新技術展覧会を視察している。この時期毛沢東は大躍進政策の失敗から国家主席の座を譲っていたが、なおその権勢を衰えながらも維持していた。
毛沢東はT-7Mに目を留め、係員に到達高度を聞いた。8キロであるとの答えを聞いた毛沢東は”8キロしか飛ばないのか”と応えた。しかしその場に居合わせた研究者は、”今は8キロだが、すぐに20キロ、200キロ飛ぶだろう”
と口を出した。
縮小型でない正式版 、T-7は同年9月に初飛行を果たした。全長10m、直径45cm、標準ペイロード25kgのこのT-7シリーズの最大到達高度は115kmであった。T-7シリーズは1960年から1968年にかけて計18基が打ち上げられた。
上海交通大学は銭学森のホームグラウンドでもある。彼は将来の人工衛星開発とその先に向けて、T-7シリーズを利用した。一段目を小さな補助固体ロケットにしたT-7A型が開発され、様々な機器試験に用いられた。そして更に生物搭載可能なT-7A(S)シリーズが開発された。
T - 7A( S ) は機体先端の分離部がひとまわり太くなり、生命維持装置や観測装置などを搭載する空間を得た。中国科学院生物物理所はこれを一連の生物搭載打ち上げ実験に使用した。4匹の白鼠、12種の試験管に入れられた各種生物、そして二頭の犬がT-7A(S)で飛んだ。
1966年7月15日、T-7A( S2) ロケットを使い、ツァオバオ " 小豹 "
という１頭の犬が打ち上げられた。更に28日にはシャンシャン" 姗姗"
という犬が打ち上げられている。この打ち上げでは少なくとも片方は高度70kmに到達した。
ツァオバオとシャンシャンの二頭は無事生還したが、衛星計画が本格化した三年後の1969年、研究所の合併による引越しの際に、他の犬に噛み殺されている。
T- 7A(Y) は1964年から打ち上げを開始した、人工衛星搭載機器試験用の機体である。この機体は酒泉で2機が打ち上げられ、地上と星の写真撮影、電離層と赤外センサのデータを取得した。
1963年1月、国防部第五研究院の下に衛星開発の本格開発のため、上海机電設計院は再編され、メンバーは50人規模まで膨れ上がった。以降、民生宇宙開発は上海、軍事関連は北京という流れが定着する事となる。
1965年、衛星計画は1970年打ち上げを目標として新しく組み直され、承認された。この651研制(65年の1番目の計画)により開発体制は更に大幅に変わり、上海机電設計院は七机部、後に第八設計院となった。
ただ、彼ら全員がそのまま衛星開発の現場に横滑りできた訳ではない。柳南生はその後小型固体ロケット"和平"
シリーズの開発に携わっている。彼のようなホープが衛星開発ではなく傍流に廻ったのは、何か訳があったのだろう。
衛星計画の復活は、大躍進政策の失敗を否定する毛沢東らの意向を汲んだものだった。従ってその目標も期限も以前のものからほとんど変化は無い。15年以内にイギリスの経済力を凌駕するという大躍進政策は明らかに失敗していたが、宇宙計画は優遇されていた。
651研制はその目的を、単純な衛星を打ち上げ、中国の衛星の能力を全世界に示す事をまず第一とし、その後回収可能衛星の開発へと進む事としていた。回収可能衛星と生命維持システムが合わされば、有人飛行まで直ぐである。中国の宇宙開発はこの時期、根底において有人飛行を目的としていたことは間違いない。
603基地は1966年を最後に打ち上げに使用されなくなり、1980年に閉鎖された。

■ 中国の宇宙開発史#1 -2008年2月11 日(月) 01時49 分
中国の宇宙開発は1955年、銭学森のアメリカからの帰国から始まる。
銭学森はアメリカにおける弾道ミサイル制御の初期の第一人者だった。何せフォン・カルマンの直弟子である。
彼は北京で天才少年として認められ上海交通大学に入学し、卒業後1935年にアメリカに留学することになる。MITに一年在籍した後、カルテクでカルマンに師事して39年に博士号を取得し、43年には助教授になっている。この時期彼はカルテク周辺のアマチュアロケットグループに入ったり、空軍のためにRATO用の小型固体ロケットの開発をしたりしている。
彼はJPLの共同設立者の一人でもある。1944年には初期の月探査機に関する研究を行っている。また彼はカルマンの助手としてアメリカの軍事航空分野での助言を行なった。ドイツ降伏直後には臨時に大佐の階級を得て、ドイツのロケット技術の調査に参加している。戦後は大陸横断ロケットプレーンの提案で雑誌や新聞等を賑わせもした。
1946年に結婚し、50年には米国籍を取得したものの、彼はアメリカ国内を吹き荒れるマッカーシズムの煽りを受け、1951年にはFBIに軟禁されるようになる。更に、暗号書類を持っているという告発を受けて刑務所に送られたが、この暗号書類と言うのは単なる対数表であったことが直ぐに判明した。彼は帰国を希望するようになっていた。
銭学森の帰国は朝鮮戦争時の米兵捕虜との交換で実現した。セキュリティリスクを伴う彼の帰国の希望は数年がかりでようやく叶えられたが、書類等の持ち出しには極めて厳しい制限が課せられた。この時期に彼が研究していたのは、コンピュータによるロケット誘導という当時最もホットな分野だったのだ。
銭学森の帰国以前にも、ヨーロッパでA-4(V-2)をつぶさに見て帰国し、軍に意見する者もいたが、それら意見は中国の政策決定になんら影響を及ぼしていない。しかし、帰国後の銭学森の動きは迅速で、反応も素早かった。帰国後の翌年2月、銭学森は意見書"建立中国国防航空工業的意見"を党中央に提出し、早速3月には中国の科学政策の中にロケット開発が組み込まれている。4月には航天工業委員会が立ち上げられ、5月には弾道ミサイル開発が決定された。
1956年10月、銭学森は新設された国防部第五研究院の院長となった。銭学森は当初、時間をかけて独自開発をすることを考えていたが、1957年8月、ソ連からの技術援助が受けられる事が決まり、事態は再び急転した。
1957年12月24日、ソ連から102人の技術者がやってきた。彼らは中国に弾道ミサイルの作り方を教えるために来たのである。技術移転されたのは、R-1,R-2,そしてR-5だった。全て液酸アルコールエンジンを使うA-4(V-2)系統の技術である。R-5の機体構造とアビオニクス(誘導系を除く)は先進的なものだったが、ソ連独自の慣性誘導系を持つR-5Mの技術は恐らく中国には渡っていない。使われたのはソ連でドイツ人技術者達が開発した無線誘導方式である。目標誘導に慣性誘導は使われていない。エンジンもグルシコの技術的跳躍以前のもので、A-4のものとスケールや技術的洗練の差は有れど、基本的に大差は無い。
時はスプートニクが打ち上げられて間もない頃である。1958年5月、共産党第8期全国代表大会第2回会議で"
社会主義建設の総路線"と共に、中国独自の人工衛星の開発が正式に発表され、10月には酒泉射場の建設が始まった。この衛星計画を581研制と呼ぶ。衛星計画は悪名高き" 大躍進" と共に始まったのだ。
R-2のコピーは順調に進んだ。材料の40%は入手性の問題から変更せざるを得ず、それに伴う設計変更が行われた。このR-2の中国コピーは、1959年には開発完了との見通しに基づいて1059号弾と名づけられた。
しかし、中ソ間の関係冷え込みに伴い、1959年6月、中国への技術支援は打ち切られる事となった。1059号弾の開発は突如として困難を極めるものとなった。更に衛星計画は国力に不相応と、開発の停止判断がなされ、弾道ミサイルの開発に注力する事となる。大躍進政策の悲惨な失敗は、順調に成長していた筈の中国の経済力をずたずたにしたのだ。
ソ連人技術者たちは60年6月に全員が引き揚げた。この初期のソ連からの技術導入というのは2年半、実質1年半の事でしかなかった訳だ。
しかし、これで突然中国独自のロケット開発がストップした訳ではなかった。むしろ逆に、スプートニクによって幕が開いた宇宙開発への関心を背景に、独自の成果が芽を出すことになる。
一つは、北京の北航飛机設計研究所で開発された" 北京二 号 " という全長2.9mほどの固体ロケットである。1958年9月、吉林省白城子で初めて打ち上げられ、高度7.4kmに達した。更に全長7.2mの液体型のもまた同年10月に打ち上げに成功したという。液体型は全長5.9m、最大到達高度は45.5kmと桁違いのものとなった。双方とも推進剤の種類は不明である。
しかし、これら全く基礎技術の違う二種類が同時に開発されたというのはどうにも解せない。固体型の実在を疑う理由は無い。打ち上げを記録した写真が残されており、北京航天航空大学には実機も展示されている。写真では草原に垂直に立てられた高さ20m程の鉄塔をガイドに打ち上げられたことが判る。つまり誘導も制御も無かったのだ。
液体型の資料は少ないが、図によると機体後端に推力偏向板の端と見えないことも無いものが描かれている。射程もこれは制御抜きには不可能である。固体型と液体型の間には、大きな技術的ギャップがあるのだ。その後北航飛机設計研究所では後継ロケットの開発は行われていない。ちなみに北京一号は双発の軽旅客機である。

■ FT245RLの使用上の注意 -2007年12月26日(水) 20時06 分
FTDI 社製USBクライアントコントローラ、FT245RLは8bitパラレルポートの入出力をサポートしたデバイスである。FTDI社のVCPデバイスドライバの導入により、PCからはシリアルポートとして見えるようになり、これでソフトウェア開発は大幅に単純化される。
FT245RLを使うには配線のみ、プログラムを書かずに済み、簡単である。しかし、これを高いパフォーマンスで使用するのは難しい。高速を求めてパラレルデバイスを求めたのなら、残念ながらそこには壁があるのだ。
VCPドライバを使う限り、PCはデバイスから、好きなタイミングでパラレルデータを取得することができない。出力も、外部に何かRDピンをネゲートしてやるハードウェアが別に必要になる訳だが、それは比較的簡単だ。物凄く簡単な方法として、RXFピンに構わず、RDピンに適当なクロックを与えるという方式がある。同じクロックでラッチすれば、出力ポートの出来上がりだ。
連続的なPCへのパラレル入力も、同じような方法なら可能だ。
しかし、入力も出力も両方やろうとするのは難しい。入出力共にパラレルポートを使用するにも関わらず、パラレルポートは入出力双方に対して1つしかないから、入力と出力で排他制御しなければならないのだ。
……手軽と言った最初の言葉は何処へ行ったのであろうか。もはやマイコンかFPGAの世界である。更に言うなら、パラレルの高速さを生かそうとすれば、選択肢はFPGAしか無いのだ。
という訳で 、FPGAで双方向通信をできるだけ高速に行おうとする際のTipsを少々。
1:FT245RL内部の入力コントローラと出力コントローラは別々に動いている。例えばTXEピンが上がっている間にもRXFピンがアサートする、という事が起こり得る。
2:バッファにデータがあるうちはデータは連続で出力される。RDをネゲートしてRXFもネゲートされ、そうして200nsecも待てばRXFが再びアサートされることになる。
3:RDをアサートしなければFT245RLはデータを出力しない。FT245RLの出力バッファが一杯の間にも入力を行う際、これは基本的な操作となる。
4:RDをアサートしても20nsec程度はデータが安定しない。データのラッチタイミングはこれを考慮に入れなければならない。
5:バッファから次々とパラレルポートに出力されている間、RXFピンがネゲートしている間にもデータ入力シーケンスは行える。勿論データ入力そのものは行なえないが、予備動作は行なえるのだ。RXFピンがネゲートしたらバスに入力データを出し、20nsec待ってWRをアサートすれば、データ入力シーケンスは出力待ちの間に終えてしまうことができる。
あとは大体スペックシート通りに動く筈だ。

スプートニク2号以降も、第三期動物打ち上げは続行されていた。これら実験の目的は有人飛行のための事前研究であり、道のりはまだ遠かった。
1958年8月に再開された打ち上げではR-2Aで2回、新しいR-5Aで3回の打ち上げが行なわれた。R-5Aは犬たちを400km以上の高度に打ち上げた。R-5Aの大気圏再突入は過酷なものとなり、分離部エアブレーキは真っ黒に焼け焦げた。
最初の打ち上げはパルマとブシヴォークの生命を奪った。死因はキャビンの減圧である。6日後の二度目の打ち上げでは、ビーリャンカとビョスケーヤの二頭は高度453kmから帰還したが、無事と言う訳にはいかなかった。心電図には明らかな異常が見られるようになっていた。
R-5Aが最後に犬たちを乗せたのは10月に入ってからだった。有人衛星計画はくさび型ではなく球形のカプセルを使うよう決定され、秋には詳細設計に入っていた。
R-5A最後の打ち上げではパラシュートの制御に失敗し、そうしてズリバとクノッカは死んだ。
この後も動物打ち上げは続行されたが、打ち上げにはR-2Aが用いられた。翌1959年7月は二機が打ち上げられて、うち1機には犬たちに加えてウサギも打ち上げられた。ウサギは瞼の上の筋肉に電極を埋め込まれて、無重力状態での筋肉の収縮を調べられた。
1960年の2機が弾道飛行での動物打ち上げの最後となった。ここでも1機、ウサギを乗せたフライトが行なわれている。この2回の打ち上げも6月24日を最後に無事に終わった。
ひと月後にはコラブル・スプートニク、ヴォストーク試験機に二頭の犬が載って、衛星軌道に飛ぶはずだった。
弾道飛行をした犬たちは全部で36頭、うち15頭が生命を落とした。
犬たちの宇宙飛行は、次の段階、軌道飛行の段階へと移った。
1960年5月15日、最初のヴォストーク宇宙船の試験機1КП、最初のコラブル・スプートニク(корабль-спутник:船-衛星)が打ち上げられた。これには人も動物も乗っていない。電気的、機械的にはほぼ同じだが、熱遮蔽が備わっていなかった。この機体は再突入シーケンスに失敗し、減速の代わりに高軌道へ遷移してしまった。
2機目のコラブル・スプートニクになるべき機体1ККはチャイカ( Чайкой) とリシーチカ( Лисичкой ) を乗せて、打ち上げ直後に爆散した。チャイカは打ち上げ時にバース( Барс ) という名前に改名された可能性がある。
赤毛のリシーチカはコロリョフによくなついていた。射出座席は動作しなかった。
1960年8月29日、2機目のコラブル・スプートニク1К-2は打ち上げられた。これに載せられたベルカ( Белки)とストレルカ( Стрелки)
の2頭は、地球を18周して帰還した。およそ1日中飛んだことになる。
この機体は更に白と黒の12匹のマウス、昆虫、とうもろこしと小麦の種子、菌類を搭載していた。宇宙での犬たちの様子は低レートテレビ画像のテレメトリで地上に送信され、その録画は世界に公開された。更に帰還後、2頭は各国の報道陣の前に晒された。この機体も西側ではスプートニク5号と呼ばれたりもした。
その後ストレルカは出産し、その仔のうちプシヴォク(
Пушок:糸くず)と名付けられた1頭が、フルシチョフからケネディにプレゼントされている。
12月1日、三機目のコラブル・スプートニク1К-5にはチャルカ( Пчелка)とムーシカ( Мушка )
が載せられ、地球を17周したところで減速噴射を実施したが、減速速度は希望より何故かすくなく、大気による減速が十分でないと判断した自動装置はАПО(аварийного подрыва объекта:緊急破壊装置)を起動した。着陸はソ連領土の外であってはならなかったのだ。こうして2頭は死んだ。海外には単に再突入に失敗したと発表された。
12月22日、4機目のコラブル・スプートニク1К-6が打ち上げられたが、3段目は予定より早く燃焼を終えてしまい、宇宙船は軌道に乗ることなく大気圏へ再突入した。宇宙船のエスケープシステムは再突入カプセルを分離し、そして緊急破壊装置が働くことなくカプセルがシベリア、ヤクーツク近くに着陸したことを地上局は報告した。緊急破壊装置は再突入異常の他にも、60時間のタイマでも起動する。即座に捜索隊が組織され、至近の町でヘリが徴発された。
この機体に乗っていた犬の名前には諸説ある。チューカ( Шутка)とコメータ( Комета ) が乗っていたという説と、ズールカ( Жулька ) とゼムチュゼナ( Жемчужина ) が乗っていたという説があり、更にゼムチュゼナはズールカが改名されたものだという話(ガゼンコ談。ズールカは後にガゼンコの飼い犬となる)や、コメータがズールカの改名後の名前だと言う話がある。
ヴォストークカプセルは着陸前に宇宙飛行士を空中で射出し、宇宙飛行士はパラシュートと身ひとつで着陸する。コラブル・スプートニクでは犬たちの生命維持カプセルは射出座席に固定され、本番と同じプロセスで空中に射出され、パラシュートで着陸する筈だった。現にベルカとストレルカはそうやって帰還していた。
しかし今回、犬たちは射出されていなかった。着陸時の衝撃は20Gにも達した筈である。捜索隊は自爆装置を解除して、衰弱しきった犬たちを助け出したが、それは打ち上げから三日後のことであった。この事故は報道されなかった。
1961年3月9日、チェヌシカ( Чернушка)
と等身大人形イワン・イワノヴィッチ、40匹のマウスを乗せた5機目のコラブル・スプートニク3КА-1は、地球を一周して無事帰還した。コロリョフは最初の有人飛行を地球一周のみとすることを決めていた。
チェヌシカは射出座席に乗らず、代わりに人形が射出された。チェヌシュカは専用の生命維持ケージの中で、カプセルと共に着陸した。着陸したのはクイビシェフから260kmの地点で、チェヌシカは怪我もなく無事だった。
続けざまの3月25日、ズヴェヅドチカ( Звездочка)とイワン・イワノヴィッチ人形を乗せたコラブル・スプートニク3КА-2もミッションを完全に遂行した。ガガーリンの飛行直前のことである。ズヴェヅドチカは元々は別の名前だったが、もっと良い名前を付けようとガガーリンによって改名されたものである。
3月29日のミーテイングで、コロリョフは関係者に、有人飛行に問題無しと報告した。

第三期打ち上げ実験は、新しいR-2Aロケットを用いて行なわれた。R-2Aは高度210kmにまで達する能力を持っていた。第三期では犬以外の動物や、麻酔状態での犬の状態が調べられた。
この時期新たにガゼン コ( О.Г. Газенко ) が科学者たちに加わっている。ガゼンコは以後のソ連宇宙生物学において大きな働きをすることとなる。
R-2Aの先端分離部は大型のパラシュートとエアブレーキを持った、重量1.4トンの弾道飛行宇宙船と言っていい規模のものだった。これは液体浸出による能動冷却の機能を持っていないことを除けば、チホンラーヴォフの1954年のレポートにあった有人宇宙船のイメージそっくりである。コロリョフは更に大型のものに人間を載せて、新しいR-5ミサイルで打ち上げるつもりだった。
分離部内部は飛行中、最大で摂氏90度以上にまで達したが、犬たちのキャビンは25度に保たれた。R-2Aのもたらす速度は、最大6分もの自由落下時間をもたらした。しかしその速度は、減速時において犬たちに最大8Gもの逆加速度をかけることとなった。この警告無しの減速は、犬たちに内出血をもたらすことが多かった。
第三期で加わった犬たちは以下の15頭である。
リベ ア( Рыжая ) 赤毛
ゾイマ( Джойна )
ベル カ( Белка ) リス 後に軌道飛行もおこなう 。
マヅニー カ( Модница ) 流行の先 端
クサチ カ( Кусачка ) 小美人
パル マ( Пальма ) てのひら
オトバシナー ヤ( Отважная ) 勇敢
シメジン カ( Снежинка ) 雪片。出産後ピンチスナー ヤ( Жемчужная ) 真珠 と改名。
マヨー ク( Малёк ) 稚魚
ブシヴォー ク( Пушок ) 糸くず
ビーリャン カ( Белянка ) 白い 蝶
ビョスケー ヤ( Пёстрая ) カラフル
ズリバ( Жульба )
クノッカ -2( Кнопка2 )
パルマ -2( Пальма2 )
これに第二期のダームカが加えられ、9機のR-2Aと3機のR-5Aの、計12機が1957年から1960年にかけて打ち上げられた。打ち上げは1957年5月から始まり、二回目の打ち上げでリベアとゾイマが減圧で出血死したほかは順調に打ち上げられた。3回目の打ち上げではマヅニーカとベルカが乗せられたが、ベルカは麻酔をかけられた状態での打ち上げだった。麻酔はアメリカの打ち上げではよく行なわれていたが、ソ連では初めてだった。これは宇宙空間での動物生理に意識の有無が関わるのかどうかを知るためだった。4度目もベルカは麻酔をかけられ、今度はダームカと一緒に飛んだ。5回目の打ち上げは9月で、意識のあるベルカと、麻酔を掛けられたマヅニーカのペアが飛行した。麻酔をしても、無重力状態の影響は現れるようだった。
そして、1957年10月4日が、更に11月3日が来る事になる。動物の軌道到達は大幅に早められた。スプートニク2号だ。

第二期打ち上げ実験は1954年7月から行なわれた。その年の5月には衛星計画が科学アカデミーで承認され、コロリョフの前には、宇宙開発の道が正式に開かれようとしていた。コロリョフは無人衛星の次の段階、有人打ち上げを既に視野に入れて活動していた。コロリョフはこの時期、有人弾道飛行を検討していた。
第一期打ち上げ以後も 、IAM において動物打ち上げの研究は進んでいた。今回の実験の目玉は宇宙服であった。この宇宙服は1952年に出来たばかりの与圧服開発製造を請け負う工場No.918、のちのズヴェズダ社で製作された。
この犬用の宇宙服はトナカイの毛皮の断熱材とプレキシガラスのバブルヘルメットを持っていた。前足は自由に動かせたが後ろ足は胴体と同じ袋の中だった。どちらにせよ空気循環装置などの隙間に収まってしまうと、犬たちは身動きできなかった。
新しいロケットR -1D(Р - 1Д ) とR-1E( Р-1Е )の分離部は、犬たちを様々な高度で射出するシステムを備えていた。犬たちの生命維持装置は、2リッター150気圧の酸素ボンベから二時間分の酸素供給が可能で、高度3600メートル以下の高度でバブルヘルメットの弁が開くようになっていた。更に生命維持装置のフレームにはパラシュートと無線テレメトリシステムが一頭づつに装備された。テレメトリは呼吸圧力や血圧、温度のデータも採取していた。
新たに加わった犬たちは以下の12頭である。
ダーム カ( Дамка )
リ タ( Рита )

打ち上げは九回行なわれた。最初はリサとバレイジクのペアが打ち上げられ、二頭とも帰還した。しかし二度目の打ち上げでダームカと組んだミーシャが死んだ。三度目の打ち上げではダームカと組んだパレイジクが死んだ。この二頭の死因は不明である。
翌 年1月に再開された四度目の打ち上げではリタが、更に五度目の打ち上げでは打ち上げ時の振動が原因でリサとブーリバが死んだ。
六度目は11月に行なわれた。この打ち上げでは帰還したはずのカプセルが着陸地帯で見つからず、三日間に渡って見つからなかったため、マリシュカとクノッカの生存は絶望視された。しかし、諦めず探索を続行した兵士たちは、草原を移動する羊の群れの中に二頭を見つけた。カプセルは羊の群れの真ん中に落ち、移動する羊たちにパラシュートを引きずられていたのだ。二頭は羊飼いが助けていた。
その後1956年5月から6月にかけて行なわれた三回の打ち上げは、何事も無く終了した。
科学者達は無重量環境での心拍数の変化を検知したと考えていた。打ち上げ時のストレスにも関わらず、宇宙空間で心拍はゆるやかになるように思われた。帰還した犬たちは打ち上げ前と何ら変わった所は見受けられなかった。第一期打ち上げを経験した犬たちの、その後の観察結果も同様だった。
1956年12月、パリで開かれたロケットと誘導ミサイルに関する国際会議の席で、これら二度の動物打ち上げ実験について発表が行なわれた。この場では犬用宇宙服、パラシュートと空中射出の手順について詳しく解説し、これら手法が有効であり、飛行は犬たちに本質的な変化をもたらさなかったと結論した。

「 宇宙の傑作 機 スプートニク」の原稿を書いています。冬コミに間に合うか判りませんが、その中から一部を。
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ジュール・ヴェルヌの小説 「 地球から月へ 」 ( Le Voyage dans la lune ) では、人間たちと一緒 に2頭の犬も、砲弾型の有人宇宙船に乗って月へと目指した。しかし、うち一頭は打ち上げ時の衝撃で怪我をし、その後亡くなっている。この犬の名はサテライト、 " 衛星"
であった。死骸は船外に投棄され、文字通り衛星となったのである。
もし宇宙を、高度100キロメートルへの到達と定義するなら、宇宙に最初に到達した動物は、アルバートIIという名前の体重3キログラムの小さなアカゲザルだ。
A -4(V-2)の技術を使った高々度への生物打ち上げはアメリカが先行していた。1948年6月11日、ホワイトサンズ射場でその最初の試みは行なわれた。ミサイル先端を分離式とし、パラシュートを装備した科学探査用の改造型A-4ロケットは、アカゲザルのアルバートIを載せて打ち上げられた。ロケットは高度60キロに到達したが、ロケット先端のカプセルは分離に失敗し、アルバートIは死んだ。
三日後、二匹目の猿が打ち上げられた。彼こそがアルバートIIである、しかしロケットは高度133キロに達した後、ミサイル先端の分離には成功したもののパラシュートの展開に失敗し、アルバートIIも死んだ。
翌年9月16日に打ち上げられたアルバートIIIは、打ち上げ10秒後に爆発したロケットと運命を共にした。11月12日に打ち上げられたアルバートIVは、アルバートIIと同じようにパラシュートの展開失敗によって死んだ。
1951年に再開された生物搭載打ち上げでは、ロケットをA-4から小型のエアロビーに変更して行なわれるようになる。
ソ連では 、1951年7月22日に初めて生物を搭載した打ち上げが行なわれた。
コロリョフと科学アカデミー会員ブラゴノラーノフ( А.А. Благонравов ) らの主導の元に、準備は1949年の冬に始まった。
モスクワの航空医学研究 所( IAM ) がコロリョフの要請で協力することとなった。アメリカの高々度動物打ち上げとその顛末の内容は論文として既に発表されていたが、IAMのイズダクスコィ(В.И.Яздовского)らは、アメリカの実験は、猿たちが宇宙空間の影響を受けていたとしても有意なデータを取得できておらず、無重量や宇宙線の影響のような、宇宙空間で動物が、人間が生存可能であるかという疑問に答えていないと考えた。
彼は高度100キロメートルへ打ち上げる搭載動物をおとなしい犬とし、そして個体差を考慮して二匹同時の打ち上げを提案した。確かに猿は生理学的に人間に近かったが、センサの取り付けが難しく、高い脈拍と呼吸頻度もデータサンプリングを難しくしていた。ネズミやウサギも同様である。それに対して、ロシアの科学者たちはパブロフ以来の伝統として犬を熟知していた。彼らは犬の情緒反応は猿のそれよりも人間に近いと考えていた。
犬たちはまず小さく軽くなければならなかった。搭載空間は28センチ立方程しか無く、一匹の重さは6から7キログラムの範囲内でなければならなかった。
年齢は生後18ヶ月から6歳までの間が望ましいとされた。カメラ映りの関係上、明るい毛色の犬が好まれた。そして衛生装置の都合から雌の犬のみが選ばれた。
候補となる犬たちはモスクワの路上から集められた。モスクワの過酷な寒さと飢えに耐える事が出来た犬たちは、どのような訓練と実験にも耐えるものと期待されていた。
犬たちの訓練は、彼らのための服に慣れることからはじまった。センサを装着したぴっちりしたスーツに胴体を覆われ、狭い空間でじっとできなければならない。
犬たちは、打ち上げ時の加速を模擬した遠心器で10Gまでの加速と、飛行機によるパラボリックフライトで短いながら無重量を経験した。科学者たちはそれらの条件での犬たちの反応をモニタし、選別に利用すると共に、将来の打ち上げ時の参考データとして経験を積んだ。
平行して、犬用の生命維持システムが開発された。生命維持装置が必要とされたのは打ち上げ準備を含めて数時間程度であった。ロケット先端の回収モジュールに適合した気密カプセルには、21.5%の酸素を含む混合気体を供給するタンクとインジェクタ、二酸化炭素を除去するためのソーダ石灰キャニスター、湿度調整用のシリカゲルが付属することとなる。センサとしては脈拍、呼吸頻度、皮膚温度、そしてカメラが搭載された。カプセルの呼吸気弁は再突入後、外気圧が一定以上になると自動的に開いて外気を取り入れるようになっていた。
最初の打ち上げ候補達は以下の9匹である。
デジカ( Дезик )
ツィガ ン( Цыган ) ジプシーという意味 。
リ サ( Лиса ) 狐という意味 。
ミーシ ャ( Мишка )
チジェ ク( Чижик )
スリャウ ィ( Смелый ) ボールド体という意味 。
バレイジ ク( Рыжик ) サフラン色という意味 。
ネプツォビ ィ( Непутёвый ) 無気力な、という意味 。
プラシュ カ( Рожка ) 靴べらという意味 。
1951年7月のカスプチンヤールにやってきた犬たちは、コロリョフら技術者、科学者、そして兵士らに可愛がられた。当時のカスプチンヤールは1947年とは違い、設備が増強されて快適な生活が送れる場所になっていた。
最初に打ち上げられたのはデジカとツィガンの二匹だった。ロケットは高度109kmまで上昇し、切り離された先端部はパラシュートで正常に帰還した。二匹は宇宙から生きて帰還したのだ。カプセルのハッチを開けると、犬たちは飛び出してきて草原の真ん中で人間たちにじゃれた。犬たちに、打ち上げ前と決定的に違う要素は見つけられなかった。
打ち上げは6回予定されていた。二匹づつ載せるから、9匹だと二回以上乗るものが現れる。二度目はデジカとリサの組み合わせだった。
しかしパラシュートは開かなかった。デジカとリサは死んだ。不具合の原因は振動によるリレーの動作不良であると思われた。ブラゴノラーノフはツィガンを二度と飛ばせるつもりは無いと言明した。
二週間後、打ち上げは再開された。
四度目の打ち上げの直前、8月17日、散歩中にスリャウィが逃亡した。逃亡といっても廻りは360度全て果てしない草原である。翌日には射場の簡易食堂で兵士たちに頭を撫でられている姿を発見されていた。スリャウィは翌日そのまま打ち上げられた。
五度目の打ち上げはミーシャとチジェクのペアだった。二匹は三度目の打ち上げから生きて帰還したペアである。しかし今回、帰還した犬たちはカプセルの中で窒息死していた。圧力調整器の故障で外気取り入れ弁が動かなかったのだ。
最後の打ち上げでは、カプセルに直接ドリルで穴が空けられた。実験期間のうち、外圧が本当に低い期間は短い。その穴からカプセルの中の気体が漏れても気体供給の能力は充分であったし、窒息も避けられる。勿論これは不具合の解決の先送りだった。
これにはプラシュカとネプツォビィの二匹が載る事になっていた。しかし打ち上げ準備中に、今度はプラシュカが逃亡した。打ち上げまで二時間という段階で途方に暮れていたところで、関係者は簡易食堂にいた子犬に眼をつけた。おとなしい名前も無い子犬に、ジフ( ЗИБ )という名前を与えて、ロケットに乗せて打ち上げてしまったのだ。ちなみにジフとは、逃げた駄犬の代わりという単語の頭文字3文字である。
二匹は無事帰還し、以後ジフも " 四本脚の宇宙飛行士 " に正式に仲間入りすることになる。

■ とりあえ ずCPU作ってみた -2007年7月30 日(月) 23時25 分
DesignWave 誌2007年7月号付録のFPGA、XC3S250Eは25万ゲート換算というロジック容量もさることながら、内部にコンフィギュラブルなブロックRAMを216kビット内蔵している。そのため、CPUを自作した時、メモリを外付けしないでも作れてしまう。
そういう訳で、これまでロジックだけは色々と書いておきながら、実装するのは躊躇していた様々なCPU自作を、現実の実装のカタチにする、これは機会だ。
しかしいきなり冒険は避け、堅実なヤツで最初は経験を積みたい。という訳で最初の目標は、アポロ誘導コンピュータの初期の原型機、Mod1bのVHDLによるハードウェアエミュレーションだ。
Mod1bは1960年から61年にかけてMIT計装技術研究所で開発された、極めてシンプルなコンピュータである。RAMは64ワード、クロックは200kHzで14clockかけて1命令実行、命令はわずか4種類しかない。命令は単純な1オペランド、間接参照も相対参照も無い。
実装したエミュレータは、まず速度が400倍の5.5MIPS、メモリは面倒くさかったのでメモリ空間512ワード全域(スイッチとランプのレジスタを除く)をRAMとした。また、割り込みや1ビットシフトなどの特殊レジスタも実装していない。従って互換性は無い(そもそもFPGAのIOでは互換をとるだけのI/O数を確保できない)ので注意されたい。大体オリジナルはRAMを破壊読出しするし。
コードは以下の通り 。

プログラムは起動直後にRAMに書き込まれる。
プログラムはただのカウンタで、無限ループを1つ巡るたびに1つづつカウントアップされる。カウンタ最上位がLEDに出力されるが、1周期が36μ秒と短いので明滅は肉眼では判別できない。従って動作はオシロとシミュレーションで確認した。
作るのに時間がかかった原因のひとつが、命令の一つ、NORが、我々の知るNOR論理とは違う代物、実際のところANDだったという点だ。これはショックだった。道理でまともなプログラムが書けない訳だ。

■ 日本における大陸間弾道ミサイル開発史#1 -2007年4月1 日( 日) 00 時26 分
日本の弾道ミサイル開発は、2006年6月の自民党本部での防衛宇宙技術に関する勉強会をその始まりとすることができる。この席上で”無責任な立場で、ざっと”日本が現有の宇宙用ロケットを転用して弾道ミサイルを持つとしたら、どのようなものになるか、意見を求められたとある人物、特に名を秘す人物が、否定的なニュアンスで語った内容こそ、その後の国産大陸間弾道ミサイルの基礎概念そのものであったからだ。
彼はH-IIAを例にとり、実用性は極めて低いが可能であると説明した。彼の説明の前半分が、その会合の参加者の頭にどの程度残留したかは疑問である。この会合の一週間後、北朝鮮の弾道ミサイル大量試射の直後であるが、政府内部会において、具体的な弾道ミサイル検討が防衛省及び関係企業に指示されたが、そのアウトラインは、既にH-IIAをベースとしたものであったとされる。
国産弾道ミサイルの開発は、2007年4月1日の閣議決定をもって正式にスタートしたが、この時には基本設計は完成していた。開発にかかるコストは最低限で済むと説明が行なわれていた。
この弾道ミサイル、10式対地弾道弾は99%までH-IIA 202 そのものである。二段目上端の弾頭インタフェイスだけは大幅な変更が加えられていたが、運用は当然H-IIAに準じたものとなる。
最初の試射 はJAXA種子島宇宙センターから2008年11月に行なわれたが、このときは情報収集衛星の技術試験機の打ち上げであるとアナウンスされていた。ご丁寧にも、10式対地弾道弾用に開発されたフェアリングには、H-IIAの標準型フェアリングに似せたダミーのマンホールまで加工してあった。
打ち上げは予定より2日遅れたが、これは地上系の不具合が原因のものであり、おおむね大きな不具合も無く打ち上げは成功した。が、この打ち上げは予定通り、失敗したとアナウンスされた。イースター島西沖合の着弾点の精度は期待通りであることが、観測を委託した民間船によって確認された。この打ち上げ失敗の原因は一段目エンジンの出力不足と報道された。
最大の問題は弾頭であった。10式対地弾道弾は11.5トンの弾頭を運搬可能であったが、当初はTNT換算爆発力で10トンを越える、米軍のMOABを越える超大型精密誘導爆弾の搭載が予定されていた。これは戦術的には極めて興味深い装備では有るが、政治的にはほとんど意味が無い。弾道ミサイルの主用途が政治的揺さぶりである以上、単なる大型爆弾では意味が無いとの意見が関係者調整部会で出た。いやでっかいキノコ雲出来るしいーじゃん、という意見もあったが、搭載弾頭は検討課題ということで一旦白紙とされた。
真に必要とされたのは核であったが、それは問題外であった。政府は、核ではないがそれっぽい爆弾、通称" 反応弾"( N2爆弾みたいなもの、という発言があったとも伝えられる。)を欲しがったが、そんなモノがある筈も無かった。
高レベル放射性廃棄物を弾頭に詰めるという案も真剣に検討された。歴史的にも、核弾頭の開発前には、弾道ミサイルのペイロードとして放射線性物質を積むという案が米ソ双方で検討されている。原子炉を弾頭にするというアイディアはこの辺りから出てきたものと思われる。
原子炉を弾頭とするメリットは、それが爆弾ではないという一点に尽きる。兵器ではなく地球に優しい国際的エネルギー支援であり、それをとびっきり高速な運搬手段でお届けするのだ。
炉心は特別に設計された小型のもので、商業用加圧軽水炉用の燃料集合体を4個収めた、高さ6メートル幅1メートルの、縦に細長いステンレス鋼の容器で、その上部に制御棒駆動機構が取り付いている。一次冷却水系はとってつけたような代物でしかない。何せ蒸気発生器が付いていないのだ。この炉心に遮蔽容器は存在しない。この原子炉の運用モードは運転をしないのが正常で、ある種の非常事態においてだけ制御棒が引き揚げられる。その際、極めて有り得ない偶然が重なって、一次冷却水が全て排出される事態となった場合、炉心温度は極めて上昇し、短時間で炉心融解の事態に至る。このプロセスは原子炉が目的地に到着する100秒前に開始される予定だった。この例えこのプロセスに至るような事故が起こらなかったとしても、この全重量8トンの高密度物体は、あらゆる遮蔽、例えば商業用原子炉の遮蔽容器をいとも簡単に破壊するだろうと計算された。
こ の " 海外支援用700kW級小型軽水炉 "
を、国産原子力潜水艦の原子炉にと画策する向きも有ったようだが、この恐ろしく出来の悪い代物をどうにかできたかどうかは疑問である。2018年11月に東シナ海で沈んだ国籍不明の原潜との関連を噂されることもあるが、ありえない話である。
この小型原子炉は日本における核開発としては異例のハイペースで開発が進み、2009年8月には1号試験炉が臨界に達した。その後ひと月で特性が検証され、11月には2号炉が打ち上げ試験モデルとして構造試験に、3号炉が電気試験に廻された。2010年4月には最初のフライトモデルが完成した。
10式対地弾道弾の試験2号機打ち上げは"
海外支援用700kW級小型軽水炉"フライトモデルの搭載が予定されていたが、種子島からの打ち上げは、漁業関係者の協力が得られる見込みが無かったため拒否されていた。勿論今後の運用を考えても種子島のみでの運用は論外であった。
10式対地弾道弾の打ち上げ運用は空自の第1、第2高射群によって行なわれ、計4基の射場が建設される予定であったが、予算の都合上、当面は芦屋基地に建設される新射場のみの運用となることが確定していた。射場建設は飛行場と固定翼機運用設備の廃止によってようやく可能となった。
サイロを使った運用が望まれたが、時間及び予算の都合、そしてホットローンチで機体を傷つけない方策がどうしても見つからなかったので、種子島に準じた射点が建設される事となった。どちらにしてもサイロを建設しても馬鹿でかい蓋が必要となり、ほとんどサイロの意味が無くなることは自明でもあった。
芦屋からの打ち上げは、2010年10月に行なわれた。見学した宇宙開発関係者はここで一様にカルチャーショックに襲われている。「俺、こういう光景、中国で見た事があるよ」とこぼす関係者もいた。搭載した原子炉が、どのようにしてある種の安全性基準をクリアしたのかは不明である。そもそも適用された基準の種類が公開されていない。
2号機の打ち上げは当初地上系の都合で2週間延期され、更に機体の都合でひと月延期されたが、打ち上げそのものは成功し、"
海外支援用700kW級小型軽水炉"フライトモデルはメルトダウンすることも無く、イースター島沖海底から回収された。
こうして10式対地弾道弾は公式に配備となった。実際の配備は翌年4月だが、試験打ち上げ成功直後に制式となっている。
政府は世界に対して 、 ” 日本は1時間以内に環境に優しいエネルギープラントをどこへでも無償貸与可能となった”と宣言した。正直なところ、世界各国はこの訳の判らない宣言に当惑し、恐怖した。”こいつら頭おかしいんじゃないか？”と思われたなら、外交としての10式対地弾道弾の配備は成功の部類であろう。
2011年6月、北朝鮮情勢の緊迫に伴い、政府は、北朝鮮への緊急エネルギー支援の準備と、緊急事態における即時対応を閣議決定した。これに伴い、芦屋では打ち上げ準備が始まり、6月22日には2日以内の打ち上げが可能状況となった。
しかし、情勢は膠着状態となり、2日以内の打ち上げが可能状況を三週間維持した辺りで、運用部隊の中からダウンする者が出始めた。7月末、隊員の一人がどうやって持ち込んだのか不明の日本刀を振りかざし、「朝鮮柳生が攻めてきたぞ」等と叫びながら周囲に斬りかかり、数人に怪我を負わせて取り押さえられる事態が発生した。これが直接の原因であるかは不明だが、翌月早くも後継機開発が決定されている。
10式対地弾道弾の性能は極めて高かったため、弾頭を軌道上に置きっぱなしにして、使いたいときに軌道離脱させれば良いのではないか、という軌道配備についての検討も行なわれた。核弾頭ではないため、軌道配備核ではない、というのが理屈だったが、デブリの影響を指摘した一部筋によってこれはお流れになった。代わりに浮上したのが部分軌道爆撃システム( FOBS )である。この開発はシークレットサービス社に委託されたが、同社が功徳兵器の試験中に豪運を炸裂させる事故を起こして一年間の取引停止を食らい、そのまま潰れてしまったために、開発はそこで中止となった。
この後しばらく、2016年前後の ” 原子炉押し付け配備競争” の始まりまで、日本は諸外国から腫れ物を扱うように接せられた。経済力のある北朝鮮、というのが専らの評判であったが、中国も原子炉の急速無償貸与を実用化したと宣言した事によって、世界は新たな冷戦の時代へと突入してゆくこととなる。

■ JavaScript再入門 -2007年3月29 日(木) 21時39 分
JavaScriptは、我々の最も身近にあるプログラム実行環境の一つである。また同時に、極めて低コストにプログラムを開発できる環境でもある。何しろブラウザとメモ帳でプログラムが書けるのだ。
しかし、複雑なこと出来ないし……という考え方が長いこと支配的であったことも事実である。絵が描けないのはそういう欠点の一つだ。
だが、JavaScriptにはブラウザがある。ネットがある。極めてリッチで洗練されたユーザインタフェイスがそこには存在する。何も全てのプログラムが美麗なグラフィックを必要としている訳ではない。ネット上にUIを置けるJavaScriptプログラムは、プログラムを公開して公共の利用に供する事に極めて適している。
さて 、JavaScript再入門と相成った訳だが、幾つか気が付いた点がある。まず、入門書として、" Ajax "
という名前が表紙に踊っていない本を買うべきでは無い、という点。
JavaScript参考書は3タイプに大別できる。まずNetscape時代の、古いバージョン向けの入門書。自分はこれで昔勉強したが、もはや本屋で見掛けることは少ないだろう。次が表紙にDHTMLという文句が書かれている本。これが最も役に立たない。ここで書かれているテクニックの大半は、Firefoxのコンテンツオプションの詳細設定で、デフォルトで機能がOFFされているものばかりである。要するにブラクラ作るのが精一杯という代物だ。そして最後がAjaxだ。
Ajaxとは簡単に言えば 、GoogleMapみたいなものを実現する技術だ。当然だが昔のコナミのアーケードゲームとは無関係である。Web2.0と言い換えても良い。で、これにJavaScriptが結構使われている。そんな訳でAjaxは流行り文句なのであるが、今時のJavaScriptを学ぶため必要な知識、即ちDOMをきちんと学べるのは、この種類の参考書以外には無い。
DOM とは何かと言えば、ブラウザで表示されている内容を、好き勝手に弄る方法である。昔のブラウザで出来なかったことが今出来るのは、今時のブラウザがページをXMLとしてパースしてくれるお陰だ。これによりJavaScriptには、XML形式の階層型データとしてページの隅々にまで自由なアクセスが可能な能力が与えられたのだ。
という訳で、JavaScriptによるプログラミングを広くお勧めしたい。
デバッガとして はFirebugの使用を推奨する。昔読んだ参考書では、JavaScriptで独自オブジェクトをどうやって作るのかすら判らなかったが、やってみると極めて素直で単純だった。いろいろ書いてみたいところだが、まず手始めに、こないだのRubyスクリプトをJavaScriptに書き換えてみた。

“ What ’s that got to do with the price of tea in China ? ” my grandmother used to ask me when she thought I was veering off - topic in a conversation .
Her voice came back to me recently , as I read about food riots in Mexico , and wondered what that had to do with the price of motor fuels in America .
Everything , apparently .
America ’s corn producers are resourceful , if not downright aggressive , when it comes to finding new ways to get people to consume their product : corn oil , corn chips , corn dogs , corn liquor , corn syrup and its obesity - inducing cousin high fructose corn syrup .
I used to like plain ol ’ corn on the cob .
Whatever happened to that ?
Of course , the latest incarnation of corn is as a motor fuel product called ethanol .
Ethanol is created by converting the starches found in corn into a combustible liquid that can be mixed with gasoline , or burned straight – if your vehicle has had the minor modifications needed to allow it to run on ethanol .
The spin is that ethanol is good for the environment because it will “ reduce our dependence on foreign oil . ”
But there are mixed opinions over the energy gains from ethanol .
In 2006 , a study out of the University of Minnesota found that ethanol returns only 25 percent more energy than it takes to produce it — and critics have suggested that the study did n’t calculate all the variables that go into producing it , such as the power to irrigation equipment to water the corn crop being used , the power consumed in making the fertilizers that nourish the crop , the cost of the farm equipment used to harvest it ( and the fuel to power that farm equipment ) .
Recent scientific studies have also found ethanol will make smog – particularly ozone pollution – worse , not better .
But ethanol is another way for corn producers to make money .
So it seems everyone is jumping on - board the ethanol - power bandwagon – from American automakers , who desperately want their massive S.U.V.s and trucks to appear to be guzzling less gas ( even when they really are n’t ) , to the oil industry ( after all , they will sell even more oil to rubes trying to make ethanol ) .
Did you miss General Motors ’ popcorn - popping “ Live Green Go Yellow ” ad campaign , touting its pseudo - green ethanol - burning E85 vehicles ?
Do you not own a TV ?
United States ethanol production increased from 1.6 billion gallons in 2000 to 5 billion gallons in 2006 .
Ethanol production is now diverting 20 percent of the U.S. corn crop – and that percentage could go as high as 50 percent this year – away from food production .
Hence , a so - called “ tortilla crisis ” has erupted in Mexico , where corn meal and flour ( used in tortilla production , among other things ) prices have gone up at least 25 percent recently .
This “ tortilla tax ” becomes a public relations challenge :
How is it more socially and environmentally responsible to starve the poor to run your S.U.V ?
No doubt the corn industry will come up with some clever new and diverting way to spin this .
They always do .
Meanwhile , copycats in the soybean industry are already plotting ways to get in on this cash - green bonanza in alternative fuels .
This year , soybean prices are expected to hit their second highest mark ever , the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports , thanks to diversion of soybean oil to use as a biodiesel fuel .
Two years ago , only two percent of the soybean crop went into bio-fuels ; it is estimated that that figure could climb to as high as 12 percent this year .
So far , Americans have n’t really caught on to what is happening to the price of products such as soybean or corn - based foodstuffs .
But that may change if and when this rush to all fuels allegedly more environmentally friendly affects the price of beer .
It could happen ; Heineken , the brewery giant , said beer prices might have to be raised because so many crops are being planted and diverted to bio - fuel production that the supply of barley and hops is being reduced .
Where will this all stop ?
Actually , it has barely even begun ; most ethanol and bio - fuel production is merely in the planning stages , or under construction ( as in the case of refineries to produce this stuff ) , and years from coming on - stream .
At what point might it dawn on people that the “ cure ” for reducing our dependence on foreign oil is worse than the original disease ?
The oil and corn industries might not appreciate this suggestion , because they stand to lose money from it , but why not just try driving less ?
Why not choose to drive more fuel - efficient cars and trucks ?
Those are things we can do to save the environment , and protect the price of nachos .
THE SOUTH …. Speaking of civil war in the south of Iraq — and we were just speaking of it , were n’t we ? — here ’s the latest :
Clashes between rival Shiite Muslim militias in the holy city of Karbala today killed at least 50 people , torched three hotels and prompted Iraqi authorities to order the evacuation of more than 1 million pilgrims from the shrine where they had gathered .
More than 150 people were injured in the helter - skelter panic that followed random gunfire by militants in the Mahdi Army loyal to anti-American cleric Muqtada Sadr and those of the Badr Organization , the armed wing of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq .
… . The death toll threatened to climb , with witnesses reporting dozens of bodies in the streets surrounding the Imam Hussein shrine and amid the smoldering rubble of the three buildings set on fire during the rampage .
By Peter Baker , Washington Post
Not that they ’re worried or anything .
But the White House evidently leaves little to chance when it comes to protests within eyesight of the president .
As in , it does n’t want any .
A White House manual that came to light recently gives presidential advance staffers extensive instructions in the art of “ deterring potential protestors ” from President Bush ’s public appearances around the country .
Among other things , any event must be open only to those with tickets tightly controlled by organizers .
Those entering must be screened in case they are hiding secret signs .
Any anti-Bush demonstrators who manage to get in anyway should be shouted down by “ rally squads ” stationed in strategic locations .
And if that does not work , they should be thrown out .
( Original Article )
The chess genius is now planning his greatest game - bringing down the Russian President .
And for the man once dubbed ' the Beast of Baku ' , it will end , for the moment , in certain defeat .
But this is just his opening gambit
Next March , Russia will hold its presidential elections .
There are only two possible outcomes .
Either Vladimir Putin's yet - to - be- announced successor will triumph or Putin will change the rules and continue in power for a third term .
There is no opposition worthy of the name , yet there is one fiercely determined opponent and his name is Garry Kasparov .
Last Monday , the former chess world champion was chosen by the Moscow branch of the coalition group called Drugaya Rossiya ( Other Russia ) to lead them in the elections .
He 'll almost certainly lack sufficient support to be allowed to take part in the main election .
In other words , he is certain to lose .
If nothing else , that is a novel competitive expectation for the man once dubbed the ' Beast of Baku ' .
For 20 years , from 1985 to his retirement in 2005 , Kasparov dominated world chess .
So great and unprecedented was his talent that he ruled the board as if by divine decree .
He was king of the 64 squares .
During this period , it was his opponents who were invariably forced to accept the likelihood of defeat .
' Most of them , ' as he once observed , with characteristic immodesty , 'have a devastatingly bad record against me . '
Britain's Nigel Short spoke in awe of Kasparov 's ' weightlifter 's energy ' - and that was before he was crushed by it in their 1993 World Championship match .
Victory was his devoted companion .
The rare setbacks he suffered were shocking enough to trigger days , even weeks , of brooding and recrimination .
So why is this born winner , and notoriously bad loser , putting himself up for an odds - on wipe - out ?
After all , he has no material need to be a politician .
He is a wealthy man with a home in New York , where he lives for part of the year with his third wife , an economics graduate .
He has a column in the Wall Street Journal and an enviably cosmopolitan lifestyle .
He makes a very comfortable living writing books about chess and giving lectures to business people and combining both as a sort of guru of board game - board room wisdom - his latest book is called How Life Imitates Chess .
He could walk away from Russia and scarcely anyone would raise an eyebrow .
He would avoid defeat , which is rather like gaining a draw .
And a draw , as Kasparov once said , ' is closer to a win' .
Instead , he 's looking at something that is closer to complete humiliation .
Except Kasparov does not see it like that .
' What we 're saying , ' he explained in an interview with the New Yorker last week , 'is we wo n't win now , but when the regime collapses , be aware we are here . '
It 's an extraordinary downsizing of ambition for someone who never displayed much in the way of career patience .
' I 've changed my routine and my focus , ' he said , ' but I have n't lost my fighting spirit . '
Which is just as well .
Born Garry Weinstein in 1963 in Baku , in the then Soviet state of Azerbaijan , Kasparov had a Jewish father and an Armenian mother .
His father died when he was seven and his mother , Klara Kasparova , became and remains his inspiration and most loyal fan .
She and former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik guided the prodigy to greatness .
But despite establishing himself as the finest player in history , the half - Armenian , half - Jew was always going to struggle to endear himself to nationalist - minded Russians .
Especially as Kasparov is more charismatic than charming .
He does n't really do humility , though there is none of the bureaucratic arrogance , the indifference to accountability , that animates the cold contempt of Putin , the former KGB colonel .
Kasparov is always prepared to argue his case .
In 1984 , when he first squared up against the then world champion Anatoly Karpov , the darling of the communist regime , Kasparov drew on the anti-Soviet sentiment of many Russians in what proved to be a victorious campaign .
But now the prevailing sympathy is pro- rather than anti-state .
After the Wild East days of the Nineties , when Boris Yeltsin allowed a grand - scale looting of national assets to take place , Putin has successfully exploited Russia 's vast mineral wealth , and high energy prices , to place the economy on a more solid footing .
The massive foreign debt has been paid off and standards of living are improving .
Still , say many observers , the plundering has not stopped under Putin .
It 's simply been made subject to tighter Kremlin control .
For Kasparov , it 's a distinction without a difference .
He believes that Putin has made himself a billionaire and is perhaps the wealthiest man in Russia .
Whatever the volume of Putin 's fortune , there is no question that he has silenced oppositional voices .
Regional governors are no longer elected but appointed by the President .
Television networks have been effectively placed under state control , political parties are little more than glorified social clubs and many opponents of the regime are imprisoned or , as in the case of a more than a dozen journalists , dead .
As a precaution , Kasparov spends thousands of pounds a month on security .
He never eats in unfamiliar places and avoids flying with the state airline , Aeroflot .
' It does n't help in the end if they really decide to go after you , ' he said .
' But , if they did , it would be really messy .
And not just because of the bodyguards .
There would be a huge risk for the Kremlin if anything happens to me ... because the blood would be on Putin 's hands . '
The regime prefers to manage Kasparov by maintaining a close vigil of his actions and restricting his access to the wider media
He insists that his phones are tapped and it's a fact that he is seldom shown on television .
On the rare occasions he does make it on to the screen , he is usually shown talking in English to emphasise his alienating ' foreignness ' .
Another stifling tactic is the disruption of his meetings by government - backed nationalist protesters .
One Kremlin - supported youth group , Nashi ( Our ) has proved particularly enthusiastic in its denunciations of Kasparov as an American placeman .
Neither has it helped his cause that he is a hero to many US conservatives .
In 1991 , he received the Keeper of the Flame Award from the Centre for Security Policy , a neocon think - tank , which is given to those ' who defend American values around the world ' .
What is perceived as his strength in America is seen as a weakness in Russia precisely because it 's appreciated by Americans .
In return for all the state - approved obloquy that comes his way , Kasparov displays a heartfelt loathing of Putin .
' I think simply that the man does n't fit the position , ' was his withering assessment when I met him in 2005 .
Dressed in a cravat , like a character out of PG Wodehouse , he sat on the edge of his chair as he spoke as if he could n't wait to put things right .
' Putin is creating unique conditions for oligarchs to rob the country and take money outside , providing they pay their dues to the regime . '
The problem for Kasparov is that his liberal agenda of transparent democracy , freedom of speech and civil rights is not one that sets the great melancholy heart of Russia beating with pride .
In the minds of many Russians , liberal democracy is strongly associated with the corruption of the Yeltsin years .
Fearing a communist comeback , Kasparov backed Yeltsin , even though it had become plain that he was hopelessly compromised by booze and the larcenous gangsters who surrounded him .
Kasparov now acknowledges that he was ' dead wrong ' , a phrase that his younger self would have almost impossible to form , let alone say .
It seems the lesson he has learnt from this acknowledged error is compromise .
Perhaps the most striking sign of this new diplomacy is the informal alliance he has formed with Eduard Limonov 's neo-Bolshevik party .
Limonov is a one - time alcoholic novelist in the Charles Bukowski mode , dismissed by Solzhenitsyn as ' a little insect who writes pornography ' .
After a stint in the States , he formed the National Bolshevik Party in 1994 and called for liberals to be sent to the gulag .
' You have to work with the people who live here , ' Kasparov says .
To what end remains uncertain .
Kasparov is in no doubt that the most important duty for a politician in Russia is to fight the current regime .
' As a big fan of Tolkien , ' he once said , ' I believe that there is absolute evil but there is no absolute good in this world .
The Lord of the Rings is about this simple truth .
There are moments when everybody who shares the same values must be united to fight absolute evil , which does exist . '
He was talking about the righteous cause of the invasion of Iraq at the time , an opinion that he subsequently appears to have revised , but it 's clear that he applies the same outlook to the need to remove Putin and his cronies .
King of the squares and The Lord of the Rings : it sounds like an unbeatable combination .
But for most Russians , it 's the same old story and , no matter how hard he tries , Kasparov may never be its hero .
· Born Garik , or Garri , Weinstein 13 April 1963 in Baku in the former Soviet Union .
His parents were Kim Weinstein , who died when Garry was seven , and Klara Kasparova .
He changed his name to avoid problems of anti-semitism in Soviet chess .
· Best of times Beating Anatoly Karpov , the Communist party 's favourite , to win the world chess title in 1985 .
· Worst of times Losing in 19 moves to IBM's Deep Blue computer in 1997 .
Kasparov maintains that the computer was rigged .
Three years later , he lost his world title to Vladimir Kramnik .
· What he says ' Today , I have to be careful not to become cruel , because I became a soldier too early . '
· What others say ' Chess for Garry was never a game .
It was about living and dying , about redefining the art every time he played . '
Biographer Fred Waitzkin
' You can expect anything with this regime and Kasparov has been very vocal and very personal in his criticism of Putin .
I would n't be surprised to hear about something terrible happening to him .
And where will the evidence be ?
Remember that Trotsky 's assassin , Ramon Mercader , was sent to get him in Mexico by the KGB and was secretly made a Hero of the Soviet Union .
No one knew the truth for decades . '
Oleg Kalugin , a former KGB general
More homeless people are using the internet
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes digital technology could be a lifeline for people on the streets .
It says many homeless people already use the internet and mobile phones to look for work and accommodation .
And it wants to build on this by encouraging homeless hostels and community centres in deprived areas to install broadband access .
' Digital divide '
The idea is set out in a report by the ODPM 's social exclusion unit , which wants to encourage hostel managers to spend more cash on providing internet access .
I do n't think IT is a substitute for a permanent address
Homelessness charity Crisis
An ODPM spokesman said having an e-mail address could be the first step to finding a permanent place to live , by enabling people to receive information about long - term living places while moving between hostels .
ODPM minister Jim Fitzpatrick said such a move would also help bridge the UK's " digital divide " .
The report , entitled Inclusion Through Innovation : Tackling Social Exclusion Through New Technologies , also says IT can help disadvantaged elderly people stay in touch with friends and relatives .
' Virtual life '
And it cites the example of mobile phones being used by homeless people to avoid the stigma of not having a permanent address by leaving a mobile number on job application forms .
Homelessness charity Crisis has backed the report .
Its Christmas Internet Cafe was accessed by around 100 people a day and was cited as an example of how web access can help the homeless .
The charity is developing a " virtual life portfolio " , which will enable homeless people to store important documents and certificates they may need to help them claim benefits , medical help or get a job .
It also runs Crisis Skylight , a project in the East End of London , where homeless people can get IT training , which has helped about 12 people find work in its first year .
A spokeswoman for Crisis denied such schemes were diverting attention from accommodation problems and could even remove incentives to find a permanent home .
" I do n't think IT is a substitute for a permanent address .
A permanent address satisfies a number of needs .
It is about having somewhere to call your own , " she said .
' Inequality '
Chris Askew , Crisis ' director of fundraising , said : " Having a mobile phone or access to the internet means that homeless people do not need to put their lives on hold .
" Despite not having an address they can still access the help and support they need or get into work and training . "
A spokesman for homeless charity Shelter said : " Technology can make it easier for homeless people to access the services they need .
" However , if the government really wants to tackle the growing inequality that is at the root of the housing crisis , it must commit funding for the social rented homes that could give those who are homeless or badly housed the chance of a brighter future . "
LONDON –
David Cameron , leader of the UK Conservative party , backed Israel ’s struggle against those who do not acknowledge its right to exist Tuesday afternoon .
Cameron spoke of his support at a luncheon organized by Israel supporters within the conservative party .
“ If what you mean by Zionist , someone who believes that the Jews have a right to a homeland in Israel and a right to their country then yes , I am a Zionist , ” Cameron said .
“ The West has to understand that there is n’t an equivalence between a democratically elected Government of Israel , a state of Israel that is a democracy , that ’s a member of the United Nations , that has a totally legitimate right to exist and defend itself – there is no equivalence between that and a group like Hamas , ” he added .
Cameron said that his visit to Israel in February left a deep impression on him , but admitted that he had mixed feelings regarding the peace process .
He said he was disappointed by the situation created by Hamas .
However , despite his awareness of the difficulties caused by the separation fence , he believed it was justified , and that it has already brought about change .
He also said less popular things as a “ friend of Israel ” .
For example , he said that Israel should refrain from establishing more settlements that would make it harder to reach a two state solution , which thought the best solution for the region .
According to Cameron , British Prime Minister Tony Blair was “ right in that he sees with absolute clarity that point that Israel is a democracy and that Israel is a country that has a right to its own legitimate self defense , to protect itself and he understands there is no equivalence between that and terrorist groups ” .
The conservative leader said that many politicians were naïve in their belief that a solution between Israel and the Palestinians would solve the conflict between militant Islam and the West .
When asked his opinion about Israel ’s actions during the Second Lebanon War , Cameron said that he was among the few politicians in the world who did not call for an immediate ceasefire , but supported Israel ’s right to protect itself against Hizbullah ’s rockets .
However , he added , again as a “ friend of Israel ” , that he thought the use of cluster bombs and Israel ’s responses in general were disproportional .

Will the Church sell carbon offset indulgences ?
Hmm .
Saint Gore ?
Via : Times Online :
Forgotten to recycle any newspapers or tin cans recently ?
Feeling guilty because you neglected to carbon offset your flight to somewhere , anywhere , outside England this summer ?
The Roman Catholic Church is at hand with a new line in â€œgreen confessionsâ€ to help eco-sinners to find forgiveness .
Dom Anthony Sutch , the Benedictine monk who resigned as head of Downside School to become a parish priest in Suffolk , will be at the countyâ€™s Waveney Greenpeace festival this weekend to hear eco-confessions in what is thought to be the first dedicated confessional booth of its kind .
Vested in a green chasuble - style garment made from recycled curtains , and in a booth constructed of recycled doors , he will hear the sins of of those who have not recycled the things they ought to have done and who have consumed the things they ought not to have done .
Father Sutch tries to practise what he preaches but has turned the heating down so low at his church of St Benetâ€™s that at least one parishioner has fled to the warmer care of a neighbouring priest for winter services .
He told The Times : â€ œIt is not , I hope , blasphemous to do this .
I do not think it is .
It is just an attempt to make people conscious of the way they live .
The Church is aware of green issues and of how aware we have to be of how we treat the environment .

University of Manchester researchers are ridding diabetic patients of the superbug MRSA - by treating their foot ulcers with maggots .
Professor Andrew Boulton and his team used green bottle fly larvae to treat 13 diabetic patients whose foot ulcers were contaminated with MRSA and found all but one were cured within a mean period of three weeks , much quicker than the 28 - week duration for the conventional treatment .
Professor Boulton , who published the results in the journal Diabetes Care , has now been awarded a £ 98,000 grant by Diabetes UK to carry out a randomized controlled trial to compare this treatment with two others .
" Maggots are the world 's smallest surgeons .
In fact they are better than surgeons - they are much cheaper and work 24 hours a day , " Professor Boulton jokingly said .
" They have been used since the Napoleonic Wars and in the American Civil War they found that those who survived were the ones with maggots in their wounds : they kept them clean .
They remove the dead tissue and bacteria , leaving the healthy tissue to heal .
" Still , we were very surprised to see such a good result for MRSA .
There is no reason this cannot be applied to many other areas of the body , except perhaps a large abdominal wound . "
Professor Boulton and his team , including senior nurse Ann Knowles , have used maggots to treat diabetic foot ulcers of patients attending the Manchester Diabetes Centre and foot clinics , as well as in in - patients at the Manchester Royal Infirmary , for ten years .
More recently they found that many of their patients were suffering from MRSA - contaminated foot ulcers , with the rate doubling in a three year period , possibly due to overuse of antibiotics and the selection of broad rather than narrow - spectrum antibacterial agents .
This led to their first study , funded by Central Manchester and Manchester Children 's University Hospitals NHS Trust ( CMMC ) Chairman 's Prize Award .
They treated 13 patients , aged 18 - 80 years with chronic foot ulcers that had suffered loss of feeling and reduced blood supply , with sterile free - range larvae of the green bottle fly Lucilia Sericata .
They applied the larvae between two and eight times , depending on the size of the ulcer , for four days at a time , with pressure relieving dressings to protect them .
No topical antimicrobial agents or growth factors were used on the study ulcer .
All but one of the patients was cleared of the superbug .
During the treatment period , no adverse reactions were reported and there was a reduction in sloughy necrotic tissue and an increase in healthy , growing tissue on removal of the last larval application .
In their second study , he and his team will compare larval treatment with antibacterial silver dressings and the biogun treatment , which uses ionized air to create superoxide radicals and eradicate bacteria .
Professor Boulton said : " This is very exciting .
We have demonstrated for the first time the potential of larval therapy to eliminate MRSA infection of diabetic foot ulcers .
If confirmed in a randomized controlled trial , larval treatment would offer the first non-invasive and risk - free treatment of this increasing problem and a safe and cost - effective treatment in contrast to the expensive and potentially toxic antibiotic remedies . "

Millennials are weird .
I should know ; I am one .
For years , our unorthodox lifestyle choices and money habits have been confusing to our elders .
And perhaps the most unprecedented millennial - ish move we 've been making is the avoidance of home ownership .
With home - buying at an all - time low according to the Census Bureau , the finger is easily pointed at us as a likely cause .
But instead of leveling the typical charges that we 're lazy and stuck in wanderlust as the root of why we still live at home , perhaps it 's because we 're just trying to learn from the mistakes of the past .
Consider what we 've witnessed :
As millennials , we lived through the late '90s and early '00s , we 've seen our parents go through tech bubbles bursting and the entire housing market crashing .
We saw firsthand what can happen if you buy a home when you can't afford it or if your job just suddenly vanishes .
A Different Track
Maybe it 's fear that drives our lack of home ownership .
But maybe some of us do want to settle down and start a family but finding a reliable and affordable hometown is part of the problem .
So we looked at the issue from a different point of view .
We decided to research cities just beyond the major metro areas typically showcased to see if a smaller town would be a more realistic way to make a start .
The good news is that the data suggests there are a lot of places that could offer a more secure lifestyle and still be within reach .
Our quest to find locations with job opportunities as well as reasonable home prices led us to this list of small ( but still realistic ) cities millennials should consider moving to .
Methodology
Get Rich Slowly analyzed several data sets to determine which cities could be deemed the best small cities for millennials :
Census population data to narrow down cities with a population between 50,000 – 150,000 that were at least 25 miles away from a major metro city center .
Census population data to find the amount of millennials living in a city as a percentage of total population .
Zillow data to find the median price of a single home family and the amount of change in market value from last year .
Bureau of Labor Statistics data to measure the percent of change in median wage data in the U.S. since 2012 .
Cities with the most positive percentage change over the last four years was deemed the winner .
Unemployment rate .
As of June , the national unemployment rate was 5.5 .
We used FBI crime information to find the crime rate per capita ( taking into consideration both property and violent crime ) .
We partnered with Redfin and Walk Score for a measurement of the walkability of each city on the list .
Scores are ranking from 0 - 100 ( 100 being the most walkable ) .

Brentwood is a quick trip away from San Francisco and Oakland — so if you 're willing to commute , the job market is unbounded .
Brentwood has offerings to keep restlessness at bay too .
It 's home to many wineries that have been highlighted in the Bay Area wine scene .
Also , in 2009 , the city broke ground for a new civic center , which has quickly become a large money maker for the city .
Non-profit organization Kaboom , nominated Brentwood as one of the most playful cities in the U.S. in 2015 .

However , home value is increasing , which lends itself to a brighter future .
There 's a large number of businesses within the area and a rapidly growing population .
Apart from its school district , the two largest employers of Novi residents are Magna International , and Ryder — both transportation parts manufacturers .

Pittsburg is close enough to the San Francisco and Oakland technology scene to be commutable , but far enough away to avoid the high price of living in the Silicon Valley .
Public transportation connects residents of Pittsburg to San Francisco and Oakland with ease , making home ownership in Pittsburg more of an option .
Recently , Pittsburg has been undergoing several redevelopment projects to promote easy access into the city of San Francisco and more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods , specifically along the waterfront .

Census data shows that Surprise grew 281 percent between the 2000 and 2010 census population survey .
This growth is great for residents because it generally means more job creation and a strong economy .
This idea is supported by the year - over - year growth in median wages and the improvement to the housing market .
The 22 out of 100 Walk Score is a slight disappointment , though .
Being able to run errands by foot is always an added bonus .
# 13 Lake Elsinore , CA ( Near Orange County and San Diego )
2014 median wage : $ 44,190
4 - year average percent of wage change : .74 %

Once considered primarily a resort town , Lake Elsinore has grown into a medium - sized city with all the bells and whistles you 'd want to settle down for good .
The lake itself is one of the largest natural freshwater lakes in Southern California , which lends itself to cheap entertainment during peak seasons .
The median home value is incredibly low for a Californian town , and the change in home value is enough to make a new property purchase enticing .
The only negative is the relatively low median wage .
Even with year - over - year wage growth , Lake Elsinore is one of the lowest - paying cities to make this list .
# 12 Flower Mound , TX ( Near Dallas )
2014 median wage : $ 49,060
4 - year average percent of wage change : 1.16 %

Flower Mound 's close proximity to the Dallas - Fort Worth airport has attracted new businesses to open up shop in and around Flower Mound .
Although the percentage of millennials to total population is relatively low compared to other cities on the list , Flower Mound has received high rankings in each of the other categories .
The most notable win for Flower Mound is the unemployment rate .
Flower Mound and the number one city on our list ( read on to find out who that is ) are both tied at four for the lowest unemployment rates on this list .

Unemployment rate : 5.3
Percentage of millennials to total population : 27.80 %
Highest measured Walk Score : 35 out of 100

Homestead has notoriously been pegged as a rural town — but this farming area has seen some major changes over the last few years .
Miami is about an hour away , and according to the Redfin agent , Jessica Johnson , construction has been on the rise in recent years .
The rural stereotype has not been entirely dissipated , though ; but Johnson reiterates that affordability is a huge draw for buyers .
You can get a brand new , large home for significantly less than [ the homes ] in Miami or the closer suburbs .
For a farming town , the percentage of millennials to total population is shockingly high .
# 9 ( Tie ) Castle Rock , CO ( Near Denver )
2014 median wage : $ 38,640
4 - year average percent of wage change : .98 %
Median home value : $ 302,200

Unemployment rate : 4.3
Percentage of millennials to total population : 18.05 %

Gentrification typically makes housing prices increase , and it appears that Castle Rock is starting to see this scenario unfold .
As the 17th most populous municipality in Colorado , Castle Rock has been reported as the center of burgeoning urbanization of the county .
Although the housing market is still relatively affordable , it will be interesting to see if the 16.6 % increase from last year becomes a pattern .
# 9 ( Tie ) Waukegan , IL ( Near Chicago )

In 2003 , Waukegan touted plans to redevelop their lakefront and downtown which will be a huge win for the community .
Arts and culture are the up - and - coming scene for this area , which speaks to the high percentage of millennials to total population rate .
The median home value in Waukegan is notably low .
In fact , it 's the only town on the list to have a median home value under $ 100,000 , yet their median wage is higher than many cities on this list .
More money , less toward a mortgage is always a good recipe .

In 2004 , Marysville voted to enhance the city .
Everything from land use and community design to economic development was placed into the master plan .
One of the most important aspects of the city 's makeover was to make its downtown more attractive for businesses and pedestrians .
It looks like something is working .
Marysville experienced the most wage growth over the last four years and currently the highest median wage to make the list .
In addition , Redfin agent Trina Torkelson states , “ When it comes to affordability , Marysville can not be beat .
The further north you travel from Seattle , the more home you can get for your money .
There is a lot of new construction in Marysville to keep up with demand and many of the original homes here have incredible views of the Valley .
You can still buy a spacious home here for under $ 300,000 . ”

Apparently George Washington visited Haverhill in the 1790's and announced it to be one of the most beautiful villages — so if that 's not an inclination into how fantastic Haverhill is , I 'm not sure what is .
Haverhill is 1 percent below the national average for unemployment , and the crime rate per capita is low .
Redfin agent David Pollack told us , “ Haverhill , which sits on the Merrimack River right by New Hampshire , is a very affordable community in the greater Boston area .
The city has converted its old downtown factories into lofts and condos and put up a new boardwalk .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Takeshi Yamashita does not look like a homeless person .
Men make use of the internet service in the private rooms of an internet cafe in Tokyo May 2 , 2007 .
Some low - wage earning young people who cannot afford apartments in Tokyo are choosing to live in internet cafes , which are cheaper than a hotel and even offer showers , microwaves and large libraries of manga to read .
Picture taken May 2 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
From his carefully distressed jeans to his casual - cool navy striped T - shirt , he is every bit the trendy Tokyoite .
Yet the 26 - year - old has been sleeping in a reclining seat in an Internet cafe every night for the past month since he lost his steady office job and his apartment .
It ’s cheaper than a hotel , offers access to the Internet and hundreds of Manga comic books , and even has a microwave and a shower where he can wash in the morning before heading off to one of his temporary jobs ranging from cleaning to basic office work .
Asked how long he plans to go on living like that , Yamashita smiles and shrugs .
“ I hope the situation in Japan will improve .
The new Japanese generation does n’t have any money , and many young people do n’t have any motivation .
I do n’t have money , but I have a dream , ” he says , sitting in a cubicle with a PC and a stack of comic books .
So what is his dream ?
“ I do n’t know .
Maybe some ordinary job in an office . ”
Yamashita is one of Japan ’s many “ freeters ” -- a compound of “ free ” and “ Arbeiter , ” the German word for “ worker . ”
A by - product of the economic crisis that hit Japan and its lifelong employment guarantees in the 1990s , freeters drift between odd jobs .
Earning around 1,000 yen ( $ 8 ) per hour , they often struggle to pay the rent in Tokyo , one of the most expensive cities in the world where a modest 30 square meter ( 320 square foot ) flat in a central location can easily cost 150,000 yen ( $ 1,250 ) a month .
Now the economy is recovering , but many freeters are missing out on the upswing after years of unskilled work .
Most expanding companies prefer to recruit fresh university graduates or transfer basic jobs to low - wage countries such as China .
CYBER HOME
As an Internet cafe owner in Tokyo ’s Ueno district , Masami Takahashi has had a close - up view of social change in Japan .
Around the corner from his cafe , homeless people who cannot even afford a reclining seat sleep in cardboard boxes .
Chinese prostitutes in Japanese kimonos prop up drunken office workers , or “ salarymen , ” who will stumble into Masami ’s cafe for a nap later in the night .
The salarymen were the first to discover net cafes as a cheap alternative to hotels after companies hurt by the economic crisis stopped funding team drinks -- an essential part of Japanese corporate culture -- followed by a night in a hotel .
And then there are customers for whom Takahashi ’s Internet point is home .
Takahashi , an affable host sporting a mullet and a blue track suit , regularly sees freeters taking refuge at his cafe .
He has even lent money to some of them out of pity .
“ It shows how the social system is changing .
It ’s a bit sad for us Japanese , ” he told Reuters , scratching his head .
At about 1,400 to 2,400 yen ( $ 12 - $ 20 ) for a night in a central Internet cafe -- free soft drinks , TV , comics and Internet access included -- prices beat those of Japan ’s famous “ capsule hotels , ” where guests sleep in plastic cells .
This means that on a Friday night in Shibuya , one of Tokyo ’s main entertainment districts , the dimly lit cafes are packed .
At 3 am , there is loud snoring from salarymen in suits , their shoes lined up neatly outside each individual cubicle containing a reclining seat or sofa , a computer and a clothes hanger .
There are fashionable young women wearing high heels and short skirts , who missed the last train after a night out .
And there are those who use the discretion of a net cafe to their own advantage .
“ I often come here with my boyfriend .
Today we escaped from high - school and came here , ” said 16 - year - old Naomi , a schoolgirl in a white shirt , tartan miniskirt and knee - high socks .
Shyly sweeping aside her long brown fringe , Naomi said she started going to net cafes with her boyfriend at the age of 15 , telling her parents she was sleeping at a friend ’s place .
“ We usually spend all night talking and reading mangas , and in the morning we go to school . ”
“ WORKING POOR ”
Like Yamashita , the freeter , many of the cyber homeless fade into this colorful crowd , finding anonymity as well as shelter .
“ The younger ones do n’t look any different from other young people , ” said Kazumasa Adachi , a manager at one of the more elegant net cafes where staff wear suits and receive customers with the polite efficiency of hotel receptionists .
He recognizes cafe dwellers by the heavy bags they lug around .
“ They are different from the real homeless because they belong to the working poor , so they do have some money , whereas the ones on the street have no money at all , ” he added .
There is no official data on the cyber cafe homeless .
Japan ’s Welfare Ministry plans a wider study on the phenomenon , according to a newspaper report , but in the meantime , it is hard to gauge the scope of the problem or its social impact .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that many are freeters in their mid-to - late - twenties , who stay in a net cafe for a couple of months before settling for a more permanent housing solution .
Those who are older , poorer , with fewer chances of escaping their drifting lifestyle , and sometimes too embarrassed to return home , find themselves at the very bottom of cyber society .
They congregate in run-down Tokyo suburbs such as Kamata , renting poorly ventilated , smoke - filled cubicles with reclining seats for 100 yen an hour .
“ It ’s very uncomfortable .
You ca n’t really sleep , ” said one Kamata cafe guest who preferred not to be named .

New Statesman ( UK ) 17 April 2000 John Pilger Almost two million Cambodians died as a result of Year Zero .
John Pilger argues that , without the complicity of the US and Britain , it may never have happened On 17 April , it is 25 years since Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh .
In the calendar of fanaticism , this was Year Zero ; as many as two million people , a fifth of Cambodia 's population , were to die as a consequence .
To mark the anniversary , the evil of Pol Pot will be recalled , almost as a ritual act for voyeurs of the politically dark and inexplicable .
For the managers of western power , no true lessons will be drawn , because no connections will be made to them and to their predecessors , who were Pol Pot 's Faustian partners .
Yet , without the complicity of the west , Year Zero might never have happened , nor the threat of its return maintained for so long .
Declassified United States government documents leave little doubt that the secret and illegal bombing of then neutral Cambodia by President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger between 1969 and 1973 caused such widespread death and devastation that it was critical in Pol Pot 's drive for power .
" They are using damage caused by B52 strikes as the main theme of their propaganda , " the CIA director of operations reported on 2 May 1973 .
" This approach has resulted in the successful recruitment of young men .
Residents say the propaganda campaign has been effective with refugees in areas that have been subject to B52 strikes . "
In dropping the equivalent of five Hiroshimas on a peasant society , Nixon and Kissinger killed an estimated half a million people .
Year Zero began , in effect , with them ; the bombing was a catalyst for the rise of a small sectarian group , the Khmer Rouge , whose combination of Maoism and medievalism had no popular base .
After two and a half years in power , the Khmer Rouge was overthrown by the Vietnamese on Christmas Day , 1978 .
In the months and years that followed , the US and China and their allies , notably the Thatcher government , backed Pol Pot in exile in Thailand .
He was the enemy of their enemy : Vietnam , whose liberation of Cambodia could never be recognised because it had come from the wrong side of the cold war .
For the Americans , now backing Beijing against Moscow , there was also a score to be settled for their humiliation on the rooftops of Saigon .
To this end , the United Nations was abused by the powerful .
Although the Khmer Rouge government ( " Democratic Kampuchea " ) had ceased to exist in January 1979 , its representatives were allowed to continue occupying Cambodia 's seat at the UN ; indeed , the US , China and Britain insisted on it .
Meanwhile , a Security Council embargo on Cambodia compounded the suffering of a traumatised nation , while the Khmer Rouge in exile got almost everything it wanted .
In 1981 , President Jimmy Carter 's national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , said : " I encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot . "
The US , he added , " winked publicly " as China sent arms to the Khmer Rouge .
In fact , the US had been secretly funding Pol Pot in exile since January 1980 .
The extent of this support - $ 85 m from 1980 to 1986 - was revealed in correspondence to a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
On the Thai border with Cambodia , the CIA and other intelligence agencies set up the Kampuchea Emergency Group , which ensured that humanitarian aid went to Khmer Rouge enclaves in the refugee camps and across the border .
Two American aid workers , Linda Mason and Roger Brown , later wrote : " The US government insisted that the Khmer Rouge be fed . . . the US preferred that the Khmer Rouge operation benefit from the credibility of an internationally known relief operation . "
Under American pressure , the World Food Programme handed over $ 12 m in food to the Thai army to pass on to the Khmer Rouge ; " 20,000 to 40,000 Pol Pot guerillas benefited , " wrote Richard Holbrooke , the then US assistant secretary of state .
I witnessed this .
Travelling with a UN convoy of 40 trucks , I drove to a Khmer Rouge operations base at Phnom Chat .
The base commander was the infamous Nam Phann , known to relief workers as " The Butcher " and Pol Pot 's Himmler .
After the supplies had been unloaded , literally at his feet , he said : " Thank you very much , and we wish for more . "
In November of that year , 1980 , direct contact was made between the White House and the Khmer Rouge when Dr Ray Cline , a former deputy director of the CIA , made a secret visit to a Khmer Rouge operational headquarters .
Cline was then a foreign policy adviser on President - elect Reagan 's transitional team .
By 1981 , a number of governments had become decidedly uneasy about the charade of the UN 's continuing recognition of the defunct Pol Pot regime .
Something had to be done .
The following year , the US and China invented the Coalition of the Democratic Government of Kampuchea , which was neither a coalition nor democratic , nor a government , nor in Kampuchea ( Cambodia ) .
It was what the CIA calls " a master illusion " .
Prince Norodom Sihanouk was appointed its head ; otherwise little changed .
The two " non-communist " members , the Sihanoukists , led by the Prince 's son , Norodom Ranariddh , and the Khmer People 's National Liberation Front , were dominated , diplomatically and militarily , by the Khmer Rouge .
One of Pol Pot 's closet cronies , Thaoun Prasith , ran the office at the UN in New York .
In Bangkok , the Americans provided the " coalition " with battle plans , uniforms , money and satellite intelligence ; arms came direct from China and from the west , via Singapore .
The non-communist fig leaf allowed Congress - spurred on by a cold - war zealot Stephen Solarz , a powerful committee chairman - to approve $ 24 m in aid to the " resistance " .
Until 1989 , the British role in Cambodia remained secret .
The first reports appeared in the Sunday Telegraph , written by Simon O'Dwyer - Russell , a diplomatic and defence correspondent with close professional and family contacts with the SAS .
He revealed that the SAS was training the Pol Pot - led force .
Soon afterwards , Jane 's Defence Weekly reported that the British training for the " non-communist " members of the " coalition " had been going on " at secret bases in Thailand for more than four years " .
The instructors were from the SAS , " all serving military personnel , all veterans of the Falklands conflict , led by a captain " .
The Cambodian training became an exclusively British operation after the " Irangate " arms - for - hostages scandal broke in Washington in 1986 .
" If Congress had found out that Americans were mixed up in clandestine training in Indo - China , let alone with Pol Pot , " a Ministry of Defence source told O'Dwyer - Russell , " the balloon would have gone right up .
It was one of those classic Thatcher - Reagan arrangements . "
Moreover , Margaret Thatcher had let slip , to the consternation of the Foreign Office , that " the more reasonable ones in the Khmer Rouge will have to play some part in a future government " .
In 1991 , I interviewed a member of " R " ( reserve ) Squadron of the SAS , who had served on the border .
" We trained the KR in a lot of technical stuff - a lot about mines , " he said .
" We used mines that came originally from Royal Ordnance in Britain , which we got by way of Egypt with marking changed . . .
We even gave them psychological training .
At first , they wanted to go into the villages and just chop people up .
We told them how to go easy . . . "
The Foreign Office response was to lie .
" Britain does not give military aid in any form to the Cambodian factions , " stated a parliamentary reply .
The then prime minister , Thatcher , wrote to Neil Kinnock : " I confirm that there is no British government involvement of any kind in training , equipping or co-operating with Khmer Rouge forces or those allied to them . "
On 25 June 1991 , after two years of denials , the government finally admitted that the SAS had been secretly training the " resistance " since 1983 .
A report by Asia Watch filled in the detail : the SAS had taught " the use of improvised explosive devices , booby traps and the manufacture and use of time - delay devices " .
The author of the report , Rae McGrath ( who shared a joint Nobel Peace Prize for the international campaign on landmines ) , wrote in the Guardian that " the SAS training was a criminally irresponsible and cynical policy " .
When a UN " peacekeeping force " finally arrived in Cambodia in 1992 , the Faustian pact was never clearer .
Declared merely a " warring faction " , the Khmer Rouge was welcomed back to Phnom Penh by UN officials , if not the people .
The western politician who claimed credit for the " peace process " , Gareth Evans ( then Australia 's foreign minister ) , set the tone by calling for an " even- handed " approach to the Khmer Rouge and questioning whether calling it genocidal was " a specific stumbling block " .
Khieu Samphan , Pol Pot 's prime minister during the years of genocide , took the salute of UN troops with their commander , the Australian general John Sanderson , at his side .
Eric Falt , the UN spokesman in Cambodia , told me : " The peace process was aimed at allowing [ the Khmer Rouge ] to gain respectability . "
The consequence of the UN 's involvement was the unofficial ceding of at least a quarter of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge ( according to UN military maps ) , the continuation of a low - level civil war and the election of a government impossibly divided between " two prime ministers " : Hun Sen and Norodom Ranariddh .
The Hun Sen government has since won a second election outright .
Authoritarian and at times brutal , yet by Cambodian standards extraordinarily stable , the government led by a former Khmer Rouge dissident , Hun Sen , who fled to Vietnam in the 1970s , has since done deals with leading figures of the Pol Pot era , notably the breakaway faction of Ieng Sary , while denying others immunity from prosecution .
Once the Phnom Penh government and the UN can agree on its form , an international war crimes tribunal seems likely to go ahead .
The Americans want the Cambodians to play virtually no part ; their understandable concern is that not only the Khmer Rouge will be indicted .
The Cambodian lawyer defending Ta Mok , the Khmer Rouge military leader captured last year , has said : " All the foreigners involved have to be called to court , and there will be no exceptions . . .
Madeleine Albright , Margaret Thatcher , Henry Kissinger , Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan and George Bush . . . we are going to invite them to tell the world why they supported the Khmer Rouge . "
It is an important principle , of which those in Washington and Whitehall currently sustaining bloodstained tyrannies elsewhere might take note .

John Edwards has dramatically raised the bar and is single - handedly shaping the debate .
To say he has " upped the ante " is the understatement of the decade .
It seems quite appropriate to ask all the presidential candidates whether they too will support the Edwards proposal .
John Edwards challenge to the political class changes the very character of the national discussion .
The time has come to demand that every member of Congress agree to give up their coverage at a date specified in 2009 , if all American citizens do not have cradle to grave , affordable and guaranteed healthcare .
It is time to pull the Cadillac coverage which the executive and legislative branch give themselves .
Tony
Snow is a testimonial to the excellence of government provided , taxpayer funded healthcare .
Until and unless the American people have affordable and guaranteed healthcare , this is the only remedy hardship , we can impose on those who seek to play Three Card Monte with our lives .
When the the political class is forced to endure the same crimes as those inflicted on the American people by the PAY OR DIE , MURDER BY SPREADSHEET for - profit insurance industry , they may get serious .
We 've been asking where are our leaders , this , my friends , is leadership .
Scott Bachmeier , a research meteorologist at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at UW–Madison , says that particles in the air scatter light .
In the day , the particles scatter more violet and blue light , but our eyes are more sensitive to blue light — that ’s why the sky appears blue .
Thunderstorms , which can be the home of tornadoes , usually happen later in the day , when the sun is approaching the horizon .
That creates a reddish tinge in the sky , as any fan of sunsets knows .
But light under a 12 - mile high thundercloud is primarily blue , due to scattering by water droplets within the cloud .
When blue objects are illuminated with red light , Bachmeier says , they appear green .
Green is significant , but not proof that a tornado is on the way .
A green cloud “ will only occur if the cloud is very deep , which generally only occurs in thunderstorm clouds , ” Bachmeier says .
“ Those are the kind of storms that may produce hail and tornadoes . ”
Green does indicate that the cloud is extremely tall , and since thunderclouds are the tallest clouds , green is a warning sign that large hail or a tornado may be present .
If this explanation is confusing , Bachmeier offers some alternative folk wisdom for the color change : that tornadoes sucked frogs and grasshoppers into the sky .
' Daily Show ' mocks ' Highlander ' Cheney 's ' secret secrets '
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday June 26 , 2007 Print This Email This
" How do you shoot an old man in the face and get him to apologize ? " says ' Daily Show ' host Jon Stewart , referring to the infamous hunting accident involving Vice President Cheney .
" Ooh Cheney , he must be evil , ooh , what 's he hiding , what are his secrets ?
" Well as it turns out , " Stewart continues , referring to the new Washington Post series focusing on Cheney , " what he was hiding , was everything . "
" Dick Cheney exists neither in the executive branch nor the legislative , yet simultaneously in both , " ' Daily Show ' correspondent John Oliver adds .
" He is neither man nor beast , yet has elements of the twain .
He is at once everything and nothing , substance without form , shape without motion , time without reason ... he is the Highlander . "
One piece of news from the London keynote event was Apple 's first public stance on SIM unlocking tools that have become available for the iPhone .
The freely available software unlocks the iPhone from AT&T 's service and allows users to use any SIM card from any network .
When questioned , Steve Jobs indicated that they will actively try to stop SIM unlocking :
" It 's a cat - and - mouse game , " said Jobs .
" We try to stay ahead .
People will try to break in , and it's our job to stop them breaking in . "
A former member of U.S. military intelligence has decided to reveal what she knows about warrantless spying on Americans and about the fixing of intelligence in the leadup to the invasion of Iraq .
Adrienne Kinne describes an incident just prior to the invasion of Iraq in which a fax came into her office at Fort Gordon in Georgia that purported to provide information on the location of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
The fax came from the Iraqi National Congress , a group opposed to Saddam Hussein and favoring an invasion .
The fax contained types of information that required that it be translated and transmitted to President Bush within 15 minutes .
But Kinne had been eavesdropping on two nongovernmental aid workers driving in Iraq who were panicked and trying to find safety before the bombs dropped .
She focused on trying to protect them , and was reprimanded for the delay in translating the fax .
She then challenged her officer in charge , Warrant Officer John Berry , on the credibility of the fax , and he told her that it was not her place or his to challenge such things .
None of the other 20 or so people in the unit questioned anything , Kinne said .
Kinne dates this incident to the period just before the official invasion of Iraq or possibly just after .
She says that because the US engaged in so much bombing prior to the official invasion , she can not recall for sure .
Prior to September 11 , 2001 , Kinne says , it was unacceptable to listen in on or collect information on Americans .
The practice was barred by United States Signals Intelligence Directive ( USSID ) 18 .
Kinne recalls an incident in 1997 in which an American 's name was mentioned , and she and her colleagues deleted every related record because they took very seriously the ban on collecting information on Americans .
Kinne was serving from 1994 - 1998 on active duty as an Arabic linguist for military intelligence at Fort Gordon in Georgia , sending reports to and collaborating with the NSA .
She served at the same station after 9 - 11 when she was activated as a reservist .
Kinne says that post - 9 - 11 she and others routinely collected information on people even after identifying them as aid workers for non-governmental organizations .
A common rationale was that the phones of such organizations could conceivably be seized by terrorists .
She recalled one case in which she was listening to an American talk to his British colleague in an international aid organization .
The Brit expressed concern about the American military eavesdropping , and the American replied that they could n't possibly be doing that because of USSID 18 .
Kinne recalls that her colleagues got quite excited and behaved as if the American had divulged secrets by mentioning that directive .
They continued eavesdropping on the man although they were unclear at that point whether they were permitted to spy on Americans .
Shortly after this incident , however , in mid-2002 , they were given a waiver to spy on Americans .
This waiver was communicated to Kinne and her colleagues orally , and she assumed that it had come from the President or someone very high up .
The waiver , she says , also permitted spying on Canadian , French , German , Australian , and British citizens without probable cause .
Many of the people , including Americans , whom Kinne spied on were journalists .
These included journalists staying at a hotel in Baghdad that later showed up on a list of targets .
Again , Kinne says , she expressed concerns to her officer in charge , letting him know that the military should be informed or the journalists should be warned to move to another location .
Kinne says Berry brushed her off .
He was , she says , " completely behind the invasion of Iraq .
He told us repeatedly that we needed to bomb those barbarians back to kingdom come . "
Berry was promoted to Chief Warrant Officer .
Kinne left , went back to school , and took a job at the Veterans Administration helping some of the victims of the fixing of intelligence that she had witnessed .
And early this year she joined a tour of Vermont with activists Cindy Sheehan , John Nichols , Dan DeWalt , and veterans of the war , a tour promoting the passage of impeachment resolutions in Vermont towns , a tour that helped effect the passage of those resolutions in over 40 towns up and down the state .
Kinne found the experience " life - changing " , and she 's now decided to tell everything she knows , and to encourage others still in the government to speak out and release documentation .
" I wish that I had said something back then , but I do n't think people would have listened , " Kinne said .
Kinne , who now works for the VA at White River Junction , Vermont , said that she has written to Senator Patrick Leahy , who has not replied to her .
Kinne has become active in Iraq Veterans Against the War .
She said that the news of the current escalation of the war also helped move her to act .
" That 's the only reason why I am choosing to break whatever rules I may have just broken by telling you about it , " Kinne said .
" Because I think that this all needs to stop , and it needs to stop now .
And the only way it 's going to stop is if people start speaking out . "

In Washington , where words are the currency , where imprecise verbs threaten the loss of a political career and misapplied nouns can doom a movement , there remain a few figures who get a general pass not just for a certain degree of verbal imprecision , but for a fairly deep - seated degree of intellectual wackiness , a penchant for regularly saying very odd things .
Newt Gingrich is one of these public figures , Robert Byrd another ; Helen Thomas has her moments , too .
You ’ll be sitting in the audience listening to a sensible speech by , say , Gingrich , and all of a sudden you get the notion that aliens have captured his brain .
Befuddled , you ’ll turn to your friend next to you , the libertarian true - believer , and he ’ll shrug his shoulders and whisper back : “ Oh , it ’s just Newt . ”
And then , a few minutes later , the speaker ’s episode will subside , the aliens return the brain , and the speech continues on its before - we - were - so - rudely - interrupted track .
No one says a word .
The capital ’s press gives these folks a pass from its usual lawyerly scrutiny because they are regarded as sages who can be relied upon to speak some kind of unusual and valuable truth , whose occasional episodes of profound intellectual oddness are thought to stem from the same deep source as their general brilliance .
One of these spells flared up during the last week in February , when Greenspan recommended that the home - owning public take a good hard look at switching from fixed - rate mortgages , under whose terms payments stay the same no matter what interest rates do , to adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , where payments fluctuate along with interest rates –which , right now , makes close to zero sense .
Interest rates are lower than they ’ve been in 30 years , and , with all economists predicting a general economic upturn , and Bush ’s budget deficit and the weak dollar sucking up capital , little doubt exists that interest rates must rise , in which case , switching from a fixed - rate to adjustable - rate mortgage would be pretty costly for any family naïve enough to take Greenspan at his word .
The episode did not pass completely without critical notice .
It was “ the strangest bit of advice ever to be proffered by an American central banker , ” Jim Grant , publisher of Grant ’s Interest Rate Observer , told the San Francisco Chronicle .
Then the press moved on : “ Oh , it ’s just Greenspan . ”
But sometimes wacko ideas can betray deeper truths .
It is tempting to ask what stake the chairman might have in trying to convince millions of people to do something so contrary to their own interest .
One theory floated by Fed - watchers is that the chairman is trying to help out his classic institutional constituency , the big banks , which hold trillions of dollars in fixed - rate mortgage paper .
There may be something to that theory , but there is almost certainly a deeper and more important motive behind this curious advice .
Quite simply , Greenspan is trying to keep a wobbly and fragile recovery alive–and using mortgage refinancing to do it .
There are many strange things about the choppy recovery we ’re in , but among the most curious is that it is being fueled largely by consumer spending .
Why consumers should continue to spend , and why they ’ve done it throughout the recession , is not immediately obvious .
After all , average income growth has been puny in the last few years .
There ’s been a big falloff in jobs .
Health care and tuition costs have only been going up .
And the stock market has spent the last three years unsuccessfully huffing and puffing to get back to the level where it was in early 2001 .
Why have consumers been spending so much ?
Economists have advanced two main reasons .
One is that Americans have so lost their moorings that they ’ve had few qualms about going deep into debt .
That ’s certainly true .
The average person ’s debt as a percentage of his income is now higher than it ’s ever been .
But there ’s another reason , too : Americans have been using their homes as ATM machines , refinancing their mortgages in order to fund their spending .
This , of course , makes sense .
The one sector of the economy that has consistently swelled has been housing prices .
This has intrigued and surprised many economists , because housing is supposed to operate in sync with the economy , expanding during flush times and contracting when things go poorly .
But even in a down economy , prices have soared .
Because of these rising prices , people have felt that despite all the ups and downs in stocks and salaries , that their overall situation was okay .
Homes are the biggest asset most families own , and their value has been rising nicely .
For that reason , Americans have felt more comfortable buying big - ticket items , from SUVs to new computers to Disney World vacations .
Much of that spending has gone right onto the VISA card .
But that debt has been kept somewhat manageable by another factor in housing prices : mortgage refinancing .
With home prices rising and the Fed keeping rates low , a mortgage refinancing industry that barely existed 15 years ago exploded into one of the fastest growing sectors of the financial services industry .
Last year , one - third of all homeowners used cash - out mortgages to refinance their homes , a rate roughly consistent over the past five years .
Savvy investors , says Harvard economist William Apgar , are likely to have refinanced “ two or three times in the last two years . ”
Each time they do , they have either been able to lower their monthly payments , or walk away with a chunk of cash .
And where does that extra cash go ?
The ubiquitous Ditech TV ads say it all : “ I just refinanced my home and paid off my credit cards ! ” American homeowners have gained $ 1.6 trillion in cash from refinancing in the last five years , and those gains have flowed almost wholly into purchases of consumer goods .
The resulting spending , says Wharton ’s Susan Wachter , is “ propping up ” the American economy .
Greenspan has played enabler to this boom .
But with the Fed fund ’s rate at 1 percent , the chairman ca n’t do much more to sustain it .
Tens of millions of Americans have already refinanced their mortgages , and at current rates , ca n’t be induced to do so again .
This small window is closing , fast :
For six months , refinancing has been tapering off , and economists expect it to narrow further–many economists have argued the gains from refinancing are likely to halve ths year .
Moreover , as soon as interest rates rise ( as Greenspan himself has said they will within the next year ) , virtually all refinancing will cease .
Greenspan ’s rather ham - handed effort to get them to go for ARMs , is a sign not of the chairman ’s own eccentricity or advanced age , but , instead , of the economy ’s current unsteadiness .
Greenspan knows , perhaps better than anyone , that this economy is perched nervously on top of a wobbly , Dr. Seuss - like tower .
Our recovery is propped up by consumer spending , which is in turn propped up by mortgage refinancing , and if that refinancing dries up before more props can be put in , the whole edifice could fall .
“ Since long - term interest rates cannot fall low enough to facilitate another wave of fixed - rate refinancings , he is trying to encourage homeowners to refinance one last time : fixed to ARM , ” Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital in Los Angeles told the San Francisco Chronicle .
Let ’s assume for a moment that enough people get fooled , and the refinancing boom gets extended for another year .
Then what ?
The real problem hits .
Because if you think Greenspan ’s being cagey on refinancing , the truth he ’s really avoiding talking about is that we ’re in the midst of a huge housing bubble , on a scale only seen once before since the Depression .
Worse , the inflated housing market is now in an historically unique position , as the motor of the rest of the economy .
Within the next year or two , that bubble is likely to burst , and when it does , it very well may take the American economy down with it .
House bound
Whether or to what extent American home prices will plummet soon is open to some debate , but not much .
Even the professionally optimistic housing economists employed by the real - estate industry are now admitting that the good times may be over : “ What we would ask for is kind of a slow slowdown , ” Jeff Culbertson , president of Coldwell Banker - Northern California , told Knight Ridder at the beginning of March .
Virtually every housing economist is concerned that prices may be unstable , and growing numbers are becoming outright alarmed .
To understand why that is–and why warnings of a coming housing collapse have n’t been front - page news–just look at the numbers .
Truth is , in most of the country there ’s no housing bubble .
Perhaps the crucial ratio from which economists determine whether housing markets are out of whack is the ratio of home prices to annual income .
In most of the country , it is modest , 2.4:1 in Wisconsin , 2.2:1 in Kentucky , 2.9:1 in Illinois .
Only in about 20 metro areas , mostly located in eight states , does the relationship of home price to income defy logic .
The bad news is that those areas contain roughly half the housing wealth of the country .
In California , the price of a home stands at 8.3 times the annual family income of its occupants ; in Massachusetts , the ratio is 5.9:1 ; in Hawaii , a stunning , 10.1:1 .
To some extent , there are sound and basic economic reasons for this anomaly : supply and demand .
Salaries in these areas have been going up faster than in the nation as a whole .
The other is supply :
These metro areas are “ built out , ” with zoning ordinances that limit the ability of developers to add new homes .
But at some point , incomes simply can’t sustain the prices .
That point has now been reached .
In California , a middle - class family with two earners each making $ 50,000 a year now owns , on average , an $ 830,000 home .
In the late 80s , the last time these eight states saw price - to - income ratios this high , the real estate market collapsed .
By other measures , too , the market is badly bloated .
One index of housing inflation is the difference between house prices and rents .
In a healthy market , driven by demand , rents and sale prices ought to track roughly together .
But while sale prices have soared , rents have stayed flat ; and in some of the most overheated markets , like San Francisco and Seattle , they have actually been declining .
Such a gap , the economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has written , suggests “ that people are now buying houses for speculation rather than merely for shelter , ” evidence that he called a “ compelling case ” for a housing bubble .
“ Within the next year or so , ” The Economist argued in a May 2003 editorial , these regional “ bubbles are likely to burst , leading to falls in average real home prices of 15 - 20 percent ” across America .
And , of course , in the most heated markets the drop is likely to be steeper yet .
When housing bubbles burst , they can hurt more than their sector of the economy .
Studies have shown that they exercise twice the effect on consumer spending as comparable declines in stock prices .
So , a 20 percent drop in housing prices would have the same , shriveling effect on the economy as a 40 percent crash in the stock market .
When investors lose value in their houses , many of them pull money out of other investments , like stocks .
Then , too , jobs in construction , real estate , and other fields that depend on new home sales die off .
What can Alan Greenspan or anyone else do about this ?
The answer is , not much .
Prices are so stratospheric that even modest hikes in long - term interest rates could burst the bubble .
And with federal deficits soaking up so much capital , interest rates are likely to rise as the economy heats up and demand for capital increases .
Of course , Greenspan could argue for rescinding some of President Bush ’s tax cuts , which he ’s long defended , to bring down the deficit .
But even that probably wo n’t forestall a collapse in home prices .
Given the lateness of the hour , and the near - inevitability of the coming crash , there ’s really only one thing left for concerned citizens to do .
Start assigning blame .
Blowing bubbles
Fortunately , the bad actors responsible for this manic inflation are pretty easy to recognize .
They look remarkably like the ones who puffed up the tech bubble in the late 90s .
In both cases , the unfettered optimism of the buying public was fueled by a brokerage industry almost wholly concerned with making a sale , independent analysts with an incentive to hype prices , and major accounting fraud .
What drives most appreciation in housing prices is the universal human desire to own a slightly larger and more expensive place than one can really afford ; a desire restrained in normal times by the universal desire of those who lend money to get paid back .
Getting a home loan used to be a particularly nerve - wracking and unpleasant process .
A stern loan officer behind a big mahogany desk would pore over your income and credit , suspiciously probing your portfolio for weaknesses .
And sensibly enough :
The bank that lent you the money would have to collect on the mortgage for the next 30 years and had to make sure you were really good for it .
It hired independent appraisers to make sure the price was in line .
This process was a little stingy , and meant some people on the low end of the income scale could n’t buy a home and many others got less home than they might have wanted , but the system usually kept prices in check .
The one exception to this general process was mortgages sold on the secondary market .
In the 1930s , Congress created the Federal National Mortgage Corporation ( Fannie Mae ) to encourage banks to make loans to low - income Americans by agreeing to purchase those mortgages from the banks .
In 1970 , Congress created a second agency , the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) , to do much the same thing .
By the late 1980s , these two entities , which belong to the category known as Government Sponsored Entities ( GSEs ) , were buying up and reselling 30 percent of new mortgages and packaging the mortgages to be sold as securities .
Fannie and Freddie ’s market share was limited by their ability to attract investment capital .
But in 1989 , Congress instituted some modest - seeming technical changes that made Freddie and Fannie much more attractive to investors , and able to draw much more capital .
Under the new rules , for instance , they were allowed to customize securities at different levels of risk and return to meet more precisely the demands of different sectors of the capital market .
Then , too , bank regulators let pension funds and mutual funds class Fannie ’s debt as low - risk .
As a consequence , during the 1990s , investors practically threw money at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which became enormously , steadily profitable .
The GSEs used the new capital to buy up every mortgage they could , and banks were only too happy to sell off the mortgage paper .
The price cap on the mortgages Fannie and Freddie could insure was raised .
As a result of all these changes , Fannie and Freddie went from buying mostly mortgages for low - end homes to those of the middle - and upper - middle class .
And the share of the nation ’s conventional mortgage debt which they insure has swelled , to more than 70 percent today , double its share in 1990 .
This shift has had two crucial , if under - appreciated , consequences .
First , in little more than a decade , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have gone from handling one trillion dollars in mortgages to four trillion , with virtually no changes in oversight .
Second , their dominance of the mortgage market has profoundly undermined the discipline that once kept housing prices in check .
Once banks knew they could automatically hand off the mortgages they wrote to Fannie and Freddie with basically no risk , the old incentive system dissolved .
“ Banks and other mortgage lenders are not watching home prices carefully because they rarely hold onto the mortgage paper they create–they just sell it upstream to mortgage investors , ” John R. Talbott , a housing researcher at UCLA ’s Anderson School of Business , has argued .
“ It is a dangerous situation indeed when neither home buyers nor the institutions that finance them are concerned with the ultimate price being paid for the housing asset . ”
In most markets , buyers and sellers rely on independent experts to bring sanity to prices .
In the stock markets during the 1990s , that role had traditionally been played by stock analysts , whose opinions were famously bought off by the investment banks they worked for .
Something similar has happened to appraisers , the independent contractors banks hire to determine the worth of a home for the purposes of a mortgage loan .
In a recent survey conducted by the October Research Group , more than half of all appraisers said that they personally felt pressured to overstate loans , and “ nearly all ” said they knew a colleague who had actually done so .
The pressure to inflate , October ’s publisher Joe Casa said , “ is much worse now than it ’s ever been . ”
Industry analysts have estimated that between 15 and 30 percent of houses nationally are over - valued .
It ’s not just the discipline of banks that keeps people from buying more than they can afford , but also the buyers ’ own fear and guilt .
But in an environment where home prices continue to spiral up , fear and guilt are replaced by a sense that you ’re a fool not to buy the most house you can possibly get away with .
A particular kind of speculative frenzy ensues , captured in a recent story in The Washington Post which detailed a new phenomenon : home buyers camping out overnight for the chance to be the first in the next morning ’s open house , ready to buy $ 700,000 houses in built - out , lush - lawned suburbs like Arlington .
The phenomenon has created temporary , yuppie tent cities .
The story ’s authors interviewed several buyers in the tented line who planned to sell their purchases back into a steadily rising market , and concluded , dryly : “ There is an element of speculation to the lines . ”
What makes the current frenzy especially dangerous is that every relevant institution has an incentive to play along .
Who , after all , is likely to say stop ?
Not the realtors .
Not the banks , any longer .
Not Fannie and Freddie or the private secondary - mortgage operators , who are turning vast profits on the backs of the bubble .
Certainly not the Federal Reserve or the Treasury Department , while the economy depends on a sustained housing boom .
By 2000 , some acute observers , like Jane D’Arista , a former chief economist for the House Financial Services committee and now a federal funds researcher with the Financial Markets Center , had begun to warn that the situation was untenable .
By 2002 , a few major players , like Steve Roach , Morgan Stanley ’s chief economist , had picked up on the concerns about a bubble and Fannie and Freddie ’s sprawling influence .
But Greenspan , Treasury , and GSE officials , in interviews and testimony , denied that housing inflation posed a problem .
And , sure enough , in the next year , not only did the bubble fail to deflate , but it also expanded –the housing sector posted its best year ever .
Then , last summer , came a warning no one should have missed : news of major accounting fraud at Freddie Mac .
In stocks , corporate accounting scandals appeared after the market plunged , too late to signal danger .
But the fraudulent accounting at Freddie Mac was , or should have been , a wake - up call , though the details of this scandal were distinctly different .
Instead of hiding losses , as happened at Worldcom and Enron , the accountants at Freddie Mac had been hiding embarrassingly large profits .
They feared that higher - than - expected returns might incite more risk - taking and a more volatile housing market than investors in Freddie Mac would like .
A number of senior executives were canned , and spooked foreign investors sold off Freddie and Fannie ’s debt .
A sense was emerging , among politicians as well as economists , that Fannie and Freddie were not just running amok , says Tom Stanton , an attorney specializing in government sponsored enterprises , but that they “ were showing a combination of high leverage , fast growth , and weak oversight of just two companies that held or guaranteed several trillion dollars of mortgages between them and posed potential systemic risk to the American economy . ”
Testifying before Congress on July 16 , Greenspan did not discuss any of this , nor did he mention a bubble .
Instead , he chose to praise the economic benefits of low interest rates and home refinancing .
The boom continued unabated .
By October , homebuyers were able to refinance to a 30 - year fixed - rate loan with a rate of just 4.99 percent .
Eleventh - hour warnings
Still , the accounting scandals , carrying with them a vague , unsavory whiff of Enron , made reforms in the housing market impossible to ignore .
Even Franklin Raines , Fannie Mae ’s chairman , admitted that the GSEs needed to be reined in .
In the fall , the House dipped its toes into the water , with a bill that established a single regulator in the Treasury Department with broader authority to make sure the GSEs had their finances in order .
At the White House ’s behest , the Senate Banking Committee began hearings on the same issue in February .
The goal of most of the debate in Congress has so far been how to ensure the GSEs financial viability ; there has been very little talk about how to reduce their role in the housing markets .
That job fell to Greenspan : Finally , on Feb. 24 , testifying before the Senate Banking Committee , he came clean about the risks of the housing market , in a speech reminiscent of his 1996 warning about “ irrational exuberance ” in the stock market .
In his familiar , glum posture , his bald head slouching low over the table , he warned that the GSEs were n’t just unstable , but also posed a “ systemic risk ” to the economy of the United States .
He suggested debt caps , to reduce Fannie and Freddie ’s role in the market , and urged stricter regulation .
The chairman ’s proposals were both brave and right , the best plan for resolving the structural problems with GSEs that ’s been put forward yet .
But given the political situation , his reforms wo n’t be enacted anytime soon .
The day after his testimony , his suggestions were brushed off by everyone from Fannie and Freddie ’s chief executives to Republicans and Democrats on the Hill .
Oh , it ’s just Greenspan .
Both political parties have bought into the idea that a vast , unfettered Fannie and Freddie are good for the country , and have only amplified the GSEs ’ “ American Dream ” rhetoric .
Republicans are still invested in the deregulation of Fannie and Freddie they helped engineer in the late 1980s .
Democrats , generally the party of more regulation , have historically been Fannie and Freddie ’s best friends , and the GSEs ’ lush executive suites are packed with former Democratic staffers : Raines was Clinton ’s director of the Office of Management and Budget , and his predecessor , James A. Johnson , a longtime aide to Walter Mondale , is now leading John Kerry ’s search for a running mate .
In the hearings on the Hill , neither Democrats nor Republicans have seemed favorably disposed to strict regulation of Fannie and Freddie , and American Banker has concluded that the GSEs ’ lobbying power is strong enough that no regulatory bill will pass without their okay .
Greenspan , of course , knows all this .
He knows his reform initiatives stand little chance politically right now , and he knows that even if , miraculously , they were put into place , they likely wo n’t keep the housing market from crashing .
Why even bother to bring it up ?
Two reasons , say Fed - watchers .
First , though he did n’t explicitly warn against the housing bubble , Greenspan wants to be able to claim , after the bubble bursts , that he gave fair warning , even though these warnings came at the eleventh hour .
But at a less cynical level , the chairman knows that in the American political process real reforms only get put into place after a crisis and not before , but that you stand a better chance of getting them if you publicize them early .
So , why then did n’t he bring these issues up even earlier ?
The answer may be that he simply could n’t afford to — he was relying on a supercharged housing sector to get the economy as a whole through the recession .
Indeed , he still is .
On the very day that he suggested his reforms of the secondary market , he was trying to squeeze a little more juice out of refinancing with his bizarre advice to consumers about ARMs .
And that , ultimately , is the ironic and uncomfortable position that this economy has forced Greenspan into .
To get out of the recession , he had to rely on , stay mum about , and even encourage a housing bubble .
Now , that very bubble may be the thing that destroys the recovery he has sought to create .

A hero died after jumping into a canal to save a drowning boy - but his devastated fiancee says his death was ' needless ' after calls for improved safety were allegedly ignored .
Printworker Leigh Pitt , 30 , sacrificed his life going to the rescue of nine - year - old Harley Bagnall - Taylor who fell into the deep water while playing outside his home .
The walls of the historic canal in Thamesmead , South - East London , are 15 ft high and there is no way to climb out .
Scroll down for more ...
Residents say they were told several years ago it would be filled in or extra safety measures would be introduced but nothing was ever done .
Mr Pitt was in his flat which overlooks the canal , called Broadwater Dock , when he heard the youngster 's screams and saw him struggling last Thursday .
He jumped in and kept the boy above the water while other residents - Brian Mahoney , his son Daniel and neighbour Martin Hills - threw a hosepipe to Harley .
Scroll down for more ...
They managed to drag Harley out but when they went to help Leigh , he had disappeared under the water .
Leigh 's fiancee , who has asked not to be named , wept as she said : " I am so angry because Leigh should still be here .
He was only 30 years old .
His death was needless .
" Leigh did n't have a chance of swimming to safety with the boy and there was no way he could pull himself out of the water because there is nothing to grab on to . "
She added : " Leigh would not have given it a second 's thought before jumping in there to save him .
It was the kind of selfless thing he would do and was the reason I loved him so much .
He was a hero . "
Police Constable Ken Chow , 28 , was the first of the emergency services to arrive at the scene .
He said : " The boy had been rescued but I was told a man was still in there .
" I jumped in but could n't see anything .
Then I saw the top of a man 's head below the water .
" I dived down and was able to pull him up for a short while but I could not tread water with him .
" There was nothing to hold on to and nowhere to go in the canal .
I had to let go of him .
He drifted away .
It was awful . "
Harley 's father Darren Taylor , 37 , paid tribute to Mr Pitt .
He said : " What that man did was unbelievable - he saved my son 's life .
We are so grateful . "
Built by Napoleonic prisoners of war , the canal lies within the London Borough of Greenwich but is the responsibility of property development and investment company Tilfen Land , which has been redeveloping the area .
Residents say they have been campaigning for better safety for 15 years .
Brian Mahoney , who helped rescue the boy , said : " We were told it would be filled in and replaced with parkland .
Then they said safety would be improved .
" If there had even been a hand rail Leigh would still be alive today . "
A spokesman for Tilfen Land said : " The site is securely fenced and clearly signposted with ' Danger - Deep Water ' warnings . "

Fox censored Sally Field but does n't give a goddamn about others

The Fox network , which censored an anti-war statement from Sally Field including the word " goddamn " at Sunday 's Emmy Awards , is n't so conservative when it comes to the use of the G - word on Fox News programming .
And that 's " goddamn hypocrisy , " says Think Progress .
" And let 's face it :
If mothers ruled the world , " Field said in her acceptance speech , " there would be no god - damned wars in the first place . "
But a new film compilation from Fox Attacks ' Robert Greenwald proves the network let at least five other " goddamns " go unbleeped on various programming .
Yesterday , the conservative NewsBusters , a media watchdog group , and others took a swipe at the Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz for suggesting the censoring of Field by Fox had been politically motivated .
" Well , it 's a non-story that became a story because of FOX pulling the plug on her anti-war sentiment , " Kurtz told Glenn Beck on CNN 's Reliable Sources .
" However , that 's not what happened , " NewsBusters ' Lynn Davidson writes .
" Instead , as the orchestra signaled her time was up , Fox cut Field 's sound after she uttered ' G **.'
Fox also censored two other speakers for obscenity . "
During its Emmy broadcast , Fox also censored remarks from Ray Romano , who used the word " screwing , " and Katherine Heigl , who mouthed the words " oh shit , " after hearing her name called .
Today , just a quick thought , directed mainly at any Christians ( or other theists , really ) who might be visiting my slice of the internet .
It is a sad fact that most people remain in the religion into which they were born .
That is , most children inculcated into Catholicism remain Catholics , most children indoctrinated into Islam remain Muslims , most children raised as Hindus remain so , etc .
A relatively small percentage of the indoctrinated eventually becomes “ agnostic ” or atheistic ; I count myself among this percentage , because I abandoned Roman Catholicism roughly six years ago , as I became more educated and knowledgeable about Darwinian evolution , anthropology , philosophy and other subjects .
Another small percentage of people switches from one superstition to another .
For example , Cat Stevens , an entertainer from the ’60s and ’ 70s , changed his name to Yusuf Islam when he converted from Christianity to Islam .
Again , though , Stevens is the exception to the rule :
Most people , once inculcated , remain so .
Therefore , I pose a question to my theist friends who still follow the religion into which their parents indoctrinated them :
Do you feel lucky to have been born into the correct religion ?
Researchers have concluded 19 major world religious groupings exist on this planet .
Those groupings are subdivided into roughly 10,000 distinct religions ( which is not to mention all the religions that have gone extinct over the millennia ) .
Scroll through this list of religions , and ponder just how different your life would have been had you been born into a different superstition .
Please consider the following suggestion :
If a devout Christian , who was born in Topeka , Kansas , had instead been born in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , he would have been a devout Muslim .
If Osama bin Laden , who is a devout Muslim , had instead been born in Athens , Alabama , he would have been a devout Christian .
I have said it before , but it warrants repetition : Religion spreads , passively , by the coincidental geography of one 's place of birth and , actively , by parents ’ talent for inculcating their defenseless , trusting young .
Some people seemingly have a genetic predisposition to religious zeal ; the religion to which they wed themselves has nothing to do with evidence and everything to do with inculcative history .
The Christian apologetics that is utterly convincing to a person born in Hendersonville , Tennessee , would be infidelic venom to that same person , had he instead been born in Tehran , Iran .
Perhaps religion finally shall go extinct once more people realize that one ’s piety , at least with regard to a particular superstition , is a mere accident of geography .
A fundamentalist Christian , in other words , in an alternate reality , would be just another mujahid .
Introduction
Typical display — best viewed with anaglyphic glasses ( ) .
Since the day I got my first computer in 1977 ( an Apple II ) , I 've been writing gravity simulators , and until now they 've been rather difficult to create and test .
But I recently learned Ruby , and I must say that , given how sophisticated this new simulator is , I am astonished at how quickly it came together .
Even though I have ported this simulator to C++ for greater execution speed , I am glad I designed it in Ruby first , because of the startlingly short prototyping and development time .
This gravity modeler operates in three dimensions ( a personal first ) , and it shows its results in true 3D using the anaglyphic method ( using red / blue glasses ) .
It was written and tested on a Linux system , but it will run on Windows if Ruby and the GTK + library are installed .

The Physics of Gravitation
We 're all indebted to Isaac Newton for sorting out the first set of mathematical rules for gravitation .
Albert Einstein added a great deal to our understanding of gravity , but in normal circumstances Newton 's equations can be used to predict gravity 's effects in nature .
The first thing to understand about gravity is that its " force " 1 declines as the square of distance :
The first thing to understand about gravity is that its " force " declines as the square of distance : ( 1 ) f ≈ 1 r2 So , if you double the distance between two masses , the gravitational force declines by a factor of four .
A full statement of the force of gravity is that it is equal to the product of the masses and a gravitational constant G , divided by the square of the distance between the masses :
So , if you double the distance between two masses , the gravitational force declines by a factor of four .
A full statement of the force of gravity is that it is equal to the product of the masses and a gravitational constant G , divided by the square of the distance between the masses : ( 2 ) f = G m 1 m 2 r2 Where :
Where : f : Force , Newtons , and please read footnote 1 . G : The Universal Gravitational Constant , estimated to be equal to 6.6742x10-11 N m2 / kg2. m 1 , m 2 : The masses of the two bodies in question .
r:
The distance between m 1 and m 2 .
All in consistent units .
All in consistent units .
We have the force , but there is one more step in moving one of the masses , and that is to apply the force .
When we apply the force , we discover something Einstein showed us — masses posses inertia , and further , inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal ( as far as can be determined ) .

When we apply the force , we discover something Einstein showed us — masses posses inertia , and further , inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal ( as far as can be determined ) .
Therefore , to convert a force to an acceleration , we apply this equation :
Therefore , to convert a force to an acceleration , we apply this equation : ( 3 ) a 1 = f m 1
Well , well .
It turns out that acceleration ( the rate of change in velocity ) is inversely proportional to mass .
But the force of gravity is directly proportional to mass , therefore two mass terms cancel out — one mass term in equation ( 2 ) and one mass term in equation ( 3 ) .
In some cases we can combine equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) like this :

In some cases we can combine equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) like this : ( 4 ) a 1 = G m 1 m 2 m 1 r2 Canceling terms : Canceling terms : ( 5 ) a 1 = G m 2 r2 Equation ( 5 ) is suitable when mass m 2 is much greater than m 1 , such as the problem of a planet traveling around the sun .
Equation ( 5 ) is suitable when massis much greater than , such as the problem of a planet traveling around the sun .
At this point we 've established the force between two masses at rest , what is known as a " static problem " .
You can measure the force with reasonable accuracy , then you can move the masses , then you can measure the force again .
But in nature , masses tend to be in continuous motion .
How can we predict the future path of a moving object under the influence of gravity ?
Are n't the forces changing from moment to moment , making it tough to do the math ?

It 's called " Calculus " .
I have written a tutorial on Calculus for those who want a quick refresher before we go on .
It turns out that Calculus , the mathematics of motion and change , is the perfect tool for gravity simulation .
A Little Calculus
Those of my readers who have n't studied Calculus should n't worry — the graphics will likely convey the key ideas , and I will do my best to explain the concepts as we proceed .
At this point , we are going to allow our masses to move , and if we intend to model that motion mathematically , we need a way to put motion terms in an equation .
Let 's say we have a function2 that tells us where we are at time t , and it looks like this :
At this point , we are going to allow our masses to move , and if we intend to model that motion mathematically , we need a way to put motion terms in an equation .
Let 's say we have a functionthat tells us where we are at time , and it looks like this : ( 6 ) p(t ) = v t ( 6 ) Very simply , function ( 6 ) says , " Position p(t ) at time t is equal to a velocity term v times t " .
If our velocity v is equal to 5 meters / second , then according to function ( 6 ) , after 23 seconds we should have moved 23 * 5 = 115 meters .
Very simply , function ( 6 ) says , " Positionat timeis equal to a velocity termtimes " .
If our velocityis equal to 5 meters / second , then according to function ( 6 ) , after 23 seconds we should have moved 23 * 5 = 115 meters .
Differential Equations
We know what is in p(t ) above , what operation it performs , because we stated it explicitly .
But there is a reason to treat functions as though they were variables , black boxes with just a name , boxes that can contain anything at all .
We know we can make statements about numerical variables without knowing or caring what the variables contain , indeed that is the primary idea behind algebra .
It turns out we can make statements about functions in the same way , without knowing or caring what the function actually does .

Because we know what is in p(t ) above , we know there is a velocity term present .
But let 's say we need to refer to velocity if given a position function with unknown contents .
Using differential equation notation , we can say : Because we know what is inabove , we know there is a velocity term present .
But let 's say we need to refer to velocity if given a position function with unknown contents .
Using , we can say : ( 7 ) v(t ) = p'(t ) ( 7 ) Our new function v(t ) represents the rate of change in the position function p(t ) , with respect to time t.
We specify a function 's derivative ( a rate of change ) with the notation in ( 7 ) , that is , p'(t ) .
Our new functionrepresents thein the position function , with respect to time .
We specify a function 's derivative ( a rate of change ) with the notation in ( 7 ) , that is , Again , this is a simple notation , it 's useful and important to remember .
It simply says that p'(t ) is the rate of change in p(t ) .
If p(t ) happens to refer to a position at some time t , then p'(t ) refers to the rate of change in position , or velocity ( or speed , for purists ) .
Again , this is a simple notation , it 's useful and important to remember .
It simply says thatis thein .
If p(t ) happens to refer to a position at some time , thenrefers to the rate of change in position , or velocity ( or speed , for purists ) .
Higher derivatives
If p'(t ) is a rate of change in p(t ) , and p(t ) is a position at some time t , then what might p'' ( t ) signify ?
Strictly speaking , that would be a rate of change in a rate of change with respect to t .
And if p'(t ) is a velocity , then p'' (t ) must refer to acceleration , which is defined as a rate of change in velocity .
Or : Ifis a rate of change in , andis a position at some time , then what mightsignify ?
Strictly speaking , that would be awith respect to .
And ifis a velocity , thenmust refer to acceleration , which is defined as a rate of change in velocity .
Or : ( 8 ) v(t ) = p'( t ) ( velocity from position ) ( 8 ) ( velocity from position ) ( 9 ) a (t ) = v'( t ) ( acceleration from velocity ) ( 9 ) ( acceleration from velocity )
Of course , we can take this shortcut :
Of course , we can take this shortcut : ( 10 ) a ( t ) = p'' ( t ) ( acceleration from position ) ( 10 ) ( acceleration from position ) Ball , Dog , Wind
At this point we can use this notation to make a rather sophisticated statement about a physical problem .
Let 's say we have thrown a ball into the air .
We have released the ball with an initial velocity v at time zero , and we want to know where the ball will go under the influence of gravity .
We 'll disregard such factors as air resistance , the neighbor 's dog , and all those messy real - world factors that mathematics does n't address very well anyway .

Here we go .
We 've thrown the ball , let it go with a starting velocity of v at time zero .
We want to make a statement about how gravity will affect the ball .
First , let 's figure out what force Earth 's gravitational field will create on the ball ( a restatement of equation ( 2 ) ) :

First , let 's figure out what force Earth 's gravitational field will create on the ball ( a restatement of equation ( 2 ) ) : ( 11 ) f = G m 1 m 2 r2
In this case , m 1 is our ball , m 2 is the Earth ( a bigger ball ) , the radius r is the distance from the center of the earth to the surface3 , and G is the Universal Gravitational Constant .
Here are the values :
In this case , is our ball , is the Earth ( a bigger ball ) , the radiusis the distance from the center of the earth to the surface , andis the Universal Gravitational Constant .
Here are the values : Mass of the ball ( m 1 ) 250 grams Mass of the Earth ( m 2 ) 5.976x1024 Kilograms Radius of the Earth ( r ) 6.37814x106 Meters Universal Gravitational Constant ( G ) 6.6742x10-11 N m2 / kg2 .
Plugging in these numbers : Plugging in these numbers : ( 12 ) f = 6.6742x10-11 ( G ) .25 ( ball ) 5.976x1024 ( earth mass ) ( 6.37814x106 ) 2 ( earth radius )
Before going on , remember equation ( 5 ) above , that cancels out two terms and gets us to acceleration in one step ?
Let 's apply that simplification : Before going on , remember equation ( 5 ) above , that cancels out two terms and gets us to acceleration in one step ?
Let 's apply that simplification : ( 13 ) a = 6.6742x10-11 ( G ) 5.976x1024 ( earth mass ) ( 6.37814x106 ) 2 ( earth radius )
Our result is an acceleration of about 9.8 meters / second2 ( that 's about 32 feet / second2 in English units ) , a number that should be familiar to many people in technical professions .

Now let 's write a statement about the ball 's flight , using the notation we have introduced above :
Now let 's write a statement about the ball 's flight , using the notation we have introduced above : Term Meaning Comment p(0 ) = 0 Initial position at time zero
The position of the thrower 's hand releasing the ball p'( 0 ) = v Initial velocity at time zero
The velocity imparted to the ball by the thrower p''(t ) = -a Gravitational acceleration A constant for any time t
These items are called " differential equation terms . "
They may or may not lead to a closed - form solution , an ordinary algebraic function for any time t.
As stated , they do in fact lead to a trivial solution , because there are only two gravitating bodies involved ( and because we chose to neglect wind and the neighbor 's dog ) :

Plot for a = 9.8 , v = 19.6 ( 14 ) p(t ) = - a t2 + t v 2
About equation ( 14 ) , notice the - a t2/2 expression ?
That 's what makes the ball come back down .
The expression to its right , + t v , initially causes our thrown ball to travel upward , but the time - squared term eventually dominates .

The expression to its right , , initially causes our thrown ball to travel upward , but the time - squared term eventually dominates .
If a closed - form solution were not available , if this problem represented a physical system that could not be solved algebraically , there would still be options .
One commony used option is to model the system in small slices of time .
This is called " numerical modeling " .
Obviously it would be better to find a closed - form solution , since that would produce an immediate result for any time , with very little computer power expended .
One applies numerical solutions only as a last resort .

This leads to a famous question .
How many gravitationally interacting bodies can you have , and still produce a closed - form solution ?
The answer is " two " .
This means the problem I stated above is the most complex form that avoids labor - intensive numerical methods .
All other problems in this class require numerical modeling .

So when you hear that NASA expended vast sums guiding a Mars lander spacecraft from Cape Canaveral , using exquisitely accurate methods , over many months of deep space flight , to a point 80 million kilometers away , where the spacecraft crashed only a few meters from its intended touchdown point , you should remember they used methods very much like those used in my modeling program .

Programming Calculus
We have established that a general - purpose gravity simulator must compute its results numerically , that is , in steps , using many small slices of time .
This approach has a number of advantages , the most important being a simple statement of some rather complex problems , but it has these drawbacks :
From the standpoint of accuracy , it is a good idea to use small time slices , but computer numeric variables have limited resolution , so we must avoid making the time slices too small .
Also , small time slices mean long execution time .
From the standpoint of fast execution , it is a good idea to use large time slices , but a numerical algorithm 's results become less accurate as the time slices become larger .
These two points are obviously in conflict , and a reasonable numerical solution balances the issues of accuracy and execution time .
But it is important to understand that all numerical solutions are approximate .
One can minimize computation errors , but they can not be eliminated .

These results were obtained on a relatively fast PC with a 3 GHz clock speed .
From the algebraic solution above , we find that the maximum ball height should be 19.6 meters , so in our simulation we 've used that result as a measure of the accuracy of the numerical solution .
This experiment shows us several things :

This experiment shows us several things :
Within broad limits , reducing the size of dt ( the time slice value ) proportionally reduces the numerical error .
( the time slice value ) proportionally reduces the numerical error .
Numerical solutions can take a long time .
This problem is typical in that each decimal place of accuracy improvement requires ten times more computer time .
more computer time .
Minimizing errors in numerical solvers quickly become a case of diminishing returns .
In the above example , the worst - case run time for the simulation took longer ( 12 seconds ) than the ball throw would have required in reality ( 4 seconds ) .
Not demonstrated in this solution is the fact that , for some problems , reducing dt too far backfires ( because of roundoff errors in the computer 's floating - point variables ) , and the errors increase again .
This would seem to have been a rather masochistic exercise , since we already know an algebraic solution exists .
But in physics , the vast majority of dynamic problems require numerical solution , so it is a good idea to learn how to perform these kinds of simulations , and avoid the pitfalls .

Simulating Space
Now we can turn to the full - fledged gravity simulator .
As explained above , the program is written in Ruby , which was a tremendous advantage with regard to develoment time .
I was able to move from a rough outline to final code is a very short time .

The default time step ( think dt from the above examples ) is 16 hours , which makes the inner solar system 's planets seem to be moving rather fast ( if your system 's clock speed is also fast ) .
If you reduce the time step , the simulation will be more accurate , but it will take longer to run .
If you increase the time step , the animation will go faster , but wil be less accurate , as explained above .

Program Notes
For those who are interested , click here to see the main Ruby program listing ( it ca n't be run stand - alone , it requires additional files present in the zip download ) .
As I developed this simulator , I decided to include some real - world orbital data , to see if the resulting simulation agreed with reality .
So I acquired a table of solar system data ( planetary positions and velocities ) and included it in the program .
I realized I had written a valid simulation when the planets did n't fall into the sun .

As to the comets , I wrote a random comet generator ( each new set of comets is different ) that creates reasonable - looking elliptical orbits .
Obviously this program 's frequency of inner-system comet encounters is higher than in reality .

The user will notice that , even with a time step of 1 hour , Mercury seems to be orbiting the sun rather quickly .
This is because each simulation " hour " may take only a few milliseconds to compute and render .

The simulator 's solar system representation is only approximately correct .
In the real world , not all the planets lie on the same plane .
A user with some programming skill could create a data table for the solar system that includes much more detailed information , such as inclination to the ecliptic and accurate planetary positions for a given starting date .

The reader may know that orbital systems with more than two bodies are potentially chaotic ( e.g. extremely sensitive to initial conditions and prone to unpredictable instabilities ) .
The only reason we do n't notice this in our own ( real - world ) solar system is because the sun 's mass is so much greater than the planets that each planet represents an individual two - body orbital system with the sun .

Symmetrical Gravity Computation
In the real world , each mass interacts gravitationally with every other mass , something that is easy to say but hard to model in a computer .
If we wanted to maintain perfect fidelity to reality , we would compute each object 's gravitational acceleration toward every other object , which unfortunately requires time proportional to n( n - 1 ) / 2 for n objects .
In this simulator , both to assure stability and to save time , the gravitational accelerations of the planets and the comets are by default computed with respect to the sun , not to each other .

In this simulator , both to assure stability and to save time , the gravitational accelerations of the planets and the comets are by default computed with respect to the sun , not to each other .
But there is an option in the program that can compute all the objects symmetrically .
Located in the OrbitalPhysics :: process_planets , this approach proves useful in simulations other than those provided by default with the program ( and only in a much faster execution environment than a typical P.C. ) .
An example would be a star cluster , a notoriously difficult system to model , and one that would require a fantastic amount of run time on a personal computer .
This option is available for code completeness but it is n't practical to use in the Ruby version of this program .

C++ Version of Gravity
It is because of modeling challenges like star clusters and my curiosity about the above - referenced symmetrical computation mode that I have written a version of this program in C++ to improve execution speed .
This version is available as a tar archived source package that must be compiled for use , and it is meant for a Linux system having an installed GTK + library .
Click here to download the C++ source package ( 215 KB ) , or click here to download a binary executable compiled on Fedora 10 ( 200 KB ) .
As expected , the C++ version is much faster than the Ruby version , and it reveals some things I did n't expect .
One of these is that graphically rendering a huge number of " comets " , a program option , takes much more processing time than simply computing their path through 3D space .
I discovered this by reducing the minimum size of the objects ( " Min. Size " ) and seeing a dramatic increase in rendering speed .
The C++ version will readily draw many thousands of objects with acceptable speed , and presents quite a spectacle when the render is carried out using the 3D anaglyphic rendering option .
To create thousands of objects , simply choose a large number of " comets " from the provided drop - down list .
This mode of operation really shows the downside of Ruby in execution speed .
The Ruby version will run acceptably fast only until there are about 16 objects present , after which it begins to slow down severely .

This is not meant to disparage Ruby , not at all .
This is not what Ruby was designed to do .
And Ruby allowed me to develop this application very quickly ( another meaning for program speed ) , after which I simply ported the program , almost line by line , into C ++.

Okay , even the head of the House intelligence committee does n’t know that one .
All the more reason to start boning up on what we — and our leaders — should have learned back before they signed us up for this crash course in Middle Eastern geopolitics .

The navy said breast implants were not to make sailors " look sexy "
An armed forces spokesman defended the operations , saying they were carried out for psychological reasons , not to make sailors " look sexy " .
Brigadier Andrew Nikolic said the " holistic needs " of service personnel were considered under defence policy .
But he said breast augmentations were not routinely funded by the military .
" We do consider the broader needs of our people , both physical and psychological , " Brig Nikolic said .
" But that is a long way from saying that if someone does n't like their appearance , Defence will fund things like breast augmentation as a matter of routine - that is just not correct . "
He was speaking after one plastic surgeon said he had carried out breast enlargements on two sailors , aged 25 and 32 , for A$ 10,000 ( £ 4,200 ) each .
Brig Nikolic said such operations were only recommended after a medical evaluation .
But the opposition Labor Party said it wanted details on the cases .
" On the face of it , taxpayer - funded breast enhancement is a questionable practice , " said Labor defence spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon .
" I have to say [ it ] smacks of a government out of touch . "
Bankrupt American Home Mortgage is attempting to seize as much as $ 27 million that former employees set aside from paychecks for retirement , according to an attorney representing them .
Employees say Melville , N.Y. - based American Home Mortgage Investment wants to release retirement money from a trust fund to pay off large creditors .
The attorney for a group of former employees alleged American Home or its trustee for the retirement plan " may have acted inappropriately with regard to withholding distributions or encouraging contributions . "
Calls to American
Home were not immediately returned early Tuesday .
The case in bankruptcy court in Delaware is being brought by 43 employees who had a total of $ 11.6 million in the retirement trust .
The deferred - compensation plan enabled employees making more than about $ 200 - thousand per year to save money tax - free until they retired .
American
Home has more than 1,000 creditors , some of which already have priority claims on the firm 's assets .
American
Home filed for bankruptcy protection in August .
Once the nation 's 10th largest mortgage lender , the company said it fell victim to ' extraordinary disruptions ' that effectively cut off the funding it needed to make new loans .
Falling home prices and a spike in payment defaults scared investors away from mortgage debt , including bonds and other securities backed by home loans .
Its 40 biggest creditors include virtually all the major names of Wall Street .

Permafrost in Canada 's Yukon territory , one of the places from which researchers uncovered ancient DNA in bacteria .
The oldest living thing has been discovered in the form of 600,000 - year - old bacteria extracted from ice cores , scientists claim .
The finding gives hope that if Mars or other frigid worlds ever supported life similar to these ancient bacteria , they might be alive still .
The trick , the discovery suggests , is for organisms to keep some metabolism going over the millennia , so that they can keep their DNA in repair while awaiting a more favorable environment in which to multiply .
The other approach , complete dormancy , would cause DNA to be damaged and perhaps destroyed over such long periods of time .
The scientists isolated long chains of active DNA from the bacteria .
" The colder you make the environment , the longer [ DNA ] survives , " said study team member Thomas Gilbert of the University of Copenhagen .
" In places like Mars and [ Jupiter 's moon ]
Europa , which are really , really cold , DNA may very well be surviving there for a hell of a long time . "
Ancient cells
Recently in separate work , scientists collected the oldest ever recovered DNA , estimated to be up to 800,000 years old , below more than a mile of Greenland ice .
However , the DNA was not active inside a living organism .
The new discovery involves extremely persistent life .
The secret to the longevity of the bacteria and DNA , the scientists write in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is the capacity of the DNA to continuously repair itself as it degrades over time .
Sarah Stewart Johnson of MIT and her colleagues uncovered the bacteria from cores drilled in northeastern Siberia , northwestern Canada and Antarctica .
They isolated genetic material from the samples , finding the DNA was relatively intact .
" Normally with old samples of this kind of age , if you get any DNA at all , which is unlikely , you 'll be getting maybe 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe 100 nucleotide sequences , " Gilbert told LiveScience .
" Here they were getting 4,000 base pairs , no problem , which suggests the DNA is pretty good . "
( DNA — deoxyribonucleic acid — is a ladder - like molecule made of paired bases and chemicals called nucleotides .
Bacteria typically have about 1 million to 5 million base pairs per genome . )
They also measured carbon dioxide levels respiring from the bacteria , finding that the microbes were metabolically active .
" Some of the bacteria are actually alive , " Gilbert said .
Lab experiments indicated the bacteria could repair damaged DNA .
Bacteria mechanics
Recent research has found evidence suggesting that ancient bacterial cells and their DNA could survive for millennia in near - dormant states .
Yet while dormancy would reduce the rate of natural DNA damage , truly dormant cells would not be capable of DNA repair .
Over time , spontaneous chemical reactions would damage the cell 's genome to the point where the cell would be unable to reproduce , proving fatal over the long - term .
The only way for cells to survive for up to millions of years would be if they had the ability to repair DNA , according to the study scientists .
Though past studies have claimed DNA older than half a million years , the scientists involved in the current finding point out their methods utilized stringent controls to prevent contamination from modern bacteria — a concern with past claims .
" People have reported old DNA several times but there have always been problems , " Gilbert said .
" It 's very easy to get bacteria contaminating your work , because obviously it 's everywhere . "
atom2 json.erl converts a directory of Atom files to a directory of JSON files .
As with most real - life problems , this one has multiple layers .
First one needs to settle on an XML to JSON mapping .
It turns out that there are many different approaches to this problem .
For now , I elected to do some generic XML - to - JSON mapping crap .
An RFC in this area would be helpful , particularly one that dealt with the notion of Extensions , and one that exposes the true structure of [ x ] html Text Constructs as those would crucial enablers for things like standard Map / Reduce jobs that extract Microformats and RDFa .
Next , it turns out that the data structures returned from the XML parser / builder ( xmerl ) are not what the JSON parser / builder ( rfc4627 ) expects , so there ’s yet another layer of impedance mismatch .
The next level down , there are Erlang concepts of tuples , arrays , binary , and ( lower case ) atoms that need to be dealt with .
Even lower down , there is utf - 8 which apparently the current rfc4627 implementation does n’t properly handle , so that module needs to be patched .
( Note : this is only for the JSON builder part , another patch would be required to support JSON parsing ) .
Add in requirements like coalescing consecutive XML text nodes , and the desire to spawn a separate thread per conversion , and the task seems like a fairly daunting one .
Yet the resulting Erlang program is remarkably compact , clean , and simple .
With many frameworks and languages , I get the feeling that I ’m dealing with a metal cabinet covered by layers of marine paint ; one where scratches tend to reveal sharp edges .
With Erlang , I get the feeling of a Victorian mahogany armoire ; one where scratches in the wood simply reveal more rich wood .

Total Recall .
To say " they do n't make 'em like that anymore ! " would be one hell of an understatement .
This movie has it all ...
Schwarzenegger in his prime , plenty of sci- fi action , gobs of blood , mutants , animatronics , one - liners galore , and a great story to top it all off .
It 's simply one of those movies that everybody loves without question .
Well today I 'd like to take a look at the ten best things about Total Recall ( you know , the one from 1990 that 's actually worth paying to see ) so you can see exactly what makes it so memorable .
So sit back , relax and enjoy your virtual vacation on Mars .
# 1 : Quaid 's Nightmare !
Here 's a hell of a way to start off a movie : Have Douglas Quaid ( Arnold ) walking on the surface of Mars when all of a sudden he slips and falls down onto a rock ... breaking his protective glass visor in the process .
In an instant , his face starts reacting to the atmospheric pressure as Quaid twitches and groans .
Soon enough , his eyes are literally popping out of his skull and just when you think he 's gonna burst , the scene ends to reveal that it was only a bad dream .
While Arnold 's noises are amusing in their own right , the real credit here ( and for many of the memorable scenes in the movie ) goes to Rob Bottin .
He 's a true special effects wizard with a unique talent for making just about anything cartoonishly grotesque .
I should note that the main bad guy , Vilos Cohaagen , actually does experience a death just like this at the end of the movie , but I still prefer the Arnold scene .
Arnold 's face is already cartoony as hell , and with the help of Bottin 's special effects , it simply becomes an absolutely perfect scene .
# 2 : Safety Zone Security !
With airport security being a more uncomfortable experience than most flights these days , is n't it about time we see the arrival of the " Safety Zone " security system from Total Recall ?
It 's fast , efficient and it shows everything a person has on them .
No , I do n't just mean what 's inside their coat .
I mean , if you want to quickly see whether or not a person is carrying a bomb in their colon , this is the way to go .
Look , if you want paranoid airport security to perform a full body cavity search because they suspect you of being a terrorist , that 's your prerogative .
Me ?
I 'm gonna stick with the " Safety Zone " security system .
# 3 : Insta-Color Nails !
Now here 's one that men and women can both appreciate .
With your electronic palette and stylus pen , you ladies can instantly color your nails until you 've found the color that works best for you .
No more messes , no nail polish fumes ... just perfect nails every time .
And for you guys out there , this will surely cut out a good HOUR of waiting for your ladies to finish doing whatever the hell it is they do in the bathroom before you go out , such as putting on their make - up .
Everybody wins !
Furthermore , why limit this technology just to nails ?
What about hair ?
Say one day you want to be a blonde , the next day you want to be a brunette ... would n't it be nice to if you did n't need to deal with hair bleaches and dyes ?
Actually , it could also make for some great pranks .
Imagine the look on your roommate 's face when he wakes up to discover that his skin is now bright green .
There 's just so much potential for fun with this technology .
Come on scientists , quit trying to cure cancer and bring us Insta -Color glee !
# 4 : Quaid Hates His Sessions With Rekall Incorporated !
Forget about Jim " rubber - faced limbo champion " Carrey , for my money there 's no better wacky facial expressionist actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger and his " Rekall " sessions are prime examples of this .
In his first session with Rekall Incorporated , Quaid apparently wakes up from a memory implant procedure because his memory was already previously erased and he begins to flip out .
While holding him down , the doctors inject him about 10 times with a sedative .
Clearly they should 've kept a horse tranquilizer on hand for a big lug like Quaid .
His next session is by force because his real alter - ego , Hauser , wants his body back .
But Hauser is , as Quaid would say , an asshole and Quaid is n't about to go quietly .
As they lock him into the Rekall machine , he goes apeshit and literally tears a big chunk of it right off .
He then stabs the doctor right in the neck with the exposed jagged edge of his arm lock !
Tasty !
I think the lesson learned here is very similar to when man put King Kong in captivity :
DON'T DO THAT .
# 5 : JohnnyCab !
Now this is something most people have a love / hate relationship with .
JohnnyCab is a robotic cab driver who comes off as an annoying throwback to a chipper gas station attendant from the 50s ( his voice is done by Robert Picardo in case you were wondering ) .
Anyway , while JohnnyCab does eliminate the odors and other headaches that come along with a real human cab driver , he does n't posses the ability to " step on it " when you 're in a hurry .
You know , like when Quaid is trying to get away from a bunch of bad guys who want to KILL him .
So what does Quaid do ?
Quaid literally uproots JohnnyCab from the floor and tosses him in the back seat and drives the car himself .
I still remember the movie audience CHEERING when Quaid did that .
It was obvious they hated JohnnyCab .
And to add insult to injury , JohnnyCab asks for the cab fare and Quaid responds " Sue me , dickhead ! " JohnnyCab then manages to regain control of the cab somehow and tries to run over Quaid .
Instead , he runs into a wall , the cab explodes , and we all get to see JohnnyCab die a fiery robo - death .
# 6 : That 's No Woman !
The moment I laid eyes on this woman I knew something was wrong with .
First off , that smile of hers was downright creepy .
So creepy that , even though she was n't covered in bugs , she still reminded me of one of the equally creepy homeless ladies from John Carpenter 's Prince of Darkness .
And that 's saying a lot since I consider PoD to be one of the most nightmarish movies ever created .
Anyway , she 's having her photo ID checked out and all is going well , albeit creepy , until she starts twitching and repeating the same phrase over and over .
Soon enough she 's going bonkers and it turns out that this is no woman after all ( shocker ) ... it 's Quaid in a mask !
Where the hell did Quaid even GET this crazy disguise !?
That 's what I really wanna know .
It surely was n't in the suitcase that was filled with goodies from earlier in the movie , so did he just pick it up at the " Freaky - Assed - Faces - R - Us " shop or what ?
Also , why did he choose this particular mask ?
Did he think it would n't stick out in a crowd ?
Call me crazy , but an ultra-creepy smiling lady with a cold stare is n't the way to go if you wanna play things quietly .
In the end , Quaid chucks the mask over to some of the security guys that are chasing him and it says " Get ready for a big surprise ! " then proceeds to explode .
Oh Quaid , you 're such a prankster !
# 7 : Kuato Lives !
So this is George ( played by Marshall Bell , who I 'll always remember as Coach Schneider , from Elm Street 2 , who got killed in the shower ) and he 's going to lead Quaid to the elusive Kuato - a mutant with psychic abilities who can help him remember things ... or at least figure out what he 's supposed to be doing on Mars .
Ok , so where exactly is this Kuato guy ?
George starts moaning in pain and we quickly realize that Kuato is inside of him !
Kuato is a mutant alien twin who emerges from George 's stomach at will , and man is he ugly .
He honestly looks like some evil devil baby straight out of a horror movie instead of some alien hero .
I 'd love to see Kuato go head - to - head with Belial from " Basket Case " .
That 'd be an epic battle of nasty looking , slimy conjoined twins if I 've ever seen one !
I should also note that Kuato was one hell of an impressive display of animatronics , requiring some fifteen people just to control all his movements .
So before he 's shot and killed by one of Cohaagen 's inside guys , Kuato uses his psychic powers to show Quaid the reactor down in the Martian mines .
With his dying breath , he tells Quaid to start the reactor and free Mars .
Thanks for the info Kuato , but we 're still gonna give you a closed - casket funeral .
No good deeds you perform can change our minds about that .
# 8 : One , Two , Three Boobs !
Yes , you knew this scene was going to be on the list .
How could it not be ?
Mary , the triple - boobed prostitute , is probably more famous than Total Recall itself .
I can only imagine how many times Lycia Naff ( the actress ) has been asked about whether or not she really has three boobs .
So Quaid travels to Venusville , the red - light district of Mars more or less , to find Melina in hopes that she can tell him more about what 's going on .
When he arrives though , he 's greeted by Mary , a mutant prostitute who is offering something a little bit more ...
As immature as it may sound , people could n't stop talking about her three boobs after the movie came out and to do this , if you bring up Total Recall in a conversation , somebody is bound to mention 'em .
But in watching this movie , I realized something that most people might 've not noticed .
Mary first appears to proposition Quaid .
Later on , she appears in another scene propositioning to Benny the cab driver who tells her , " Baby , you make me wish I had three hands ! " while groping her .
And finally , she appears in the scene where Richter and his men start attacking everybody in sight and he shoots her in the back .
So she has three separate on - screen topless appearances .
Three scenes .
Three boobs .
Coincidence ?
I think not .
# 9 : Adios Richter !
I do n't care what anybody says , Richter is the main bad guy in this movie , not Cohaagen .
Sure , he works for Cohaagen , but does anybody really care about that profiteer ?
No .
But Richter , played by the almighty Michael Ironside , is everything a bad guy should be .
Pissed off and ruthless .
A little earlier in the story , they have Quaid capture and they 're about to return him to his former evil self .
Richter , knowing Quaid wo n't remember a thing , punches him right in the face and then says " See you at the party . "
Unfortunately for him , Quaid had other plans .
Quaid manages to escape from the Rekall facility and heads down into the Martian mines to free Mars .
But before he can do that , Richter manages to catch up with him on an elevator and the two get into a fight .
Now I 'll be the first to admit , Michael Ironside , while he may be good at looking extremely pissed off , is not the kind of guy who could realistically stand toe - to - toe with Arnold Schwarzenegger in a fight .
Still , in the movie he holds his own for a little while , but then he gets knocked over the side of the elevator and tries to pull Quaid down with him .
Quaid quickly pulls his arms up just enough so they 're ripped completely off in between the elevator and the next floor .
As Richter falls to his armless death , Quaid throws down his two bloody arms and shouts " See you at the party , Richter ! "
But since this is Arnold we 're talking about , it sounds more like " See yoo at da pahty , Reektah ! "
It 's easily one of the most quoted lines from a movie already filled with all sorts o' fantastic one - liners .
# 10 : Bug Removal
Early in the movie , Richter and his crew are trying to track down Quaid .
Fortunately for them , they implanted a bug in Quaid 's head when he originally went to Rekall .
So all they have to do is look on their tracking screen to see exactly where he is .
But Quaid also left a message for himself on a little computer explaining how to get rid of said bug .
First thing he needed to do was wrap a wet towel around his head to distort the signal of the bug so he can buy himself enough time to remove it .
Now I 'm sure they could 've come up with many ways to distort the bug signal , but the writers clearly thought it would be funny to see Arnold with a wet towel wrapped around his head .
And you know something ?
They were absolutely right ... it 's 100 % awesome .
Anyway , in his message to himself , Quaid is told to jam the self - guiding bug removal mechanism way up into his nose until he hears a " crunch " .
After that , all he has to do is wait for it to grab onto the bug and then yank it out .
Sounds easy enough , but when you have a bug that 's larger than your eyeball embedded in your brain , pulling it out through your nasal cavity might prove to be difficult .
And whaddaya know , it is !
A killer display of animatronics work combined with Arnold 's trademark grunting noises easily makes this the most memorable scene in the entire movie if you ask me .
And having seen what Quaid went through to remove it , I can say with absolute certainty that if there was a bug implanted in my brain , I 'd just leave it there .
Some things just are n't worth the trouble .
And there you have it , the ten best things about the original Total Recall from 1990 .
In all honesty though , it was really hard narrowing down the movie to just ten moments since so much of it is memorable ( Arnold shouting " Scroooo Yooooo ! " for example ) .
Do yourself a favor and check it out if you 've never seen it before .
And if you have seen it before , are you sure you really saw it , or was a memory of the movie implanted in your brain ?
SEE YOO AT DA PAHTY REEKTAH !

University of Exeter biologists say that some female beetles often mate simply to quench their thirst and overcome dehydration .
The sexual imperative is provided by male beetles who produce unusually large ejaculates ( up to 10 percent of their body weight ) , tempting dehydrated females to accept sexual invitations simply to get hold of the water in the seminal fluid .
Published in Animal Behaviour , the study examined the behaviour of the beetleCallosobruchus maculates , a serious pest in warm climates .
Some females were given unlimited access to water while others were not and all the females were free to mate .
The researchers found that thirsty females mated 40 percent more frequently than those with free access to water .
The University of Exeter ’s Dr Martin Edvardsson explained that the female beetles can absorb the water in the seminal fluid through their reproductive tracts and need to mate less frequently the more water they take from each mating .
This is to a male ’s advantage , says Edvardsson , because the longer the female goes without mating with another male , the greater his chance of successful fertilization .
By transferring a large amount of water with the sperm , a male can help ensure his sperm has more time to fertilize the eggs without having to compete with the sperm from future matings .
“ The large ejaculates may have evolved because males can make it less beneficial for females to re-mate by providing them with a large amount of water , ” speculated Edvardsson .
Because there are always costs as well as benefits associated with mating , similar trade - offs are likely to be important in many species where males provide their mates with material resources .
“ The key thing , ” says Dr Edvardsson , “ is that the resource provided by males is less beneficial to females the more of it they already have , like water or food for example . ”

Jose Padilla is known worldwide as the man who plotted with Al Qaeda to detonate a radiological " dirty bomb " in a major US city .
He allegedly presented his plan to top Al Qaeda leaders Abu Zubaydah and 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
But according to US intelligence reports , both men doubted Mr. Padilla could pull off the attack .
For his part , Padilla told military interrogators that he never intended to carry it out .
The former Taco Bell employee made the proposal in early 2002 as a way to justify fleeing Pakistan to avoid being sent to combat US forces in Afghanistan , says a government account .
So is Padilla – whose terror conspiracy case could go to a Miami jury Wednesday – a committed Al Qaeda operative , or merely a big - talking mujahideen wannabe who ultimately wanted to go home ?
The answer to that question is important .
Padilla is n't a run -of - the - mill enemy combatant apprehended on a foreign battlefield .
He is a United States citizen , arrested on US soil , who was held in a military prison for 43 months and subjected to harsh interrogation techniques until he confessed .
Padilla was given due process to file a lawsuit challenging his treatment by the government .
But as an enemy combatant , he was stripped of every other constitutional protection and right , including the right to know that a constitutional challenge had been filed on his behalf .
Many legal scholars and intelligence experts say Padilla 's ordeal highlights the danger of a government that obtains information through secret , coercive means and then selectively releases some of it to justify its actions .
" This is the hallmark of an authoritarian state , " says Larry Johnson , a former State Department counterterrorism official and former analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency .
" At many of the points at which the government said ' dirty bomb , ' there was no opportunity to respond for the reason that Mr. Padilla was in solitary confinement and no lawyer had been able to talk to him about the charges , " says Diane Amann , visiting law professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
The release of some details about Padilla and the dirty - bomb plot was justified by administration officials as supporting the public interest .
But some information about Padilla and his interrogation must remain secret , officials say , to prevent revealing US intelligence sources and methods to Al Qaeda .
In the court of public opinion , Padilla stands convicted .
His name is almost synonymous with dirty bomber .
Yet , when it came time to put Padilla on trial , the government 's case in Miami included no mention of a dirty bomb .
In his trial , Padilla is accused of providing material support to a terror group by attending an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan .
Federal prosecutors are using a broad conspiracy charge to allege that Padilla was a willing participant in a global terror campaign to wage violent jihad by murdering , kidnapping , and maiming people .
Padilla denies it .
Although they seek a life sentence , prosecutors introduced no evidence of personal involvement by Padilla in planning or carrying out any specific terrorist plot or violent act .
There is a reason the government 's case is so thin , legal analysts say .
If prosecutors brought the dirty - bomb plot or other alleged illegal actions by Padilla into the Miami case , it would open the door for courtroom scrutiny of the government 's use of coercive interrogation techniques against Al Qaeda suspects , including Padilla .
And that would have taken jurors deep into the shadowy underside of America 's war on terror – a journey in Padilla 's case that wends its way from his cell on an isolated wing of the US Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston , S.C. , through covert CIA interrogation sites overseas to an alleged torture chamber in Morocco .
This is a part of the war on terror the Bush administration would rather keep quiet .
But details are emerging .
What they reveal is the aggressive – and at times , ruthless – pursuit of intelligence information , and the selective public release of some of that intelligence when it serves the administration 's goals .
Plot hit airwaves in 2002
The Padilla story burst into the national consciousness in June 2002 when then - Attorney General John Ashcroft interrupted a trip to Moscow to make a dramatic televised announcement .
" We have disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive ' dirty bomb , ' " he said .
Padilla was a " known terrorist " who had trained with Al Qaeda , studied how to wire explosives , and researched radiological dispersion devices , he told the world .
What he did n't say was that Padilla had been locked in a solitary confinement cell in New York City for the past month and that Padilla was only now being taken into military custody on the eve of a scheduled court hearing that would have required the government to legally justify Padilla 's continued detention .
Instead , President Bush declared Padilla an " enemy combatant " who posed a " continuing , present , and grave danger " to US national security .
The president said Padilla possessed intelligence information that could help prevent Al Qaeda attacks on the US .
Some officials offered a less dramatic take on the dirty - bomb plot than Mr. Ashcroft's .
Then - Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the CBS " Early Show " that Padilla was " in the very early stages of his planning . "
He added , " I do n't think there was actually a plot beyond some fairly loose talk . "
Nonetheless , the dirty - bomb announcement sent shock waves across the country and immediately helped justify the use of coercive interrogation techniques against Padilla , analysts say .
And it gave news reporters an irresistible tag line to link to Padilla 's name – " dirty bomber . "
The dirty - bomb stigma would later help the government battle constitutional challenges to Padilla 's military detention , according to many legal scholars .
And it helped rally public support for an array of tough counter - terror policies by feeding national anxiety about possible terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction .
Perhaps most important , these analysts say , the Padilla case presented US officials with a situation that resembled the often discussed " ticking time bomb " scenario .
Under this hypothetical plot , a terrorist has been captured after planting a ticking time bomb in a busy public location .
Officials face the moral dilemma of either using traditional noncoercive interrogation methods that can take hours , days , or weeks and risk the deaths of thousands of innocent people or resort to brutal tactics to quickly obtain information to discover and defuse the bomb .
Under the scenario , saving thousands of lives is viewed as the greater good that justifies using torture against the terrorist .
Mr. Bush has repeatedly stated that his administration does not use torture .
But he has also acknowledged that in certain instances harsh interrogation methods have been authorized and used to help protect the nation .
Although civil libertarians protested Padilla 's detention without charge , there was no significant public outcry .
Terror war innovation : long detention
The dirty - bomb allegation emerged from information obtained through a Bush administration innovation in the war on terror .
That innovation called for the open - ended detention of terror suspects to facilitate aggressive , prolonged interrogations .
The questioning was often accompanied by specially authorized harsh interrogation techniques , including isolation , sensory deprivation , and stress positions , among others , according to former interrogators .
No judge in an American courtroom could permit the introduction of information gathered under such coercive techniques , in part because they carry a high risk of producing unreliable results .
If the technique is coercive enough , a subject will say whatever it takes to make it stop , former interrogators say .
In addition , the rules of procedure and long - established constitutional protections forbid the use of coerced statements as evidence in a trial .
But the rules of the courtroom are not necessarily the rules of the interrogation room .
Senior Bush administration officials made clear that once an individual is classified as an enemy combatant , he is no longer entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions and the US Constitution .
Because Padilla was held in solitary confinement under secret conditions , no one was aware of what was happening to him .
The initial constitutional debate revolved around whether Padilla had a right to consult a lawyer or whether the government could hold him in isolation indefinitely .
In February 2004 , then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales told a meeting of the American Bar Association that citizens who take up arms against America do n't deserve legal counsel .
Any individual rights , he said , " must give way to the national security needs of this country to gather intelligence from captured enemy combatants . "
Mr. Gonzales added , " The stream of intelligence would quickly dry up if the enemy combatants were allowed contact with outsiders during the course of an ongoing debriefing .
The result would be the failure to uncover information that could prevent attacks , " he said .
" This is an intolerable cost , and we do not believe it is one required by the Constitution . "
Two months later , lawyers were arguing Padilla 's case before the US Supreme Court .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted to know if there was any check on the powers being claimed by the executive branch to collect intelligence through coercive interrogations .
" Suppose the executive says , ' Mild torture , we think , will help get this information ' ? " she asked .
" Some systems do that to get information . "
" Well , our executive doesn't , " said then - Deputy Solicitor General Paul Clement .
A few minutes later , Justice Antonin Scalia , an anchor on the court 's conservative wing , said he found nothing in his research to support Bush 's assertion of unchecked authority to wage the war on terror .
" It does n't say you can do whatever it takes to win the war , " he said .
His comment raised a huge red flag for the administration .
That evening , coincidentally , the CBS program " Sixty Minutes II " broadcast the first images of detainee abuses at Abu Ghraib in Iraq .
A month later , at the height of the Abu Ghraib scandal and with Padilla 's case pending at the Supreme Court , the Justice Department held a highly unusual press conference .
Officials announced that after two years of interrogation , Padilla had confessed to involvement in the dirty - bomb plot and other activities with Al Qaeda .
" We now know much of what Jose Padilla knows .
And what we have learned confirms that the president of the United States made the right call , " said James Comey , then deputy attorney general at the Justice Department .
Padilla 's Supreme Court case was dismissed by a 5 - to - 4 vote on a technicality .
The justices said Padilla 's lawyers should have filed their suit in South Carolina rather than New York .
Scalia provided the key fifth vote in a decision that effectively allowed the administration to continue to hold and question Padilla in the brig .
Padilla 's lawyers filed a new suit in South Carolina and , by 2005 , were again at the steps of the Supreme Court .
But rather than allow an airing of the issue at a high court that many analysts believe to be sympathetic to Padilla , the administration transferred him from military custody into the criminal - justice system .
With jury deliberations about to begin in Miami , legal scholars expect more major twists and turns in the Padilla saga .
Among moves to watch :
• If Padilla is acquitted , will the government try to return him to the brig ?
• If Padilla 's lawyers file a civil suit to try to get his military detention case before the Supreme Court again , will the government argue that such a suit must be immediately dismissed to avoid revealing state secrets ?
When Federal Bureau of Investigation agents first took Padilla into custody , administration officials thought they had nabbed an intelligence prize .
Five years later , legal and intelligence analysts say , these claims look increasingly hollow as the administration maneuvers to keep Padilla from having a meaningful day in court .
Its tactics are also keeping the public from knowing the truth about Padilla and the dirty - bomb plot , they say .
" You do n't go on the Internet and spend a day reading and become an expert on how to put together a dirty bomb , " says Mr. Johnson , the counterterrorism expert .
" I 'm not knocking folks who work at Taco Bell , but that 's not a place you 'd go to ramp up your skills " as a nuclear jihadist .

Plans to allow British scientists to create human - animal embryos are expected to be approved tomorrow by the government 's fertility regulator .
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority published its long - awaited public consultation on the controversial research yesterday , revealing that a majority of people were " at ease " with scientists creating the hybrid embryos .
Researchers want to create hybrid embryos by merging human cells with animal eggs , in the hope they will be able to extract valuable embryonic stem cells from them .
The cells form the basic building blocks of the body and are expected to pave the way for revolutionary therapies for diseases such as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and even spinal cord injuries .
The consultation papers were released ahead of the authority 's final decision on the matter , which will mark the end of almost a year of intense lobbying by scientists and a fervent campaign by organisations opposed to research involving embryonic stem cells .
Using animal eggs will allow researchers to push ahead unhindered by the shortage of human eggs .
Under existing laws , the embryos must be destroyed after 14 days when they are no bigger than a pinhead , and cannot be implanted into the womb .
Opponents of the research and some religious groups say the work blurs the distinction between humans and animals , and creates embryos that are destined to be destroyed when stem cells are extracted from them .
Two research groups based at King 's College London and Newcastle University have already applied to the HFEA to create animal - human embryos , but their applications have been on hold since November last year amid confusion over whether the authority was legally able to issue licences .
If the authority approves the research , the applications will go forward to a committee , with a decision on both due within three months .
Professor Ian Wilmut , whose team cloned Dolly the sheep , is waiting for the HFEA 's decision before applying to create hybrid embryos to study motor neurone disease with Professor Chris Shaw at the Institute of Psychiatry in London .
The consultation , a £ 150,000 , three - month mix of opinion polls , public meetings and debates , found participants were initially cautious of merging animal and human material , but became more positive .
" When further factual information was provided and further discussion took place , the majority of participants became more at ease with the idea , " the HFEA 's report says .
Most support was expressed for the creation of so - called cytoplasmic hybrid embryos , in which a human cell is inserted into an empty animal egg .
Other hybrid embryos , such as those created by fertilising an animal egg with human sperm , or vice versa , were less well supported .
In December , the government sparked a revolt by scientists , patient groups and medical researchers when it published a white paper containing proposals to outlaw almost all research into animal - human embryos .
The research has since been backed by Nobel prizewinners , the Medical Research Council , the Wellcome Trust , the Commons science and technology committee , and the government 's chief science adviser , Sir David King .
In May , the government withdrew its opposition in a draft fertility bill and now seeks to outlaw only embryos created by mixing sperm and eggs from humans and animals .
The bill will be put before parliament before the end of the year .
Martin Rees , president of the Royal Society , said : " The HFEA 's consultation reveals welcome recognition of the potential of this research , [ with ] 61 % of the general public agreeing with the creation of human - animal embryos , if it may help understand diseases , with only a quarter opposed to this research . "

Snowe signs onto to withdrawal bill Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Republican Sen. Olympia
Snowe has signed on as cosponsor to a Democratic bill that will require troops to leave Iraq by the end of April 2008 , she said in a statement provided to RAW STORY .
The Maine senator , who was among the first Republicans to break with President Bush over the war , said she is supporting the withdrawl measure because the Iraqi government is failing to meet its political benchmarks and it is unfair to keep US troops in harms way for the sake of a government unwilling to affect reconciliation .
Snowe is signing on to an amendment sponsored by Sens. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , and Jack Reed , D - R.I. , that would begin a redeployment of US troops out of Iraq within 120 days .
The legislation aims to have all but a small number of troops out of the country by April 30 .
" We have arrived at the crossroads of hope and reality , and we must now address the reality , " Snowe said in a prepared statement .
" We need to send a strong message from the United States Congress on behalf of the American people that the current strategy is unacceptable and that we must move in a different course . "
This morning , according to a local Maine television station , " Maine 's senior senator is indicating that she may break ranks and line up with Democrats in support of legislation to require a troop withdrawal from Iraq to begin within 120 days . "
A vote is expected next week .
While nearly all Democrats support the measure , it still lacks the 60 votes required to defeat a filibuster .
ThinkProgress has a CNN video reporting Snowe 's decision here .
The moderate Republican visited Iraq most recently in May of this year , the Washington Post reported Sunday .
" It was infinitely worse , in spite of the surge and the additional troops , " she told the paper .
" I 've been to war zones .
You know when it 's working and when it is n't , and really , it was an ironclad shutdown . "
Snowe introduced legislation in May that would have called for limits on the US mission in Iraq if the Iraqi government failed to meet political benchmarks , she said .
 We are past non-binding resolutions but we are also not abandoning the mission in Iraq , " Snowe said in her statement Wednesday .
" We can not continue to keep our brave military men and women on the front lines if the Iraqi government is unwilling to put national interests above their own sectarian interests .
Full statement from Sen. Snowe : #
 We have arrived at the crossroads of hope and reality , and we must now address the reality .
We need to send a strong message from the United States Congress on behalf of the American people that the current strategy is unacceptable and that we must move in a different course .
As I have stated for months and underscored in the bipartisan legislation I introduced in May , if the Iraqi government failed meet the political benchmarks necessary for success than we would transition to a more tailored mission in Iraq , one that does not limit our ability to counter Al Qaeda operations in the region , and redeploy the remaining forces .
The proposal by Senator Levin is a continuation of what I laid out in my legislation that focuses on counterterrorism operations , protecting U.S. and Coalition personnel and assets in the field , training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces and coordinating a multifaceted strategy to encourage neighboring nations to help bring stability to Iraq .
 The surge was designed to provide breathing room for the Iraqi government to initiate the political objectives for national reconciliation and make the political concessions among all parties .
Regrettably , the Iraqi government has failed to achieve or make any measurable progress on any of the objectives .
 We are past non-binding resolutions but we are also not abandoning the mission in Iraq .
We cannot continue to keep our brave military men and women on the front lines if the Iraqi government is unwilling to put national interests above their own sectarian interests . #

At times like this we need all the friends we can get , quite a few of whom these days will be on Zoom or Skype .
Similarly , for a few years after I discovered Time Goes By and when I got this gig , I could count Ronni as the best friend I had never met .
That all changed of course when Norma , the Assistant Musicologist and I visited Oregon ( a couple of times ) and stayed with her in Lake Oswego .
Here are some friends songs .
RAL DONNER was cursed by having a voice that was uncannily like Elvis’s .
I bet all those Elvis impersonators wish they could claim the same thing .
Ral was never an impersonator , indeed he really hated it when it was pointed out to him ( which was quite often ) .
See what you think when he sings Girl of my Best Friend .
♫ Ral Donner - Girl Of My Best Friend
MIKE MCCLELLAN would be a super - star if he lived in a bigger country .
Well , he is here in Australia .
Mike recorded several albums in the seventies and eighties , but they have been deleted .
There are a couple of collection CDs as well as several more recent albums , but it ’s still difficult to source his early music unless you have the vinyls .
From that early period , here is a song he still performs quite often , Lovers Never Wind up Friends .
♫ Mike McClellan - Lovers Never Wind Up Friends
Quite coincidentally , I discovered Larry McMurtry ’s book , All My Friends are Going to be Strangers , around the same time that I first heard MERLE HAGGARD perform ( My Friends Are Gonna Be ) Strangers .
I assume for Merle there was a bit of tongue in cheek going on as his backing band was called The Strangers .

After his initial success as a pop star and member of a Doowop group DION DiMucci turned into a fine blues and folk performer .
One of the first albums of his that demonstrated that was “ Sit Down Old Friend ” .
Here is the song Sit Down Old Friend .
♫ Dion - Sit Down Old Friend
PERCY SLEDGE is probably best known for one song and what a great song that is .
It ’s not the one we have today , however .
There was a lot more to him than that one .
Besides being one of the finest soul singers , he was also a bluesman of note as this shows on My Old Friend the Blues , from the album with the same name .
♫ Percy Sledge - My Old Friend The Blues
On the surface .
JIMMY BUFFETT seems to be the friendliest musician around .
I hope he ’s really like that .
From one of his early good albums ( most of his early albums were good ) , “ Son of a Son of a Sailor ” Jimmy tells us about his African Friend .

By far the most critically successful and popular band in Australia in the seventies was SKYHOOKS .
They liked to dress up in outlandish costumes but their musicianship was impeccable .
Besides that they , thanks to main songwriter Greg Macainsh , addressed issues about Australian suburban life , particularly Melbourne whence they hailed .
The song All My Friends Are Getting Married is more laid back then their usual fare .
♫ Skyhooks - All My Friends Are Getting Married
From easily their finest studio album , “ American Beauty ” , the GRATEFUL DEAD want to be a Friend of the Devil .
Of course , although they only recorded two or three good studio albums , their milieu was live performances at which they excelled .
As they are no more , it ’s good that there are a number of fine live recordings .
“ A number ” ?
I would n’t be surprised if every concert they ever performed is out there somewhere .
Anyway , here ’s the song , with Phil Lesh playing bass as the lead instrument .
♫ Grateful Dead - Friend Of The Devil
HERMAN'S HERMITS came from Manchester ( not far from Liverpool ) at the height of Beatlemania .
Unlike most of their contemporaries , they were a straight pop band and had a clean cut image – they did n’t frighten parents the way other bands at the time did .
In spite of that ( or maybe because of it ) they produced really fine pop songs , most of which still hold up today , including My Sentimental Friend .
♫ Herman's Hermits - My Sentimental Friend
The members of the NITTY GRITTY DIRT BAND must be friends as they ’ve been together with little change to their lineup since the sixties .
They have even recorded a song along that line called Partners , Brothers and Friends .
Here it is .
♫ NGDB - Partners Brothers And Friends
Back around 1970 , I discovered a record by SPIDER JOHN KOERNER and WILLIE MURPHY .
This is a really wonderful album and in keeping with the theme of the column , my friends thought so too .
The album is called “ Running Jumping Standing Still ” and I now have it on CD so it might still be around somewhere .
It ’s the only thing they did together and it ’s a collection folk - blues , ragtime piano , country and even a little jazz thrown in for good measure .
In keeping with our category , their song is Friends and Lovers .
Spider John sings the lead on it .

There is one song I ’m sure you were all expecting , but as you can see , I did n’t include it .
I expect that there will be comments about that .

For example , the fact that we shift our weight using our bodies and especially our arms in order to balance was very important in getting ASIMO 's walking mechanism right .
The fact that we have toes that help with our balance was also taken into consideration : ASIMO actually has soft projections on its feet that play a similar role to the one our toes play when we walk .
This soft material also absorbs impact on the joints , just as our soft tissues do when we walk .
ASIMO has hip , knee , and foot joints .
Robots have joints that researchers refer to as " degrees of freedom . "
A single degree of freedom allows movement either right and left or up and down .
ASIMO has 34 degrees of freedom spread over different points of its body in order to allow it to move freely .
There are three degrees of freedom in ASIMO 's neck , seven on each arm and six on each leg .
The number of degrees of freedom necessary for ASIMO 's legs was decided by measuring human joint movement while walking on flat ground , climbing stairs and running .

ASIMO also has a speed sensor and a gyroscope sensor mounted on its body .
They perform the tasks of :
sensing the position of ASIMO 's body and the speed at which it is moving
relaying adjustments for balance to the central computer
These sensors work similarly to our inner ears in the way they maintain balance and orientation .
ASIMO also has floor surface sensors in its feet and six ultrasonic sensors in its midsection .
These sensors enhance ASIMO 's ability to interact with its environment by detecting objects around ASIMO and comparing gathered information with maps of the area stored in ASIMO 's memory .
To accomplish the job our muscles and skin do in sensing muscle power , pressure and joint angles , ASIMO has both joint - angle sensors and a six - axis force sensor .
Unless you know a lot about robotics , you may not fully grasp the incredible milestone it is that ASIMO walks as we do .
The most significant part of ASIMO 's walk is the turning capabilities .
Rather than having to stop and shuffle , stop and shuffle , and stop and shuffle into a new direction , ASIMO leans and smoothly turns just like a human .
ASIMO can also self - adjust its steps in case it stumbles , is pushed , or otherwise encounters something that alters normal walking .
In order to accomplish this , ASIMO 's engineers had to find a way to work with the inertial forces created when walking .
For example , the earth 's gravity creates a force , as does the speed at which you walk .
Those two forces are called the " total inertial force . "
There is also the force created when your foot connects with the ground , called the " ground reaction force . "
These forces have to balance out , and posture has to work to make it happen .
This is called the " zero moment point " ( ZMP ) .
To control ASIMO 's posture , engineers worked on three areas of control :
Floor reaction control means that the soles of the feet absorb floor unevenness while still maintaining a firm stance .
Target ZMP control means that when ASIMO can't stand firmly and its body begins to fall forward , it maintains position by moving its upper body in the direction opposite the impending fall .
At the same time , it speeds up its walking to quickly counterbalance the fall .
Foot - planting location control kicks in when the target ZMP control has been activated .
It adjusts the length of the step to regain the right relationship between the position and speed of the body and the length of the step .
This looks like a job for ASIMO !
Although ASIMO is n't quite ready for prime time ( there are still improvements that need to be made to allow it to fully function as Honda hopes ) , Honda has put ASIMO to work as a receptionist in its office in Wako in Saitama prefecture , just north of Tokyo .
ASIMO spends its time greeting guests and leading them around the facilities .
To perform these duties , ASIMO has to be specially programmed to know the layout of the buildings and the appropriate way to greet visitors and answer questions .
If the thought of an army of ASIMO robots gives you the heebie jeebies , you can relax .
Honda says that ASIMO will never be used in military applications .
In repressive Burma , the festival of Thingyan or New Year is the only time residents can let their hair down , dousing each other with water pistols as temperatures soar .
With windows tightly closed , in the midst of a military convoy , we were hurtled through it , having being handed an extraordinary invitation to attend one of the junta 's cabinet meetings .
It was 2003 and beside us was Colonel Tin Hlaing , then home minister , who turned to face us and said : " I 'm having a party at home later .
Come over and play Thingyan [ water pistols ] .
It 'll be fun . "
This seemingly affable figure was the same colonel who had led the suppression of the 1988 democracy movement in which thousands were killed .
This was one of many days of surreal encounters with a regime that had decided to take us off a visa blacklist reserved for journalists who had been critical of them , and lure us back with an invitation to question its leaders .
Our reception demonstrated the difficulties in dealing with the regime .
As soon as we landed we were held for seven days by military intelligence .
There is no cohesive Burmese government , only pools of influence that frequently drown each other out , some backed by senior generals , others leaning towards the Military Intelligence ( MI ) faction , and yet more clinging to the vestiges of power retained by military commanders with postings in the strategically important border region or mineral rich states of Upper Burma .
The daily New Light of Myanmar newspaper offered clues to how this power struggle was playing out , as the order in which the generals appeared in its front page reflected who momentarily had the upper hand , the only permanent faces being Senior General Than Shwe , chairman of the State Peace and Development Council , the official name of the regime ; Khin Nyunt , the SPDC's Secretary 1 and MI chief ; and Maung Aye , Burma 's army chief .
Finally , our sponsors in the home ministry regained some leverage and whisked us to a hall arranged with heavy teak thrones .
The cabinet trooped in , Col Tin Hlaing the first to come over : " Is n't this strange , us meeting like this ? " he cackled in perfect English .
The foreign minister , Win Aung , the junta 's sole civilian member , spoke next .
Since 1998 , he had defended Burma 's record to the west .
" We are constantly misrepresented , " he said .
" You only ever read that we 're a narco - state but we 've made a commitment to be drug - free and you can shoot me if we do n't comply . "
Colonel Thein Nyunt , the border affairs minister , stood : " We are always described as dictators .
But we are not power - hungry people - we 're just human beings .
We are not here to stay .
Democracy is not in question . "
It went on for hours , as one after the other read from statements .
Democracy was described as an objective , for when the country had matured .
Within 18 months , Win Aung had been sacked before being jailed .
Next to fall were the agriculture minister , transport minister and deputy foreign minister .
In October 2004 , Khin Nyunt , recently appointed prime minister , was arrested too .
A month later , Col Tin Hlaing , a Khin Nyunt loyalist , was gone .
Khin Nyunt 's rise had been ensured by his close relationship to Burma 's greatest contemporary dictator , Ne Win , who had seized control of the country in 1962 .
However , in 2002 Ne Win died , leaving Khin Nyunt vulnerable .
In October 2004 the military arrested him , accusing him of taking bribes .
Khin Nyunt 's MI headquarters were raided .
With him gone Than Shwe and Maung Aye became paranoid .
Watching regime change in Iraq , they moved the government to Pyinmana in 2005 .
They began to fight each other as corruption soared and the economy collapsed , driving monks on to the street , an arc of events that could be torn from the pages of not so distant Burmese history .
When the monarch King Mindon Min lay dying in 1878 , his wife began jockeying to secure the throne for Prince Thibaw , her stepson , perhaps the least impressive of 82 possible successors .
She placed a discreet order for velvet from a French weaver who worked at court .
On the night of February 15 , assassins chased down Thibaw 's fraternal rivals , bagging them in the sacks and beating them to death .
It was sacrilege to spill the blood of Burmese aristocrats but the velvet absorbed it , allowing Thibaw to ascend to the throne .
Today , the military is beginning to do the same to its people , coming by night and at dawn to take an unknown number of protesters to places where we will never see their blood being spilled .
Back in the good old days , role - playing games were printed in soft cover booklets and came came boxed for their protection .
I have a bunch of these boxes , not all of them in the best of shape .
My most coveted being a fine condition original boxed set of Empire of the Petal Throne from 1973 , but I digress .
I was going through the boxes the other day , taking inventory and dreaming of playing , when I found this old catalog .
Its the sum of what the grand - daddy of role playing , TSR , had to offer in 1980 / 1981 and it needed to be shared .
It is awesome .
The cover to this catalog is amazing .
I knew about most of the products here already , but I loved the art .
It typifies the aesthetic of the time .
The hand drawn doorway and funky font surrounding the books .
This sort of stuff inspired a lot of poor imitations on school notebooks .
The early illustrated cover boxes for Basic and Expert Sets were wonderfully evocative .
In a weird twist , I had the expert set before I got my basic set .
Isle of Dread was and is still one of my favorite modules and certainly my favorite X adventure .
Of the B modules , I really enjoy The Palace of the Silver Princess .
I use it often with new players and have updated it for every system I have played .
I do n’t believe it is a perfect adventure , but it has the right flavor and is easy to insert into any fantasy setting .
Every book on this page is amazing .
I spent hours pouring through them .
The new rule sets , the illustrations , the font , once I went to AD&D , I never looked back .
Always had a soft spot for these screens , even though I switched to later versions .
I eventually bought most of these on clearance over the years , but for the most part my character sheets and logs were handmade .
The Rogues Gallery is underrated as an aid and helped me develop my own set of pre-canned randoms .
I have proudly either ran or played in ever one of these modules .
Tomb of Horrors is certainly the most difficult .
Built to slay .
I like running The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan and really enjoyed my time played as a dwarf in the G series .
I never owned a single one of these games as a kid .
I did by Dungeon !
a few years ago , but have yet to play it .
I played a lot of Top Secret and Gamma World .
We played Boot Hill briefly , but eventually switch to another old west system called Desperado .
I do n’t remember why .
Never played Fight in the Skies , but my friends and I made up an RPG system based on WWI aerial combat .
Not a ton of opportunity for roleplaying , but we had a lot of fun with our d6 based combat .
Love the art on these games .
I owned The Awful Green Things from Outer Space .
It was fun , but we did n’t play it much .
I could write a love letter to Fiend Folio .
In my game closet , I think I have 5 copies of it .
It felt new and exotic , while being very familiar at the same time .
As a DM , I think the best part of owning it was being able to throw monsters at my players that they had never heard of .
If you want to play in Greyhawk , the World of Greyhawk is the perfect place to start .
Before I developed my own world , I used Greyhawk and never really made the move to the Forgotten Realms when it was released .
Although I do enjoy the world building of the Forgotten Realms and they have released some great novels set there .
I burned through a lot of Dragon Dice in my day and still have the chipped remains of many sets .
LOVE Dragon Magazine .
It was always filled with thought - provoking articles and gave you a sense of community .
For my money though , Dungeon magazine was the better investment .
I have every issue of Dungeon and a heck of a lot of Dragon .
Never got to GENCON , even though I desperately wanted to go .
As you can see here , they held GENCON EAST in Cherry Hill , NJ .
To be so close , but yet so far really hurt .
Why these shirts have not been reprinted to death is beyond me .
I want all of them and they
Here is the order form for the shirts .
6 bucks a shirt !
Including shipping !
What a bargain .
That would be $ 15.10 nowadays , which would still be worth it .
Finally here is the Index of the catalog .
Not very exciting , but I like the font .

Top Democrat claims ' overwhelmingly positive ' response to move to defund the Vice President Michael Roston
Published : Monday June 25 , 2007 Print This Email This
While some would argue that Dick Cheney has sought unlimited power for his office in President George W. Bush 's White House , the Vice President could soon be facing some major limits on his government bank account .
A top House Democrat has announced his intention to offer an amendment to strip funding from the yearly budget for the Office of the Vice President .
" On the Hill , there 's an overwhelmingly positive reaction , " a spokesman for Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) told RAW STORY Monday afternoon .
He went on , " This is an important amendment and question , and it's a choice that the Vice President should make .
He can not be allowed to accept executive branch funding and not adhere to executive branch rules .
There is no fourth branch of government . "
On Saturday , RAW STORY 's Josh Catone first reported on Emanuel 's planned amendment to the Financial Services Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 .
Emanuel announced his plan in reaction to the House Oversight Committee 's revelation last week that Cheney 's office had argued that for the purposes of certain laws , the Vice President 's office was not an agency in the executive branch .
Multiple Democratic Congressional staffers told RAW STORY that the bill will come up for a vote on Wednesday or Thursday .
And staff for Rep. Emanuel , who is the chairman of the Democratic Caucus in the House of Representatives , believed he would have the votes to shrink the Vice President 's budget to zero .
Emanuel 's amendment could inject some excitement into a droll funding bill that normaly gets scant attention on an annual basis .
The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill , in addition to funding the White House , covers the budgets of the Supreme Court , the Treasury Department , the District of Columbia , and a variety of other independent government agencies .
In the FY 2008 budget , which was approved last week , the House Appropriations Committee stated without any controversy that it " recommends an appropriation of $ 4,432,000 for the Office of the Vice President , the same as fiscal year 2007 level and the amount requested by the President . "
RAW STORY was awaiting reply from the office of Rep. Jose Serrano , who chairs the Financial Services Subcommittee and will likely direct the debate on the spending bill , to see if he would support Emanuel 's effort .
But there appeared to be no obvious procedural barrier to the Illinois Democrat 's move .
The defunding of the Vice President 's office could also get some support from Democrats in the Senate .
" That might not be a bad idea , " Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) said on Fox News Sunday , according to the New York Daily News , when asked if defunding the Vice President was an option that would be considered when the Senate receives the House 's version of the budget bill .
How the White House will react if Cheney is defunded by Congress is still up for grabs .
In Monday 's Daily Press Briefing , White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino was asked " Does the White House then also believe he should get funding for the vice president 's office from the legislative branch instead of from the executive branch ? "
" I do n't know , " she responded before arguing it was a constitutional question she could n't answer .
Andy Hampsten , the former pro cyclist , the only American ever to win the Tour of Italy , the first American ever to win the grueling Alpe d’Huez stage of the Tour de France , does his best to discourage casual riders from signing up for the cycling trips he leads in Tuscany .
“ All of our trips are designed to satisfy experienced riders , ” Mr. Hampsten writes on his Web site .
To train , he suggests , “ you should ride at least 100 miles a week for at least 6 to 10 weeks ” on routes with “ as many hills as you can find . ”
So I had an image of what our fellow cyclists would look like when my husband , son and I arrived in Castagneto Carducci for a cycling vacation .
They would look like Mr. Hampsten , who at age 45 remains boyishly thin and agile , bouncing with energy .
I was wrong .
For the most part , our group consisted of ordinary - looking , mostly middle - age men and a few middle - age women .
The popular BitTorrent tracker The Pirate Bay just launched bergmanbits.com , a tribute to Ingmar Bergman , the legendary Swedish film director , who passed away yesterday .
The site lists all the movies he directed , and . torrent links are available for most of them .
Ingmar Bergman was a source of inspiration to other well know flim directors such as Woody Allen , Stanley Kubrick , and Lars Von Trier and he received three Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film .
Ingmar Bergman died yesterday at the age of 89 , something that did n’t go unnoticed by The Swedish Pirate Bay .
On bergmanbits.com we read :
“ As big fans of Bergman ’s work , we decided to make a tribute site to the films he created and we all love .
We want to help people share these works and hope that even though Ingmar is no longer with us more people will experience the films and enjoy them as much as we have . ”
The Pirate Bay and friends are know for their responses to recent events .
Earlier this year they launched Oscartorrents , with links to all the Academy Award nominees , and EurovisionTorrents , a similar project for the Eurovision song contest .
OscarTorrents , the pirate alternative for the Academy Awards turned out to be a great success with Pan ’s Labyrinth as the big winner .

もしかして Google の持っている大規模日本語データって、著作権者は
Google じゃないんでは。いや、実際どういうデータを公開するのか知らないけど、その辺の権利関係も明確にしてから公開するんならすごいな。
多くの方が危惧されているように，Webデータの著作権はGoogleにはないので，オリジナルの文章を再現できないことという前提条件の下，元の文章を機械的に処理した上で日本語コーパスデータとして公開するようです．
大規 模Webデータといっても，かなり学術的なデータになるようで，言語処理やそこに関わる研究分野としては，今までになかった*1「書き言葉・話し言葉」での大規模なコーパスデータは歓迎できるものではないでしょうか．これによって，新しくおもしろい研究が生まれるといいですね．

Funny what you find when you go through the old boxes in the garage when you are moving house .
An early piece of Internet history that never made it off the drawing board but was an early browser / iPhone / laptop combination device .
Keyboardless , with the facility to download pages , navigate links , have bookmarks and be a mass market consumer product that allowed people to view custom news .
We take this for granted with Digg and the likes today , browsers and hi-tech phones .
However , this proposal was put together in 1989 and drafted as a patent application in April 1990 , in the days even before a proposal by Tim Berners - Lee for research into a hypertext project .
Also in 1990 , it was almost a year away ( 13 March 1991 ) before Digital even launched their own PCs .
The story of this project kind of began at University in the mid 1980s .
I did n't particularly much like command line driven operating systems and on the University VAX was always writing programs to isolate myself from the command line , perform meta commands and make life simpler .
One relic of that time which is still running 23 years later is I did n't like the cold way the computer told the time , so I changed it to conversational English , then into conversational Scots Gaelic , it was posted to usenet in 1993 .
When I joined Digital in 1987 , it was more of the same command line driven tools which were frequently extended .
About the only remaining tool I wrote from that time was a way of doing secure copies between machines , posted to usenet many years later in 1993 .
So having got fed up with simple commands , the introduction to windows in about 1988 or so was a progressive step I welcomed .
Initially it was DECwindows , then X Windows .
Of particular interest was an application called Bookreader , which was an online help system with hyperlinks .
I thought this had a lot of potential .
Looking back , the period 1989 - 1992 for me was clearly one of those periods I would certainly class under the " well I could have been a multi billionaire by now if I had seen the full potential of those ideas . " .
First off there was 1989 , winning an award from Shell Livewire and appearing in the local papers with a " computer based automatic job matching service " , 4 years ahead of the first to launch , Jobserve .
although to be fair the ESPC I mentioned in the business plan already had a computerised matching service in the 1980s for houses .
Then there was PageLink in 1990 , an award from Digital 's founder Ken Olsen , and a personalised view of the daily news ( not quite a blog but getting there ) first published the same day as Tim 's paper .
Those days , two things prevented me from going it alone .
One was that I had been headhunted by a group within Digital in the USA and was trying to relocate there so did n't want to put down too many roots in the UK and the other was that the spirit of the net back then and indeed much of what I chose to do was to have good non commercial ideas and give them away .
The first was campaigning for smoke free areas in pubs ( came to pass eventually 17 years later ) , then the " news from Scotland " publication , then setting up the UK 's first guide to getting online in 1992 , a listing in e-mail addresses of the rich and famous followed by writing the FAQ for the soc.culture.celtic and soc.culture .scottish newsgroups , still going strong .
Looking back and especially at the size of my ( very large ! ) mortgage now , I think I might have been better doing things that earned a bit more money but there you go .
Pagelink and the UK Internet List were both written in Reading , England , maybe the houses get a blue plaques one day :- P
So to the patent .
The research for what would have been the net 's first job matching service in 1989 ( the business plan I still have makes interesting reading talking about using email to the general public ! ) had got me interested and not long after this Digital had been looking for ways to up its profits because it was in decline due to the rise of the PC .
They launched an employee involvement scheme to improve the company 's effectiveness so I suggested an idea in two parts .
1 . making use of the military grade security they had to securely run two operating systems on one piece of hardware .
2 . Renting out one of the operating systems to the general public and making use of Digital 's 50,000 strong computing network ( then the world 's largest private network ) to make some money ( ie a commercial SETI ) .
The kudos of getting an award from Ken Olsen , not long after Fortune had called him " the most successful entrepreneur in the history of American business " for that idea got me thinking when the next scheme came along and that was sponsorship for patentable ideas .
So there I was using the Bookreader software , interested in patents , rather bored of my job configuring networks and waiting for my work visa for the US to come through .
The idea of being able to view pages of documents around the house , save paper and navigate them in a new hypertext style was appealing .
I proposed the idea as a patent and it was met with encouragement .
The plan then changed to make more of the emphasis on hardware so it became bundled as a hardware device supported by software .
After progressing to that stage , the ongoing problems at DEC then caused a departmental reorganisation and the person sponsoring my idea was moved elsewhere .
His replacement said the idea was " pie in the sky " and would n't back it .
Remember this was coming from a company where even the PC was treated as a waste of time for years .
Shortly after this patent application stalled , my plans for going to the US changed .
Deciding to remain in the UK my efforts were then spent promoting the Internet .
Having first gained access in 1983 , I remember promoting in 1987 the virtues of the Internet to a PhD computing student at Cambridge University .
So when I came to leave Digital in 1992 and knowing I would be remaining in the UK , I set up the UK internet list - a small piece of history as the UKs first guide to getting online and a guide that was especially designed to eliminate " pay per message " charges and replace them with flat fees .
What happened in parallel was that another colleague left DEC to join ICL and later told me about a " new service called Jobserve " that was set up by two ICL colleagues and seemed to be doing quite well ( later to become the UKs most profitable company ) .
Also in parallel , a friend from high school , John Giannandrea had made his career from Dunblane High School where we both had a common interest in computing and had followed the course I had tried to take and had got a job in the US .
He later became Chief Technology Officer for a little known startup that was Netscape .
Two years prior to the netscape floatation I wanted to know what was happening with hypertext and I wrote " Xmosaic allows a hypertext document to have links to files on machines across the world .
This technology is very exciting .... " .
Too right .
If only I had been in California rather than back in Edinburgh where famously my Linked In connection Ian Ritchie was turning down Tim Berners - Lee 's request to commercialise the browser .
So the PageLink device did n't move forward .
Jobserve took off , Netscape took off and as for me well I ended up launching the UK internet list as a result , going back to University to come first in the UKs first degree in Object Technology , invented a broken link preventor , got some management interviews with Google , Amazon and Tesco.com and now work as an independent consultant .
So I got some kudos and others got the big bucks .
I still have great ideas , so anyone looking to back the next big idea ( rated as " the next Google " ) please get in touch ...
All that remains of the proposal in 1990 was these papers in the garage and a copy I think on an old TK50 tape that probably can't be read anymore even if I could find it .
So these are the scanned in pages ( sorry for the images ) that I found .
Some interesting highlights include :
Page browsing , following links , phone functionality ( fax ) , shaped like a laptop ( more than a year before DECs first PC ) , no keyboard ( like iPhone ) , store bookmarks ( like Netscape ) , etc .
Other comments such as personalised news ( digg , etc ) are mentioned as of course the revolution in advertising which would follow ( Google , etc )
I was going to write more and tidy this page up , etc but the iPod touch launch made me think that sticking this page up today would be relevant .
More than 17 years later , the consumer finally has a portable touch screen mass market web browser .
Plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose .
This is n't meant to be any particular claim to fame or detract from anyone elses work , as any academic and / or researcher will accept ( and was the basis for the original google model ) we build on the works of others , and others will follow after us and build on our work .
This simply represents a snapshot of time and some early browser history from 1990 that until now has laid in a box in a garage gathering dust and it is perhaps of interest to historians and researchers of that time as to what was going on then and how long it has taken for some of these ideas to be brought to market .
Sorry this has turned into a longer introduction than expected , memories from long ago sometimes do that .
A witness said the Mahdi Army took over police headquarters
Another 500 troops will now pull back from Saddam Hussein 's former palace , their only remaining base in the city .
In future , British forces will be based at an air station just outside Basra .
The MoD said Basra does not have the heavy fighting experienced in Baghdad and Iraqi forces are demonstrating that they can take the lead in the city .
Confused reports
The MoD said in a statement : " There had been a small presence up to now of British forces in the PJCC ( Provincial Joint Coordination Centre ) for the support and mentoring of Iraqi police .
" Last night these forces were moved from the PJCC in the framework of the plan for the handover of the Basra Palace to Iraqi control , though British forces currently remain at the palace base . "
Between 50 to 60 British troops and Iraqi police were based at the police headquarters , while around 500 UK service personnel remain at Basra Palace .
The overnight withdrawal led to confused reports about who now controlled the police headquarters .
Shia flag
The British military spokesman in Basra has dismissed reports that Shia militia men from the Mahdi Army took over the base after British forces passed control to Iraqi police last night .
Witnesses told the Associated Press the Mahdi Army emptied the building taking generators , computers , furniture and even cars .
Major Michael Shearer told the BBC News website that officers from the Multi-National Force spoke to the local Iraqi Army commander who " assured us that the PJCC is under his control and being efficiently run by the Iraqi Army .
He also stated that all the equipment remains within the PJCC " .
An MoD spokesman said there was a green Shia flag flying on the building , but not the black flag associated with the Mahdi Army .
There are now about 5,500 UK troops in Iraq - mostly based at Basra Airport .

Three people have been killed in an explosion , during a test of rocket systems to be used in Richard Branson 's proposed space tourism ventures .
Three other people were severely injured in what was described as a major blast at the Mojave Air and Space Port facility in California .
All those killed and injured worked for Scaled Composites , the private venture run by aerospace designer Burt Rutan , whose SpaceShipOne became the first private manned rocket to reach space .
The blast , shortly after 2:30 pm yesterday ( 10.30 pm UK time ) , happened during testing work on a rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo , which is being designed and built by Scaled for Mr Branson 's proposed Virgin Galactic space tourism venture .
The company plans to offer commercial trips into space for tourists costing around £ 100,000 a head on SpaceShipTwo , which will carry six passengers and two pilots .
The president of Virgin Galactic , Will Whitehorn , expressed the company 's sympathies to the families but would not comment further until Scaled had completed its investigation .
According to Mr Rutan , the explosion happened during tests of the flow of pressured nitrous oxide through an injector .
The company uses nitrous oxide as an oxidiser in its rockets , providing the oxygen that rocket fuel needs to burn .
The cause of the blast was a mystery , a highly emotional Mr Rutan told a press conference at the former military airport .
" We were doing a test we believe was safe .
We do n't know why it exploded .
We just do n't know , " he said .
Scaled uses part of the isolated airport , a former US air force base , as a testing facility for its space ventures .
A number of other companies - including other commercial space ventures - used the Mojave facility for testing , said Stuart Witt , the airport 's general manager .
" What we do is inherently risky , " he said .
" These are not the days we look forward to , but we deal with it . "
A local hospital spokesman said two of those killed died at the scene while the third died later in hospital .
Two of the three injured workers were in a critical condition and one was serious .
All were suffering numerous shrapnel wounds , the spokesman added .
In 2004 , SpaceShipOne , funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , made the first privately financed manned spaceflight by climbing more than 62 miles on a suborbital journey above the Mojave desert .
SpaceShipOne went on to make two more flights and won the £ 5 m Ansari X Prize for the first private manned space flight .
Mr Rutan has since been developing SpaceShipTwo for Branson , who is investing at least £ 100 m for a fleet of spaceships .
The first vessel is planned to be ready within a year , and following a year of flight tests , have its first commercial launch in 2009 .
US defence giant Northrop Grumman owns 40 % of Scaled and has agreed to buy the rest of it , subject to regulatory approval .
" This is an occasion for the 1.5 billion Muslims to look at the seriousness of this decision , " Mohammed Ijaz ul - Haq , religious affairs minister , told the Pakistani parliament in Islamabad .
" The west is accusing Muslims of extremism and terrorism .
If someone exploded a bomb on his body he would be right to do so unless the British government apologises and withdraws the ' sir ' title . "
After his comments were reported on local news stations , Mr ul - Haq told MPs that his aim had been to look into the root causes of terrorism .
The comments follow other condemnation of the award for Rushdie , whose novel The Satanic Verses provoked worldwide protests over allegations that it insulted Islam .
He received the knighthood for services to literature in the Queen 's birthday honours list published on Saturday .
Earlier today Pakistani MPs demanded Britain withdraw Rushdie 's knighthood .
A government - backed resolution condemning the author 's knighthood was passed unanimously by the lower house of the Pakistani parliament amid angry protests across the country .
MPs said the honour was an insult to the religious sentiments of Muslims .
In the eastern city of Multan , hardline Muslim students burned effigies of the Queen and Rushdie , chanting " Kill him !
Kill him ! "
Pakistan 's minister for parliamentary affairs , Sher Afgan Khan Niazi , who proposed the resolution condemning the honour , branded Rushdie a " blasphemer " .
She told MPs : " The ' sir ' title from Britain for blasphemer Salman Rushdie has hurt the sentiments of the Muslims across the world .
Every religion should be respected .
I demand the British government immediately withdraw the title as it is creating religious hatred . "
Also today , Muhammad Abdul Bari , secretary - general of the Muslim Council of Britain , said many Muslims would regard the knighthood as the final insult from Tony Blair before he leaves office next week .
" Salman Rushdie earned notoriety amongst Muslims for the highly insulting and blasphemous manner in which he portrayed early Islamic figures , " Dr Bari said .
" The granting of a knighthood to him can only do harm to the image of our country in the eyes of hundreds of millions of Muslims across the world .
Many will interpret the knighthood as a final contemptuous parting gift from Tony Blair to the Muslim world . "
Yesterday , Iranian politicians accused Britain of insulting Islam by awarding the knighthood to Rushdie , who was forced into hiding for a decade after the country 's late spiritual leader , Ayatollah Khomeini , issued a fatwa calling for his assassination .
Mohammad Ali Hosseini , a spokesman for Iran 's foreign ministry , said the decision to honour the novelist was an orchestrated act of aggression directed against Islamic societies .
He said Rushdie was " one of the most hated figures " in the Islamic world .
" Honouring and commending an apostate and hated figure will definitely put the British officials [ in a position ] of confrontation with Islamic societies , " Mr Hosseini said .
" This act shows that insulting Islamic sacred [ values ] is not accidental .
It is planned , organised , guided and supported by some western countries . "
" Giving a badge to one of the most hated figures in Islamic society is ... an obvious example of fighting against Islam by high - ranking British officials . "
The Iranian government formally distanced itself in 1998 from the original fatwa against Rushdie , issued in 1989 by Khomeini .
But shortly after it disavowed the death edict under a deal with Britain , the Iranian media said three Iranian clerics had called on followers to kill Rushdie , saying the fatwa was irrevocable and that it was the duty of Muslims to carry it out .
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said the honour was " richly deserved " and the reasons for it were " self - explanatory " .
In a statement after the announcement of his knighthood on Saturday , Rushdie , 59 , said he was " thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour " .
Democrats Newly Willing to Compromise on Iraq
After short - circuiting consideration of votes on some bipartisan proposals on Iraq before the August break , senior Democrats now say they are willing to rethink their push to establish a withdrawal deadline of next spring if doing so will attract the 60 Senate votes needed to prevail .
Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , said , " If we have to make the spring part a goal , rather than something that is binding , and if that is able to produce some additional votes to get us over the filibuster , my own inclination would be to consider that . "
Democrats would need to lure the 60 senators in order to cut off a likely Republican filibuster .
Spring , eh ?
Is n't April the new September ?
April is in the Spring .
The emerging proposal by Mr. Levin and Senator Jack Reed , Democrat of Rhode Island , would still order the administration to begin pulling at least some combat troops out of Iraq , probably by the end of the year .
It is not clear what other provisions the measure may include .
" We 'll see " , the game my parents played with me as a child , is the game being played by Bush , the GOP , and the Democratic Leadership .
And it looks to me that , despite all the " we 're working hard against the GOP " rhetoric , they plan to go right along with whatever words spill out of Petraeus 's pie hole .
Petraeus is the new Tenet , apparently , so his words will be used to make the decisions , which will doubtlessly turn out wrong , because the ENTIRE goal - for the GOP , at least - is to STAY IN IRAQ .
They have no intention of leaving .
And for whatever reason , the Democratic Leadership appears to be committed to investing the effort to aid them while appearing to " keep pressure on them " the whole time .
Mr. Reid and other Democrats said they would continue to press their preferred approach of setting a date to have most combat troops out of Iraq even while pursuing a compromise with Republicans .
Party strategists say that withdrawal is a top priority of the party ’s anti-war base and that polls continue to show that much of the public favors a withdrawal from Iraq .
It 's clear they know what we want .
It 's less clear that they genuinely intend to do anything other than placate us while they leave things just as they are .
More and more it has the appearance of a charade .
Posturing and rhetoric and footdragging and stalling and goalpost moving , and distractions and new requests for more time and more money .
They have NO intention of bringing troops home , no intention of stopping the illegal occupation that is ruining America .
Maybe Harry IS trying to bring troops home - I cannot really tell anymore , such is the disconnect between words and actions .
Either we have a voice or we do n't .
So far , our demands are ignored .
We have heard whining from Democratic leadership about our anger towards their FISA cave - in but I do not believe for a moment that this is a " motivational level of pain " .
I think it 's lip service at best .
Possibly lip service uttered in hopes of us backing off , leaving them alone and continuing to send them money ( which should stop , really ) .
So ..no .
Our demands have yet to be addressed , let alone met .
The message should be " Screw Petraeus " and whatever he has to say .
We 've known for months he 's just going to regurgitate what he 's been told to regurgitate and the White House has written what he is to say .
Its a fucking farce and pretty much YOU ALL KNOW THAT .
We demand the troops be extracted and brought home and we are n't getting it .
We demand an end to the illegal occupation , and we are n't getting it .
We demand impeachment proceedings against Dick Cheney and George Bush for forcing us into this debacle , but - you guessed it !
- we ai n't getting it .
Protest , dammit !
So , honestly , this whole writing exercise was about today 's Phone Protest .
I am very displeased that a simple and direct protest action gets far less attention than some fucked - up gay repub .
Who cares ?
The Democratic Leadership needs a giant fire lit under their asses TODAY .
They have reported feeling the pain of our bitter feedback about their FISA capitulation , so you KNOW they are getting our feedback .
I am unsure how much it motivates them to make the decisions we elected ( read " hired " ) to make .
It 's called " Representation " , I think .
We elect people to go to our Capitol and place votes that reflect what WE want .
Not what the President wants or what the Republicans want , or even what Harry or Nancy themselves want .
They are to do what we want .
That 's they whole point of America :
No taxation without representation , remember ?
Phones , Faxes and E -mails .

Call them repeatedly .
I have wanted to get a bit more support for this here at the " Activist " site but people seem too preoccupied with poll numbers of presidential wannabes and gay republicans .
It 's not really addressing the crises at hand , but what do I know ?
Perhaps Obama would bring the troops home before 2010 .
The problem is they never should have been there to begin with , and the occupation is illegal and killing innocent people .
Plus Bush HAS to be damaged .
Impeached , tarred - something .
He can not be allowed to complete his " term " .
If he complets his term it's as good as saying everything he did is OK with you and me and thats BULLSHIT .
Perhaps Chris Floyd is right :
The Republic you wanted -- and at one time might have had the power to take back -- is finished .
You no longer have the power to keep it ; it 's not there .
It was kidnapped in December 2000 , raped by the primed and ready exploiters of 9/11 , whored by the war pimps of the 2003 aggression , gut - knifed by the corrupters of the 2004 vote , and raped again by its " rescuers " after the 2006 election .
Beaten , abused , diseased and abandoned , it finally died .
We are living in its grave .
The annus horribilis of 2007 has turned out to be a year of triumph for the Bush Faction -- the hit men who delivered the coup de grâce to the long - moribund Republic .
Bush was written off as a lame duck after the Democrat 's November 2006 election " triumph " ( in fact , the narrowest of victories eked out despite an orgy of cheating and fixing by the losers ) , and the subsequent salvo of Establishment consensus from the Iraq Study Group , advocating a de-escalation of the war in Iraq .
Then came a series of scandals , investigations , high - profile resignations , even the criminal conviction of a top White House official .
But despite all this -- and abysmal poll ratings as well -- over the past eight months Bush and his coupsters have seen every single element of their violent tyranny confirmed , countenanced and extended .
Are we dead yet ?
We do appear to be just coasting along on momentum for now but from the social services safety net to the bridges and levees and other infrastructure , I see America crumbling before my eyes .
So .. are you going to call or not ?
If nothing else , would you keep me company ?
The effects of data fragmentation in a mixed load database ( c ) 2007 , Dmitry Dvoinikov dmitry@targeted.org Abstract
This article discusses the effects of data fragmentation when the database is under mixed load .
In an experiment that follows , a specific workload is executed twice against two different databases to support the theoretical discussion and yield some numbers .
The tested database engine is PostgreSQL , although the results should remain true for most relational database engines .
Introduction A simple operational database is often created without any thought of architecture or any prior planning .
It may contain a single large table holding most of the current data .
This main table accumulates incoming facts and is supposed to be going like that forever .
As time passes , some data piles up and suddenly it appears an easy solution to start running reports off the table .
After all it is the table , right ?
And so , it keeps accepting a steady incoming stream of facts , but now it also serves a gradually increasing flow of more and more complex analytical queries .
Besides , no maintenance is performed on the database , other than backing it up perhaps .
A few months down the road the analytical queries suddenly start exhibiting awful performance and a typical thing to blame is what , a lowly hardware , an incapable database engine or the inherent complexity of analytical queries .
Then a more fashionable database is installed on a more powerful server and the story starts over .
To quickly dismiss the declared problems , today 's entry - level server ( even like the one I will be using in the following experiment ) would eat yesterday 's flagship for breakfast .
The database engines have matured over the years and have often converged in their basic principles and feature sets .
The problem with complex queries may exist but should be solvable as soon as developers and administrators work together .
I 'm not at all advocating the approach to run reports off a main operational table , mixing different data access patterns like that is wrong .
But the fact is – some database applications do require such mixed load and I will just use one simple case as a demonstration of the disastrous effects that data fragmentation has on a database .
To do so , I will run identical workload two times – first ( which I will call " fragmented " ) through a database with no maintenance whatsoever and the other ( " defragmented " ) through a database with minimal online defragmentation .
This particular experiment I will run on PostgreSQL although much of the following discussion holds true for most other databases .
Theoretical background
Here is how the main operational table looks like :
It is typical to have records inserted at the logical end of the table and only relatively fresh records updated or referenced on individual basis .
As soon as a record ages , it no longer sees any updates and is seldom selected alone , but is frequently selected in a bunch with a lot of other records .
For the sake of this discussion I will assume that the table accumulates financial transactions - payment records from different customers .
What is important is that each record in the table is tagged with the customer id , there are many customers and the payments arrive in random order .
Here is how the table looks like then :
The simplest report ( account statement ) will then fetch all the rows for a single given customer and perhaps sort or apply aggregates .
What 's wrong with the above picture with respect to such request is that customer 's rows are scattered across the entire table , so that to fetch every single record , the database engine has to read an entire page from the disk , and that is not only a separate physical I/O operation , but worse , if the required rows are sparse ( and they are ) it requires a disk head seek .
Besides , each read from the disk will likely bring in a single worthy record .
This means that we have about as many logical reads as we have records in the result :
It would be great if all the records for the same customer appeared together , in physical proximity .
This way a fast sequential read will bring into memory just the records required and nothing else .
The following scheme demonstrates the ideal situation ( this is what Oracle 's sorted hash cluster does theoretically ) :
In practice it would never be that clean and beautiful unless you actually take time to physically reorganize the table every now and then .
The reorganization process may take names of defragmenting , rebuilding indexes , dumping and reloading the table or clustering :
The problem is , however , as the table grows , it takes more and more time to reorganize it like that , and the table may have to be taken offline for the duration of entire process .
There may be other problems .
In PostgreSQL specifically , clustering is something like
INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY cid ; wrapped up in a non-standard operator
CLUSTER t__idx__cid
ON t ; and although it can be performed online on a live table , it is notoriously slower than just the mentioned SQL query .
Granted , the database engine may attempt to keep the table clustered all the time ( just like the mentioned sorted hash would ) and partitioning may help , but I 'm going to demonstrate the effects of simple online defragmentation , which should support my point that even a little bit of contiguity may have wonderful effect on performance .
What I 'm going to do in the second workload run is to replace the original table with the view concatenating two tables – one current operational containing only records being actively updated ( in real life – records less than one day old ) , and another archived containing records which are highly unlikely to ever get updated , mostly participating in analytical queries :
As soon as the t_current table fills up so that its tail contains just enough unchangeable records to bother processing , the tail is cut off and appended to the t_archive table sorted by customer id .
This way t_current will always contain at most two days worth of records and t_archive will grow unconstrained but will have the customers ' records somewhat clustered .
Therefore , a query fetching all records for a customer will need to scan through much fewer islands of densely packed records .
The view created to replace the original table :
CREATE VIEW t AS SELECT * FROM t_archive UNION ALL SELECT * FROM t_current will behave almost exactly as the original table , as soon as we equip it with a few rules .
Rule system is a PostgreSQL - specific feature which essentially allows intercepting queries at execution time and making them do something else .
In this case we need a single insert rule so that inserts to t actually go to t_current and two update rules so that each update on t will in fact run two identical updates on t_archive and t_current .
Without further discussing this , we may just assume that t is an updateable view which behaves very much like the original table .
But the table layout and physical I/O are not the only sources of trouble with data fragmentation .
Another database component which is heavily affected is the shared buffer pool .
The buffer pool is a dedicated memory area , shared between all the database engine instances ( hence the name ) , and it basically contains the data being currently accessed .
The buffer pool is limited and often fixed in size therefore it can only hold only so many data pages at a time .
As soon as the database engine needs to reference another data page and the shared buffer pool has no free space , some of the currently resident pages need to be evicted .
Note that it 's only for the diagram that the buffer pool is being used in the FIFO fashion , a real database engine may replace the pages in the pool in any order .
The so - called common wisdom recommends not to configure the shared buffer pool in PostgreSQL to be very large , because , they say , when operating system implements effective file caching , large portions of system memory automatically become sort of a level 2 shared buffer pool – if a recently evicted page is needed again in a short while , while it still resides in the filesystem cache , no physical I/ O is necessary , it 's simply copied back from kernel memory .
This appears to be a valid advice but it is still worth a closer look .
One case where this " buffer pool extension " principle does not work is when the page to be evicted is dirty ( has been changed in memory since it has been read from the disk ) .
A dirty page cannot be evicted without previously being physically flushed to the disk .
It can not be simply discarded like a clean page , because doing so would result in a data file inconsistency and require recovery from the transaction log .
Therefore , in presence of concurrent updates and inserts , select queries will result in a constant stream of random I/O writes to the underlying data files .
Technically , such write may not result in an immediate synchronous physical I/O operation ( as is the case with transaction log ) , but the OS filesystem cache will only keep the page to be written only for so long as to optimize the disk access pattern , meaning – almost no time .
This implies that in spite of any OS caching , your database cannot have more dirty pages than a shared buffer pool can hold .
To be fair , this is always true , and you would n't normally have that many dirty pages – checkpoints and writer processes will see to that .
Besides , having a lot of dirty pages is bad in case of a failure when all the dirty pages are lost and need to be recovered from the transaction log , which may take a lot of time .
Another case where the filesystem cache usefulness is reduced is the following .
As the number of concurrent queries increases and they start to compete for the space in the shared buffer pool , the pool becomes a major source of contention as each query demands more pages for itself .
Theoretically , a simplest query of
SELECT * FROM t would have flooded the buffer pool with pages not to be accessed again any time soon .
Moreover , should the amount of selected data have exceeded the buffer pool size , the entire buffer pool would have been entirely wiped out with pages being immediately evicted and impossible to reuse without being re-reading again .
Such scenario is extreme but the database engine needs to specifically protect itself from such buffer pool trashing .
The buffer pool management algorithms are probably among the most valuable database vendor know - how's .
PostgreSQL specifically uses an advanced algorithm trying to separate expendable short - living pages from the precious long - living ones .
Now , notice that no matter if the shared buffer pool is backed up by a filesystem cache or not , the queries will still compete for space in the buffer pool .
Does n't matter if a page has been found in kernel memory and not been read from the disk - it has to be copied to the buffer pool before the database can access it .
Having filesystem cache support will save us a physical read sometimes , but it will not rid of contention at the shared buffer pool .
Armed with all this knowledge , let 's look again at what happens when a highly defragmented data is accessed , this time with the shared buffer pool included to the diagram .
The key thing to note is that both the data file and the buffer pool have page granularity .
Even if all you want is a single record , you have to read the whole page from the disk .
Likewise , no matter if you need to process a single record from the page you have just read , you have to allocate an entire page from the shared buffer pool just for it , possibly evicting other pages .
This leads us to the pinnacle point of this article -
Data fragmentation is not only bad because it results in lots of physical I / O but also because it reduces the effective size of the shared buffer pool from N pages to N records , thus by a factor of a 100 .
For example for a PostgreSQL shared buffer pool of 256 M and a default page size of 8 K , the shared buffer pool can contain at most 32 K pages of data .
But with heavily fragmented data it becomes just 32 K records .
Think about it – no matter how fast hard drives you have , no matter how much physical memory , a database cannot reference more than 32 K records at a time without having to swap pages around , likely causing physical I/O .
Finally , let 's proceed to the experiment .
Experiment workload
The workload simulates the described scenario where the database processes a stream of both OLTP requests accessing single record each and simple analytical requests accessing a bunch of records each .
The records are never deleted , therefore the test database grows indefinitely .
The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the effects of fragmentation as the database keeps growing .
Technically , ten client sessions are connected to the database and repeatedly execute the same stored procedure in an infinite loop at full speed .
Each stored procedure run is performed in a separate explicit transaction .
The stored procedure being executed is the same , but upon each run it chooses an action to perform at random as follows :
25 % chance of " insert "
Insert single record with sequential record id and random customer id .
This corresponds to initial payment creation .
Insert single record with sequential record id and random customer id .
This corresponds to initial payment creation .
25 % chance of " update "
Update a single record by random record id inserted within last hour .
This corresponds to payment status change or something like that .
Update a single record by random record id inserted within last hour .
This corresponds to payment status change or something like that .
25 % chance of " select one " ( record )
Select a single record by random record id inserted within last hour .
This corresponds to the payment browse .
Select a single record by random record id inserted within last hour .
This corresponds to the payment browse .
15 % chance of " select hour " ( worth of records )
Select all records for a random customer for the last hour , sorted by insertion time .
This corresponds to a daily account statement .
Select all records for a random customer for the last hour , sorted by insertion time .
This corresponds to a daily account statement .
10 % chance of " select all " ( records )
Select all records for a random customer , sorted by insertion time .
This corresponds to a yearly account statement .
All the queries are executed against the same single table ( either physical table , or logical view ) of the following structure :
CREATE TABLE t ( ts timestamp NOT NULL , -- date and time of insertion id int NOT NULL , -- record id generated with a sequence cid int NOT NULL , -- random customer id pad varchar ( 200 ) NOT NULL -- " the rest " of the record fields ) ; where ts is the current time at the moment of insertion , id is the sequence - generated unique number , cid is a random customer id in range 0-9999 , and pad is a stuffing to replace the rest of the unspecified fields .
As pad has a random length , 100 bytes on average , the typical record size is around 150 bytes ( ts + id + cid + 100 + PostgreSQL mandated 27 bytes per record ) .
The tables have two indexes to them - one by ( id ) and another by ( cid , ts ) .
A typical record can therefore have the following lifecycle :
1 . Get inserted :
INSERT INTO t VALUES ( now ( ) , 123456 , 1234 , '*' * 130 ) 2 . Get updated ( possibly more than once ) :
UPDATE t SET pad = ‘*' * 180 WHERE id = 123456 3 . Get selected on an individual basis ( possibly more than once ) :
SELECT * FROM t WHERE id = 123456
Note : only records inserted within the last hour can be selected or updated individually .
4 . Get selected along with all the customer 's records for the last hour ( possibly more than once ) :
SELECT * FROM t WHERE cid = 1234 AND ts > now ( ) – 1 hour ORDER BY ts 5 .
Get selected along with all of the customer 's records ( possibly more than once ) :
SELECT * FROM t WHERE cid = 1234 ORDER BY ts There is no doubt that the performance of a database under described workload will degrade as the size of the table increases , the question is – how bad and how fast would it degrade .
Online defragmentation
As mentioned earlier , the second database will be equipped with a simple online defragmentation facility – a separate stored procedure executed periodically .
The defragmentation process is executed in a separate explicit transaction and cannot violate data integrity .
Now the question is – how frequently defragmentation should be performed ?
If you run it frequently , each defragmentation run will take less time and affect the main workload less , but the archive table will be more fragmented .
If you perform it infrequently , the archive table will be better clustered but the defragmentation process will take more time and memory and affect the main workload more .
I came to the following decision – each defragmentation run should deliver to the archive table just enough records so that each customer 's rows occupy exactly one page .
This seems to be the minimal reasonable clustering .
The calculations are as follows then : for a page size of 8 K and average row size of 150 bytes , each page accommodates about 55 rows .
Since there are 10,000 customers and we need a separate page worth of records for each customer , it gives 550,000 records to be sorted and transferred to the archive table on each defragmentation run .
To put it simply , the defragmentation procedure is run whenever another 550,000 records are inserted to the current table .
That many records occupy about 80 Mb and should comfortably be sorted in memory , provided the session is configured appropriately .

Amount of physical I/O generated separately by reads and writes .
Percentage of dirty buffers in the buffer pool .
Experiment results
The workload has been run for a week against each of the two databases independently .
The " fragmented " database performed worse , as expected , and only managed to process 11 million rows .
The " defragmented " database performed much better and has been able to process about 17 million rows .
The results are shown on the following diagrams .
The X scale of the diagrams measures the number of rows in the table , not time elapsed , therefore the " fragmented " diagrams appear significantly more narrow .
Nevertheless , all the diagrams correspond to the same running time .

Results discussion Predictably enough , there appear to be three clearly different regions , marked A , B and C on the graphs .
Region A : the entire database is smaller than the buffer pool , all the data is always unconditionally available to the engine .
Although it appears to be a trivial case because all the requests are so fast that they are not even detectable on the graph , the I/O diagrams tell an interesting story .
As the records are inserted at the amazing speed , the buffer pool usage skyrockets , and because of the simultaneous hail of updates , the percentage of dirty pages follows closely .
Nearly all buffer pool pages become dirty at this moment .
There is an overwhelming amount of physical I/O writes during this entire period .
It can not be justified by writes to the transaction log alone , and is probably due to the dirty pages eviction resulting from combined effects of buffer pool manager attempts to reuse the pages , background writer process and checkpoints .
I/ O reads , there are none .
Region B : the database size grows above the buffer pool but is still smaller than the physical memory available on the server .
This is an interesting period of time .
The database is under load but it appears to be in stasis – all the requests execute at about the same speed , the amount of I/O writes has dropped significantly , but is still high and at about the same level .
There is still no I/O reads – the database is completely backed up by the filesystem cache .
Note however , that the " select all " requests timing grows linearly .
This could have been rather unexpected result , after all , why would an all - in - memory request take more time ?
But it perfectly illustrates the discussed point of buffer pool contention – it is not enough for a record to present in physical memory to be accessed – the page it belongs to has to be brought to the buffer pool .
Another , rather curious result is that it takes more time to insert and update a physical table than a view , just note how the insert / update lines are higher on the fragmented table graph .
This is probably because the inserts and updates to the view t are always redirected to the table t_current , which is always smaller in size ( and has smaller indexes too ) .
Also note that in the defragmented run , select queries wipe out fewer pages than they do in fragmented case .
This results in fewer forced evictions and significantly higher percentage of dirty pages .
This may not be very important at the moment but it will be in region C .
Region C : the database size becomes larger than the amount of physical memory on the server .
As the physical memory boundary is crossed , the fragmentation deficiencies are immediately surfaced .
The fragmented database starts trashing almost instantaneously .
Not just that , the average time for a single " select all " query in the fragmented database grows exponentially , so high in fact that it cannot be conveniently drawn on the graph and is represented by a fictional dotted line .
At 11 million records , the time to execute a " select all " reaches 11 seconds .
At the same database size , the unfragmented database runs it in less than 500ms !
As the amount of physical reads starts growing , the writes take a steep fall because the hard drives now have to seek a lot .
With the fragmented database the fall is ugly and edgy and makes the impression of hitting the wall .
With the defragmented database the fall is smooth and nice and makes an impression of being able to keep going for a while .
As mentioned previously , the defragmented database can afford to keep more dirty pages in memory , which allows squeezing in more concurrent reads without having to evict every page .
The defragmented database thus demonstrates better I /O rates .
Finally , at its 17 million records , the behavior of the unfragmented database does n't indicate that it is preparing for anything unusual .
The request times keep growing smoothly and linearly , the amount of I/O reads keeps rising asymptotically and the amount of I/O writes keeps falling for the hard drives of limited capacity to accommodate more and more reads .
It seems like it would easily go like that for another 10 million records .
The fragmented database would have been long since dead by that time .
Conclusions Fragmentation is evil .
A fragmented database could not be larger than the physical memory installed on the server .
Anyhow , this is true in presence of analytical requests spanning significant portions of the database .
Purely OLTP load will have no performance penalty in a fragmented database .
Besides being bad for the I/O performance , fragmentation does affect buffer pool management and the effects are clearly visible .
This is very true for PostgreSQL which has very specific buffer pool management policy , and is likely to be true for other databases as well .
How exactly any other database 's buffer pool manager behaves under fragmented load cannot be seen from the executed experiment .
The limiting factor is physical I/O ( as usual ) , and head seeks kill it more efficiently than anything .

Making it clear he will resist congressional pressure next month for an early withdrawal , he signalled that US troops , whom he hailed as the " greatest force for human liberation the world has ever known " , will be in Iraq as long as he is president .
He also said the consequences of leaving " without getting the job done would be devastating " , and " the enemy would follow us home " .
Mr Bush 's speech came on the day that the US suffered one of its highest daily death tolls since the 2003 invasion , with 14 troops killed when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed .
In a speech to army veterans in Kansas City , Mr Bush invoked one of the US 's biggest military disasters in support of keeping troops in Iraq : " One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ' boat people ' , ' re - education camps ' and ' killing fields ' . "
The speech was aimed primarily at what White House officials privately describe as the " Defeatocrats " , the Democratic congressmen trying to push Mr Bush into an early withdrawal .
The issue is set to come to a head next month when the US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , gives a progress report to Congress .
Gen Petraeus is expected to say that the surge has produced military successes but that there has only been limited progress on the political front .
In relation to the latter , Mr Bush was forced yesterday to backtrack after 24 hours earlier expressing frustration with the Iraqi prime minister , Nour al - Maliki .
Alarmed by the harsh reaction of Mr Maliki , Mr Bush hurriedly rewrote his speech to praise him : " Prime Minister Maliki 's a good guy , a good man with a difficult job and I support him . "
The speech overall reflected the White House belief that it is shifting American public opinion behind the surge - the injection of 30,000 extra US troops into Iraq that has brought the total US force in the country to its highest level , 165,000 .
The Bush administration wants to keep the surge going until at least next April , at which point the overstretched military will be forced to begin reducing troop numbers anyway .
Although Gen Petraeus has not yet completed his report , a Pentagon source said the US presence could be down to 110,000 by the end of next year .
The army , as of yesterday , had no plans to replace five brigades , each consisting of 3,400 to 4,000 soldiers , when their 15 - month tours expire next summer .
Freedom's Watch , a conservative group , yesterday launched a $ 15 m ( £ 7.5 m ) advertising campaign in 20 states saying : " It 's no time to quit .
It 's no time for politics . "
Mr Bush 's former White House spokesman , Ari Fleischer , who works for the group , said : " We want to get the message to both Democrats and Republicans : do n't cut and run , fully fund the troops , and victory is the only objective . "
The White House has been emboldened by a Gallup poll published yesterday showing approval ratings for the Democratic - led Congress had dropped to 18 % , the lowest since the survey of the public views of the legislature began in 1974 , and an earlier Gallup poll showing support for the surge had jumped in a month from 22 % to 31 % .
Two of the most influential senators on military affairs , the Democratic chairman of the armed services committee , Carl Levin , an advocate of an early withdrawal , and John Warner , a veteran Republican who recently broke ranks with Mr Bush over the war , issued a statement this week lauding the surge 's " tangible results " .
Mr Bush , until yesterday , had strenuously avoided making explicit references to Vietnam .
It is a gamble , risking reminding Americans that Vietnam was a military quagmire and reminding them of the shambolic retreat from the embassy rooftop in Saigon on the day that a Black Hawk crashed in Iraq killing 14 US soldiers .
But Mr Bush tried to turn the argument around as he made a series of contentious political parallels .
He argued that US involvement in the far east had turned it from a continent in 1939 with only two democracies - Australia and New Zealand - into one where democracy was the norm : he mentioned Japan , South Korea and Vietnam .
" In Cambodia , the Khmer Rouge began a murderous rule , in which hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died by starvation and torture and execution , " Mr Bush said .
Some historians argue that it was the US covert bombing of Cambodia that produced the Khmer Rouge rather than US withdrawal from Vietnam .
Mr Bush added : " In Vietnam , former allies of the United States and government workers and intellectuals and businessmen were sent off to prison camps , where tens of thousand perished .
Hundreds of thousands more fled the country on rickety boats , many of them going to their graves in the South China Sea . "
He said that there had been lots of critics of US involvement in Vietnam at the time .
But he quoted from Graham Greene 's novel The Quiet American , the words " I never knew a man who had better motives for all the trouble he caused " , implying that , with the benefit of hindsight , they were wrong , just as critics of the Iraq war will later seen to be misguided .
He will expand on that in a speech next week in which he will say he has not abandoned his ambitious idea that Iraq could be in the vanguard of bringing democracy to the Middle East .
Since the British government hinted recently that it planned an early pullout from Iraq , it has come under increasing pressure from the White House .
US general Jack Keane yesterday became the latest American to criticise the proposed British move .
He told the BBC that the situation in Basra was deteriorating .
" From a military perspective I know what the [ US ] commanders are trying to avoid is having to send reinforcements to the south from forces that are needed in the central part of Iraq .
That situation could arise if the situation gets worse in Basra if and when British troops leave , " he said .
Literary allusions
Bush 's " better motives " quote comes from Graham Greene 's The Quiet American , a searing attack on US foreign policy set in Saigon in 1952 .
It is the story of jaded British reporter Thomas Fowler and his relationship with younger US spy Alden Pyle , told against the backdrop of the French battle with the Viet Minh - precursor to the Vietnam war .
" Innocence is a kind of insanity , " says Fowler of Pyle as he blunders into the conflict , sponsoring a corrupt militia leader based on real nationalist Trinh Minh Thé .
Fowler 's jealousy over Pyle 's interest in his Vietnamese mistress and distaste for his methods culminate in a bomb attack in Saigon .
A film version was scheduled for release in 2001 , starring Michael Caine .
It was test screened on September 10 but postponed for a year after the 9/11 attacks .
Paul Lavern Ritch , 37 , from Roath , Cardiff , was stabbed early on Sunday morning after a night out with friends in the town of Margate , New Jersey .
It is thought Mr Ritch may have stepped in when he saw someone being attacked .
The 37 - year - old was well known in Cardiff through sporting activities and worked at the city 's David Lloyd club .
Mr Ritch - known as Lavern - was once short listed for Company magazine 's bachelor of the year and also included in the Wales on Sunday newspaper list of eligible bachelors .
It is believed he had been visiting a friend from nearby Cherry Hill and spent Saturday night at restaurants and clubs in Margate , a fairly affluent resort on an island a few miles from Atlantic City .
The sportsman , who also worked as a swimming and tennis coach , was declared dead an hour after being taken to hospital .
A major crime unit is now investigating .
It is the first murder in the seaside resort for more than six years .
Police issued a sketch of the suspect on Tuesday
Thomas Hiltner , Margate 's municipal clerk , said he believed Mr Ritch had been leaving a pub and may have seen somebody chasing another person .
" My understanding is he was trying to maybe aid or help , maybe fend off , or help distract the perpetrator , maybe try and help out the guy that was being chased obviously wrong place at the wrong time because the perpetrator was carrying a knife , " he said .
Police are searching for the murder weapon while the Atlantic County medical examiner 's office has confirmed Mr Ritch died from a single stab wound to the heart .
Phaedra Laird , a reporter with Channel 40 TV news , said the fact the Atlantic County prosecutor had held a rare news conference spoke volumes about how hard they are trying to solve the crime .
They had released photographs from surveillance footage featuring a man they want to speak to and had appealed to the public to identify him .
He was a very peaceful guy who was always stepping in and helping people , that 's the type of person he was .
He was just perfect , he was lovely and it's just a tragedy
David Knibbs , friend
She said the man police want to speak to had been ejected from a bar at 0100 local time .
She had unofficially been told the man may have returned to the bar looking to pick a fight - an event unconnected to Mr Ritch and his friends .
" What I 'm gathering is maybe that fight between those two separate people ensued on the street , a chase took place and sensing that something was wrong , Lavern Ritch chased after them .
Friends of Mr Ritch have said it would be typical of him to step in if he saw someone in trouble .
Fellow swimming instructor David Knibbs said : " He was a very peaceful guy who was always stepping in and helping people , that 's the type of person he was .
He was just perfect , he was lovely and it 's just a tragedy . "
David Lloyd health club in Cardiff , where Mr Ritch worked , planned opening a book of condolence .
In 1998 , Mr Ritch took part in the ITV programme Gladiators .
His family are being comforted by relatives at their home in Fairwater , Cardiff .

Building up an emergency fund , if you have n’t already , is one of the most important things you can do to help your finances .
But you knew that .
It ’s common financial advice , actually , but what ’s not so common is how to actually do it .
Obviously those who have n’t saved up an emergency fund have a difficult time saving money , even if they know they should .
So today we ’ll look at some strategies for building up an emergency fund , for those of us who do n’t have it so easy .
Why It ’s So Critical
I do n’t like to use the word “ critical ” often , because it ’s often an exaggeration .
But in this case , when we ’re talking about the health of your finances , an emergency fund is definitely critical .
If you are having financial problems , the most important steps you can take immediately are 1 ) reduce your spending by being more frugal ; 2 ) stop getting into debt ; and 3 ) build an emergency fund of $ 1,000 ( and later you can increase that to the standard 3 - 6 months of income ) .
Here are a few reasons an emergency fund is critical to your financial health :
Stop getting into debt .
When an emergency comes up , if you do n’t have an emergency fund , the first thing that will be cut from your budget is your debt repayment .
You ’ll use your credit card to pay for the emergency , and then you ’re deeper in the hole .
An emergency fund stops the need to use credit to pay for emergency expenses .
Smooth out your budget .
If unexpected things come up , you do n’t have to continually re-factor your budget to pay for these things .
With an emergency fund , it makes budgeting much easier .
Prevent late fees .
If you are living paycheck - to - paycheck , you will come up with times when you have to pay a bill late , or overdraw your bank account .
With an emergency cushion , you avoid these financial hits .
Get ahead .
If you can get a month ahead , your financial stress will drop way down .
Instead of always playing catch - up , you can pay your bills ahead of time and sit back and relax .
21 Strategies for Creating an Emergency Fund
If you have trouble saving , it ’s not enough to tell you how important it is to have an emergency fund .
You need some strategies for doing it .
Please note that you should choose the strategies that work best for you , and perhaps combine some of them if that works better .

The men were arrested in a hotel in north - eastern Bauchi State , which is governed by the Islamic Sharia law .
The Sharia punishment for sodomy is death by stoning .
The men , reportedly wearing women 's clothes , are said to have gone to Bauchi town from neighbouring states to celebrate a " gay wedding " .
Sharia judge Malam Tanimu ordered that the 18 be remanded in prison after they were arraigned before him on Wednesday .
Prosecuting police officer Tadius Boboi said the men's actions had contravened Sharia law , adopted in Bauchi and a dozen other states in Muslim northern Nigeria in 2000 .
Amputations
More than a dozen Nigerian Muslims have been sentenced to death by stoning and for sexual offences ranging from adultery and homosexuality .
But none of these death sentences have actually been carried out as they were either thrown out on appeal or commuted to prison terms as a result of pressure from human rights groups .
Many others have been sentenced to flogging by horsewhip for drinking .
But there have been two amputations in north - western Zamfara State which pioneered the introduction of the Islamic legal system in the country .
Taboo
Nigeria , like many African countries , is a conservative society where homosexuality is considered a taboo .
The Nigerian parliament has been trying to pass a controversial law introduced by former President Olusegun Obasanjo banning gay rights organisations .
Gay activists and some human rights groups have condemned the proposed legislation and called for its rejection .
But homosexuality and same sex marriage are illegal in Nigeria and are considered very serious offences .
In April , a woman reportedly fled Nigeria after being accused of organising a polygamous lesbian wedding .
She later denied the reports .
Two years ago , a Sharia court sentenced a man to six months in prison and fined him $ 38 for living as a woman for seven years in Kano .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in an interview published on Monday the Fed would have to raise interest rates to double - digit levels in coming years to thwart inflation .
But double - digit rates , which have not been seen since the 1980s , would not be a long - term fixture , Greenspan said in an interview with USA Today conducted on Friday .
“ Double digit is something that is likely to happen for a short period of time , ” he said , adding it was hard to predict when such a big rate increase would be needed .
The U.S. central bank meets on Tuesday and is widely expected to cut the benchmark federal funds rate by at least a quarter - percentage point to help the economy weather a housing downturn and credit crunch .

Leahy : Republicans seem to love to shut down government Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This
The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee accused Republicans of being too willing to shut down Congressional business over judicial nominations , despite Democrats ' record of approving more of President Bush 's nominees than the GOP approved for his predecessor , Clinton .
" If Republicans follow through on their threats to shut down the Senate over a single judicial nomination , they would be continuing their pattern of obstructionism and it would ( be ) the American people and our troops who suffer the most , " Leahy said in a statement released by his office Wednesday afternoon .
" Like their President , Republicans priorities are misguided and dangerous .
Instead of funding vital defense initiatives , Republicans are talking about shutting down the Senate over a single judicial nominee . "
The swipe at Republicans from Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) came as he announced that his committee would return to the contentious nomination of Jude Leslie Southwick to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals .
Republicans have threatened to slow or halt Senate business if Southwick 's nomination does not come before the full Senate for a vote .
Sen . Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , took to the Senate floor Wednesday to again call for Southwick 's nomination to be voted on by the full Senate .
He invoked previous battles over judicial nominees , including the near - shutdown in early 2005 when Democrats threatened to filibuster nominees in the Republican - controlled Senate .
" I hope we do not have our actions disintegrate to the kind of controversy we had a couple years ago , " Specter said , " but that we can move beyond this to the kind of bipartisanship which Senator Leahy and I have been able to muster for the Judiciary Committee . "
Leahy reminded Republicans of their past efforts to bring the government to a halt .
" Congressional Republicans seem to love to shut down the Government and seem intent on manufacturing excuses to do so , " he said .
" In 1995 it was Newt Gingrich , who did not like his treatment on Air Force One .
When they were in the Senate majority a few years ago -- and while surreptitiously stealing our computer files -- it was Senate Republicans who insisted on a 40 - hour debate on this Presidents court packing schemes . "
The decision , along with Democratic efforts to scuttle Republican attempts to bring Southwick 's nomination to the floor for a vote marked the latest salvos in a potential showdown .
Democrats on the committee are unified in opposition to the nomination , observers say .
Republicans have been attempting to circumvent the committee to salvage the nominee , who they say has the support of a majority of senators .
" I have n't seen any Democrats ( on the committee ) rushing to his defense ; hopefully that wo n't change , " Judith E. Schaeffer , leagal director of People for the American Way told RAW STORY .
Schaffer 's group and many others on the left oppose Southwick 's nomination because they say he is not adequately supportive of civil rights .
A conservative observer predicted the nomination would not actually be voted on Thursday , despite its placement on the agenda .
Curt Levey , executive director of the Committee for Justice , which is supporting the nomination , said Republicans want a vote from the full Senate and to torpedo the nomination in committee " would be a slap in the face " to Republicans .
" Republicans made clear they 're willing to fight on this , " Levey told RAW STORY .
" I would guess they will report him out of committee without a positive recommendation , that will be the compromise . "
Leahy said he had removed Southwick 's nomination from the Judiciary Committee 's agenda " at the request of Republican Senators , " and was moving again to consider it after hearing Republican complaints that the nomination was being held up .
The Judiciary Committee in June delayed a vote on Southwick 's nomination over concerns on his civil rights record during his time as a judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals .
Civil rights groups have opposed the nomination , including the Human Rights Campaign , the Alliance for Justice , People for the American Way , the NAACP of Mississippi , decrying what they call his lack of commitment to civil rights .
Also on Wednesday , Republicans tried to force the nomination out of the Judiciary Committee , but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) vowed to scuttle their push for a " sense of the Senate " resolution calling for a vote on the nomination by the Senate at large .
Levey predicted the defeat of that resolution could provoke Senate Republicans to block Senate business .
In his statement Wednesday , Leahy accused Republicans of being less willing to approve President Clinton 's nominees than Democrats have been to approve Bush's .
" I guess those making these threats and demands have a short memory , " Leahy said .
" I do not intend to pocket filibuster more than 60 of this Presidents judicial nominees , as the Republican majority did with President Clintons judicial nominees . "

Man drowns in vat of sulfuric acid
2007-09-23 06:33:00 PDT
REDWOOD CITY -- Update : San Mateo County Coroner 's officials have identified 18 - year - old Fernando Jimenez Gonzalez of Redwood City as the man who drowned in a vat of sulfuric acid at a Redwood City factory early this morning .
Gonzalez 's body was discovered at Coastal Circuits Factory on Tacoma Way at around 1:45 a.m. by his father , also an employee of the company , after Gonzalez did n't arrive home , according to a Redwood City police spokesman .
- - -
An 18 - year - old man working at a printed circuit boards company in Redwood City died early this morning after he apparently drowned in a vat of sulfuric acid , according to Sgt. Steve Dowden .
The man was one of two working at the Costal Circuits Factory at 1602 Tacoma Way at around 1:45 a.m. when he died , Dowden said .
Officials believe fumes from the various chemicals used at the factory overwhelmed the victim , and he fell forward into a waist - high vat of sulfuric acid and drowned , according to Dowden .
Dowden said the victim did not appear to be wearing facial protection , a safety measure strongly recommended when working in close contact with hazardous chemicals .
The circuit boards factory is now closed for an undetermined amount of time , according to Dowden .
Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials are investigating the incident to determine what working conditions surrounded the victim 's death , Dowden said .
The other worker at the factory was not injured , Dowden said .
White House may have committed ' extensive ' violations of Records Act , says Oversight Committee Michael Roston
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a report Monday warning of major violations of the Presidential Records Act by White House officials who used e-mail accounts supplied by the Republican National Committee .
" The evidence obtained by the Committee indicates that White House officials used their RNC e-mail accounts in a manner that circumvented [ Presidential Records Act ] requirements , " said a statement issued by the House Oversight Committee .
" Given the heavy reliance by White House officials on RNC e-mail accounts , the high rank of the White House officials involved , and the large quantity of missing e-mails , the potential violation of the Presidential Records Act may be extensive . "
White House spokesman Tony Snow in his daily press briefing said that White House e-mail use was based on Clinton administration policy .
" Those e-mail accounts were set up on a model based on the prior administration which had done it the same way in order to avoid Hatch Act violations , " he noted .
" Any e-mails sent to or received from a White House e-mail account is automatically archived , and the RNC has had an e-mail preservation policy for White House staffers as well .
We should have been through this , I 'm not sure exactly when the start - date was , we 'll just have to see how Counsel 's office responds to Rep. Waxman 's request . "
Snow later suggested that Rep. Henry Waxman 's committee was still engaging in fishing expeditions .
" I 'm sure at the appropriate point we 'll have a response , " he said .
" We 've seen a number of times right now where people have been putting together investigations to see what sticks .
They have had very little success so far .
This administration is very careful about obeying the law , we take it seriously . "
The House Committee found that 88 White House staffers used the RNC e-mail accounts , and the archives were destroyed for 51 of those officials .
Karl Rove , currently President Bush 's Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Planning , was among the heaviest of users .
" The RNC has preserved 140,216 e-mails sent or received by Karl Rove .
Over half of these e-mails ( 75,374 ) were sent to or received from individuals using official '.gov ' e-mail accounts , " the Committee 's release stated .
" These e-mail accounts were used by White House officials for official purposes , such as communicating with federal agencies about federal appointments and policies . "
Other heavy users of the ' off - the - books ' e-mail accounts included Sara Taylor , Rove 's deputy who was recently subpoenaed by the Senate Judiciary Committee , her number two Scott Jennings , and Ken Mehlman , who at one time served as White House Director of Political Affairs .
Rep. Waxman 's committee also found culpability in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who served in the first half of the Bush administration as White House Counsel to President Bush , and took no action to preserve the RNC e-mails .
" The Office of White House Counsel under Alberto Gonzales may have known that White House officials were using RNC e-mail accounts for official business , but took no action to preserve these presidential records , " the committee 's statement said .
" There is no evidence , however , that White House Counsel Gonzales initiated any action to ensure the preservation of the e-mail records that were destroyed by the RNC . "
The report suggested that some of the ' destroyed ' e-mails could be available on the servers of other government agencies .
" Preliminary responses from the agencies indicate that they may have preserved official communications that were destroyed by the RNC , " it noted .
And , Waxman 's office threatened to issue subpoenas to further the investigation .
" The Committee may need to issue compulsory process to obtain the cooperation of the Bush Cheney 04 campaign .
The campaign has informed the Committee that it provided e-mail accounts to 11 White House officials , but the campaign has unjustifiably refused to provide the Committee with basic information about these accounts , such as the identity of the White House officials and the number of e-mails that have been preserved , " the statement suggested .

ATLANTA , Sept. 19 — The attack in a hotel parking lot here last month was remarkable not only because the victim , Juanita Bynum , is the most prominent black female television evangelist in the country , who is pals with Oprah , admired by Aretha , and who recently signed on to campaign for Obama .
It was shocking , especially to legions of women who had latched onto her message that only chastity and self - respect would bring true love , because the attacker who choked , stomped and kicked her , Ms. Bynum said , was her husband .
The episode has led to debate about domestic violence and how churches , particularly black churches , respond to it .
But it has also raised questions about the trajectory of Ms. Bynum ’s career as a woman who called herself a prophetess , and while condemning promiscuity spoke openly about her lust and longing , in what has been called one of the most significant contemporary American sermons .
Her struggle struck a chord in many black communities , where marriage rates are notoriously low , and it seemed to culminate in the form of an earthly reward : a televised , million - dollar 2003 wedding to a fellow Pentecostal preacher , Bishop Thomas W. Weeks III , followed by what seemed to be a model marriage .

As first reported last week , producer Joel Silver and Warner Bros .
are indeed teaming for a new big - screen version of the cartoon / toy / comic book franchise He -Man and the Masters of the Universe .
The producer and the studio previously collaborated on the Matrix and Lethal Weapon franchises , as well as on V for Vendetta and The Reaping .
Variety says this He - Man , to be scripted by Justin Marks from an idea by Marks and co-producer Neil Ellice , " was pitched to the studio and Mattel as a classic good vs. evil battle , using the kind of visual effects strategy employed in 300 .
A warrior is touted as the last hope of a magical land called Eternia , which is being ravaged by technology and a despotic ruler named Skeletor .
Many of the characters in the universe will be informed by the four different cartoon series done since the 1980s .
" The trade claims the Warners - Silver deal with He - Man toy maker Mattel " is contingent on Mattel formally approving an outline for the project . "
Despite rumors online , Variety says the title role has not been cast .
The trade adds that , in addition to He - Man and Super Max , Marks is also scripting the Voltron movie and a new film version of the videogame Street Fighter
The Bolivarian computer , model VIT C2660
Mérida , June 12 , 2007 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) —
The Venezuelan government of President Hugo Chavez announced the launch of their " Bolivarian Computers " last week , consisting of four different models produced in Venezuela with Chinese technology .
The new computers will run the open - source Linux operating system and will first be used inside the government " missions " and state companies and institutions but eventually are expected to be sold across Venezuela and Latin America .
Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez presented the new machines to the public last week at an event in the state of Falcon as he donated them to a school there .
The new computers are produced by the joint venture VIT ( Venezuela de Industria Tecnológica ) , which is owned by the Chinese company Lang Chao and the Venezuelan Ministry of Light Industry and Commerce .
" The price of other similar brands is US $ 930 , and the price of our computer is almost 40 % less , " explained President Chavez .
" But , in addition , it has an added value , given that it comes with open - source software and a three year guarantee , while other brands only offer one year . "
Production of the models began in the end of 2006 and the first 1,619 units were distributed to students of Integral Medicine in the government program Mission Sucre .
Chavez promised last October to give a computer to every one of the 11,100 students in the second year of the new medical education program Integral Community Medicine ( MIC ) and began to follow through with that promise last May .
" I feel excited because the president came through with his promise , and that makes us be more responsible with the program , more dedicated , since it is a big help that motivates us to keep moving forward , " said one student .
Units have also been given to the Urban Transportation Fund , the Agrarian Bank , the national mail service Ipostel , and the Experimental University of Simon Rodriguez .
And although the first units have been donated to the public sector , the new Bolivarian computers will also be sold inside Venezuela and exported .
" We are working with cooperatives and small companies to form our own distribution network , " said the manager of sales Eduardo Hernandez .
" It 's a slow process .
This month we have already completed the formation ( of a distribution network ) in Caracas and by the end of the year we will have distribution and technical support throughout the whole country . "
The computer factory is located on the Paraguana Peninsula in the state of Falcon and has an annual capacity of 150,000 units .
For this year the factory is expected to assemble 80,000 units and 6,000 laptop computers .
Until now Venezuela has always imported computers both from well - known brands and generic brands from the developed world .
With this new venture the Venezuelan government hopes to diversify national production , integrate national productive chains , and work towards technological independence for the country .
According to the web page of the new state company , VIT has the objective of " production , marketing and sale of technological products , with an emphasis in manufacturing and assembling computers and accessories .
Our efforts are also focused on national export , with a future projection to the international market . "
By the end of the year , the intention is to begin to locally produce some of the technology in order to substitute some of the imported components used in the assembly of the machines for components produced in Venezuela .
In order to do this , the government has built installations for research and development in order to design the components inside the same factory .
The company is offering 3 different desktop models and one laptop with a price range of US $ 405 ( Bs. 870,750 ) to US $ 1,400 ( Bs. 3,010,000 ) .
The processors will range in speed from 1.5 GHz to a 3.0 GHz Intel Pentium IV and the laptop will use a 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor .
With respect to the operating system , Venezuela has taken a strong position in favor of open - source software in order to " promote technological development " and help " reach technological independence . "
For this reason the computers will use the open - source Linux , but the components are also compatible with the Windows operating system .

This past Saturday I decided to trim the dog 's nails .
I do n't do this very often because I have to do it by myself and the dog hates it .
She would rather be whipped with a bullwhip than have her nails trimmed .
I do n't know why ... that 's just one of her quirks .
The dog is a min pin , black , and about 16 pounds of wiry frame and pure muscle .
I start , as I always do , with trying to use treats to get her to comply .
I take her into the bathroom and give her a treat .
I put a treat in the bathtub and put her in there .
So far so good .
I tell her to sit and gave her a treat .
Textbook ... up until this point .
Now comes the fun part .
The dog and I go through the sit - grab paw - stand game .
The dog sits .
I grab a paw and lift it up to try to trim the nails .
The dog stands , which allows her to gain leverage to pull against me .
I push her rear down and she sits again .
Start over .
The problem is that the dog has infinite time in which to play this game and I have other things to do .
The offer of treats is irrelevant ... the dog knows that if she complies the nails will get trimmed , which is tantamount to torture for some reason .
Twenty minutes of this and it's time for plan B .
Oh well , at least I can say I tried .
Plan B involves putting the dog in various wrestling holds that still allow me to hold each paw with one hand and trim the nails with the other .
Unfortunately this has two drawbacks .
One is that the dog can still twitch her legs enough to cause me to trim the nails either too close or not close enough .
The other is that the newly trimmed nails are extremely sharp , so that the dog gains weaponry to use against me as the process continues .
After a wrestling / trimming session that could have headlined as a grudge match on any WWF program , the dog finally has trimmed nails .
Unevenly trimmed , but trimmed none the less .
At least one nail on each paw is trimmed too close , so during the match my white t- shirt has become covered in blood .
My arms and legs are scratched up like I 've been in a fight with a rabid bobcat , I 'm covered in dog hair , and I 'm sweating profusely .
The dog is none the worse for wear except for the fact that she can now walk properly .
I 've had enough of her for the day , so I pick her up to take her out to the back yard .
As I 'm about to put her out , the doorbell rings , which causes her to start barking and writhing around in my arms , giving me a few extra scratches just for good measure .
Out she goes .
I head back to the bathroom to start cleaning up , and the doorbell rings again .
The dog starts barking and jumping on the back door , leaving bloody streaks in the process .
Having already had enough of whoever is at the door , I decide to ignore it .
The doorbell rings again .
Fine .
Anyone but Ed McMahon is going to be sorry .
Still out of breath from the fight , sweating , covered in scratches and blood and hair , and carrying a nail trimming tool in one hand , I fling open the door .
The picture - perfect charismatic family has decided to let the little girl be the front man .
She looks to be about eight years old .
She 's standing on the front porch , while Mom , Dad , and Little Brother - about five - are standing a few feet back on the walkway .
I grit my teeth in my best Dirty Harry impression , look directly at the little girl , and say , " Yes ?
" The boy is n't paying much attention , having found a stick with which to occupy himself , but the other three family members are frozen .
The mom finally pulls the boy back against her leg , but they 're too far from the girl to reach her without stepping closer themselves .
The girl is unable to move .
The dad , showing his true colors , is also petrified .
The mom finally gives him an elbow and he tries to find his voice .
I continue to stare at the little girl .
" Yes , can I help you ?
" The boy finally looks up and sees me .
He starts with a low moaning noise and slowly works up to a scream .
He scampers behind his mom and latches onto her leg so she can't easily move .
Dad gets his voice back and says , " Mm - m - maybe this is a bad time , uh , Lindsay honey come on , let 's go . "
Lindsay is as still as a stone .
Still staring at the girl , I take a step forward onto the welcome mat .
My jaw still locked , speaking through my teeth , I say , " Not at all .
Would you like to come in ?
" Lindsay 's fight - or - flight instinct kicks in , except in her case it 's fight - or - scream .
She lets out a scream that would put Fay Wray to shame .
Then another .
And another .
Dad , figuring he better do something , takes a careful step forward and pulls Lindsay back .
She continues to stare at me and scream as he picks her up .
Little brother is in full scream mode also , and attempts to climb up his mom 's backside .
She almost trips over him trying to get turned around , picks him up and starts trotting away .
Dad follows with the girl .
Bye now !
I go back in and close the door , then go to the window and watch .
Mom and Dad do their best to jog all the way back to their minivan parked across the street a few houses down .
Just as they get to the minivan , Lindsay , who is still looking back toward my house and screaming , pukes all down her dad 's back .
Mom tries to put the boy down , but he 's clinging to her like a monkey .
Dad fishes the keys out of his pocket and they all get in the van .
After a minute Mom and Dad step back out .
Mom 's front is all wet .
Apparently the boy peed all over her .
Dad is covered in puke , and takes off his shirt and leaves it in the street .
Mom and Dad finally get in the van and the family leaves .
I know what 's coming , so I quickly go to the bathroom and jump in the tub where I was trimming the dog 's nails .
I turn on the shower and wash off all the blood and hair .
I hide the wet clothes in the bottom of the hamper and put on an identical white shirt and similar shorts .
My hair is very short , so it dries quickly with just a towel .
I dry the bathtub with the towel as well .
I then go to the back yard with a paper towel and wipe the blood off the back door .
The dog has stopped bleeding by now .
Perfect .
Two minutes later the doorbell rings again .
" Yes officer ? " I say after I open the door .
" Can I help you ? "
He looks me up and down and says there 's been a complaint of something strange going on in the house .
He 's being purposefully vague , so I ask for more details .
He mentions a bloody shirt and points out the scratches on my arms and legs .
" I just finished trimming the dog 's nails and they 're very sharp .
We were playing afterwards and I got scratched up a little . "
I invite him in and he takes a look around .
I take him to the back door and show him the dog .
Then I say , " Oh , I know what they must have seen ... come in here . "
We go to the kitchen and I pull the paper towel out of the trash can .
" See ?
I got a couple of the dog 's nails a little close , and I used this to stop the bleeding .
I must have had it in my hand when I answered the door .
" The officer asks if he can look around the house , and I say he can .
He just kind of walks up the hallway and sticks his head in to give each room a cursory glance .
Satisfied that he 's seen enough , he starts to leave .
I stop him and say , " By the way officer , I have a ' No Soliciting ' sign , and although I 'm aware that the city ordinance says it 's for sales only , I have it there because I do n't wish to be disturbed by anyone .
I imagine other people with those signs feel the same way .
Maybe you could say something to those people ? "
" Will do , " he says as he leaves .
" Thanks for your cooperation .
" I watch out the window again as Mom and Dad , who have returned , gesture towards my house as the officer shakes his head .
Dad starts to get a little hot , and the officer finally points his finger at him and says something .
The officer then shakes his head as he gets in his car and leaves .
It seems he has better things to do than field complaints from overreacting religious nuts .
Mom and Dad get back in their minivan and leave , hopefully having learned their lesson .
So , if you 've been bothered by people from this particular church the last few Saturdays , there 's a good chance you wo n't be bothered any more .
While a trip across Russian countryside a few bears appeared on the road .
The cars pulled to the roadside and started watching what is going to happen .
Bears approached the cars and demanded some food .
The orange bus driver was the bravest .
He has shared his snacks with forest robbers .
After he did this they started eating and people could continue their trip .

AIPAC ’s Influence Continues to Wane
By Allan C. Brownfeld
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) long has been considered one of Washington ’s most effective lobbying groups .
On the surface , it may appear that its influence remains as strong as ever .
At its annual Washington policy conference in March , 6,000 AIPAC members heard Vice President Dick Cheney warn that failure in Iraq would endanger Israel .
Stressing that he stood before the crowd “ as a strong supporter of Israel ” and that “ Israel has never had a better friend in the White House than George Bush , ” Cheney ’s address came at a time of swelling criticism of the Iraq war in the U.S. as a whole and from many quarters in the American Jewish community .
Cheney ’s call on AIPAC to oppose withdrawal from Iraq overshadowed the meeting .
Organizers had hoped the plenum would focus on the need for tough economic sanctions against Iran , without having the effort portrayed publicly as advocating military action against the regime in Tehran .
But attempts to avoid such a perception suffered a blow when Congressional Quarterly reported on AIPAC ’s role in blocking a House proposal that would have required the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval before taking military action against Iran .
Beneath the appearance of continuing power and influence , it is becoming increasingly clear that AIPAC does not in fact represent the views of the constituency in whose name it claims to speak , the American Jewish community .
Rather than supporting AIPAC ’s embrace of the war in Iraq , a recent Gallup Poll placed the American Jewish community at the top of the list of “ major ” religious groups opposed to the war .
The Reform movement — the largest synagogue denomination in the U.S. — has gone on record in opposition to the war .
According to Rabbi Eric Yoffie , president of the Union of Reform Judaism , his group ’s resolution fairly reflects the Jewish community ’s attitude toward the war .
“ It is not us that are out of step with American Jews , ” he said .
AIPAC ’s role is coming under increasing scrutiny , spurred in part by the debate initiated by Professors John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt in their in - depth 2006 study of the Israel lobby , which originally appeared in the London Review of Books ( and was reprinted in the “ Other Voices ” supplement to the May / June 2006 Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , ) .
Mearsheimer and Walt argued , among other things , that AIPAC had encouraged the U.S. to adopt policies that were neither in the American national interest nor in Israel ’s long - term interest .
“ It is suddenly becoming possible to ask hard questions about America ’s relationship with Israel . ”
Despite the widespread criticism which the two professors received from some in the organized Jewish community , the criticism and scrutiny of AIPAC ’s role has increased dramatically in recent months .
Declared New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof : “ There is no serious political debate among either Democrats or Republicans about our policy toward Israelis and Palestinians .
And that silence harms America , Middle East peace prospects and Israel itself .... Within Israel , you hear vitriolic debate in politics and the news media about the use of force and the occupation of Palestinian territories .
Yet no major American candidate is willing today to be half as critical of hard - line Israeli government policies as , say , Haaretz , the Israeli newspaper . ”
One reason for such silence , Kristof wrote , “ is that American politicians have learned to muzzle themselves .
In the run-up to the 2004 presidential primaries Howard Dean said he favored an ” ˜even - handed role ’ for the U.S. — and was blasted as being hostile to Israel .
Likewise , Barack Obama has been scolded for daring to say : ” ˜Nobody is suffering more than the Palestinian people . ’
In contrast , Hillary Rodham Clinton has safely refused to show an inch of daylight between herself and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert . ”
Writing in the April 12 New York Review of Books , George Soros , the billionaire philanthropist and political activist , argued that the U.S. is doing Israel a disservice by allowing it to boycott the Hamas - Fatah Palestinian unity government and to turn down the Saudi Arabian peace initiative .
But , he pointed out , there is no meaningful debate of such policies .
“ While other problem areas of the Middle East are freely discussed , criticism of our policies toward Israel is very muted indeed , ” Soros wrote .
Pro-Israel activists , he added , have been “ remarkably successful in suppressing criticism . ”
Singling out AIPAC as a key source of the problem , Soros accused the lobby of pushing a hawkish agenda on Israeli - Palestinian issues .
“ AIPAC under its current leadership has clearly exceeded its mission , ” he maintained , “ and far from guaranteeing Israel ’s existence , has endangered it . ”
Noting that “ I have a great deal of sympathy for my fellow Jews and a deep concern for the survival of Israel , ” Soros declared that he “ cannot remain silent now when the pro-Israel lobby is one of the last unexposed redoubts of this dogmatic way of thinking ... I believe that a much - needed self - examination of American policy in the Middle East has started in this country ; but it ca n’t make much headway as long as AIPAC retains powerful influence in both the Democratic and Republican parties ... I should like to emphasize that I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel ... Neither Israel ’s policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism .
At the same time , I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel ’s policies , and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby ’s success in suppressing divergent views . ”
In its March 17 issue , The Economist of London devoted a full page to a discussion of the “ changing climate ” facing AIPAC : “ The Iraq debacle has produced a fierce backlash against pro-war hawks , of which AIPAC was certainly one .
It has also encouraged serious people to ask awkward questions about America ’s alliance with Israel .
And a growing number of people want to push against AIPAC .... AIPAC ’s ace in the hole is the idea that it represents Jewish interests in a country that is generally philo - Semitic .
But liberal Jewish groups retort that it represents only a sliver of Jewish opinion .
A number of liberal groups have started to use their political muscle — groups such as the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism , Americans for Peace Now and the Israel Policy Forum .
These groups scored a significant victory over AIPAC by persuading Congress to water down a particularly uncompromising bit of legislation , the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act , which would have prevented any American contact with the Palestinian leadership ...
The growing activism of liberal Jewish groups underline a worrying fact for AIPAC : most Jews are fairly left - wing .
Fully 77 percent of them think that the Iraq war was a mistake compared with 52 percent of all Americans ... ”
Beyond this ,
The Economist declared , “ An even greater threat to AIPAC comes from the general climate of opinion .
It is suddenly becoming possible for serious people — politicians and policymakers as well as academics — to ask hard questions about America ’s relationship with Israel .
Is America pursuing its own interests in the Middle East , or Israel ’s ?
Should America tie itself so closely to the Israeli government ’s policies or should it forge other alliances ?...
The biggest challenge facing AIPAC is how to deal with this changing climate .
Its members have been admirably honest about their mission in life .
They boast about passing more than a hundred bits of pro-Israel legislation a year .
But they are too willing to close down debate with explosive charges of anti-Israel bias when people ask whether this is a good thing .
America needs an open debate about its role in the Middle East — and AIPAC needs to take a positive role in that debate if it is to remain such a mighty force in American politics . ”
Former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski worries that America is seen in the Middle East as “ acting increasingly on behalf of Israel . ”
In his new book , Second Chance : Three Presidents and the Crisis of American Superpower , he calls for “ stricter lobbying laws ” because groups such as AIPAC have too tight a hold on U.S. policy .
It is Brzezinski ’s view that AIPAC has seriously distorted U.S. policy in the Middle East .
Increasingly , more and more Jews feel alienated from Jewish organizations that supported both the Iraq war and Israel ’s war in Lebanon .
“ The virtually unqualified support of organized American Jewry for Israel ’s brutal actions ... is not new but now no longer tolerable to me , ” Sara Roy , a scholar at Harvard ’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies , writes in a new book , The War On Lebanon .
“ The Moderate Jewish Left ”
According to Dan Fleshler , an activist in the pro-Israel peace community , Middle East violence has helped awaken a large “ universe ” of liberal , politically active Jews .
“ Many of them are alienated from Israel and want nothing to do with it , ” he says .
“ Maybe the most important thing to them is the Sierra Club .
They ’re cultural Jews , they ’ve never been involved with Israel per se . ”
Their passivity has allowed right - wing Zionists who care more about the issue to affect policy , Fleshler explains , adding that the challenge to an alternative lobby is figuring out how to capture “ the moderate Jewish left ” on Israel issues .
This past March , while thousands of AIPAC delegates traveled to Capitol Hill to advocate for tough sanctions on Iran and no negotiations with the Palestinian Authority until it renounces terror and recognizes Israel , two other Jewish groups were urging the opposite .
Americans for Peace Now called on the Bush administration to change course and adopt a policy of “ limited , constructive engagement ” with Tehran .
In a statement , the group recommended that the U.S. develop “ a basket of meaningful diplomatic and economic carrots and sticks sufficient to persuade Iran to halt further development of its nuclear program . ”
Another group , Brit Tzedek v’Shalom , urged its supporters to call their senators and tell them not to sign a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , sponsored by Senators Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) and John Ensign ( R - NV ) , calling for “ no direct aid and no contacts ” with any members of the Palestinian Authority “ that does not explicitly and unequivocally recognize Israel ’s right to exist , renounce terror and accept previous agreements . ”
In an e-mail to supporters , Brit Tzedek declared : “ At a time when the U.S. should be supporting forces of moderation among the Palestinians , this letter weakens those forces and demonstrates to the Palestinian people that moderation brings them nothing . ”
M.J. Rosenberg of the Israel Policy Forum headlined a recent column “ Pandering Not Required . ”
In it he called on presidential candidates instead to show their support for Israel by pledging : “ If I am elected president , I will do everything in my power to bring about negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians with the goal of achieving peace and security for Israel and a secure state for the Palestinians . ”
Explaining how far AIPAC ’s positions are from the American Jewish mainstream , columnist Douglas Bloomfield wrote in the March 15 Washington Jewish Week that , “ Most American Jews , like the rest of the country , oppose the Iraq war , but [ Israeli Prime Minister ]
Olmert gave it a ringing endorsement in his live satellite hook - up to AIPAC .. that could have been written by Dick Cheney ...
Olmert ’s over - the - top embrace of the Bush policies is one more example of how the Israeli government is out of touch with the mainstream of American Jewry .
His intervention in the most explosive issue before this nation is sure to give a lot of Israel ’s friends in Washington serious heartburn . ”
Bloomfield went on to point out that “ Most Americans support a peace process leading to a two - state solution , and they see settlements as an obstacle to that goal — which is what backers intended .
Settlements have never been popular among most American Jews ( or Israelis these days ) , and Olmert ’s recent decision to expand them did not sit well in the Jewish community .
More damaging may be the perception of excessive Israeli government tolerance of settler violence against Palestinians , which reinforces the belief there is a double standard for justice in Israeli society .
Most American Jews are uncomfortable with AIPAC’s and the Israeli government ’s warm embrace of the religious right .
AIPAC delegates ... enthusiastically cheered a speech by evangelical Pastor John Hagee , who railed against territorial concessions to the Palestinians as ” ˜appeasement ’ and ” ˜crocodile food . ’
Most American Jews are progressives and uncomfortable with the alliance with evangelicals like Hagee ; and do n’t share his hard - line views about peace with the Palestinians and have less to agree about on domestic policy . ”
Not only is AIPAC not representative of the constituency in whose name it professes to speak , but its former foreign policy chief , Steve Rosen , and its former Iran analyst , Keith Weissman , are now being prosecuted by the U.S. government for allegedly sharing classified U.S. information about Iran with Israeli diplomats , journalists and others .
By any standard , AIPAC appears , more and more , to be a rogue organization speaking only for a narrow extremist constituency both in Israel and the U.S.
As this reality becomes increasingly clear , its influence is likely to recede dramatically .

Contributed by merdely on 2007 - 09 - 15 from the pretty - cool - compiler dept .
Anders Magnusson 's BSD - licensed pcc compiler has been imported into CVS .
He wrote to NetBSD 's tech - toolchain list :
It is not yet bug - free , but it can compile the i386 userspace .
The big benefit of it ( apart from that it 's BSD licensed , for license geeks :-) is that it is fast , 5 - 10 times faster than gcc , while still producing reasonable code .
The only optimization added so far is a multiple - register - class graph - coloring register allocator , which may be one of the best register allocators today .
Conversion to SSA format is also implemented , but not yet the phi function .
Not too difficult though , after that strength reduction is high on the list .
Anders continues :
It is also quite simple to port , writing the basics for i386 took three hours ( hello world ) and complete port ( pretty much as it is right now ) two days .
I have added most of the C99 stuff ( it is supposed to be a c99 compiler ) but some stuff is still missing , like the ability to do variable declarations anywhere ( requires some rewriting of the yacc code ) .
NetBSD also imported pcc into pkgsrc .
The commit message gives a little bit of pcc 's history :
The compiler is based on the original Portable C Compiler by S. C. Johnson , written in the late 70's .
Even though much of the compiler has been rewritten , some of the basics still remain .
The intention is to write a C99 compiler while still keeping it small , simple , fast and understandable .
I think of it as if it shall be able to compile and run on PDP11 ( even if it may not happen in reality ) .
But with this in mind it becomes important to think twice about what algorithms are used .
The compiler is conceptually structured in two parts ; pass1 which is language - dependent , does parsing , typechecking and build trees , and pass2 which is mostly language - independent .
About 50 % of the frontend code and 80 % of the backend code has been rewritten .
Most stuff is written by me , with the exception of the data - flow analysis part and the SSA conversion code which is written by Peter A Jonsson , and the Mips port that were written as part of a project by undergraduate students at LTU .
Otto Moerbeek ( otto@ ) wrote to the pcc mailing list :
It ’s only been a few months since the discovery of ice geysers on Saturn ’s moon Enceladus , and now this dynamic process is turning up all over the Solar System .
Astronomers think they ’ve found a similar phenomenon on one of the strangest places : welling up from the surface of Pluto ’s moon Charon .
The discovery was made using the Gemini Observatory ’s adaptive optics system from atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
The telescope picked out large deposits of ammonia hydrates and water crystals spread out across the surface of the icy moon .
Scientists think that water mixing with ice deep underneath Charon ’s surface is causing this material to push up through the moon ’s ultra -cold surface .
This action could be happening quickly , taking just a few hours or even days .
Over time , this process could give Charon a new surface one millimetre thick every 100,000 years .
Of course , if Charon has this process going on , something similar could be happening across the Kuiper Belt .
The discoverers believe there ’s a dynamic process going on here because Charon ’s surface does n’t appear to be “ primordial ice ” ; ice that was created during the formation of the Solar System .
Instead , it ’s much more crystalline in appearance , and must have formed recently .
The next step will be to examine other Kuiper Belt objects , like Quaoar and Orcus – both are larger than 500 km ( 310 miles ) across .
Of course , the best thing would be to send a spacecraft and see these bodies up close .
It ’s very convenient , then , that NASA ’s New Horizon spacecraft is on its way , and will make a flyby in about a decade .

Briliance BS6 Crash Test in Spain - 3 Stars
Briliance BS6 Crash Test in Germany - 1 Star
As we reported yesterday Chinese automaker Brilliance appears to have addressed a number of the shortcomings in its BS6 sedan that caused it to spectacularly fail a Euro NCAP crash test conducted earlier this year by Germany 's ADAC .
The car has been re-tested , this time in Spain ( again , according to Euro NCAP standards ) , and has now received a 3 - star crash rating
We now have video of the new test regimen , and it 's embedded after the jump along with the original German one for comparison .
As you can see , the BS6 fares much better this time around , with the car holding up a lot better from the A - pillar and back .
In the photo above from China Car Times , the doors all opened properly following the crash .
Whether other Chinese automakers will look at the Brilliance saga and learn from it is unknown .
For its part , Brilliance appears to have learned a hard lesson .
If you want to sell cars in lucrative Western markets , they need to perform better than papier mâché sculptures in crash tests .
Follow the jump for videos of the crash tests , old and new .

Lies , More Lies , and Damn Lies

As Americans turn increasingly against President George Bush ’s calamitous war in Iraq , and revolt spreads through Republican ranks , the White House is again resorting to its tried - and - true ploy of fanning grossly inflated fears of terrorism .
The president just made two preposterous claims last week that insult the intelligence of his listeners .
First , Bush insisted US forces in Iraq are fighting " the same people who staged 9/11 . "
Second , withdrawing US forces from Iraq , as the Democratic - controlled Congress is urging , means " surrendering Iraq to al - Qaida . "
These canards mark the latest steps in the Bush administration ’s evolving efforts to mislead Americans into believing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are all part of a global fight against al - Qaida .
When marketers want to change the name of an existing product , they first place a new name in small type below the existing one .
They gradually shrink the old name , and enlarge the new one until the original name vanishes .
That ’s what ’s been happening in Iraq .
When the US invaded , Iraqis who resisted were initially branded " Saddam loyalists , " " die - hard Ba’athists , " or , in Don Rumsfeld ’s colorful terminology , " dead- enders . "
Next , the Pentagon and US media called the Iraqi resistance , " terrorists " or " insurgents . "
The reason for invading Iraq , the White House insisted , was all about removing the tyrant Saddam , seizing weapons of mass destruction , defending humans rights and implanting democracy .
Then , a tiny , previously unknown Iraqi group that had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden appropriated the name , " al - Qaida in Mesopotamia . "
This was such a breathtakingly convenient gift to the Bush Administration , many cynics suspected a false - flag operation created by CIA and Britain ’s wily MI6 .
Soon after , the White House and Pentagon began calling most of Iraq ’s 22 plus resistance groups , " al - Qaida . "
The US media eagerly joined this deception , even though 95 % of Iraq ’s resistance groups had no sympathy for bin Laden ’s movement .
Watch any US network TV news report on Iraq and you will inevitably hear reporters parroting Pentagon handouts about US forces " launching a new offensive against al - Qaida . "
Al - Qaida in Mesopotamia did n’t even exist before 9/11 , but that did n’t stop President Bush from trying to gull credulous voters .
He simply ignored the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate that found US - occupied Iraq had become an " incubator " for violent anti-American groups .
If the US were to withdraw from Iraq tomorrow , the nation would be split between warring Shia , Sunni and Kurdish parties .
The fake Al - Qaida in Iraq would end up at the bottom of the totem pole , or be wiped out by other Iraqis .
Even Osama bin Laden and his number two , Dr. Ayman al - Zawahiri , have blasted the phony al - Qaida in Iraq and called for an end to its attacks on Iraqi civilians .
Polls show that in spite of a mountain of evidence to the contrary , White House disinformation strategy has worked .
Today , an amazing 60 % of Americans still believe Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks .
At least that ’s down from the 80 % who originally believed this Orwellian big lie in 2003 .
The White House continues to blur the facts and make Americans believe Iraq and Afghanistan are " central fronts in the global war on terror . "
The fact recent polls found 60 % of Americans — and 90 % of US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan — still believe Saddam and bin Laden had colluded to launch 9/11 is shocking , but not surprising .
Ignorance of foreign affairs and mindless flag waving are as American as apple pie .
Tens of millions of Americans are fed a steady diet of political or religious ideology disguised as news from the administration ’s house organ , Fox News ; from evangelical Christian TV and radio ; or from the neoconservative ’s version of Pravda , the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial pages .
The rest are too busy watching brain - deadening TV pap to pay the least attention to events overseas .
They remain unaware the faux " war against global terror " is now costing a mind - boggling US $ 12 billion monthly , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service .
That ’s the cost of 3 nuclear - powered " Nimitz " class 97,000 - ton aircraft carriers every month .
The Bush Administration has spent $ 610 billion dollars since 2001 on its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , making them the second most expensive conflict in US history after World War II .
Last week , US Homeland Security Czar Michael Chertoff allowed he had a " gut feeling " that an al - Qaida attack on America was imminent this summer .
At the same time , Washington was abuzz with a leaked US intelligence report that al - Qaida — the objective of the so - called war on terror — had reconstituted and was as strong as prior to 9/11 , 2001 .
America ’s sixteen intelligence agencies spend $ 40 billion annually , with another $ 15 — 20 billion in their hidden " black budgets . "
Homeland Security spends $ 44.6 billion .
In spite of these gargantuan expenditures of a trillion dollars — that ’s $ 1,000,000,000,000 — the best intelligence Czar Chertoff can come up with is " gut feeling ? "
One suspects Chertoff ’s worried stomach has far more to do with the growing Republican Party revolt against the president ’s Iraq war than nebulous threats from Osama bin Laden ’s loud but tiny group .
Polls show the only area where Republicans still command popular support is the " war on terror . "
So Bush / Cheney & Co. are trying to use al - Qaida to scare Americans to vote Republican , just as they did prior to 2004 elections .
It worked well last time and got Bush reelected .
But Americans are increasingly leery of the White House ’s crying wolf .
Many are also asking how Bush could claim " steady progress " was being made in his wars when it appears the al - Qaida movement is back to pre-2001 strength , anti-American groups are popping up across Asia and Africa , and Iraq is a bloody mess .
After six years of conflict , 3,600 dead and 25,000 wounded American soldiers , expenditure of $ 610 billion , tens of thousands of dead Iraqis and Afghans , collapse of Mideast peace efforts , and a Muslim World enraged against the US , nothing positive seems to have been accomplished by a leader who likes to style himself , " the war president . "
As the White House now ponders an attack on Iran , we would do well to recall the famed words of King Pyrrhus of Epirus , " one more such victory and we are ruined . "
The Best of Eric S. Margolis
Nice piece in the New York Times about a Czech photographer who worked in the 60s and 70s using homemade cameras , one of them shown here .
They are a wonderful example of street use .
The Times said , “ he fashioned them from shoeboxes , toilet - paper rolls and plexiglass , polishing the lenses with toothpaste and cigarette ash . ”
The guy was a bit of a pervert .
He took low - res images of pretty girls on the street , in cafes , and on buses .
“ His photographs may look naïve , but they ’re the product of a carefully orchestrated series of missteps that begins with crude , homemade cameras .
As he says in the film , “ If you want to be famous , you must do something more badly than anybody in the entire world . ” ”
Still , his cameras are cool .

There ’s an emerging category of street technology which might be called Jailhouse Tech .
The material constraint of a prison inspire fantastic innovation and re-use of made parts .
A lot of the devices made in this manner are crude weapons , but others include eating implements , tattoo instruments , music , and other tools .
Here are some examples from a prison in Mexico City by Gabriella Gomez - Mont .
Electric cooking stove made with wire and brick .
From the fantastic interview with the artist who works in this prison and who facilitated the photographer who shot these images :
Now that it is over and done with I can tell you this .
For the eight prisoners that helped us it would have easily meant another extra seven years in jail , and for us instant lock - up until they set bail .
Especially because of having in our possession — or even presence –those knives made from the metallic edges of the windows !
In there , they menace and kill people with those , we would all gotten into so much trouble if we had been caught with them .
I do n’t even know if those particular knives that we photographed that day had already been used for some sort of bloody business or not , I preferred not to ask ; but it would have been even worse .
Weapons .

Dornbracht , a German manufacturer of bath and kitchen fixtures is presenting a exhibit called “ Global Street Food ” which has removed street food carts from the streets and spotlighted them in a gallery on Dornbracht ’s campus .
I wish I had thought to photograph the many wonderful carts I had seen in my travels , but it never occurred to me then .
Here is grill from Kampala , Uganda .
And a cheese and sausage cart from Buenos Aires .
If you have photographs of interesting street food carts send ( or point ) them to me , and I ’ll post .

Thomas Kalak is a photographer from Munich , Germany who specializes in the offbeat .
His subject is the curious art of found technology .
He ’s accumulated a magnificent gallery of old American cars in Cuba called “ Havana Oldtimers “ .
In Thailand he focuses on the often - seen but rarely - noticed jumble of wires that weave their way overhead every street .
Adhoc in design , these almost organic nests have their own charm if you let them seduce you .
Kalak has collected an entire portfolio of Bangkok Wires .
These and more are included in a new book about Thailand called “ Thailand — Same Same , But Different .
No cliches here .
No lovely maids , palm beaches or grand temples .
Instead Kalak captures odd moments of street use .
Plastic chairs in alleys ; traffic cone patterns .
Even the locals are blind to their off - center beauty .
Kalak has a keen eye for the way folks improvise .
I think of this work as improv zen .
The ubiquitous plastic bag becomes an instant cheap bottle if you add a straw .
And you can hang it anywhere .
Owner - built key ring boards .
I think these are home - made brake lights .
Suspended by a wire , a bulb inside a bottle covered with read plastic will light up at night .
Filled with water this can keeps the table cloth from blowing away .
A mop made from old socks !!
Reflectors made from CDs .

What do you do if you have a locked gate but more than one person is permitted to open it ?
You do n’t want multiple keys , in case one is lost / stolen .
Then all the keys may need replacing .
Instead you can have multiple locks , chained into one long lock .
Open any lock to open the gate .
This way each person needs to manage their key ( and lock ) .
I ’ve seen various installations on this solution in different parks in the Bay Area .

Pico are hand built sound systems erected in chiva , or local bus / truch transport , in Cartegena , Colombia .
The large speakers and boom boxes are tricked out like juke boxes , and the entire brightly painted chiva becomes a music hall .
I could only find a few photos ( email me if you find more ) .
Here is an abstract of a scholarly examination of the tech culture .
Sound Systems , World Beat and Diasporan Identity in Cartagena , Colombia
Deborah Pacini Hernandez in Diaspora : Volume 5 , Number 3 , Winter 1996 Afro-Caribbean music plays a large role iin Cartagena , Colombia , a city with a large population of African origin .
Hernandez details the ways in which the Colombian recording and broadcast industries resisted the dissemination of such music , and discusses the material practices centered around picos , locally constructed sound - systems , through which African - Colombians acquired , reproduced , disseminated , and transformed recorded diasporan musics .
She notes that the black Cartageneros ’ production of such music systems preceded the appearance of world beat in northern contexts by almost a decade , and traces their acknowledgment of and participation in a diasporic Afro- Caribbean identity based on musica africana .

Over at Treehugger , Warren McLaren has rounded up all the examples of this ingenious , indigenous , “ labor - saving ” invention that he could find .
It is apparent that thousands of people who have to mow the lawn decided there must be an easier way and had exactly the same idea :
Why not hook the mower to a bike ?
And so the bikemower is born in a thousand of garages around the country .
Judging from the pictures , they are still in the garages .
Most of the pics rounded up by McLaren look as if they were taken at garage sales .
I have my doubts that the bike mower is very useful , or easier to use than pushing on your feet .
For the full set see the Treehuger post above .

This prototype of a prototypical street cart is artist Mouna Andraos ’ idea .
From the artist ’s proposal : “ An old idea from yesterday ’s streets adapted to serve the needs of today ’s urban dwellers , the Power Cart is a mobile unit that delivers alternative power to people in the streets .
Street vendors have traditionally played an important role in defining the urban environment and often speak to the current social and cultural context of a city .
In most parts of the world ( and if the weather permits it ) , the street is a place where social interactions abound and where commerce rules , and street vendors around the globe bring to local populations the things they need right at their door steps .
Knife sharpening in India , refills of gas in Africa , fake Gucci bags in Paris and chair massages in New York , the Power Cart looks and feels like another service for the city of today .
Need a charge on your cell phone ?
Your laptop is about to die and you really need to check that email ?
Or maybe there is no power around you at all ?
Where ever you might be in the world , hail the Power Cart for a quick fix .
Let the Power Cart owner turn the crank for you and get the electricity you need , one minute of cranking at a time . ”

Legal expert : White House stonewalling may force Congress to charge president with criminal offenses David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This Keith Olbermann announced on Wednesday 's Countdown that the White House is refusing on grounds of executive privilege to honor Senate subpoenas and release documents relating to its warrantless wiretapping .
In addition , Vice President Cheney 's chief of staff , David Addington , has sent a letter to Sen .
John Kerry ( D - MA ) saying Cheney 's office will not comply with oversight by the National Archives because it is not " an agency . "
Olbermann then turned to law professor Joanathan Turley , who agreed tentatively that the administration might move slowly enough to " run out the clock " on its time in office .
" But there is one thing that might concern them about the court , " Turley said , " and that is , you know , for many years , since we first found out about this program , some of us have said that this was a clearly criminal act that the president called for .
...
If we 're right , not only did he order that crime , but it would be , in fact , an impeachable offense . "
" Both sides , both Democrats and Republicans , have avoided this sort of pig in the parlor , " Turley continued .
" They do n't want to recognize that this president may have ordered criminal offenses .
But they may now be on the road to do that , because the way Congress can get around the executive privilege in court is to say , we 're investigating a potential crime . "
Olbermann went on to joke that the attempt to pin down Cheney 's real nature is starting to sound like a game of 20 Questions .
Turley laughed and said , " The position adopted by Mr. Addington and Mr. Cheney , to put it bluntly , was absurd .
...
In past administrations , if someone like Mr. Addington made such a moronic argument as this one , they would be out of a job the next week .
... I think that what it really shows is the lack of sort of adult supervision within the administration . "
Olbermann probed further into why Cheney has given up claiming he is not part of the executive branch but is still not complying with the order .
" Is this an attempt to stop what Congressman Emanuel talked about yesterday , cutting off the funding ?
Is it just more smokescreen ? "
" This administration , I have to say , has a certain contempt for the law , " said Turley .
" They treat it like some of my criminal defendents used to treat it .
...
They come up with any argument that might work .
...
It 's a sort of shocking development .
...
But at the end of the day , they will lose , and they 're making the situation worse . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on June 27 .
Pressure in the United States and Iraq for deadlines comes during a buildup of American and Iraqi troops to buttress the latest security plan for the capital .
Three additional American brigades , a total of about 7,000 troops , have already been deployed in and around Baghdad , and two more are scheduled to arrive in the next two months .
The increase appears to have led to a limited reduction in violence in Baghdad , particularly in the kinds of assassinations for which Shiite militias have most often been blamed .
But American and Iraqi forces have not been able to stop the car bombings and suicide attacks attributed to the Sunni Arab - led insurgency .
Bridges were the targets of two suicide bombings on Friday in a neighborhood on the southern fringe of Baghdad , killing at least 22 people and wounding at least 50 , an Interior Ministry official said .
Military pressure on Baghdad has driven some Sunni Arab militants to Diyala Province , north of the capital , where they have joined a worsening battle between Sunni and Shiite militias .
The challenge to the American and Iraqi military in Diyala was underscored Friday by the American military commander in northern Iraq , Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon , who said he had asked for more troops to join the fight in the province .
The level of violence in Diyala , already high , has increased since the start of the American - led security crackdown in mid-February , making it one of the most lethal regions in Iraq for American troops .
“ I do not have enough soldiers right now in Diyala Province to get that security situation moving , ” General Mixon said .
“ We have plans to put additional forces in that region . ”
He declined to provide details about possible future deployments .
But he insisted that a cornerstone of the country ’s long - term security would be a sustained American presence .
“ We just ca n’t think about pulling out of here just like that , ” he said .
The American military command said two soldiers were killed and 11 wounded in two attacks on Thursday , one in Baghdad and the other in Diyala .
The Interior Ministry official said at least 17 bodies had been recovered from streets around Baghdad .
The Home Office is considering giving the police the power to take a DNA sample on the street , without taking the suspect to a police station , as well as taking samples from suspects in relatively minor offences such as littering , speeding or not wearing a seat belt .
The move comes as an official genetics watchdog prepares a public inquiry into the police national DNA database , following concern over the retention of samples from people acquitted of any offence , and disclosure that the database holds DNA records for one in three of British black males .
The database is the largest in the world , with 3.4 m profiles , more than 5 % of the UK population .
If the powers are granted , it would expand massively .
Baroness Kennedy , chair of the Human Genetics Commission , said the power of the police in England and Wales to take DNA samples from any arrested individual without requiring their assent was unrivalled in the world .
" We want to ensure the public voice is heard on issues people think are relevant .
The Citizen 's Inquiry is likely to grapple with issues such as whether storing the DNA profiles of victims and suspects who are not charged , or who are subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing , is justified by the need to fight crime . "
She added that under law it was very difficult , and sometimes impossible , to have your sample removed .
" On the other hand a steadily increasing number of serious crimes , including murder and rapes , are being solved and criminals brought to justice with its help .
It is likely that the use of DNA information by police authorities for criminal intelligence purposes will grow .
It is therefore vital that the public are able to voice their views . "
The inquiry will recruit representative panels of the public to consider social and ethical issues in police use of DNA .
The initiative comes as the Home Office finishes consulting on police powers to extend use of the DNA database , with a view to legislation this autumn .
The results show wide support from the police to take DNA , fingerprints and footwear impressions on the street to confirm identity and check against the national database , and support to lower the threshold to take in suspects in minor offences .
A Home Office paper summarising the consultation said respondents " welcomed the ability to reduce the threshold , including to the extent of allowing for the taking of fingerprints , DNA and footwear impressions for non-recordable offenses for the purpose of offender identification and searching databases " .
It adds : " The second issue relates to the taking of fingerprints , photographs and samples on the street .
This was welcomed at an operational level as a means of increasing officer confidence in knowing who they are dealing with and enabling them to deal more effectively with the incident at the scene . "
I 've been troubleshooting a bit of JavaScript lately , so I 've enabled script debugging in IE7 .
Whenever the browser encounters a JavaScript error on a web page , instead of the default , unobtrusive little status bar notification ..
.. I now get one of these glaring , modal error debug notification dialogs :
I left this setting enabled out of pure forgetfulness .
Browsing the web this way , I quickly realized that the web is full of JavaScript errors .
You can barely click through three links before encountering a JavaScript error of one kind or another .
Often they come in pairs , triplets , sometimes dozens of them .
It 's nearly impossible to navigate the web with JavaScript error notification enabled .
JavaScript errors are so pervasive , in fact , that it 's easy to understand why IE demotes them to nearly invisible statusbar elements .
If they did n't , nobody would be able to browse the web without getting notified to death .
Firefox goes even further : there 's no visible UI whatsoever for any JavaScript errors on the current web page .
You have to open the Tools | Error Console dialog to see them .
The upshot of this is that JavaScript errors , unless they result in obvious functional problems , tend to go unnoticed .
Things that would cause showstopping compiler errors in any other language are at worst minor inconveniences in JavaScript .
When errors are ignored by default , what you end up with is an incredibly tolerant , extremely permissive programming ecosystem .
If it works , it works , errors be damned .
But this unparallelled flexibility has its price .
Just ask Dave Murdock , who found out the hard way how flexible JavaScript can be .
So I dug into the code , which I had n't written , and I saw JavaScript similar to this in the execution path that was causing Firefox to hang : var startIndex = 0 ; for ( i = start Index ; i < end Index ; i++ ) { // do some stuff here }
This works fine in Internet Explorer 7 .
What happens in Firefox ?
i is reinitialized to startIndex after every run of the loop .
You have to declare the loop like this for it to work : var startIndex = 0 ; for ( var i = startIndex ; i < end Index ; i++ ) { // do some stuff here }
Putting the var before i is the way it ought to be as far as I can tell , but both Internet Explorer and Firefox do the wrong thing by developers here .
Both browsers should be sticklers about requiring var in a loop variable declaration and produce a clear JavaScript interpreter error before the code has the chance to run .
It 's not just JavaScript .
HTML and CSS are incredibly forgiving of errors as well .
Ned Batchelder observed bizarrely tolerant behavor when specifying named colors that do n't exist .
Consider this small snippet of HTML :
< font color= 'red ' > █
This is RED </ font >
As you vary the named color , you do n't get the error you might expect .
What you do get is weird colors :
Firefox IE7 Opera red Ã¢â €“ Ë† # ff0000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # ff0000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # ff0000 seagreen Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 2e8b57 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 2e8b57 Ã¢â €
“ Ë† # 2e8b57 sea green Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0e00ee Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0e00ee Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0ea00e sxbxxsreen Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0000e0 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0000e0 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00b000 sxbxxsree Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00000e Ã¢â €
“ Ë† # 0b00ee Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00b000 sxbxxsrn Ã¢â € “ Ë† #000000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0b0000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00b000 sxbxeen Ã¢â € “ Ë† #000e00 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0bee00 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00b0ee sreen Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00ee00 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00ee00 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 00ee00 ffff00 Ã¢â €“ Ë† # ffff00 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # ffff00 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # ffff00 xf8000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0f8000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† # 0f8000 Ã¢â € “ Ë† #0f8000
( If you 're curious how " sea green " can possibly equate to blue , the answers are in the comments to Ned 's post . )
I can't think of any other programming environment that goes to such lengths to avoid presenting error messages , that tries so hard to make broken code work , at least a little .
Although there was a push to tighten up HTML into the much more strictly enforced XHTML , it 's an utter failure .
If you 're not convinced , read Mark Pilgrim 's thought experiment :
Imagine that you posted a long rant about how [ strict XHTML validation ] is the way the world should work , that clients should be the gatekeepers of wellformedness , and strictly reject any invalid XML that comes their way .
You click Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœPublish ' , you double - check that your page validates , and you merrily close your laptop and get on with your life .
A few hours later , you start getting email from your readers that your site is broken .
Some of them are nice enough to include a URL , others simply scream at you incoherently and tell you that you suck .
( This part of the thought experiment should not be terribly difficult to imagine either , for anyone who has ever dealt with end - user bug reports . )
You test the page , and lo and behold , they are correct : the page that you so happily and validly authored is now not well - formed , and it not showing up at all in any browser .
You try validating the page with a third - party validator service , only to discover that it gives you an error message you 've never seen before and that you do n't understand .
Unfortunately , the Draconians won : when rendering as strict XHTML , any error in your page results in a page that not only does n't render , but also presents a nasty error message to users .
They may not have realized it at the time , but the Draconians inadvertently destroyed the future of XHTML with this single , irrevocable decision .
The lesson here , it seems to me , is that forgiveness by default is absolutely required for the kind of large - scale , worldwide adoption that the web enjoys .
The permissive , flexible tolerance designed into HTML and JavaScript is alien to programmers who grew up being regularly flagellated by their compiler for the tiniest of mistakes .
Some of us were punished so much so that we actually started to like it .
We point and laugh at the all the awful HTML and JavaScript on the web that barely functions .
We scratch our heads and wonder why the browser can't give us the punishment we so richly deserve for our terrible , terrible mistakes .
Even though programmers have learned to like draconian strictness , forgiveness by default is what works .
It 's here to stay .
We should learn to love our beautiful soup instead .
The discovery was made by a team of Italian volunteers who had flown in to help with the relief efforts .
The three , who work for the Protezione Nazionale agency , came to the UK with a hovercraft they use for flood searches .
The grim find underlined the severity of the flooding , which began in Yorkshire and Humberside a month ago .
At least six other adults have died since intense rainstorms struck the country .
One man died trying to unblock a storm drain in Hull , another was swept up in the River Leen near Nottingham , and a man in his sixties was found drowned in Lincolnshire .
In Sheffield , a 14 - year - old boy died after being swept away when the River Sheaf burst its banks .
In the more recent flooding , a father and son lost their lives as they were pumping water from a submerged room at Tewkesbury Rugby Club .
In addition , twins born prematurely in a flood - stranded area of the town failed to survive , despite having been airlifted to hospital by an RAF rescue crew .
Some 130,000 homes in Gloucestershire were still without fresh water yesterday , and the Met Office warned of further heavy rain last night and this morning , threatening to undo last week 's salvage and rescue work .
The Environment Agency , facing criticism for its response to the earlier floods , announced it was working to clear grills and unblock drains , as well as ' checking sandbag and pump availability ' .
Though counselling ' vigilance ' rather than ' alarm ' , it said water levels could rise ' very quickly ' and warned that ' flash flooding caused by surface water ' was possible .
Redoubling the pressure on the agency , a report in today 's Sunday Times alleges that its chief executive , Baroness Young , picked up a £ 24,000 bonus only days before the flooding began .
Engineers for the Severn Trent water company said last week they hoped to repair a key , flood - damaged treatment station and to begin restoring water to the affected homes by this Tuesday .
But with new downpours threatened , the company 's engineers , backed by the military , were busy yesterday installing new flood defences at the station .
The threat of more rain coincided with warnings that the cost of the past month 's flooding - first in the north , and more recently in Gloucestershire , Oxfordshire and other southern and central areas - would run into billions of pounds .
However , the national water regulator , Ofwat , was quick to reject suggestions by Young that water prices would have to rise to allow companies to invest in infrastructure to deal with future flooding .
A spokeswoman said the companies already had £ 1bn to spend on sewage system improvements and related projects , and that the firms ' insurance would cover immediate costs .
She said no change would be made until the next five - year price review in 2009 .
The deluge is also set to revive the debate over plans to build hundreds of thousands of affordable houses , many on flood plains .
A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said it was ' strongly urging ' the government against building in ' high flood risk ' areas .
While it 's still a teaser at the moment , John Nack ( senior product manager for Photoshop ) has confirmed the development of Photoshop Express .
It 's a free online photo editor that 's not meant to replace Adobe 's current offerings , but " make Adobe imaging technology immediately accessible to large numbers of people . "
And from the screenshot here you can tell it's not even a dumbed - down Photoshop , but an entirely new product ( that reminds us of something from the new iLIfe ) .

The announcement follows Adobe 's implementation of Premiere Express , their online video editor , and it signifies a fairly progressive market plan by Adobe .
In a content creation culture where every teen is a video editor , the democratization of powerful multimedia tools online allows Adobe to reach out to this new generation without abandoning their industry professional bread and butter .
And it makes us want to remind kids that we once edited a movie on a VCR ( after walking 30 miles barefoot in the snow , aiming our kite for lightning to capture the electricity to do our work ) .

When the violent strand of Islam eventually collapses of its inherent contradiction , that day may have been foreseen in the siege at Pakistan 's Red Mosque .
If the military uses wise tactics to end the siege well , civilization will be the victor .
The standoff began after the mosque 's radical jihadists began to escalate their terrorizing of citizens in the capital , Islamabad .
For months , the Muslim militants had been sending self - appointed vice squads onto the streets to enforce their strict version of Islamic law .
They accused women of being prostitutes , burned music discs , and abducted police .
Pakistani society , which prefers democracy over sharia vigilantism , was fed up .
When the military finally decided to crack down last week , the militants showed what they were really made of :
They are using women as hostages .
And one of their leaders , senior cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz , tried to sneak out of the compound in women 's clothing , covered in a burqa and wearing high heels .
For all of his past sermonizing on keeping the sexes separate , his attempted escape in drag revealed the underlying farce of Islamic holy war .
The mosque and its religious schools ( madrassas ) are a key part of Pakistan 's long history of dealing with militant Islam , going back to its support of Islamic fighters against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and then the post -Soviet Taliban regime .
Since the Sept. 11 attacks , however , President Pervez Musharraf has tried to break the link between the military 's intelligence services and Muslim radicals .
The Red Mosque siege represents a firm , public stand by the government to weed out the militants before they threaten Pakistani society itself .
If Mr. Musharraf succeeds in ending the standoff with little bloodshed , the victory will send a strong message to anyone trying to turn Pakistan into " Talistan . "
Other stark standoffs between violent , totalitarian Islam and civilized society are currently happening in several Muslim lands .
Lebanon 's military is trying to end the hold of Islamic militants on a Palestinian refugee camp .
Secular Palestinian leaders have successfully isolated the Sunni radical group Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
And in Saudi Arabia , more and more citizens are challenging the mutawiyin , or the nonuniformed religious militia who enforce the radical Wahhabi form of Sunni Islam on public behavior .
Pakistan has many more radical groups it will need to confront , especially along the border with Afghanistan and at dozens of Muslim seminaries that teach violent tactics .
The nation 's problem is compounded by the bungled attempts of Musharraf , who is both president and chief of the army , to restore a full democracy in Pakistan after his eight years in power .
So far , he has shown restraint during their siege of the Red Mosque , a move that only helps to show the militants ' moral weakness and allows more of those holed up inside to think twice and escape .
He has the quiet support of much of Pakistan 's political opposition .
This crisis also represents , in a microcosm , an attempt by the world 's 1 billion , mainly moderate Muslims to stand up to zealots .
Al Qaeda and other such groups have lost their " war " to create a united Muslim state because of their violent , antidemocratic tactics .
It only takes a civilized response to reveal their lack of appeal .
Iraq
War supporters , opponents disagree on GAO report David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 31 , 2007
Print This Email This The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the leaked draft of a Governmental Accountability Office progress report on Iraq concludes that " Iraq has failed to meet all but three of 18 congressionally mandated benchmarks . "
That report , while welcomed by critics of the war , has already been disputed by the Pentagon and dismissed by administration officials on the grounds that the benchmarks set unrealistic goals .
CNN spoke on Friday with Michael O'Hanlon , co-author with Kenneth Pollack of a controversial July 31 New York Times op - ed , " A War We Just Might Win , " which claimed that " we were surprised by the gains we saw [ in Iraq ] and the potential to produce ... a sustainable stability , " O'Hanlon disputed the GAO report 's conclusions , saying , " For their allegation that there 's no progress whatsoever in the security environment to be true would mean that every person I spoke to in Iraq was wrong . "
He contrasted General Petraeus 's recent claim of a 75 % reduction in sectarian killings in Baghdad since last winter with the report 's assessment of no progress on security and suggested that this discrepancy could undermine the credibility of the report as a whole .
The Pentagon has recently been accused of using " fuzzy math " to minimize the number of deaths classified as " religious and ethnic killings . "
Keith Olbermann also discussed the draft GAO report , on Thursday 's Countdown , suggesting that President Bush is already seeking to water it down before its official release and that someone at GAO might have leaked the it to the Post out of fear it would be " neutered . "
Olbermann further cited an internal White House memo , obtained by the Associated Press , which suggests the administration is preparing to downplay the meaningfulness of the Iraq benchmarks .
He pointed out , however , that President Bush himself had called those benchmarks " a clear roadmap to help the Iraqis secure their country and strengthen their young democracy " when he agreed to them last May .
" Does that not make it difficult for the White House to argue now that this GAO report will not present a true picture of the situation in Iraq ? "
Olbermann asked MSNBC analyst General Wesley Clark " Exactly right , " replied Clark .
" They should not be able to squirm out from underneath these standards .
...
The American people are making a judgment every day as they see the results of the war .
The benchmarks confirm that judgment , and this is a huge problem for the White House . "
Clark concluded by calling on the administration to come up with a political and diplomatic strategy for the region and " stop hiding behind General Petraeus . "
The following video clips are from MSNBC's Countdown and CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on August 30 and 31 .

One man decided it was time to sell the country -- debt and royalty included .
Computers inside pharmaceutical giant Pfizer 's network are spamming the internet with e-mails touting the company 's flagship erectile - enhancement drug Viagra , along with ads for knockoff Rolexes and shady junk stocks .
But the e-mails are not part of Pfizer 's official marketing efforts .
Pfizer 's computers appear to have been infected with malware that has transformed them into zombie computers sending spam at the behest of a hacker .
Oddly enough , they are spamming the public 's inboxes with ads for the company 's own product .
" There is a disaster inside this company , and they do n't know it , " says Rick Wesson , CEO of Support Intelligence – a small San Francisco - based security company that alerted Wired News to the problem .
Protect Your Machine
Help create a computer security how - to .
Wesson says Pfizer computers have been spamming inboxes for the last six months and that he 's kept 600 spam messages sent from company computers .
He says 138 different Pfizer IP addresses have been blacklisted by various groups , but adds that he can't estimate the number of infected machines without more information or installing monitoring equipment on the edge of Pfizer 's networks .
To illustrate what might be going on , Wesson says that when his company found a similar situation at an international shipping company that employs about 150,000 people , that company 's subsequent audit found 2,500 infected computers .
Support Intelligence claims to have found similar spam bots at Bank of America and Toshiba .
However , Pfizer appears to be unaware of the situation , despite several warnings from Support Intelligence .
" If they ( were aware ) , they would have taken care of the problem , " Wesson says .
Much of the spam originating from Pfizer 's machines pretends to be sent from Gmail accounts , says Wesson .
Products hocked include penis - enlargement products with the names " Mandik " and " Manster , " as well as pharmaceuticals like Viagra , the sleep drug Ambien and the sedative Valium .
The spam also includes ads for Cialis , a Viagra competitor made by Eli Lilly .
On Tuesday morning between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. , Pfizer 's network sent at least 20 messages about sex and penises , according to Wesson .
The number of infected machines is impossible to determine , because much of the traffic comes from behind a firewall that obscures the machines ' internal IP addresses .
Support Intelligence tracks spam by monitoring inboxes at 250,000 website domains that it owns – opening those to allow any and all e-mail and tracking what they get .
It also monitors communications to and from command - and - control centers , the computers hackers use to give instructions to a network of zombie computers known as a botnet .
Paul Ferguson works to fight botnets as a network architect for security giant Trend Micro .
He says Support Intelligence does " great work " and acts responsibly in disclosing security problems .
" They harvest valuable intelligence and share it with the security community , " Ferguson says .
" They also do ' due diligence ' showing that even large corporations are subject to security problems , and only do so when they exhaust other attempts at communicating to them that they have a problem . "
Support Intelligence says they 've seen connections between botnet controllers and computers inside Pfizer 's network .
" Pfizer sticks out like a glaring downed jet in a haystack , " Wesson says .
" They constantly send us the most egregious spam .
When there is this much smoke , there is a hell of a fire going on . "
Pfizer did not respond to requests for comments .
The flood of spam adds to Pfizer 's recent computer security woes .
This summer , the company revealed that it had suffered three breaches of sensitive data , cumulatively affecting more than 50,000 individuals .
In one breach , a Pfizer employee exposed personal information on 17,000 employees after installing peer - to - peer software on a laptop .
In another breach , confirmed Tuesday , a former employee downloaded sensitive data , including social security numbers and credit - card information for about 34,000 Pfizer employees .
Wesson says Support Intelligence has warned Pfizer numerous times that its computers were infected .
In March , Support Intelligence chief operating officer Adam Waters penned a report about Pfizer 's infection , telling the company " an alarming amount of bot spam has been observed exiting the Pfizer network indicating multiple system infections . "
The report included detailed information about which machines were sending the rogue e-mails .
Though the report was sent to the company at the end of March , none of the identified problems has been fixed , according to Waters and Wesson .
Support Intelligence has also informed Pfizer of the problem during sales calls , where the security company unsuccessfully tried to sell the company network - cleansing - and - monitoring service .
There 's no consensus estimate of the number of zombie botnet machines on the internet , but computer - security experts agree that millions of PCs are likely to be infected .
Hackers use the computers for numerous nefarious purposes , from sending spam to extorting money from businesses through denial - of - service attacks .
The malicious power of botnets was displayed in April when Russian attackers launched sustained denial - of - service attacks against thousands of government and commercial websites in the small European republic of Estonia , to retaliate for Estonia 's relocation of a World War II memorial statue of a Soviet soldier .
Hackers build botnets by infesting computers through booby - trapped web pages and spam infested with attachments or worms that travel from computer to computer .
Most computer users have no idea they are infected , because the remotely controlled malware often uses a small fraction of the infected machine 's computing power and has no effect on day - to - day computer usage .
To fight this , savvy users often share tips and tricks for protecting personal computers .

Small donors rewrite fundraising handbook
KANSAS CITY , Mo. —
On a table near The Cashew ’s upstairs bar , Nicola Heskett is laying out an array of pens and donor information forms as Jason Moehlman strolls in , still sweaty from the muggy evening ’s air .
He slaps down a $ 20 bill to cover the recommended contribution for the Kansas City Lawyers for Barack Obama Happy Hour .
“ Uh , would you mind using your credit card ?
I think it ’s a little cleaner , ” says Heskett , 36 , a first - time , small - time bundler for Obama who is helping to rewrite political fundraising playbooks this cycle .

The rise of the baby bundlers — people who ask friends and family to donate for a candidate and then direct the money to the campaign — is adding a face - to - face dimension to tactics used in 2004 to spur an explosion of Internet donations .
The influx of these new players , combined with unorthodox appeals by the candidates , also is fundamentally reshaping the parties ’ donor bases .
The surprising end result could be that the Democratic nominee will buck historic trends and have a significant financial edge in a cycle when the nominees alone are expected to spend an unprecedented $ 1 billion .
Obama on Monday e-mailed supporters to report he had 75,000 new donors in the third quarter , which ends Sunday .
That figure nearly matches the entire Republican field ’s donor base in the first six months of the year .
According to an August analysis by the Campaign Finance Institute done in partnership with Politico , 87 percent of the donors to Democrats in the first six months of this year did n’t give money to any candidate in the party ’s crowded 2004 primary , the first presidential race after passage of the McCain - Feingold reform law that put a premium on limited individual donations .
There ’s also a significant infusion of new blood on the GOP side : Among Republican givers , 89 percent of donors did not give to President Bush in his 2004 reelection race .
That figure could reflect two trends : the engagement of new donors such as those backing former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the Mormon community and the fatigue or disenchantment of Bush - Cheney donors .
Several high - ranking members of the president ’s 2004 campaign finance team have n’t written a single check to a 2008 candidate .
Beneath those broad numbers lies harder evidence suggesting a Democratic financial tsunami is building .
The total number of donors who gave more than $ 200 in the first six months of this year to Democrats was 137,388 compared to 81,075 givers to Republicans , the Campaign Finance Institute study found .
If history serves as a guide , many of those primary donors will be inherited by the party nominee next year , much as Democrat Howard Dean ’s Internet activists stuck with nominee John F. Kerry in 2004 .
“ The Democratic nominee will begin with an unprecedented fundraising base and will be able to draw on the unprecedented fundraising bases of other Democrats .
That will make for a very powerful force , ” said Anthony Corrado , a political fundraising expert who serves on the Campaign Finance Institute ’s board .
The primary engine behind the Democratic gains is the upstart campaign of Obama .
His new face and soaring rhetoric draws huge crowds on the campaign trail that can turn thousands of $ 5 donations into real money .
At a June event in Seattle , more than 3,500 people attended a public rally at the WaMu Theater , and a few hundred joined a higher - dollar reception .
The combined events generated more than $ 500,000 , said Michael Parham , a Seattle attorney and first - time presidential fundraiser who serves on Obama ’s national finance committee .
A month later , more than 100 people nibbled raspberry Jell - O Rice Krispies Treats in a doctor ’s backyard in western Michigan , a normally reliable Republican region .
Obama made a few remarks and mingled casually with the crowd that delivered about $ 120,000 to his campaign , said Patrick Miles Jr. , 39 , a Harvard University classmate of Obama ’s and another first - time presidential fundraiser .
Miles brought along his Republican secretary and her 18 - year - old granddaughter .
“ It was n’t the same old crowd , ” said Miles .
In a nutshell , Obama is beating all competitors in every category — number of donors , cash raised , cash on hand — except one .
Only Democrat John Edwards has a smaller percentage of big donors — those who gave the maximum $ 2,300 .
But , when actual people rather than percentages are measured , Obama takes that title , too , with more than 9,600 maximum givers compared to Edwards ’ roughly 3,000 big donors .
Obama ’s fundraising prowess has thrust him into top - tier status and forced Clinton to watch her back — even though the Chicago lawyer has yet to overtake the former first lady in national and early - primary - state polling .
Like the other major candidates , Obama recruited experienced fundraisers .
But , more so than his competitors , he opened the door to newcomers .
Now , the rookies are producing cash at a clip that is astonishing veteran campaign finance experts .
According to the Campaign Finance Institute analysis , 55,755 people gave more than $ 200 to the Obama campaign in the first six months of this year .
That is at least double the number of donors for every other candidate — Republican or Democrat — except for Clinton , who had 36,307 donors .
During the same six - month period in 2003 , President Bush had 19,289 donors who ’d given more than $ 200 , and Kerry had 9,862 , the institute found .
Yet those figures only scratch the surface of Obama ’s strength .
His campaign says — and other camps do n’t dispute — that its total number of donors as of June 30 was 258,000 .
That means about 202,000 people gave him less than $ 200 in the first six months of this year .
Small change ?
Think again .
According to campaign financial disclosure reports , Clinton raised $ 4 million from donations under $ 200 , and Romney reported $ 3 million .
Edwards ’ small checks amounted to $ 5 million and Republican front - runner Rudy Giuliani gathered less than a million from the little guys .
In contrast , Obama raised $ 16.4 million , or 29 percent , of his record - breaking second - quarter total of $ 57 million from those small donors .
And that ’s what brings us to The Cashew bar in downtown Kansas City and the small group of young lawyers who are sipping beer with orange slices floating on top .
Heskett ’s transition from Democratic voter to presidential fundraiser mirrors the path of many of this year ’s new players , as her frustration with the Bush administration shoved her into action .
Her first vote for president was cast for Bill Clinton in 1992 .
After that came jobs , marriage and a mortgage , leaving scant room for political activism .
In 2000 , she voted for Al Gore and was upset by the Supreme Court ’s ruling in the Florida recount that gave Bush the White House .
But “ not upset enough , looking back , ” she says .
In 2004 , Heskett attended a house party , donated a few hundred dollars and voted for the Kerry - Edwards ticket .
When Bush won , she was stunned and angry at herself .
“ I was embarrassed to think I could put on a bumper sticker and vote and think that was all the skin I needed to put in the game , ” she recalls .
In 2006 , she put out yard signs for favored candidates , donated more money , attended events and started “ getting into the habit of talking about politics . ”
It was n’t natural , or easy , since her other partners in the law firm , Shook , Hardy & Bacon , include plenty of Republicans .
As this year ’s season approached , Heskett decided she wanted to campaign for a candidate rather than just against one .
While watching the Sunday morning talk shows , she was surprised to hear conservative George Will praise Obama ’s second book , “ The Audacity of Hope . ”
She read it and was intrigued .
She began reading Obama speeches and was drawn to his diplomatic tone and skills .
In April , she signed on to help the campaign .
In early May , the Missouri Obama fundraising team put on its first big event : A major rally downtown followed by a smaller , high - dollar fundraiser at a converted condo building .
Heskett , who has contributed the maximum $ 2,300 , was among the high - dollar givers .
The combined events raised $ 100,000 .
Since then , Heskett was included in another small gathering with Obama , and she ’s hosted a handful of low - dollar , laid - back events with other young lawyers .
Overall , she estimates she ’s raised between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 for his campaign .
About 10 attorneys attended the recent happy hour event , donating varying amounts that added $ 320 to Obama ’s bottom line .
When asked why he became a first - time presidential donor , Moehlman , 32 , runs his fingers through his short black hair , sighs and says : “ I hate Bush . ”
An attorney with Polsinelli Shalton Flanigan Suelthaus , he hastens to add that he also is a fan of Obama and credits the campaign for sending the message that even his modest cash contribution is welcome .
“ You feel it might make a difference , ” he says .
Standing nearby is his law firm colleague , John Paul McGurk , 28 , who invited Moehlman to the event .
McGurk has been volunteering for campaigns since college , when he worked for his Republican history professor ’s unsuccessful bid for Congress .
With two friends in Iraq and another in Afghanistan , his opposition to the war prompted him to donate to a Democrat .
With stakes so high , “ it feels like these elections matter now , ” he says .
Last week , I drew up some guidelines to follow if you wanted to try baking cookies in your car .
This past weekend , since the temperatures were well over 100 F out here , I decided to give the technique a try myself .
I parked my car in full sunlight in the middle of the day , sliced up some cookie dough and started to bake .
I previously noted that most of the reporters and writers who tried this technique used refrigerated , slice - and - bake cookie dough .
My guess would be that they chose to use that type of pre-fab dough because they might not be regular bakers and were looking for something that would be quick and easy , since the baking process using a car is not exactly fast .
I went with a homemade dough , but decided that I , too , would use a slice - and - bake type of cookieÂ ( the recipe is at the bottom of this article ) .
This meant that my dough could be prepared well in advance and that I could control the thickness of each cookie with precise slicing .
Drop cookies work , too , but this seems to be the best way to control spread and ensure even cooking .
I sliced my dough into 1/4 - inch thick slices and placed them on a parchment lined baking sheet .
I used potholders to support the baking sheet ( and to prevent any damage to my dashboard from the hot metal ) and placed both the cookies and an oven thermometer in my car .
30 minutes later , the cookies were beginning to spread slightly .
The temperature inside my car reached over 180F during baking .
Since my car is significantly larger than my oven , I did n’t want to open the car doors at any point during the baking .
I recommend that you remove anything you think you ’ll need before you begin .
Here are the cookies after about 1 hour :
It took about 2 1/2 hours for the cookies to bake completely .
I ended up opening the car door shortly before the end of the baking period to check for doneness .
This check has to be done manually , as there are no color indicators ( such as brownness ) to judge by because the sugar in the car cookies does not caramelize and brown like that of oven - baked cookies .
So , I gently pressed the edges of the cookies to feel that they were firm and even more gently touched the center of one of the cookies to see that it held together and was not gooey ( the center of the cookie should not be entirely firm , unless you are shooting for a crispy cookie ) .
Finally , I slid one of the cookies around on the parchment paper – a good test for this type of baking because a baked cookie will release easily from the paper , while an unbaked cookie will stick in place .
If your cookies are not done , add more baking time in 15 or 30 minute increments , as opposed to the 30 second or 1 minute increments you might add to an oven - baked cookie .
The finished cookies were very light in color , but smelled and tasted delicious .
They were slightly crisp at the edges and chewy in the center .
I think that they were best hot out of the car , and believe that my tasters did , too , since the whole batch was gone in under 5 minutes .
My only regret is that I did n’t bake more at one time , since it ’s a time - consuming process and not something I ’m up for every day .
Car -Baked Chocolate Chip Cookies
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter , soft
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg
2/3 cup mini chocolate chips
In a small bowl , whisk together flour , baking powder , baking soda and salt .
In a large bowl , cream together butter and sugars .
Beat in egg , followed by flour mixture and chocolate chips .
Place dough on a large sheet of wax paper and roll into a log approximately 11 - inches long by 2.5 - inches wide .
Freeze for 2 - 3 hours , or overnight .
When ready to bake , park your car in the sun on a 100 F + day .
Slice cookies into 1/4 - inch thick slices and place on parchment - lined baking sheet .
Place baking sheet on car dashboard ( with protective towel underneath ) and bake for 2 1 /2 - 3 hours , until done .
If you have a big dashboard ( or a friend with another car ) , you can do two batches at once , otherwise you can save half of the dough for another day .
Makes about 2 1/2 dozen cookies .
As G8 and EU ministers gathered in Berlin Germany last month to discuss energy efficiency measures , Greenpeace activists used a mechanised road roller to crush ten thousand energy - wasting light bulbs at the Brandenburg Gate .
Greenpeace is demanding tough European efficiency standards for energy using products , and an immediate ban on incandescent light bulbs .
The demonstration marks the start of Greenpeace Internationalâ€™s energy efficiency campaign , which aims to stop the huge energy wastage caused by a wide variety of inefficient electrical products .
Light bulbs are an iconic example of the many energy wasting products that are sold to consumers .
An incandescent light bulb wastes 95 % of its energy generating heat instead of light .
Although cheaper to buy than energy efficient bulbs , incandescent bulbs cost European consumers almost 200 ( $ 271 ) euros a year in wasted electricity , and on a pan-European level , contribute millions of tons greenhouse gases in the generation of this wasted power .
Switching to CFLs ( energy efficient bulbs ) alone would result in shutting down 25 polluting power stations in Europe .
“ It ’s urgent to close the European market to “ energy - wasters ” .
We have heard rumours and vague promises from various governments about banning incandescent bulbs , so let ’s do it now !
We are calling on ministers to instigate immediate national bans on light bulbs and push for enforcement of a EU - wide mandatory efficiency standard on domestic lighting by 2010 .
This would not be hard for the EU and would send a strong political signal to the world : this 19th century climate - damaging product has no place in the 21st century . ” said Laetitia de Marez , head of Greenpeace International ’s Efficiency project .
The EU has started to consider efficiency standards for certain energy - using product categories under the framework of the Ecodesign directive , but this process is lengthy and any proposed legislation could amount to nothing more than “ voluntary measures ” if industry lobbyists have their way .
One has to wonder if this will be yet another issue that the Europeans get ahead of us on .
There is hope however , with a change in political leadership we might see an efficiency revolution in America .
But it wont happen by itself , we must maintain the pressure on our elected officials to continue to push for more efficiency , more renewable energy , and more sustainable building codes .
Its up to all of us .
“ Energy efficiency is such an easy , logical and profitable way to solve half the climate problem that we ca n’t afford to not grab this opportunity .
Smart energy use is something that benefits everybody : less CO2 emissions , lower energy bills and lower power consumption .
It ’s win - win - win , so why not use energy the smart way ? ” said Sharon Becker from Greenpeace International .

Seems likely that attacker rolls dice against target number for everything - attacks , spells , etc. as in SW : Saga Edition .
Design game elements for their intended use .
Secondary uses are nice , but not a goal .
Basically , when we build a monster we intend you to use it as a monster .
If we build a feat , it 's meant as a feat , not a monster special attack .
If we also want to make it a playable character race , we 'll design a separate racial write up for it .
We wo n't try to shoehorn a monster stat block into becoming a PC stat block .
The designs must inform each other , but we 're better off building two separate game elements rather than one that tries to multiclass .
As an example , the a theoretical minotaur PC race write up draws on and evokes the feel of the minotaur monster , but it does n't simply copy over the rules .
- Mike Mearls
In Fourth Edition , we 've totally revamped the math behind the system , and that 's a big part of the way that we 've extended the sweet spot across the whole level range .
When PCs fight monsters of their level , they 'll find that the math of the system is more or less the same at level 30 as it is at level 1 .
There will always be variation with different PCs and different monsters , but that variation wo n't be so great that monsters are either too deadly or too weak .
- James Wyatt * Races will grant abilities at levels other than first - most of the abilities will be gained in the first 10 levels , but there will be some gained at higher levels . *
Dwarven Resilience ( 1st level ) * Elven Evasion ( 1st level ) *
Half - Elven Inspiring Presence ( 1st level ) * Racial Feats to improve racial abilities * Racial - specific Powers for class , accomplishing what Subsitution levels did .
Example : Dwarf Fighter with " Friend of Earth " power at 10th level *
An 8th level power ( or spell ) is a power you gain at 8th level .
( Thadir 's FAQ * " We are doing something different with hit points .
It 's not exactly what you described , but characters will be more likely to survive a single hit at low level .
I like to say the changes we 've made make it so you wo n't go down in one hit at low level or high level . "
( Thadir 's FAQ *
All classes let you do a little of all three .
At - will powers are there so you never run out of options .
Per - encounter powers are there so you can always take it up a notch .
Per - day powers are there so you can really bring down the thunder when you need to . *
There are 8 classes in PH1 , but more will come out later in other books and the magazines .
Think of it this way :
There are many classes , but each will fit into one of the four roles .
This way you have plenty of variability , but you can always be sure that the class is filling a basic function it 's expected to .
( Logan Bonner * Four roles : Striker , Defender , Controller , Leader .
All classes fit one of those roles , with some hybrids . *
Cleric , Fighter , Rogue and Wizard are definitely in .
Other classes are up for debate .
Likely : Warlord , Ranger , Paladin , possibly Monk ... but possibly not .*
Healing power triggered by striking a creature in melee *
The cleric does n't give up his attacks just because he can heal — it 's part of his role .
( Thadir 's FAQ * " Martial " power source being non-magical , as will manuevers .
Non-anime .*
That being said , at high levels , the fighter does push beyond the limits of human ( or elf or dwarf ) ability .
Also , if someone wanted to make their fighter more magical - feeling , they could muck about with the flavor of the powers to make them less mundane .
( Thadir 's FAQ *
The rogue ( for example ) still has plenty of social focus .
The thing is , we do n't take away his combat ability because of it .
( Thadir 's FAQ * Fireball does n't do 1d6 per level any more .*
Multiclass wizards ( gish ) will be more balanced from the beginning .
( Dave Noonan * Statblocks will be simplified , and not the same as for PCs . *
A very enjoyable part of this work is designing sample encounters for the monsters .
We talked just today about whether that would be better on D&D Insider , but we agreed that it 's important to reinforce the message that an interesting encounter consists of multiple , different monsters grouped in interesting ways .
- James Wyatt * [ In 3e , we ] end up jumping through dozens of hoops set up by the rules of monster design .
If I do n’t use all the monster ’s skill points , it ’s “ wrong . ”
If I give it more than the “ correct ” number of feats , I have to explain that it has a bonus feat .
And do n’t even think about putting that ogre in full plate without advancing it enough to gain the Armor Proficiency ( heavy ) feat .
Good grief .
I want to design a cool monster , not wrestle with the system for hours .
Thankfully , 4th edition is doing it completely differently .
Monsters are being designed for their intended use : as monsters .
We ’re not shoehorning them into the character system and hoping what comes out works in the game .
Of course , they look alike in many ways and use the same game system , but now the results matter , not the rules for minutiae .

Autopatcher , a frequently updated project devoted to compiling all the Windows Updates into a single installation package ( geared toward offline system updating and quick system rebuilds ) , has been shut down by Microsoft as of yesterday ( 08/29/07 ) .
Citing security and intellectual property as reasons for the action , Microsoft contacted the site owners of Autopatcher and Neowin.net ( which housed an Autopatcher support forum ) with a legal takedown notice , demanding that the download and support pages be removed immediately .
As a result ( as if there could be any other outcome ) , downloads and support forums were taken down as of yesterday afternoon .
A note on SynergyMX‘s website reflects exactly what I was already thinking :
The security giant declined to explain the timing of decision , leaving critics to suggest that getting rid of a service that allowed users to obtain patches without Windows Genuine Advantage controls might be among the reasons behind the move .
While I can appreciate the reasoning behind the action ( especially coming from a “ security giant ” ) , I do n’t think that distributing MS patches is a criminal offense .
If people want to download unauthorized patches , then let them do it .
After all , they will be the ones to deal with support if anything breaks .
With that said however , Autopatcher was very reputable , and had a huge fanbase , especially with those fed up with the love - it or hate - it Windows Update service .
Check out the Neowin forums for the ongoing discussion as some are trying to organize a ‘ fight back ’ campaign .
I wish them the best , but my guess is that it will be a futile effort …
Either way , it will be interesting to see how this plays out .
*** Update ***
Potential news that the Autopatcher project could continue under Microsoft ’s direction ?

WASHINGTON  A new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll shows deepening pessimism on Iraq , even as many Americans are reluctant to limit money or troops for the war effort .
Only 28 % say the United States will probably or definitely win the war , down from 35 % in December and the lowest since the question was first asked in September 2005 .
The share of people who now call the war a mistake is 59 % — the same as September 2005 and the highest level in the 58 times the question has been asked since the war began .
The poll asked about proposals circulating on Capitol Hill as Congress weighs how to exert influence on President Bush 's Iraq policy .
House Democrats could unveil their plans this week .
Six in 10 people said they want Congress to set a timetable to withdraw all U.S. troops by the end of 2008 .
Three - quarters said Congress should require that U.S. troops come home if Iraqi leaders do n't keep pledges to reduce violence , and that U.S. troops have at least a year 's stay in the USA between deployments to Iraq .
The mandatory break is part of a plan by Rep. John Murtha , D - Pa .
At the same time , six in 10 people said they do n't want Congress to deny funding for additional troops to be sent to Iraq .
A slim majority , 52 % , said they do n't want lawmakers to revoke the authority they gave Bush in 2002 to use military force in Iraq .
Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , a presidential candidate and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , is pushing to revoke that authority .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , another White House candidate , wants to cap troop levels in Iraq .
That idea won support from 54 % in the poll .
Linda Fowler , a government professor at Dartmouth College , said there 's some recent evidence of a decline in violence in Baghdad , " but that does n't seem to have penetrated the public consciousness . "
Fowler said that is because of other developments such as " wrenching stories " about National Guard and Reserve troops going off on their second and third tours of duty , and the turmoil at Walter Reed Army Medical Center " reminding people that we are asking a great deal of our soldiers and not properly taking care of them . "
Bush 's approval rating in the new poll was 33 % , while 63 % disapproved of his performance .
That was a slight dip from last month , when 37 % approved and 59 % disapproved .
The latest poll showed a partisan divide .
Majorities of Democrats supported every step to limit or wind down the war .
Majorities of Republicans supported only the year - long break for Guard and Reserve troops and withdrawing troops if Iraqi officials do n't reduce violence .

If we organized properly via the web we could have local citizens throughout the country who agree to a pledge to stalk the MAINSTREAM MEDIA to push the " IMPEACH NOW " agenda .
For example , the citizens near the OJ case could show up with IMPEACH NOW !
signs and form a crowd outside the courthouse .
The location (s ) around the country would change on a day to day basis but with email we could stay a step ahead of the MM whores by notifying participants .
They could then head out to the event with their IMPEACH NOW !
signs in tow and make their voices heard .
I think it 's crazy enough of an idea that it just might work .... and if you want feel free to sing my " IMPEACH NOW " song while holding up those signs .... you can listen / download it here www.myspace.com/odro

- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton cites her experience as a compelling reason voters should make her president , but nearly 2 million pages of documents covering her White House years are locked up in a building here , obscuring a large swath of her record as first lady .
Clinton ’s calendars , appointment logs and memos are stored at her husband ’s presidential library , in the custody of federal archivists who do not expect them to be released until after the 2008 presidential election .
A trove of records has been made public detailing the Clinton White House ’s attempts to remake the nation ’s healthcare system , following a request from Bill Clinton that those materials be released first .
Hillary Clinton led the healthcare effort in 1993 and 1994 .
But even in the healthcare documents , at least 1,000 pages involving her work has been censored by archives staff because they include confidential advice and must be kept secret under a federal law called the Presidential Records Act .
Political consultants said that if Hillary Clinton ’s records were made public , rivals would mine them for scraps of information that might rattle her campaign .

“ Those files -- that ’s the mother lode of opposition research , ” said Ray McNally , a Republican political consultant in Sacramento .
“ Opposition researchers would be very hungry to see what ’s there . ” Robert Shrum , senior political strategist in Democratic Sen. John F. Kerry ’s 2004 presidential campaign , said : “ In 2 million pieces of paper , would opposition researchers hope to find one where she wrote a memo saying , ‘ I wish I ’d never gotten involved in healthcare ? ’
Sure .
That ’s what they ’d love to find . ”
At the Clinton library overlooking the Arkansas River , federal archivists clad in protective smocks are sorting through 80 million pages of records and another 20 million e-mails from a Clinton presidency that ended in January 2001 .
About 2 million of those pages concern the first lady ’s office .
A staff of 11 spends most of its time answering some 250 requests for documents submitted under the Freedom of Information Act .
Requests are fulfilled largely on a first - come , first - served basis .
Because the earliest requests involved other Clinton administration activities , the requests for the now - New York senator ’s records are further back in line , staff members said .
A list of Freedom of Information
Act requests that have been completed by the archives staff includes one for a photo of Bill Clinton jogging with a “ Yale Whiffenpoof Club insignia ” on his clothing ; another for various files on UFOs and flying saucers and one for the full name of the pastry chef who made a birthday cake for Chelsea Clinton .

Before documents are released , archives staff must read them and , by law , must redact material that they determine contains classified information , invades a person ’s privacy , reveals trade secrets , reveals confidential advice from presidential advisors or raises other concerns specified in the records law .
Asked how long it might be before Hillary Clinton ’s records are released , the library ’s chief archivist said it could take years .
“ We ’re processing as fast as we can , ” Melissa Walker said .
Not fast enough , in the view of some who have been waiting .
A conservative watchdog group called Judicial Watch filed suit against the National Archives last month , demanding the release of Hillary Clinton ’s diaries , telephone logs , daily planners and schedules .
In the 1990s , the group filed suits against the Clinton administration that led to revelations about fundraising practices , including Democratic campaign donors being tapped for official trade missions .
In the most recent suit , Judicial Watch said it had submitted its request more than a year ago and had received nothing , save for confirmation that the library possessed “ a substantial volume ” of such papers .

Staffing pressures have prevented the National Archives from keeping up with an expanding workload .
In 2002 , the agency employed 334 archivists .
This year , the number is down to 301 .
That 10 % drop came during a period when the National Archives assumed jurisdiction over two more presidential libraries : those of Clinton and Richard Nixon .
“ If we have fewer trained personnel , we are unable to do as many preservation projects as we might like , and we ’re less able to serve the public in ways we would like to , ” said Susan Cooper , a spokeswoman for the National Archives .
But advocates for open records said that had it made savvier use of technology , the Clinton library could be moving more quickly .
Computers can sort through e-mail to flag classified documents , as distinguished from material that can be speedily released , said Thomas S. Blanton , director of the National Security Archive , a research institute at George Washington University .
“ There ’s no reason why a load of a few hundred FOIA requests should absorb 11 full - time people perpetually , ” Blanton said , referring to requests made under the Freedom of Information Act .

What records that have been made public offer tantalizing details about Hillary Clinton ’s White House years .
One memo reveals details about the “ war room ” for the healthcare plan .
Aides wrote of the need for secrecy , but also presented Hillary Clinton with arguments she could make that the process of drawing up a healthcare plan was “ the most open in the history of the federal government . ”
A 1993 memo discussed a plan to create reports on members of Congress , tracking their positions on healthcare .
The files would log when members met with Hillary Clinton , how they voted on key bills , and -- under a category called “ influence ” -- whom they consulted for advice .
One 1994 memo offers a historical curiosity :
It draws Clinton ’s attention to a rising Republican politician , Mitt Romney , who is now a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination .
In the memo , Clinton ’s aides discussed a trip to Boston , where the then - first lady was to appear at a fundraising event for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass ) .
Kennedy was then running for reelection against Romney .
“ Romney , a millionaire business consultant with no political experience , is a Mormon , ” the memo reads .
“ His religion is a delicate issue , which Kennedy himself has not raised but other Democrats have . ”

At other presidential libraries -- which in some cases have had decades to process the material -- some first lady records are now open to the public .
About 75,000 pages of Rosalynn Carter ’s records are publicly available , including scheduling and social office files .
Both the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush libraries also said that some records covering former first ladies Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush were open .
The healthcare papers that have been released contain gaps when it comes to the part played by Hillary Clinton .
A number of records involving her have been kept secret because they include confidential advice between presidential aides .
Among the withheld documents are memos about meetings between Hillary Clinton and Democratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- now her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Other records kept from public view include a 1993 memo to the first lady entitled “ positioning ourselves on healthcare , ” and another from that year called “ public portrayal of the Medicare program . ”

Wow , We Suck
With the Bush administration seemingly heading toward a catastrophic attack on Iran with little chance they 'll be stopped , now is a good time to consider how much everyone involved in this process sucks .
By this I do n't mean Bush blah Republicans blah suck .
That 's too easy .
Any honest evaluation would find most of the blame lies elsewhere .
I suck
I can't emphasize this enough .
I wo n't go into detail because it's so embarrassing , but the difference between what I 've done and could have done is gigantic .
In particular , it took me decades to figure out how American society works , which is as humiliating as taking twenty years to figure out tic tac toe .
And I 'm extending my suckiness by complaining about it publicly .
In a blog post .
I really , really suck .
Everyone I know sucks
My family and friends do n't feel powerful because none of us is Rupert Murdoch .
But on any rational scale — comparative or historical — we have a lot of freedom and resources .
Have we utilized even 5 % of these ?
No .
That 's because we do n't truly believe people in other countries are as real as we are .
We 've also failed to imagine the likely consequences to ourselves from our inaction .
This is particularly distasteful because we 're living in the first time in history when technology enables non-saintly humans to figure this out , if they want to .
Clearly we do n't want to .
We suck .
Liberal blogs suck
Arthur Silber is absolutely right about this .
The blogosphere esucks .
The anti-war movement sucks
Afghanistan ?
Okay , that was impossible .
Iraq ?
September 11th , etc. But Iran ?
If you can't stop the third war in six years — one that 's going to happen because shredding infants with flechettes is the last remaining activity that provides William Kristol sexual gratification — you should change your name from " anti-war movement " to " pro-sucking movement . "
Democrats suck
Tautological .
Democrats=suck .
Americans suck
We started out as thirteen colonies clinging to the eastern seaboard .
Then we conquered the entire continent .
Then we ended up with military bases in a hundred other countries .
Now we 're researching how to drop tungsten rods on people from space .
Yet we remain convinced we 're really nice .
My country ' tis of suck .
Human beings suck
We 've been working on " civilization " for 6,000 years .
We 've figured out fire , and making extremely tall buildings that do n't fall over , and even crossing plums with apricots .
Yet we 've made zero progress on our main problem : slaughtering each other in generous megadeath quantities .
This suggests the error is indeed bred in the bone .
In Latin , our species is called homo suckapiens suckapiens .
Planet Earth sucks
Life is centered on everybody eating others until they themselves get eaten .
And their entire lifespan is spent worrying about being eaten , which always happens in the end anyway .
This whole setup sucks .
The universe sucks
Its apparent meaningless would n't be so bad if existence were solely pleasurable .
In my experience , this is not the case .
13.7 billion years of suck .
In conclusion , I hate to claim there 's any point to this , because that would detract from its meta - suckiness .
Nevertheless , success is more likely to follow from a clear - eyed appraisal of a situation , rather than hubristic fantasies .
That 's the theory , anyway .
It admittedly sucks .
[ With apologies for my long - windedness ]
This question was inspired by the post regarding the CMU Professor ( Pausch ) that is dying of cancer and is facing death with an amazingly positive attitude .
Specifically , there was a thread started by jaed : " It 's sad that we have to be reminded of it , but this just reaffirms that the little bubble world of YC , TechCrunch , and Web 2 .
Oh really do n't mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of life .
This guy would n't trade some extra time with his family for all the startups and VC cash in the world .
It just puts things into perspective . "
I agree with jaed .
I also agree with neilc , who thinks that the " YC philosophy " is consistent with the positive message of the article .
SO MY QUESTION IS THIS :
Is making an AJAXified tool or toy that will likely be used by less than 1 % of the people in the richest country in the world the absolute best use of your time and talents right now ?
Honestly ?
This is not a rhetorical question , nor is it intended to cast judgment on anyone who is actively pursuing a startup just to make money .
I can't throw stones , because that is exactly what I 've spend MY life doing .
I also do n't want to make anyone feel bad , I 'm just trying to prompt a discussion .
I 'm wondering if people think that our best and brightest minds might be better suited to doing something like medical research than , say , designing software and working for hedge funds ?
There is really nothing like finding out someone you love has cancer or a life - threatening illness to make you feel completely impotent when you 're just a businessman or programmer .
I 've helped design medical software in the past , but it was never a great leap forward or anything .
It was just incremental progress for money .
I 've never felt like I made a GREAT difference .
And sitting in a children 's hospital is a VERY humbling experience , no matter how successful you are .
I 'm an entrepreneur and an investor , and I enjoy it .
I 'm not unfulfilled , but I have a growing regret that I have n't done much to really help the world .
I donate to charities , and I 've founded companies that have made really good products and offered great services , but I 've never made the type of contribution that saves lives .
I 've never discovered a vaccine or an improved diagnostic tool or anything .
And I 'd like to .
I feel like I 've won the luck lottery ( white , male , mostly healthy , born in the USA , educated , wealthy ) and I want to give back more .
I have n't faced the obstacles that some people face ( racism , limited access to education , etc. ) , so I guess I have a guilt complex or something that I have n't done more .
Typical liberal ;-)
//////////////////////////////////////////
I 've thought of going back to medical school or something , but my odds of really helping there are small and it wastes my natural skill set .
( I 'm also not likely to be accepted , but that 's another story . )
I believe in entrepreneurship though , so I can try to make a difference in that way .
So , if anyone here has any ideas to save lives or make a massive improvement in the world , give me a shout .
Seriously .
I have more money than Paul Graham ( although I 'm not as smart , connected , or good looking ) and I 'm open to ideas outside the Y Combinator sweet spot .
I think the best ideas in most industries come from people OUTSIDE that industry , so I would think that the brainpower on this site could really make a difference in the world .
I do n't think YC are that interested in medical startups ( etc. ) , so I do n't think I 'm stepping on their toes ... but , if I am , please let me know and I 'll retract this portion of the post .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Democratic presidential front - runner Sen. Hillary Clinton is being taken to task by her two closest rivals for accepting $ 400,000 in campaign contributions from Washington lobbyists .
Sen .
Hillary Clinton dismissed criticism that she took money from lobbyists , saying it would not influence her .
Over the weekend , Clinton was booed by an audience of liberal bloggers in Chicago when she defended taking money from Washington lobbyists , something both Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards have vowed not to do .
" I do n't think , based on my 35 years fighting for what I believe in , anybody seriously believes I 'm going to be influenced by a lobbyist or a particular interest group , " Clinton said .
" A lot of these lobbyists , whether you like it or not , represent real Americans .
They actually do .
They represent nurses , they represent social workers -- yes , they represent corporations that employ a lot of people . "
The former first lady said that she welcomed the debate on the issue .
" I 've been waiting for this .
This gives us a real sense of reality with my being here , " Clinton said , prompting a loud rumble from the audience at a candidates ' forum sponsored by The Daily Kos .
Edwards ' response was to ask , " How many people in this room have a Washington lobbyist working for you ? "
" You are not represented by Washington lobbyists .
We need to cut these people off , " he said , to cheers .
However , while eschewing contributions from Washington lobbyists , Edwards has accepted about $ 10,000 in contributions from lobbyists in his home state of North Carolina , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
The Edwards campaign said there is no inconsistency because his pledge did not extend to lobbyists representing local interests .
Monday , the Edwards campaign also said it would return a $ 4,600 donation from the Credit Suisse bank , which is registered to lobby in Washington .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , lobbyists actually provide less campaign cash than political action committees or donors directly affiliated with large corporate interests .
" But they do get a lot of attention because it 's very easy to point at them and say , well , these are the special interests , these are the people who most represent these big moneyed interests that are trying to influence policy , " said Massie Ritsch , a spokesman for the center .
And while the grassroots interests of many ordinary Americans are represented by Washington lobbyists , as Clinton noted , some political experts think that could be a hard case for her make .
Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report said that while Clinton is making an " analytical argument " about the way the political system works , Edwards " is simply getting the emotional advantage of portraying her as somebody who is close to lobbyists and big business and the establishment .

Military Favors Ron Paul Over McCain
The US Federal Election Commission has released the Selected Presidential Reports for the 2007 July Quarterly , and there are a few surprises .
No surprise , of course , is that people in the armed services and veterans overwhelmingly support the Republican Party .
However , after digging through individual candidates ’ contributions by employers , we find an elating ( or disturbing , if you ’re rooting for Rudy McRomney ) trend .
The breakdown ?
Here you go .
Army Navy USAF USMC VET TOTAL Ron Paul 6975 7765 4650 1500 1250 22140 McCain 6225 6480 1570 1600 800 16675 Romney 2051 0 1500 0 1000 4551 Giuliani 1450 370 250 0 250 2320 Hunter 0 1000 0 0 0 1000 Richardson 50 750 0 0 0 800 Huckabee 250 0 500 0 0 750 Tancredo 350 0 0 0 0 350 Brownback 71 0 0 0 0 71 T. Thompson 0 0 0 0 0
This table expresses in dollars the total campaign contributions that each candidate has received from individuals who marked “ Air Force , ” “ US Marines , ” “ USMC , ” “ Army , ” “ Navy , ” or some other such permutation of letters as their employer that gives the appearance that they are a member of the armed services .
The “ veteran ” column was derived by looking for “ retired ______ , ” “ ______ retired , ” or anything containing the word veteran , with the exception of Veterans ’ Affairs ( or the like ) .
What conclusions can be drawn from this surprising , exciting information ?
One might jump to the conclusion that the troops are tired and demoralized and angry to be fighting in the desert sand , and willing to leap on the only Republican candidate who wants an immediate end to the war .
But that ’s an insufficient explanation , since veterans favor Ron Paul as well .
Our military forces have a strong tradition of valorization and an implicit belief that they have served to protect the freedom of private citizens in the United States .
So profound is this belief that it ranks as the # 1 reason that veterans and active duty say they joined ( even though education ranks as the # 1 reason prior to enlistment ) .
This culture of pride in service particularly to safeguard American liberties and freedoms — regardless of whether it is true or not — disinclines those in service to contribute to candidates like Romney and Giuliani who want to expand Executive power and increase spying on Americans .
This is why Ron Paul and John McCain are the clearest front - runners in terms of contributions .
Well , that and the fact that McCain was a Captain in the Navy and Ron Paul was a flight surgeon .
Or … ( one final thought ) … does it run in the other direction ?
Does the military favor Paul and McCain because they were military , or do Ron Paul and John McCain have a favorable set of values for military servicemen and women because they themselves have served ?
🙂 Look for more analysis of these contribution schedules in the upcoming days !
The Lua programming language has been around for more than 10 years , but only recently has it started to appear on the mainstream radar screens .
It has evolved from a simple scripting language to a full - fledged solution for scripting and embedding .
Lua is portable , fast and small , and the language of choice for applications as diverse as games , Web sites and robot controllers as the Lua Users Wiki and LuaForge will confirm .
Lua portability can be shown by the long list of operating systems it runs on , which includes not only Windows and Linux , but also small systems and mobile devices .
The memory and CPU requirements for the runtime are really low , and Lua has been used in environments that most other scripting options would not dare go into .
One of the milestones of the history of Lua has been the release of the book Programming in Lua ( a.k.a " PiL " ) , by Roberto Ierusalimschy , in 2003 .
This review is about the second edition of Programming in Lua , a .k.a. the " Blue PiL " due to the color of its cover .
Lua is free software and can be obtained from its site ( www.lua.org ) .
There you will also find the reference manual of the language and the full contents of the first edition of Programming in Lua .
As a disclaimer , let me say that I 'm one of the technical reviewers of the book and I have been working with Lua since 1993 , most of the time interacting with Roberto Ierusalimschy , even when not working in the same projects as him .
The second edition manages to surpass an already good book in various aspects .
The " Blue PiL " presents not only the language itself , but also gives an excellent view of how one could see Lua as the foundation of solid scripting techniques .
The original Programming in Lua was focused on Lua 5.0 , while the second edition focuses on Lua 5.1 .
While the differences between Lua 5.0 and 5.1 are not radical , the newer version has a lot more to offer , both in terms of the modularity aspect and of language features .
The second edition of Programming in Lua indicates clearly when some concept or detail relates only to a specific version of Lua , but most of the contents can be applied to both Lua versions .
Programming in Lua is oriented to both the novice programmer who wants to get a first feeling for Lua , and to the advanced Lua or C programmer who wants to use the full potential of the language .
The book clearly separates the two aspects and indicates the sections that can be skipped for each reader profile .
The author manages to keep a light and easily readable style during the whole book and the examples are simple and direct , making the flow of the reading quite pleasant .
I can say that , even having some reasonable experience with Lua , I was surprised by a lot of details in the book .
The " Blue PiL " is one of those books that you can read many times over , and each time you learn something new .
The " Blue PiL " starts with an overview of the Lua language and slowly evolves through the more advanced concepts and the features that make Lua such a unique language .
Even though it 's a relatively thin book , it goes from the starting concepts to the more sophisticated ones with a grace that is really rare to find .
The one other book that comes to mind with an effect like this is the classical Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman , which says a lot .
The first part of the book presents the language and the basic features .
In particular , concepts such as iterators , coroutines and closures are presented in a clear way , which is no small feat considering that many readers will be having contact with such concepts for the first time .
One of the strong points of Lua is its simplicity , but do n't assume that this implies lack of power .
An example of this balance is the table data structure , in fact the only data structure for Lua .
Tables allow the construction of every other data structure ( arrays , sets , bags etc ) but also allows the use of sophisticated techniques such as metamethods , function environments , modules and object orientation .
In fact , instead of providing every feature one might want to use , Lua provides the meta mechanisms so you can create your own features , or use them as modules created by third parties .
In order to explain the full power of these meta mechanisms the second part of the book takes the reader from the basic steps of creating a table and shows how each of the mechanisms can add features or help the usage of some advanced concepts .
As an example , the chapter on object - oriented programming not only shows how to use objects in Lua , but also how to think of objects as prototypes for other objects , and how to implement inheritance on such a model without using anything too fancy .
There are also chapters on the use of metatables ( basically tables that define the behavior of other tables ) , the use of tables as function environments ( a really powerful mechanism once understood ) , modules and finally weak tables .
Weak tables allow the advanced use of memory resources in an automatic way , providing mechanisms for data structures that tend to be hard to implement in other languages , if even possible at all .
This slow but efficient presentation of concepts that , though complex , can be easily assimilated by the reader is a predominant aspect of Roberto 's work .
He is not only a skilled author but also knows how to present things in a way that a novice can grasp and an expert can master .
The third part of Programming in Lua covers all the language libraries ( math , table , string , system , debug and I/O ) in clear prose and shows that even with a small set of libraries Lua can pack a lot of power on a very small footprint .
Finally , the last part of the book is directed to programmers that want to use Lua to its full potential .
Lua can be used as an extension language or as an embedded language , and knowing how to interact with the host language ( C , C++ , Java , Delphi etc. ) is mandatory for that .
The book presents the C API for Lua in the same progressive pace , but also manages to cover every ground needed so one can add Lua to a project without much pain , if any .
One important thing to note about the book is that it follows the same philosophy that guides the language , showing that simplicity and lightness has nothing to do with lack of power or coverage .
I really recommend this book to anyone interested in learning Lua , and also for those who already know how to use Lua but would like to fully master its way of thinking , the so called " Lua way " of doing things .
The book has been considered by many as an excellent guide on programming , even if one is not interested in Lua in particular .

Some counties are re-examining business tax incentives : Frederick County , Md. : May revoke a $ 5 million property tax break given to a biotech company that was sold and paid a top executive $ 140 million .
Finney County , Kan. :
May penalize firms that do n't create promised jobs after getting tax breaks .

Facebook Generous tax breaks given to companies that threaten to take their business elsewhere are coming under increasing scrutiny from state and local officials who say taxpayers are n't getting their money 's worth .
Critics say the tax breaks and other financial incentives have gotten out of hand , costing taxpayers billions of dollars and doing little for the economy .
" There 's an entitlement mentality about tax breaks today , " Kansas City , Mo. , Mayor Mark Funkhouser says .
" Every developer thinks it 's his right not to pay property taxes . "
Funkhouser was elected mayor in May after campaigning against tax breaks to developers , including one for a luxury condo development in an affluent part of his city .
MUSKEGON REBUILDS : Michigan city finds hope in tax breaks Supporters of incentives say the deals are crucial to keeping economies strong , especially in depressed areas .
" A well - thought - out portfolio of incentives is vital to being competitive for quality projects , " says Jim Fain , commerce secretary in North Carolina , which has been aggressive in providing economic assistance to companies .
In March , North Carolina gave $ 212 million in state and local assistance over 30 years to lure a $ 600 million Google server operation to Lenoir .
State and local governments offer about $ 50 billion a year in tax breaks and other economic incentives , according to economists Alan Peters and Peter Fisher .
Academics say there is little evidence to show that tax breaks have a lasting effect on a local economy .
Property tax breaks to manufacturers appear to boost industrial employment for a short time , says University of Nebraska economist John Anderson , a former Michigan economic developer .
" But the impact of incentives dissipates quickly , so in a few years , there 's no benefit to employment , " he says .
Among the states re-examining economic development incentives : • Arizona .
The Legislature passed a law in July that limits sales tax breaks that local governments can give retailers .
Cities and counties had been slashing sales tax rates to attract big chains such as Wal - Mart , Home Depot and Nordstrom .
That hurt local businesses , whose customers paid the full tax .
• Mississippi .
Incentives given to a beef factory , which opened and closed in 2004 , have become a key issue in the political campaign for state agriculture commissioner .
The deal cost taxpayers $ 55 million .
• New York .
The state sent 3,000 letters in July to companies given tax breaks in exchange for promises to invest money and create jobs .
The letters went to companies that failed to meet 60 % of their goals .
The action came after New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer ordered an audit of firms that have received tax benefits by locating in low - tax Empire Zones , the state 's premier economic development program .
These zones provide more than $ 600 million a year in tax breaks to 9,800 businesses .
Funkhouser says tax breaks take money from services — such as police and schools — that make a local economy successful .
" Tax breaks are like taking a painkiller to mask the underlying problem , which are quality - of - life issues , " he says .
Fain says government involvement is vital in a global economy .
" We 're competing against Ireland , Eastern Europe , Singapore , not to mention China and India , " he says .
" We have to use the tools that we have . "

In the study , Republicans were at rough parity with Democrats in party ID , trailing them by three percentage points .
GOP identification drops
Americans are n’t just having a tough time seeing themselves pulling the lever for Republicans these days .
Fewer are seeing themselves as Republicans , period .
That ’s the conclusion of one of the party ’s most respected polling firms , based on a compilation of its national surveys conducted so far this year .
Public Opinion Strategies , based in Alexandria , Va. , counts among its clients about one - fourth of all Republican members of Congress and is half of the bipartisan team that conducts polling for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal .

Party identification — or affiliation , as it ’s also called — measures whether people consider themselves to be Republican , Democratic or independent .
In 2004 , according to the firm ’s merged polling data ( think of it as one huge data set compiled over the course of a year ) , Republicans were at rough parity with Democrats in party ID , trailing them by three percentage points .
At this point in 2007 , they trail Democrats by seven .
Other , nonpartisan national surveys show a similar disinclination to identify with the GOP .
The development provides another angle from which to view the party ’s plight in being defined in the public ’s minds by an unpopular president sticking with an unpopular war and a group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill who continue to serve up easy fodder for late - night talk shows .
The lag in self - identified Republicans is another worry bead for the string of polling measures that warn of an uphill battle for the party next year .
Barring improvement , it will affect their 2008 prospects as much as , if not more than , the far - more - hyped job approval rating of the outgoing president .
The party will not be starting the 2008 general election campaign from the same position George W. Bush occupied in either 2000 or 2004 — races that were both decided at the margins .
Some geographic areas and voter groups where Public Opinion Strategies found that the GOP has lost ground are not surprising , given the results of last year ’s midterm elections : in New England , where only one Republican House incumbent was left standing after Election Day ; in the now decidedly purple mountain states ; and among suburban women .
Of real concern , however , is the firm ’s finding of fewer self - identified Republicans among men over the age of 55 and men who live in rural areas — groups that have been GOP mainstays for most of the Bush era .
Data compiled by Public Opinion Strategies this year also reaffirms a more widely acknowledged point in political circles : that the GOP continues to trail dangerously on the question of whether voters would be more inclined to elect a Democratic or Republican member of Congress , aka the generic congressional ballot test .
According to the firm ’s merged polling data for 2006 , the party was at a 10 - point disadvantage during a year that landed Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress .
At this point in 2007 , the party remains at a nine - point disadvantage .
Much of this erosion is due to independents increasingly favoring Democrats .
As the data show , self - identified Republicans and Democrats have been answering the generic ballot question basically the same way over the past few years ; it is among independents that support for Republican members of Congress has plunged .
Democratic pollster Jay Campbell of Hart Research , which works with Public Opinion Strategies on the NBC / Wall Street Journal poll , suggests that these shifts demonstrate the power that one overarching issue — in this case , Iraq — has to move the electorate .
In 1992 , a banner presidential election year for Democrats , a similar shift in their favor on party identification was driven by Americans ’ unhappiness with the economy .
And until recently , Campbell notes , GOP congressional leaders have pretty uniformly supported Bush on the war .
“ Republicans get blamed for Iraq , the public wants no part of it , so they begin to abandon the party , both in name and at the ballot box . ”
Between their growing deficit in party ID and loss of favor among independents , the math does not add up for the GOP — at least not at the moment .
Even if their presidential nominee continues to receive about 90 percent of his party ’s vote , that 90 percent will be smaller than the 90 percent of the Democratic vote going to that party ’s nominee , and independents cannot be counted on to help the GOP compensate .
But with the future leader of the party still to emerge , the current leader still struggling to make his case for an unpopular war and the party ’s ranks on Capitol Hill still fending off scandals , this can of worms will get kicked down the road .
Primary season typically is not party - building time , but a time when parties look inward .
Since this primary season began as soon as the midterm elections wrapped up , there was n’t a great deal of post - midterm discussion among Republicans about how to grow the party .
GOP candidates for president are consumed with charting courses to the nomination which run through the heart of the party ’s traditional base and which wo n’t be affected by any shrinkage of the GOP voting pool .
But barring improvement , the candidate who emerges as the nominee will face an uphill general election battle with a smaller army than the party had four years earlier .

The new note , issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe from Wednesday , can buy 1kg ( 2.2lb ) of sugar .
Food and fuel shortages have become common as the government relies more heavily on imports , pushing prices to new heights .
The official annual rate of inflation in Zimbabwe is more than 4,500 % .
In practice , this means the price of a loaf of bread costs 50 times more in cash than it did a year ago .
Shortages
The new note is worth US $ 13 at the official exchange rate or $ 1 on the black market .
ECONOMIC MELTDOWN Inflation : 4,500 % Unemployment : 80 % 3.3 m - 25 % of the population - need food aid 3 m left the country
Q&A : Zimbabwe 's economic crisis
But correspondents say that as long as Zimbabwe has a shortage of staple foods , including maize , food shortages are likely to continue .
Critics have blamed President Robert Mugabe 's policies , especially the seizure of white - owned farms , for ordinary Zimbabweans ' hardship .
For his part , President Mugabe has accused foreign governments of trying to interfere in Zimbabwe 's affairs .
The new banknote comes after International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) forecasts that by the end of 2007 , prices will be 1,000 times higher than they were a year earlier , Reuters news agency reports .
" Price controls that are being enforced are likely to exacerbate shortages and ultimately fuel further inflation , " said Bio Tchane , director of the IMF 's Africa department , who described Zimbabwe 's prospects as " bleak " .
RARELY if ever has a company risen so fast in so many ways as Google , the world 's most popular search engine .
This is true by just about any measure : the growth in its market value and revenues ; the number of people clicking in search of news , the nearest pizza parlour or a satellite image of their neighbour 's garden ; the volume of its advertisers ; or the number of its lawyers and lobbyists .
Such an ascent is enough to evoke concerns — both paranoid and justified .
The list of constituencies that hate or fear Google grows by the week .
Television networks , book publishers and newspaper owners feel that Google has grown by using their content without paying for it .
Telecoms firms such as America 's AT&T and Verizon are miffed that Google prospers , in their eyes , by free - riding on the bandwidth that they provide ; and it is about to bid against them in a forthcoming auction for radio spectrum .
Many small firms hate
Google because they relied on exploiting its search formulas to win prime positions in its rankings , but dropped to the internet 's equivalent of Hades after Google tweaked these algorithms .
And now come the politicians .
Libertarians dislike Google 's deal with China 's censors .
Conservatives moan about its uncensored videos .
But the big new fear is to do with the privacy of its users .
Google 's business model ( see article ) assumes that people will entrust it with ever more information about their lives , to be stored in the company 's “ cloud ” of remote computers .
These data begin with the logs of a user 's searches ( in effect , a record of his interests ) and his responses to advertisements .
Often they extend to the user 's e-mail , calendar , contacts , documents , spreadsheets , photos and videos .
They could soon include even the user 's medical records and precise location ( determined from his mobile phone ) .
More JP Morgan than Bill Gates
Google is often compared to Microsoft ( another enemy , incidentally ) ; but its evolution is actually closer to that of the banking industry .
Just as financial institutions grew to become repositories of people 's money , and thus guardians of private information about their finances , Google is now turning into a custodian of a far wider and more intimate range of information about individuals .
Yes , this applies also to rivals such as Yahoo ! and Microsoft .
But Google , through the sheer speed with which it accumulates the treasure of information , will be the one to test the limits of what society can tolerate .
It does not help that Google is often seen as arrogant .
Granted , this complaint often comes from sour - grapes rivals .
But many others are put off by Google 's cocksure assertion of its own holiness , as if it merited unquestioning trust .
This after all is the firm that chose “ Do n't be evil ” as its corporate motto and that explicitly intones that its goal is “ not to make money ” , as its boss , Eric Schmidt , puts it , but “ to change the world ” .
Its ownership structure is set up to protect that vision .
Ironically , there is something rather cloudlike about the multiple complaints surrounding Google .
The issues are best parted into two cumuli : a set of “ public ” arguments about how to regulate Google ; and a set of “ private ” ones for Google 's managers , to do with the strategy the firm needs to get through the coming storm .
On both counts , Google — contrary to its own propaganda — is much better judged as being just like any other “ evil ” money - grabbing company .
Grab the money
That is because , from the public point of view , the main contribution of all companies to society comes from making profits , not giving things away .
Google is a good example of this .
Its “ goodness ” stems less from all that guff about corporate altruism than from Adam Smith 's invisible hand .
It provides a service that others find very useful — namely helping people to find information ( at no charge ) and letting advertisers promote their wares to those people in a finely targeted way .
Given this , the onus of proof is with Google 's would - be prosecutors to prove it is doing something wrong .
On antitrust , the price that Google charges its advertisers is set by auction , so its monopolistic clout is limited ; and it has yet to use its dominance in one market to muscle into others in the way Microsoft did .
The same presumption of innocence goes for copyright and privacy .
Google 's book - search product , for instance , arguably helps rather than hurts publishers and authors by rescuing books from obscurity and encouraging readers to buy copyrighted works .
And , despite Big Brotherish talk about knowing what choices people will be making tomorrow , Google has not betrayed the trust of its users over their privacy .
If anything , it has been better than its rivals in standing up to prying governments in both America and China .
That said , conflicts of interest will become inevitable — especially with privacy .
Google in effect controls a dial that , as it sells ever more services to you , could move in two directions .
Set to one side , Google could voluntarily destroy very quickly any user data that it collects .
That would assure privacy , but it would limit Google 's profits from selling to advertisers information about what you are doing , and make those services less useful .
If the dial is set to the other side and Google hangs on to the information , the services will be more useful , but some dreadful intrusions into privacy could occur .
The answer , as with banks in the past , must lie somewhere in the middle ; and the right point for the dial is likely to change , as circumstances change .
That will be the main public interest in Google .
But , as the bankers ( and Bill Gates ) can attest , public scrutiny also creates a private challenge for Google 's managers : how should they present their case ?
One obvious strategy is to allay concerns over Google 's trustworthiness by becoming more transparent and opening up more of its processes and plans to scrutiny .
But it also needs a deeper change of heart .
Pretending that , just because your founders are nice young men and you give away lots of services , society has no right to question your motives no longer seems sensible .
Google is a capitalist tool — and a useful one .
Better , surely , to face the coming storm on that foundation , than on a trite slogan that could be your undoing .

Law students took notes using laptop computers in a class on evidence at Regent University .
The school , below , which was founded by televangelist Pat Robertson , is in Virginia Beach , Va. ( Gary C. Knapp for the Boston Globe ) Scandal puts spotlight on Christian law school Grads influential in Justice Dept.
VIRGINIA BEACH , Va. --
The title of the course was Constitutional Law , but the subject was sin .
Before any casebooks were opened , a student led his classmates in a 10 - minute devotional talk , completed with " amens , " about the need to preserve their Christian values .
" Sin is so appealing because it 's easy and because it 's fun , " the law student warned .
Regent University School of Law , founded by televangelist Pat Robertson to provide " Christian leadership to change the world , " has worked hard in its two - decade history to upgrade its reputation , fighting past years when a majority of its graduates could n't pass the bar exam and leading up to recent victories over Ivy League teams in national law student competitions .
But even in its darker days , Regent has had no better friend than the Bush administration .
Graduates of the law school have been among the most influential of the more than 150 Regent University alumni hired to federal government positions since President Bush took office in 2001 , according to a university website .
One of those graduates is Monica Goodling , the former top aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales who is at the center of the storm over the firing of US attorneys .
Goodling , who resigned on Friday , has become the face of Regent overnight -- and drawn a harsh spotlight to the administration 's hiring of officials educated at smaller , conservative schools with sometimes marginal academic reputations .
Documents show that Goodling , who has asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination to avoid testifying before Congress , was one of a handful of officials overseeing the firings .
She helped install Timothy Griffin , the Karl Rove aide and her former boss at the Republican National Committee , as a replacement US attorney in Arkansas .
Because Goodling graduated from Regent in 1999 and has scant prosecutorial experience , her qualifications to evaluate the performance of US attorneys have come under fire .
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , asked at a hearing : " Should we be concerned with the experience level of the people who are making these highly significant decisions ? "
And across the political blogosphere , critics have held up Goodling , who declined to be interviewed , as a prime example of the Bush administration subordinating ability to politics in hiring decisions .
" It used to be that high - level DOJ jobs were generally reserved for the best of the legal profession , " wrote a contributor to The New Republic website . " . . .
That a recent graduate of one of the very worst ( and sketchiest ) law schools with virtually no relevant experience could ascend to this position is a sure sign that there is something seriously wrong at the DOJ . "
The Regent law school was founded in 1986 , when Oral Roberts University shut down its ailing law school and sent its library to Robertson 's Bible - based college in Virginia .
It was initially called " CBN University School of Law " after the televangelist 's Christian Broadcasting Network , whose studios share the campus and which provided much of the funding for the law school .
( The Coors Foundation is also a donor to the university . )
The American Bar Association accredited Regent 's law school in 1996 .
Not long ago , it was rare for Regent graduates to join the federal government .
But in 2001 , the Bush administration picked the dean of Regent 's government school , Kay Coles James , to be the director of the Office of Personnel Management -- essentially the head of human resources for the executive branch .
The doors of opportunity for government jobs were thrown open to Regent alumni .
" We 've had great placement , " said Jay Sekulow , who heads a non profit law firm based at Regent that files lawsuits aimed at lowering barriers between church and state .
" We 've had a lot of people in key positions . "
Many of those who have Regent law degrees , including Goodling , joined the Department of Justice .
Their path to employment was further eased in late 2002 , when John Ashcroft , then attorney general , changed longstanding rules for hiring lawyers to fill vacancies in the career ranks .
Previously , veteran civil servants screened applicants and recommended whom to hire , usually picking top students from elite schools .
In a recent Regent law school newsletter , a 2004 graduate described being interviewed for a job as a trial attorney at the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division in October 2003 .
Asked to name the Supreme Court decision from the past 20 years with which he most disagreed , he cited Lawrence v. Texas , the ruling striking down a law against sodomy because it violated gay people 's civil rights .
" When one of the interviewers agreed and said that decision in Lawrence was ' maddening , ' I knew I correctly answered the question , " wrote the Regent graduate .
The administration hired him for the Civil Rights Division 's housing section -- the only employment offer he received after graduation , he said .
The graduate from Regent -- which is ranked a " tier four " school by US News & World Report , the lowest score and essentially a tie for 136th place -- was not the only lawyer with modest credentials to be hired by the Civil Rights Division after the administration imposed greater political control over career hiring .
The changes resulted in a sometimes dramatic alteration to the profile of new hires beginning in 2003 , as the Globe reported last year after obtaining resumes from 2001 - 2006 to three sections in the civil rights division .
Conservative credentials rose , while prior experience in civil rights law and the average ranking of the law school attended by the applicant dropped .
As the dean of a lower - ranked law school that benefited from the Bush administration 's hiring practices , Jeffrey Brauch of Regent made no apologies in a recent interview for training students to understand what the law is today , and also to understand how legal rules should be changed to better reflect " eternal principles of justice , " from divorce laws to abortion rights .
" We anticipate that many of our graduates are going to go and be change agents in society , " Brauch said .
Still , Brauch said , the recent criticism of the law school triggered by Goodling 's involvement in the US attorney firings has missed the mark in one respect : the quality of the lawyers now being turned out by the school , he argued , is far better than its image .
Seven years ago , 60 percent of the class of 1999 -- Goodling 's class -- failed the bar exam on the first attempt .
( Goodling 's performance was not available , though she is admitted to the bar in Virginia . )
The dismal numbers prompted the school to overhaul its curriculum and tighten admissions standards .
It has also spent more heavily to recruit better - qualified law students .
This year , it will spend $ 2.8 million on scholarships , a million more than what it was spending four years ago .
The makeover is working .
The bar exam passage rate of Regent alumni , according to the Princeton Review , rose to 67 percent last year .
Brauch said it is now up to 71 percent , and that half of the students admitted in the late 1990s would not be accepted today .
The school has also recently won moot - court and negotiation competitions , beating out teams from top - ranked law schools .
Adding to Regent 's prominence , its course on " Human Rights , Civil Liberties , and National Security " is co taught by one of its newest professors : Ashcroft .
Even a prominent critic of the school 's mission of integrating the Bible with public policy vouches for Regent 's improvements .
Barry Lynn , the head of the liberal Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , said Regent is churning out an increasingly well - trained legal army for the conservative Christian movement .
" You ca n't underestimate the quality of a lot of the people that are there , " said Lynn , who has guest - lectured at Regent and debated professors on its campus .
In light of Regent 's rapid evolution , some current law students say it is frustrating to be judged in light of Regent alumni from the school 's more troubled era -- including Goodling .
One third - year student , Chamie Riley , said she rejected the idea that any government official who invokes her Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination could be a good representative of Regent .
As Christians , she said , Regent students know " you should be morally upright .
You should not be in a situation where you have to plead the Fifth . " © Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company .

世界初の電子式卓上計算器は英国Sumlock-Comptometer社が真空管（実際にはネオンガスを封入した管）を使って開発した「アニタ・マーク8（Anita Mark 8） 」で，1961年10月のロンドン博覧会に出品された。私が勤めていたビジコン社（旧社名は日本計算器販売）はこのアニタ・マーク8を見つけて日本に輸入し，販売したが，高価過ぎて日本ではあまり売れなかった。しかしアニタ・マーク8は日本メーカーの電卓開発に大きな影響を与えた。
計算器の計算手段は，アナログ式の計算尺から，機械式手回し計算器，モーターを使った電動計算器，リレー式計算器，そして真空管を使った電子式卓上計算器（電卓）へと進化した。やがて，1951年に開発され「回路の時代」をもたらしたトランジスタや，ダイオードが使われるようになった。1964年には，トランジスタを使ったシャープの「CS-10A」やキヤノンの「キヤノーラ130」といった電卓が開発され，量産にも成功した。
電卓市場で最初の価格破壊を仕掛けたビジコン社
一方，ビジコン は1966 年に高性能電 卓 「 ビジコ ン161」を発売した。これはイタリアのモンティ・カティーニ・エジソンが開発した超小型磁気コア・メモリーの技術を日本で初めて電卓に採用したもので，メモリーを搭載し，16桁の加減乗除と平方根の計算ができた。しかもビジコンはビジコン161を29万8000円という当時としては破壊的な価格で発売した。その頃，シャープの電卓「コンペット21A」は14桁の加減乗除に対応，メモリー無しで43万5000円だった。ビジコン161は価格が30万円を切ったことから爆発的に売れた。電卓は会社に一台から各課に一台の時代となり，電卓の価格競争が始まった。
日本の電卓は事務用電卓から出発。その後，科学技術計算用電卓やプリンタ付電卓へと急成長し，日本の電卓業界はOEM（相手先ブランドで販売される製品造）を含めた世界の電卓ビジネスを一手に引き受けるようになった。電卓は今日のパソコンと同様，電子機器メーカーにとっての花形商品だった。
市場拡大とともに開発工数の削減が求められた
今から振り返ると，この価格競争と市場拡大がイノベーションを生み出したと言える。というのは，当時の電卓の制御方式は「ワイヤード・ロジック（結線または布線論理）」が採用されており，機能の変更が面倒だった。ワイヤード・ロジックはプリント基板上にトランジスタやダイオード，抵抗，集積回路（IC），磁気コア・メモリーなどを配置し，基板上の配線で論理を組み上げる制御方式である。よって，電卓の機能を変更するには基板上の配線を変更しなければならず，これでは開発工数の増大を招く。新機種の開発やOEMビジネスのためには，開発工数を増やさずに機能の追加や変更が可能な別の制御方式が必要となった。
電卓はコンピュータと同じく，入力装置や出力装置，処理装置，メモリー装置で構成されている。であれば，コンピュータと同様に「プログラム論理方式」を採用できるはずだ，とビジコンは考えた。そこでビジコンは，OEM先ごとに仕様の異なる電卓の開発を短期間に行う方法として，同方式の電卓への導入を計画した。私がビジコンに入社したのはちょうどその頃だった（関連記事）。
私は1967年に東北大学理学部を卒業後，ビジコンで電子計算機のプログラマの職に就いた。入社6カ月後，日本計算器に出向し，電卓の試作やキーボードの開発に従事した。さらに入社2年目の1968年春には，設立間もない電子技研工業に移籍した。電子技研工業はビジコンと日本計算器，三菱電機の共同出資により設立されたビジコンの東京地区における開発・製造会社であった。
これも今から振り返ると，電卓へのプログラム論理方式の採用が「4004」の開発につながる布石で，画期的なことだったように思える。しかし，当時のビジコン社内では「電子計算機」や「プログラム」などの言葉が日常的に使われていたため，プログラム論理方式の電卓への導入には実のところ何の違和感も感じなかった。
私はハードウエアとソフトウエアの両方を知っているということで，プログラム論理方式の電卓に必要な命令セットやプログラム，ハードウエア構成などの原案を作成した（次回につづく）。
Is absolute power concentrated in an autocratic ruler or clique in your government ?
Does the leader of your country adopt any of these roles : judge , jury , or executioner ?
Does he have a moustache ?
If the answer to one or more of these questions is " yes " , you may be living in a dictatorship .
But how to be absolutely certain ?
It 's easy to tell if you are living under the yoke of an old - fashioned oppressive regime , especially if somebody from the Department of Health and Human Services hammers bamboo under your fingernails .
But the modern type of dictator is a far subtler creature .
He may not wear epaulettes or shrink human heads .
Some of the foremost dictators currently in power have excellent taste in neckwear and are indistinguishable from merchant bankers .
Some of them are merchant bankers , but that 's a horse of a different subject .
The foremost tool used by modern dictators to subjugate their constituent populations is no longer violence , and this is what makes them so hard to identify .
There is now a far more effective weapon in the dictator 's arsenal : futility .
Futility has made the jackboot obsolete .
It operates on one of the greatest human vulnerabilities : our fear of humiliation .
To understand this we must define some terms .
First , futile and impossible are not the same things .
An attempt to achieve the impossible will generally end in disaster , but it will not be humiliating -- because the odds of success are extremely low , so no penalty for failure and you get points just for trying .
There is even a sort of romantic association with failure , as with tuberculosis in poets .
An excellent example of attempting the impossible is human flight .
It was impossible for centuries , and legends grew up around those that failed in the attempt .
The fellows that eventually figured the flying thing out pushed back the boundaries of impossibility , and made human flight a commonplace reality , except at Chicago 's O'Hare International terminal .
So beyond the impossible is the possible .
On the other side of the equation from impossibility , however , there 's futility .
Let 's put it another way , because I happen to have a spare analogy lying around .
A young gink in 1922 decides to send a man to the moon .
This is impossible in 1922 .
But Melvin ( let 's say his name is Melvin ) works the problem , and by the 1960's there are men hopping around the moon like large bipedal pressure - suited fleas .
So the impossible is where the action is , right ?
You follow me .
Good .
Now let 's have a look at futility .
Same Melvin ( he wears a yellow plaid waistcoat and a Rotary Club watch fob , incidentally ) decides to send a man to the moon .
But on a bicycle .
This is futile .
You could n't make a bicycle tire that would last the distance , for one thing .
Worst of all , the effort would end in humiliation .
The test pilot pedals furiously and ends up no closer to the moon than Nyack , NY before he gets short - winded and has to lie down .
Everyone involved in this junket is mocked , scorned , ridiculed , exposed to derision even , because there was never any real question how things would work out -- whereas the impossible carries with it the tang of hope .
Because you just never know .
So what the up - to - date dictator needs to do is to obscure that faint whiff of hope , to make the impossible into the merely futile , and before you know it people are throwing around references to sheep , vis -Ã -vis the general population .
Not everybody is trying to bicycle to the moon , so how does futility operate on today 's dictator - subjugated peoples ?
Let us spin another moonbeam .
Say you , an American citizen prone to whimsy , wanted to travel to Cuba .
One might say ( go ahead and say it , I 'll wait ) that the opposite of " futile " is " practical " .
Is it impossible to travel to Cuba ?
No .
A stout set of water wings is all that 's required , and maybe some sandwiches if the wind is against you .
But is it practical ?
Emphatically not .
It 's an enormous pain in the ass .
You 'll be opposed every step of the way , even if you 're on the short list of persons they 'll allow to go there , such as journalists .
It may not be impossible , but it 's futile .
How about voting for president ?
Not impossible at all .
Some people do it a dozen times in the same evening .
But ask most persons in this Great Nation if it 's worth the trouble , you will get an answer to the effect of " no " , or even " fuck off " .
But surely , a hypothetical detractor ( of which I have many ) might argue , a leader cannot be said to be a dictator , no matter how resolutely he ignores the will of the people in order to follow his own whims , if ( the word " if " here is meant to be italicized , but I forgot to do it and it's too late now ) , if ( I say again for emphasis ) the people are free to speak out against him , to vote him out of office , to protest in the streets , to elect representatives for the express purpose of opposing that leader ?
The worst one can say of such a leader is that he is of an authoritarian bent , or a peckerwood .
He can't really be a dictator , right ?
Enter futility , stage left .
Because if speaking out against him has absolutely no impact on policy , if the voting machines are sufficiently jiggered and his opponents sufficiently irresolute , if protests are ignored by politicians and news outlets alike , and if the elected representatives staunchly ignore the will of their constituents in favor of the leader 's aforementioned whims , then it is futile to bother with any of these things .
Opposition is futile : you can do it until you 're blue in the state , but nothing will happen .
It 's like boycotting Wal - Mart because it treats its employees badly : knock yourself out , but do n't expect the corporation to go socialist all of a sudden .
In fact , people that make such a stand are labeled cranks and idealists , reality - based unwashed hippie losers .
It 's humiliating .
There 's a Wal - Mart right over there , just go buy a pack of batteries .
Ahhh , that feeling of futility is gone .
Now you 're normal again .
Reactionaries please note I have never patronized a Wal - Mart .
What I 'm driving at here is that Americans are drowning in a sense of futility right now .
They are humiliated .
George W. Bush ( just for example ) crapped on their heads , so they elected Nancy Pelosi to lead the charge against him , and Pelosi kicked them in the testicles .
Humiliating .
Many folks , having read my occasional screeds documenting the death rattles of mankind , comment that rather than whining , we ought to be DOING something about the issues ( by " we " they mean " me " , of course ; they 're already making a difference with street theater featuring Uncle Sam mimes with papier - mÃ¢chÃ© tanks and wheelbarrows stuffed with fake dollar bills ) .
May the religious entity of their choice bless them , may they never get that horrible ant - like feeling of futility , but lordy lord do I ever get it myself .
It does n't mean I 'm living in a dictatorship .
Maybe I just have a low tolerance for being ignored by all - powerful megalomaniacs pissing my tax dollars away to expand the reach of their personal corporate empires .
Maybe I 'm hypersensitive to a bunch of subnormal bureaucrats deciding how much freedom is too much for my own good .
Probably I am .
But once that old feeling of futility sneaks up on me , it sure takes hold .
If it was impossible to oppose a fellow like George W. Bush ( just for example ) because he would send brownshirts to your house to cut off your ears and put food on your family , it would be a whole lot more fun .
We could have secret meetings and run little hand - cranked printing presses day and night , distributing leaflets concealed inside baskets of luncheon rolls .
Eventually someone would figure out a way to electrify his bunny slippers , and the next thing you know Biff Zapata is walking into the White House and it's a whole new day .
Many a dictator has succumbed to the impossible in this manner .
But it 's not impossible to oppose Bush , only futile .
I have been opposing him since he first started governing the country , way back in 2002 .
What has been the yield of my efforts ?
What have the steadfast and urgent efforts of all my fellow - travelers opposing this erstwhile tyrant amounted to ?
Hint : it 's a quantity in the mid- to low - zilch region , relative to the damage he has meanwhile done on the slightest caprice .
So two questions hang in the air , like goiters : first , are we living in a dictatorship ?
I know you saw through my cunning rhetorical subterfuges above and know that this is what I was driving at the whole time .
And you probably know that my answer is " yes " , but that it 's a dictatorship empowered by futility rather than violence ( the violence being restricted to people we 've recently attacked , such as Afghanis , Iraqis , or black Southerners , plus a handful of suspects whisked away for torture , just to remind everybody else there are worse sensations than a feeling of futility ) .
That said , the second question arises from the first : if this is a dictatorship , even of the subtlest kind , what does one do about it ?
It 's humiliating to go around being outwitted at every turn by a president so incompetent he could n't light a match if you held the blowtorch .
I think the answer lies in the nature of the impossible .
We should probably be attempting impossible things .
Our current incremental approach amounts to pitching pebbles in the tide .
World events play up the sense of futility : are we really going to diddle around demanding improved fuel economy when the seas are already going to rise five meters ?
How high is that in feet , anyway ?
If we 're at Peak Oil already , is it really worthwhile attempting to stop these rotten oilmen fighting it out in faraway deserts ?
Ca n't we just wait until the oil runs out ?
If the educational system is so broken it will take decades to fix , should n't we just bustle our kids into private schools now , rather than hope they graduate from high school when they 're thirty ?
It all seems dreadfully futile , put in that kind of context .
But let 's talk about the impossible : cars that run five trillion billion miles on a thimbleful of mint sauce !
A protective snow globe built over the entire North Pole with " Merry Xmas " engraved on the genuine burl walnut base !
A proportionally representative government with mandatory voting for all adults , universal healthcare , and a lifetime supply of Circus Peanuts for every citizen !
The more impossible something is , the more worthwhile it seems .
At least there 's no disgrace if it does n't quite pan out the way you intended .
Come to think of it , that 's probably the main appeal these days of demanding the impeachment of George W. Bush : when the Republicans were in control of the House and Senate , it was futile .
Now that the Democrats are in charge , it 's impossible .

Strange Culture Screenings
Critical Arts Ensemble Defense Fund
might have thought they 'd stumbled upon an underground bioterrrorist 's laboratory .
On May 11 , 2004 , 911 received a call from SUNY Buffalo University professor and artist Steve Kurtz reporting the death of Kurtz 's wife Hope from heart failure .
The responders entered the home where Kurtz worked on his projects for Critical Arts Ensemble ( CAE ) — projects which explore and critique bio-issues like our contemporary use of biotechnology for weapons programs , reproduction , and food .
The responders noted a table with scientific equipment and peculiar substances that are an essential part of Kurtz ' work .
The FBI detained and questioned Kurtz for 22 hours .
His house — and his wife 's body — were confiscated .
Kurtz ' entire street was quarantined while agents from numerous agencies , including Homeland Security and the Department of Defense , descended on his home in hazmat suits .
Everything was confiscated – computers , books on bioweaponry , garbage , posters with " suspicious " Arabic lettering on them …
everything .
After about two days , the authorities had tested the biological materials and declared that no toxic material had been found .
On May 17 , Kurtz was allowed to return to his home .
Whoops !
So did the authorities apologize to the grieving professor before busying themselves with pursuing real crimes and threats ?
Not on your life !
Despite the Public Health Commissioner 's conclusions about the safety of Kurtz 's materials , and despite the FBI 's own field and laboratory tests showing they were n't harmful to people or the environment , the Justice Department still sought charges under the U.S. Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism
Act of 1989 , as expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act — Prohibitions With Respect to Biological Weapons .
A federal grand jury rejected the charges , but instead handed down indictments with two counts each for " mail fraud " and " wire fraud . "
According to the CAE , the charges " concern technicalities " about how Kurtz obtained " $ 256 worth of harmless bacteria for one of CAE 's art projects . "
( Robert Ferrell , former head of the Department of Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh 's School of Public Health , and a collaborator on several of CAE ’s projects , now facing charges along with Kurtz )
In this interview , Kurtz characterizes the charges even more bluntly .
" The Department of Justice can drop a major felony on someone for filling out a warranty card incorrectly and mailing it .
" To bring more attention to the case , film director Lynn Hershman Leeson ( Teknolust , Conceiving Ada ) has released a unique new film , Strange Culture .
Starring Tilda Swinton , Peter Coyote , Thomas Jay Ryan , and Josh Kornbluth — plus Kurtz himself — the film effectively communicates the story while also reinventing the documentary genre in Leeson 's unique style .
Strange Culture was screened in the virtual world of Second Life as part of the 2007 Sundance Festival , a first for the festival .
The film has also been screened in Los Angeles , Albequerque , Chicago , Buffalo , Seattle and Minneapolis and is just finishing up showings in San Francisco and San Rafael on September 27 .
The film has not gone into conventional release , but future showings are planned for New York City .
Describe the project you were working on that caused you to have the materials that caused law enforcement officials to go nuts .
Three projects seemed to really bother law enforcement .
Critical Art Ensemble was working on a biochemical defense kit against Monsanto ’s Roundup Ready products for use by organic and traditional farmers .
That was all confiscated .
We had a portable molecular biology lab that we were using to test food products labeled “ organic ” to see if they really were free of GMO contaminant .
Or , when in Europe , to see if products not labeled as containing GMOs really had none .
We 'd finished the initiative in Europe and were about to launch here in the U.S. when the FBI confiscated all our equipment .
Finally , we were a preparing project on germ warfare and the theater of the absurd .
We were planning to recreate some of the germ warfare experiments that were done in the ' 50s ( which were so insane that they could only have been paid for with tax dollars ) .
We had two strains of completely harmless bacteria that simulated the behavior of actual infectious diseases — plague and anthrax .
To accompany these performances , we were in the middle of a manuscript on the militarization of civilian health agencies in the U.S. by the Bush administration .
Everything described was confiscated .
We had to start from scratch on the project and the book .
Happily , we did eventually do the experiments , and published the book — Marching Plague : Germ Warfare and Global Public Health .
Would you say that originally , they authentically suspected they had found some sort of bioterror weapon , and once they realized they had n't , they found other reasons to remain hostile ?
What I think they thought was that they had a situation , along with a vulnerable patsy , out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case .
After all , the rewards that were heaped on the agents , prosecutors , and institutions that brought home the so - called “ Lackawana Six sleeper cell ” case — another railroad job — were witnessed by others in these agencies and noted .
This made it too lucrative to pass up turning anything they could into “ terrorism ” .
They also had plenty of other reasons to be — and remain — hostile .
Could you describe the scene of the raid ?
Did they use a lot of weaponized overkill ?
I really do n’t know any more than anybody else about that .
At the time of the real action , I was at the Yes Men ’s compound in Troy , NY .
( Due to the initial media circus , I was told by my lawyers to leave town for a few days . )
From what I can tell from the news footage and the reports of neighbors , the entire alphabet soup of the federal investigative agencies was launched .
Each took a turn entering my home wearing hazmat suits with guns drawn , and proceeded to do their “ bioterrorism ” exercises .
Oh , I had the impression that the entire situation involving your wife 's death , the discovery of the materials , and the raid all happened fairly instantly .
Did this scene stretch out over days ?
It did stretch out a ways .
Even though I was illegally “ detained ” for 22 hours the day after my wife ’s death and they had confiscated my house , the raid did n’t begin .
It took a few days for them to assemble all the troops and to obtain a search warrant .
And did they think you were trying to avoid arrest since you were hiding ?
No .
I was out of town on advice of my attorneys .
I had already been in custody and released .
They knew they only had to contact my lawyer and I would self - surrender .
This must have all been a tremendous strain , coming as it did coupled with the death of your wife .
Can you describe some of the thoughts and emotions you had around all this ?
I think all adults know the feelings of intense grief and depression that are brought about by the loss of a loved one .
My feelings were in no way unique .
But when you spice it with the adrenalin and the hyperanxiety of being attacked by the full weight of federal forces , which in turn causes all your survival instincts to really kick in , you have a bad trip from which you are not going to come down for a long time .
In my case , it was six months or so before I started feeling anything approaching normal .
This close proximity to mortality stemming from two different extremes ( loss and attack ) creates a feedback loop that turns your brain into static .
Patterns of thought , emotion , and behavior deconstruct and seem to lose any identifiable point of origin .
I was a zombie — an animated organic mass with modest brain function .
Have you run into particularly Kafkaesque scenarios given this cases ' attachment to The Patriot Act and Homeland Security ?
The case has been a hyperreal , bureaucratic grind , but I have yet to wait endlessly in any hallways not knowing why I was there or what I was charged with .
Explain a little bit more about the project you were planning around these materials related to biological warfare and theater of the absurd .
We did the projects .
You can see them at our website at critical - art.net .
We just recreated a couple of the experiments that different militaries did to see if germs were viable candidates for weaponization .
For the British Plague experiments , Critical Art Ensemble went to the Isle of Lewis in Scotland where they had originally been done .
The British tests started south of this location and were land - based , but the results were so appallingly bad from a military perspective that they began to believe that the only way infectious disease could possibly be of use militarily was as a tactical ship - to - ship weapon .
To test this idea they moved to an even less populated area ( the Isle of Lewis ) .
They put a bunch of monkeys and guinea pigs on a pontoon and started shooting germs at them in both powder and wet forms from about a mile away — a very difficult shot in the blustery weather of Northern Scotland .
The infection rates were again poor , and included a fishing vessel that unsuspectingly sailed through the experiment .
The British Navy had to follow the vessel to make sure it did n’t land or make physical contact with other ships until they were sure no one on the boat was infected .
No one was .
The only conclusion reached from this experience was to move the test to the colonies — in this case , the Bahamas .
Critical Art Ensemble did the same thing , only we recreated the harmless simulant tests ( not the actual plague tests ) , and only used guinea pigs overseen by the SSPCA — no monkeys .
Our results were just as bad , so it seems as if we reliably replicated the test .
CAE went to the end of the world to shoot bacteria at guinea pigs .
Can there be a more absurdist gesture than that ?
Well yes — one : Bush reinitiating a failed germ warfare program at public expense and at the cost of civilian interests in world and national health policy .
The Bush administration is usurping public civilian agencies ( such as the CDC and countless universities ) and using them to play out the administration ’s fantasies of a terrorist germ warfare attack .
The resources to study infectious diseases are limited , and it 's criminal to use them for a remote “ what could be ” scenario at the expense of real , ongoing health crises like AIDS , TB , hepatitis , malaria , and other diseases that are killing millions every year .
I never thought of CAE as a really obscure project , since I 'd read various manifestos or statements by you and seen stuff about you here and there .
And yet , outside the avant - garde art community , very few people know about this bizarre and outrageous case .
Do you think this says something about our cluttered and diffuse culture .
I think you have stated the situation as well as I can .
Information is ubiquitous and overwhelming .
Only so much can be processed in a day .
And when you think of how many outrages are occurring each day because of the war and the current U.S. constitutional crisis , who has time to follow one of the many ridiculous court cases brought by the Department of Justice ?
One has to be motivated by a very direct interest in the case to take notice , no matter how precedent setting the case might be .
In my case , the Department of Justice is attempting to completely implode civil and criminal law , but if you are not in the arts and sciences , there ’s too many other events and situations to worry about .
Is there some way we can make it more difficult for arbitrary authority to pick off people who are on the so - called fringes ?
I have no idea .
The FBI has been a Dr. Jekyll / Mr Hyde type of institution from its inception .
While I am happy for its work against organized crime , for example , I have always been completely outraged by its continuous assault on those individuals and sometimes entire communities ( as with the current attack on peoples of Islamic faith ) who openly express ideological difference .
The FBI has worked against socialists and communists from the 20s through the 60s , and against the equal rights movements of the same period .
The COINTELPRO operations of the 60s and 70s are basically back , so exercising our rights is more risky than ever , but it ’s for that very reason we must .
Rights are won and kept through struggle , and in our struggle to preserve our Constitution , it pains me to say that the FBI is and has always been one of the anti-democratic enemies .
What do you think abour Lynn Hershman 's film , Strange Culture ?
It ’s inspirational and well worth seeing .
It has brought awareness about the case to new audiences .
Did you participate in the creative direction at all ?
No .
What kind of effect do you expect from it ?
Exactly what it ’s doing — bringing an awareness of the case to people and communities that otherwise would not hear about it .
According to the CAE defense fund FAQ , you were originally charged under prohibitions on biological weapons , but a grand jury instead handed down indictments related to " wire fraud " and " mail fraud . "
And then it also states that the terrorism charges could come back to haunt you .
I wonder how your attorneys are coping with all this .
Are they simply trying to get across the absurdity of the whole mess , or are their any legal fine points ?
What they have been arguing in motion hearings is that the Department of Justice is making an absurd interpretation of the mail fraud law .
The DoJ has thrown away its guidelines ( which state my case should not be prosecuted ) and interpreted the law in a way that is unique for my situation .
My co-defendant Bob Ferrell and I are the first citizens to ever be indicted for mail or wire fraud because we supposedly broke a material transfer agreement .
The “ defrauded ” parties do not believe we did anything to harm them — the crime is a DoJ fantasy that they hope to prove .
We ’ll see at trial if rationality prevails .
If it does n’t , the case will set a precedent that will mean that the Justice Department can drop a major felony on someone for filling out a warranty card incorrectly and mailing it .
This will be a major tool for them .
Talk about being able to pick off people at will !
Jared Diamond , the noted evolutionary biologist and Pulitzer Prize - winning author of Guns , Germs , and Steel and most recently Collapse , has very definite ideas about why the little people of Flores would not have had sex with modern humans , would not have coexisted long with them in any case , and cannot possibly still survive today — among other cogent thoughts .
In this wide - ranging interview , Robert Krulwich picks Diamond 's spirited brain about all things floresiensis .
Big story about little people Krulwich : Alright .
First let me just ask you , as stories go , to me this is a big one .
But what about to you ?
Diamond :
To me , when I heard of this , I immediately said to myself , this is the most amazing discovery in any field of science in at least the last 10 years .
Krulwich :
That big ?
Diamond : Yeah .
Krulwich : Why ?
Diamond : Why ?
Because it 's the most drastically different human that existed in the last million years .
And that it turned up — you would n't have thought that remarkable new discoveries like this were still waiting to be made among humans .
And if made anywhere , I would n't have expected it to turn up on the island of Flores , which lots of zoologists have gone to to study Komodo dragons .
You would n't expect something weird to be lurking there with all the searches for the Komodo dragon .
Krulwich :
Is the main weird thing that this is an ancient bit of life that is extremely modern all of a sudden ?
Or is it that there 's just another bit of life that you did n't know about ?
Or both ?
Diamond :
There are two weird things about it .
One is that it 's so small , smaller than any human or protohuman of the last five million years .
And the other thing is that it appears to be a really late survivor of Homo erectus , which we thought was gone long before that .
The third amazing thing is that there 's the possibility that it coexisted with modern Homo sapiens , which would astonish me — and which I think is probably wrong .
But it 's open for discussion .
Krulwich :
If you were to just play a hunch — because , I mean , there are going to be arguments that say nay and there are going to be arguments that say yeah — is your hunch at this point that they actually existed as a separate species ?
Or that they were a sick bunch of human beings ?
Diamond :
Well , I would bet $ 10 , or 10 to one odds , that they were a separate species and not some deformed , microcephalic [ that is , having an abnormally small head ] modern humans .
Krulwich : Why ?
Because you want it ?
Because it 's a great tale ?
Or because there 's just something in you that says , yeah , the data will deliver ?
Diamond :
The data already out there — well , the skull does not resemble that of known microcephalics .
They 've got eight different specimens , or fragments of eight different specimens .
The recent information on the brain indicates a very distinctive form of brain .
The whole form of the skull is erectus - like , and it's not pathological - sapiens - like .
So everything says yes erectus and no , not a weird sapiens .
Island hopping Krulwich : Alright .
So puzzle number one :
This is a creature that came out of Africa , like presumably all of us did , and kind of wandered into Europe and wandered into Asia .
And now we find a variation on this creature on an island .
Are you puzzled about how a creature like this would get to an island ?
Diamond : I 'm puzzled , but not very puzzled .
One may ask how on Earth did these very primitive humans get to an island ?
Getting to an island requires boats , and they probably did n't have the brains to have boats .
But then reflect :
On this island were also elephants that certainly did not have boats .
And on another island in the same general area were not only a couple of types of elephants but also buffalo and pigs and at least two species of monkeys .
And you can be sure that the buffalo and the monkeys did not have boats or rafts .
So whatever way that the buffalo , elephants , pigs , and monkeys got there , humans got there .
In fact , we know something about how animals reach islands .
One way is they can swim .
Elephants can swim reasonably well .
Pigs likewise .
Certainly humans can swim .
The distances involved were slight .
Krulwich : Like six or eight or 10 miles ?
Thirty miles ?
Something like that ?
Diamond : I think more like three to 10 miles .
The water gaps even today are less than 30 miles .
But all this was going on during the Ice Ages , when around the world a lot of water was locked up in glaciers .
So sea level was low .
And where at present you have shallow seas , up to 10,000 years ago would have been dry land .
Like the English Channel used to be dry land .
Krulwich :
Oh , so you could have walked there conceivably ?
Diamond : No , you could n't walk there .
These particular channels were never obliterated , as the English Channel was .
But they were considerably narrower than they are now .
Krulwich :
So if you walked most of the distance from Africa to near Flores , and you had a little bit of water between you and it , how would you get across that little bit of water ?
Not a raft , not a boat , because we 're thinking they 're too dumb for this ?
Diamond :
Well , there were actually three possible ways .
One is , maybe they did have enough brains to have a really primitive raft .
For example , maybe they just had bamboo that they lashed together , and it may not take much brains to lash bamboo together .
So that 's one possibility .
Another possibility is they swam — it 's a few miles — or they got carried along by the current .
Elephants did it , monkeys did it .
If monkeys could do it , why could n't these dumb humans do it ?
And then thirdly ...
Krulwich :
You mean , you like grab onto a log and float for the afternoon or something like that ?
Diamond : Even without grabbing onto a log .
Just floating .
And the third possibility is what you say , that they grab onto a log .
But it 's bigger than a log .
When you 're on the coast in low tropical rainforest areas , when there 's a big storm , whole pieces of bank get displaced and washed down rivers .
Those pieces of bank actually have trees on them ; they 're like floating islands .
That 's the way that , for example , lots of rats and lizards reach islands .
They get carried out on these big masses of floating vegetation .
So I 'd say there are three choices .
It 's these natural rafts , or they swam or floated , or they had just enough brains to build really simple bamboo rafts .
Shrunk to fit Krulwich : Okay .
Now , when these creatures arrive on the island , they are normal - sized .
When we discover them later , they are smaller .
What happened ?
Diamond :
What happened ?
They shrunk in size .
There are lots of precedents for that .
There were lots of big animals that arrived on small islands and then , over evolutionary time , they shrunk in size .
Krulwich : Such as ?
Diamond :
There are lots of elephants , for example .
Here where we sit in southern California , about 50 miles off the coast is an island called Santa Rosa that had pygmy mammoths .
These were big mammoths that swam out there and ended up shrunk to horse size .
There were pygmy elephants on lots of islands around the world .
Krulwich :
Is a pygmy elephant like 20 percent or 80 percent of the other , regular elephant ?
How shrinky are those ?
Diamond : Oh , they can be one tenth the mass .
They can be cow - sized elephants .
For example , on this very island with pygmy humans , Flores , there were pygmy elephants .
So that 's one pygmy .
There were pygmy buffaloes .
There were pygmy deer on quite a few islands .
There were pygmy elk .
There were pygmy giant deer .
There were pygmy hippopotamuses in the Mediterranean .
Krulwich :
Oh , so getting smaller is kind of normal if you 're isolated on an island ?
Diamond :
If you 're a big animal that gets isolated on an island , the only way to survive is to get smaller .
If you do n't get smaller , you die out .
Krulwich : Why ?
Diamond : Because if you 're big , the smaller island is n't able to hold enough individuals to make a sustainable population .
For example , let 's take humans .
Suppose these were full - sized humans arriving on that island .
Flores is a moderately small island .
It might have been big enough to hold , in isolation , say 200 full - sized humans .
Of those 200 , 100 are males , 100 females .
Of the 100 females , 50 are juveniles , and 50 are adults .
And of those 50 adults , some are better than others .
So what sounds like 200 , a viable population , you end up with maybe only 10 or 20 skilled , reproductive females .
That gets marginal .
And then if you have a drought and a Komodo dragon kills a few of them on top of it , it 's just not a viable population .
You also get genetic problems — inbreeding — when you 've got as few as 200 .
Now , suppose your humans are not 150 - pound humans but 30 - pound humans .
You can get five times as many of them .
And your population is not 200 , but 1,000 .
Now you 've got something viable .
Krulwich :
So you do n't run the risk of everyone being first cousins of everybody else , resulting in a weak genetic situation ?
If you have more folks , then you have more variation , and you can be a little bit more robust ?
Diamond :
It 's not just that you have more variation .
You 've got more individuals .
Few individuals , even if they 've got great variation , are at risk of a fluctuation that wipes them out .
So that 's the reason why we 've got on islands around the world all of these — there must be a couple of dozen populations of pygmy elephants and pygmy hippos and pygmy deer and pygmy giant deer and pygmy people .
Krulwich :
But one could argue that human beings are different from deer and buffalo and elephants , because they can have meetings , you know , maybe hand signals or something to say " Let 's not have as many babies this year " or whatever .
They do n't have to do it inside their bodies .
They can do it with their brains .
Diamond : Brains are good for solving some problems , and they 're not good for solving other problems .
If the basic problem is that you do n't have enough people , then no matter how smart you are , the population will die out .
We have examples of this in modern times .
There are modern human populations that were too small and died out .
For example , Pitcairn Island , which was colonized by the Bounty mutineers because it was supposedly an empty island .
When the Bounty mutineers arrived on Pitcairn in 1790 , they found abandoned temple platforms and statues .
There had been a human population isolated there .
From the size of Pitcairn , we can be confident that there were fewer than 200 individuals .
They were able to survive as long as there were boats bringing fresh humans .
But once the boats disappeared , that population then died out .
So we know that not even modern humans are enough to survive as a small population .
Krulwich :
So it 's crucial to have as many of you as possible .
On the other hand , you have to eat and take care of yourself .
And that 's the tension ?
Diamond :
That 's right .
Krulwich :
So smaller is better ?
Diamond :
That 's right .
Krulwich :
Why does this process begin on islands ?
What is it about islands that triggers this ?
Diamond : Restricted space , and hence a restricted population .
This dwarfing occurs only on smallish islands .
Dwarfing has not been documented for a big island like Japan or Britain .
Krulwich :
Is it also important that bigger , full - sized adult human beings do n't join you from elsewhere periodically ?
I would think that 's the other issue .
You do n't get any more biggies .
Diamond : Yeah .
If you had biggies , the biggies would provide genes .
Krulwich :
They would have sex with you , and you would have big babies ?
Diamond :
You have sex and you have big babies .
But the other thing is if you have biggies , the biggies will rescue the population .
So say every generation in come a few individuals .
Your population starts to get dangerously small , but then in come a few biggies , and they rescue the population .
Krulwich :
So you 're not surprised , then , that this group of human types could become very small ?
Diamond : I would say yes and no .
On thinking about it , I 'm not surprised .
The reason that I was surprised initially was that there had n't been a documented case of dwarfing in island human populations .
In retrospect , you could say " Okay , so there 's dwarfing in humans .
We already had dwarfing in elephants .
What 's the big deal ? "
But it was the first .
A spectacular solution Krulwich : Now , I want to talk about just how small .
This is pretty small , as currently gauged .
It 's like three feet tall .
It 's very close to — I do n't know if you 've seen the Austin Powers movies .
There 's this character who is a mad scientist , and he delights in creating an absolutely tiny version of himself .
It 's smaller than a dwarf ; it 's like a three - foot - tall version .
He calls it Mini - Me .
It seems like movie stuff .
In this case , though , a third of standard human size seems very small because it means that everything is a third smaller , particularly the brain .
Does n't that give you pause , a brain that 's a third the size of your own ?
Diamond :
It 's even worse than that .
The estimates of weight are something like 30 pounds compared to modern - sized humans of 150 pounds .
So they were about one - fifth of human size .
Again , if you had told me some scientist has made this amazing discovery of a dwarf human population [ and you had asked ] how big do you think they were , I would have guessed 80 pounds .
Is n't that incredible ?
So when I say this is the most amazing discovery in the past 10 years , I would never have dreamed that they could have shrunk down to 30 pounds .
Krulwich :
What 's crucial here , the weight , the scale , or the brain ?
Or all of it ?
Diamond :
The weight and the food requirements .
What 's required in order to subsist as a smaller population is lots of small individuals with small food requirements .
The brain is n't the problem .
The food consumption is the problem .
Krulwich :
But this is tremendously successful then .
If you can get down to that scale , then you 're really treading very lightly on the land .
There can be more and more of you .
Diamond :
That 's right .
Krulwich :
It 's a very spectacular solution .
Diamond :
It is .
It 's a spectacular solution , like the pygmy hippos on the island of Cyprus .
They were cute little things about so big [ indicates size of a pig ] .
That 's pretty dramatic .
Krulwich :
What about the brain , though ?
First of all , these creatures had tools , and they had fire .
I know this is not exactly your field , but I 'm just curious .
Fire is a dangerous thing .
Does cooking mean that you 're a sophisticate ?
Diamond : Neanderthals are the first humans for whom there 's clear evidence of the control of fire .
That is to say , Neanderthal campsites regularly show evidence of hearths .
So we know that Neanderthals had fire .
Now , Neanderthals had full - size brains , but those brains clearly were not up to the brains of modern humans , because Neanderthals did not invent rapidly , and they did n't have much in the way of art .
Fire impresses me a little , but not very much .
Dragons in the diet ?
Krulwich :
What about the fact , and I 'll read you the diet , when they look , they find contemporaneous burnt , chewed , gnawed , or otherwise looking like foodish versions of fish , frogs , snakes , tortoises , birds , rodents , bats , stegodonts ...
What 's a stegodont ?
Diamond : Stegodonts are the pygmy elephants .
Krulwich : Alright .
And Komodo dragons .
Have you ever seen a Komodo dragon ?
Diamond : Yes .
Closely .
Krulwich : Very closely ?
Diamond : Mm-hmm .
Krulwich : I 'm looking at one now , in my mind .
I do n't know how much they weigh , but this one looks like it 's 250 pounds or something .
What do they weigh ?
Diamond : Up to 500 pounds .
But it 's worse than that because while the modern Komodo dragons weigh up to 500 pounds , the archeological excavations that produced the dwarves also produced evidence of a super - size Komodo dragon .
Krulwich :
Oh , so these dragons are getting smaller , too , over time ?
Diamond : No , the dragons are different .
Warm - blooded animals shrink on islands .
Cold - blooded animals often expand on islands , to fill the niche left by lions and tigers that could not get out there .
Cold - blooded animals have lower food requirements , and so a cold - blooded animal requires as much food as a warm - blooded animal one - seventh of its size .
Krulwich : Oh !
So while the mammals are going down , the reptiles could be going up ?
Diamond :
It happened there on Flores .
Flores has the Komodo dragon , the world 's biggest lizard today .
But in the past apparently it had a super Komodo dragon .
Krulwich :
What 's going on with the mouth of this beast ?
It 's going [ makes slurping sound ] , and there 's all this stuff flying in the air .
What is that ?
Diamond :
It 's very interesting .
Komodo dragons , the way that they kill is they 're ambush predators .
They can run quickly for about 20 or 50 feet and they get exhausted .
So they can't chase down a prey .
In modern times , Komodo dragons have been hunting introduced goats or buffalo .
They wait in ambush , and they race out , and they take a bite .
Sometimes they pull the animal down , but sometimes they do n't , and the buffalo staggers off .
Within a day or two , the buffalo dies an agonizing death of infection within the territory of the Komodo dragon that brought it down .
And the reason that the buffalo has died this agonizing death is that Komodo dragons do not brush their teeth .
Krulwich : [ laughs ]
Diamond :
In fact , they have specialized in not brushing their teeth .
Because they 've got all this rotting meat between their teeth , their mouths harbor bacteria .
And these are n't just the bacteria that you and I would have if we ate steaks and then did not brush our teeth for a week .
Komodo dragons have evolved really nasty bacteria .
So what happens is the buffalo has been bitten , it staggers off , the wound gets infected , the buffalo gets really sick , and then it falls down in the territory of the Komodo dragon that wounded it .
Krulwich :
So that spit is — that 's poisonous spit ?
Diamond :
It 's not spit that contains cyanide .
It 's spit that contains bacteria like botulism bacteria and anthrax and other things that you would not want to get infected by .
Krulwich :
So if you wanted to eat one of these things , if that 's in your diet , then you 'd better come prepared with tools , with some kind of cooperation , because you 're only three feet tall .
Diamond : Mm-hmm .
Krulwich :
What do you think ?
Diamond :
Well , if I were three feet tall and I were hunting a Komodo dragon , and I were not yet smart enough to have bows and arrows , which they did n't have for sure , I would vote for a spear .
A spear that I could throw .
Or a lance .
We know that Neanderthals in Europe had spears , so maybe these creatures had spears .
This is all assuming that they really hunted the Komodo dragons .
Krulwich : Right .
Diamond : Because there 's the added question of who really killed the stuff ?
Was it the dwarves ?
Or was it the later sapiens ?
Krulwich :
If they were eating them before the sapiens arrived , though , then it really gets interesting .
Diamond : Yeah .
Then they had to have some way of killing a Komodo dragon .
And if I were to do it , I would elect for a thrown spear , so that I did n't have to get in close quarters .
A question of brains Krulwich : Would I be able to say " Hey , Charlie , move over to the left ? "
Or have some form of language ?
Diamond :
Not necessarily , because wolves and lions do pretty good communal hunting without any form of language .
Krulwich :
So having Komodo dragon meat in my diet is not an absolute , not the Harvard Law degree of brains ?
I mean , it just means that you 're a little ahead of the game , but you are n't a monster intelligence ?
Or does it ?
Diamond : Unless wolves and lions are graduating from Harvard Law School nowadays , which they certainly were not in my day .
Krulwich : [ laughs ]
Diamond :
No , I would say hunting a Komodo dragon , that 's not the real test of brains .
Krulwich :
Which leaves us with this other question of , when scientists have now begun looking at endocasts of these brains , they say — well , at least this fellow Ralph [ Holloway , an anthropologist at Columbia University ] who we talked to — he says , well , they do n't look the same as human brains .
There could be two reasons for that .
They could be sick human brains , in which case they would look like sick human brains , or they could be something different .
At the moment , as we 're interviewing , the preponderance of view is that they seem to be something different .
The question is , can you create a brain that can do more work in a smaller cavity ?
That 's one of the big questions raised here .
Diamond : Mm-hmm .
Krulwich :
What do you think ?
Diamond : Uh , I would n't reject the possibility .
Here 's a clear example of evolving a brain that can do far better in the same space , or even in less space :
The brains of Neanderthals were , on average , slightly larger than the brains of modern humans .
But modern humans were far more inventive than Neanderthals .
As soon as you get modern humans — sapiens — you begin to get art , you begin to get rapid change of artifacts .
You start getting bows and arrows , and spear throwers .
You get far more rapid invention than had gone on with 300,000 years of Neanderthals .
So the secret to modern humans was not getting a bigger brain .
The brain is getting smaller .
Something happened in the reorganization of the brain that made them smarter .
Krulwich :
But this is a pretty big challenge .
We 're talking here about one - third the size .
Diamond : Mm-hmm .
Krulwich : A little bigger than chimpanzees , a lot less big than , for example , you .
Diamond : Mm-hmm .
Krulwich :
So you have to imagine a thinking , conscious , sentient person with a third of your brain .
A third .
Diamond : A somewhat thinking , somewhat conscious , somewhat sentient person .
And without being boastful , I still believe that I would outclass them , and that all of us here would outclass them .
They might have had enough brains to make tools , maybe even moderately sophisticated tools .
How much brains does that require ?
People have tried to teach tool - making to chimpanzees .
The problem is not so much with their brains as with their hand grip .
These dwarves had a good hand grip — people have had a good hand grip for two million years .
In truth , it remains to be seen how smart they were .
I have n't seen evidence of proto -Einsteins out there yet .
Unsafe sex Krulwich : Alright .
Last set of questions .
This has to do with sex mostly .
We have this astonishing thought that on this island were two populations — for maybe as many as 40,000 years , Homo sapiens ( us ) and little people .
Now , the eighth - grade definition of species is that if you 're a little person and I 'm a big person , I would n't want to have sex with you because you look " other , " and if I did have sex with you , I / we could n't have a baby .
Is that where we are in this situation ?
Diamond : Uh , yes .
The definition of species is reproductive isolation .
Populations that do n't interbreed with each other given the opportunity would be considered distinct species .
So I guess the final question that everybody is too shy to ask about these micropygmies is , did we or did n't we have sex with them ?
Because the fact is that modern humans , Homo sapiens , eventually arrived at this island of Flores and would have coexisted for some length of time that you can argue about .
Did we or did n't we have sex with them ?
My bet is we did not have sex with them , and here 's my reasoning .
Although they were small , they would have been tough , nasty characters .
About a week and a half ago in Los Angeles , there was a really tragic , awful event in which a couple who had brought up a pet chimpanzee went and visited their pet chimpanzee in an animal shelter with a couple of other chimpanzees that had been kept there for a long time .
These were chimpanzees habituated to humans .
And something went wrong .
Two teenage male chimpanzees attacked the man , and the result was just awful .
They pulled off his nose , and [ attacked ] his eyes .
They chewed off every one of his fingers .
They chewed out his buttocks .
Okay ?
What do I think would have happened if some full - sized male sapiens had presented his private parts for having sex with this 30 - pound pygmy ?
I would not have given much for the future of the private parts of that male sapiens .
Krulwich : Really ?
Diamond : I would predict that those pygmies would have been really nasty .
Just like any humans would be really nasty .
Krulwich :
What , because the pygmy looking at the other was like " This is an other .
I do n't know why he 's doing this to me ? "
Diamond :
That 's right .
This would be hostile .
Modern human populations are hostile to each other .
It takes something to have sex between modern human populations .
Krulwich : How about curiosity ?
I mean , we all know about folks who , you know , sometimes go off into the barn and do things we do n't even need to know about .
Could n't there have been a little person and a big person who just wanted to " I 'll show you mine if you show me yours " and it would n't have been quite such a hostile act ?
Wiped out Diamond : Almost all sheep are nice [ laughs ] .
Almost all humans are not nice .
Example : Today , in Africa , we have chimpanzees .
Chimpanzees are about the same size as humans , and genetically they 're the species closest to humans .
Despite that , there is no attested case of humans having sex with chimpanzees .
It would be absolutely lethal .
The man who did it would come off without his private parts !
Krulwich : Alright .
So you 're thinking here real speciation .
If there were an attempt to inseminate one to the other , what would be the issue , if they were truly a different species ?
Diamond :
The likelihood of a viable hybrid , given the extreme differences , would be rather slight .
There are the size differences .
One would expect there to be developmental differences , maybe a different duration of pregnancy .
I would expect them to be too different .
But on top of that , people talk about possible coexistence between the micropygmies and modern sapiens for 40,000 years .
I do n't believe it .
My guess is that within 100 years of modern sapiens arriving on the island , the dwarves would have been exterminated .
Krulwich :
By the humans ?
Diamond :
By the humans .
We know that modern humans , given the opportunity , exterminate other modern humans .
I cannot believe that they would have failed to exterminate these dwarves in a very short time .
Krulwich :
That seems to be your prejudice .
I mean , you said the dumbest thing that ever happened was Carl Sagan sending off the message to outer space saying " Here we are , the lovely people on Earth . "
In your mind , that was called " Come and get me . "
Diamond :
That 's right .
I 've worked in New Guinea for the last 41 years , and I know what happens in New Guinea .
And we have evidence about what happens in traditional human societies , namely , there are uneasy relationships at the boundaries .
You certainly do n't tolerate strangers , because it 's dangerous to tolerate strangers .
You try to kill them .
When a human population colonizes an area with another human population , there is a touchy negotiation in which either one group exterminates the other or they decide that they can't exterminate the other , so they see if there is some mode of coexistence based on different economics .
For example , coexistence between Pygmies and farmers in the Congo basin .
Pygmies and farmers do n't kill each other .
They have different economies , which match .
The Pygmies are hunter gatherers ; they gather honey , they hunt animals in the jungle .
And the farmers grow crops .
So the Pygmies and the farmers trade back and forth .
They have different economies .
It works .
In the case , then , of the micropygmies and Homo sapiens [ on Flores ] , both of them would have been hunter gatherers .
They would have been competing directly .
There would have been no basis for trade , because there would n't have been a difference that would have allowed profitable trade .
Krulwich :
So this would be a case of " I 'm here , and therefore you 're not , because you 're in my way . "
Diamond : " I 'm here , and you 're going to be good food , and this is my island . "
Again , I would bet 10 to one odds on my $ 10 that the micropygmies did not last .
I would give them 100 years .
Maybe even just 10 years from the time that full - sized sapiens arrived before they were exterminated .
Krulwich :
So you do n't buy into this 40,000 years of cohabitation at all ?
Diamond : Absolutely not .
Still with us ?
Krulwich : Let 's finish , then , with this question .
Is it possible , in this modern world , that these creatures might still be around ?
Diamond : No [ laughs ] .
Krulwich : Not possible ?
Diamond : No .
It 's not possible because humans have been running around every place in the modern world .
Why did they discover the micropygmies ?
Because their bones were buried deeply in the ground .
Even archeologists working on the island of Flores came across the bones only relatively recently .
There have not been surprising new human populations discovered except in previously unexplored areas like the New Guinea islands .
Krulwich :
What about folktales ?
I mean , Norwegians had elves , we have hobbits .
Are those just stories people tell each other , or do they have any probative value to scientists ?
Diamond : Zero. Krulwich : Zero ? Diamond : Zero [ laughs ] .
Krulwich :
What do you mean ?
If you arrive somewhere , do n't the stories people tell , do n't your ears perk up ?
Diamond : Yes , my ears [ do ] , but people tell all sorts of strange stories , and some of them are true , and some of them are not true .
We have to assess whether they might be true .
Might it be the case that after thousands of years of Indonesians tramping around every single island in Indonesia , and after a couple of hundred years of Europeans tramping around Indonesia , and after 100 years of people tramping around the island of Flores 100 years after we discovered the Komodo dragon , might there still be tiny people out there in the jungle ?
No .
No chance whatsoever .
Krulwich : Alright .
Then I 'm going to ask you a stupid very last question .
Let 's suppose that you wanted to look for one anyway .
Where would you look ?
Diamond :
In another galaxy [ laughs ] .
Certainly not on Earth .
“ If you ’re a big animal that gets isolated on an island , the only way to survive is to get smaller . ”
“ Brains are good for solving some problems , and they ’re not good for solving other problems . ”
“ Fire impresses me a little , but not very much . ”
“ It remains to be seen how smart they were .
I have n’t seen evidence of proto - Einsteins out there yet . ”
“ You certainly do n’t tolerate strangers , because it ’s dangerous to tolerate strangers . ”
Washington , DC --
New research by political scientists concludes that available data does not appear to support the claim that Hispanic immigration poses a threat to American identity .
Among the key findings of this study are that Hispanics acquire English and lose Spanish rapidly beginning in the 2nd generation ; appear to be as religious and at least as committed to the work ethic as native - born whites ; and largely reject a purely ethnic identification and exhibit levels of patriotism equal to native - born whites by the 3rd generation .
This research is presented in an article entitled " Testing Huntington : Is Hispanic Immigration a Threat to American Identity ? " by co-authors Jack Citrin , Amy Lerman , Michael Murakami ( all of the University of California , Berkeley ) , and Kathryn Pearson ( University of Minnesota ) .
The article appears in the March issue of Perspectives on Politics , a journal of the American Political Science Association ( APSA ) , and is available online at http://www. apsanet . org / imgtest / PerspectivesMar07Citrin_etal .

The goal of the study is to test several propositions in the national debate on immigration -- put forth by Harvard scholar Samuel Huntington among others -- which emphasize the destabilizing impact of Mexican immigration on American national identity .
The authors seek to " ground the debate over Huntington 's prognosis ... in a sustained empirical analysis of recent immigrants . "
The resulting analysis employs data from the U.S. Census and several national and Los Angeles opinion surveys with thousands of respondents .
Traditional patterns of linguistic assimilation result in the vast majority of immigrants becoming monolingual in English by the 3rd generation .
Clear evidence also points to the continuation of these patterns in the case of Hispanic -- and specifically Mexican - - immigrants .
In the 2000 Census , 50 % of the native - born living in the households of Mexican - born immigrants either spoke only English or spoke English very well .
Other data show that 71 % of Hispanic immigrants are English dominant by the 3rd generation and that " controlling for age , education , income and residential context , 2nd and 3rd generation Hispanics are much more likely than immigrants to speak English well . "
The authors note that this " intergenerational rate of linguistic assimilation among the offspring of Mexican immigrants surpassed that of every other immigrant group . "
Moreover , they found that " the pace of linguistic assimilation among recent Mexican immigrants seems to be more rapid than in the past . "
Finally , the authors observe that by the 3rd generation , Hispanics ' preferences on policy questions related to bilingual education and declaring English as the official language of the U.S. " closely resemble those of whites and blacks . "
Huntington and other nationalists have prioritized identity with the nation over other affiliations and are concerned about a collision between demographic diversity and national solidarity .
The data analyzed in this study demonstrate that " the assimilation of Hispanics is proceeding but is not complete . "
By the 3rd generation 56 % of Hispanics identify themselves as American , and " among native - born Hispanics , an American identity ... far outstrips a purely ethnic identity . "
In terms of love of country , the authors find that " patriotism among Hispanics , including the foreign - born , is as high as among white Americans . "
Finally , regarding the perceived challenge posed to the cultural foundation of the Anglo - Protestant Ethic by Hispanic immigration , the data shows that " Hispanics as a whole appear to attend church about as often as white respondents " and there is no evidence that they or their offspring are " quicker to abandon God or country than other Americans . "
Hispanics are also more likely than whites -- by a margin of 59 % to 30 % -- to agree with the statement that " success at work in America comes from doing what is best for yourself rather than what is best for others , " belying the fear that " today 's Hispanic immigrants are unprepared to work hard . "
The prominent debate about immigration and its consequences today has wide - ranging consequences for immigrants and U.S. citizens alike and is a growing field of research for political scientists .
This important study examines the veracity of claims made in the immigration debate regarding threats to American national identity .
Contrary to these fears , the authors observe that " the data available now suggest that the rise of a self - sufficient sub-population speaking mainly Spanish ... is not a serious threat , and that the privileged status of English as the country 's sole common language remains secure . "
They conclude by noting that while predictions about the future always are risky " at present traditional patterns of assimilation appear to prevail " among Hispanic newcomers .

A few years ago , we predicted that the spread of DVRs was going to change advertising culture , as viewers gained the ability to jump past commercials and free themselves from scheduled broadcasting times .
Now a new study from the University of Oregon has found that local news broadcasts are being infiltrated by advertising at around the same rate that DVR users skip ads .
The fact that DVRs allow viewers to skip adverts is seen as one of their biggest benefits by users , but advertisers — and the TV networks that depend on them — are not so happy .
Ad buyers do n't want to pay full price for slots that viewers will never see , and TV networks are going as far as asking fans not to watch timeshifted programs but instead watch them live , lest the show in question get canceled .
Since the economies we live in depend on consumer spending , those on the selling side of the equation need a way to get the message out regarding their new product , and if viewers are n't prepared to watch the adverts , then some other way of reaching them will be used .
The researchers looked at 17 different TV stations in the US over a four - month period in 2004 .
The study , published in Electronic News , monitored 2 newscasts a month for each station and looked for instances where ' stealth adverts ' crept into the news reporting .
A stealth advert , according to Jim Upshaw , one of the authors of the report , is when a commercial message promoting a product is " cloaked in some other garment than a normal commercial . "
Upshaw and his colleagues found that 90 percent of the newscasts contained at least one instance of stealth advertising , including product placement within stories or on the anchors ' desks , and sponsored segments .
Small - to - medium sized stations were more susceptible to the trend than those serving larger markets .
We 've previously reported on the growing trend for product placement within TV shows , although these are usually at the network level .
Since local TV stations make a lot of their revenue from selling ad slots during the nightly news broadcasts , their perceived fear of DVR - using audiences is evidently driving this move from selling advertising between news segments to selling it during those segments .
This is n't the first time that smaller news broadcasts have come under fire for presenting information to viewers under the guise of reporting when , in fact , they 're promoting someone else 's message .
Last year the FCC rapped 77 different broadcasters ' knuckles over the widespread use of video news releases , where video press releases were used on air and presented as news without being identified as such .
Merck said it had adequately warned patients and doctors of Vioxx ’s heart risks and that it never knowingly endangered patients .
The pace of Vioxx - related lawsuits , after soaring in 2005 and 2006 , has fallen slightly this year , as plaintiffs ’ lawyers shy away from cases where they lack strong evidence that their clients took Vioxx for several months before having a heart attack .
Lawyers have withdrawn several cases as they were about to go to trial .
“ It seems to have worked quite well , ” Peter Schuck , a professor at Yale Law School who specializes in complex litigation , said of Merck ’s strategy .
“ They have discouraged the plaintiffs ’ bar from litigating these cases . ”
The legal system is not set up to try thousands of cases at once , and nearly all Vioxx lawsuits are caught up in the pretrial process .
Plaintiffs ’ lawyers have tried to get the courts to combine all the potential suits into a single class action .
But judges have rejected that tactic .
Because the facts of individual cases can vary greatly , each case must be tried separately , courts have ruled .
So far , fewer than 20 Vioxx suits have reached juries , an average of 9 in each of the last two years .
At this rate , the backlog of Vioxx cases will take years to work through and many plaintiffs may die before they get their day in court .
Even if they win , it will take years for plaintiffs to be compensated .
Merck has appealed every case it has lost .
In the case of Mrs. Ernst , if her award is upheld , she will not be paid before 2010 at the earliest , her lawyer , W. Mark Lanier of Houston , said .

After the 2005 verdict , analysts wondered how Merck would overcome evidence presented in the case , showing that the company had been concerned about Vioxx ’s potential heart risks as early as 1997 , two years before it began selling the drug .

Buddhist monks march through Ahlone , a Rangoon suburb , on 24 September

Brig Gen Thura Myint Maung , minister for religion , warned them not to break Buddhist " rules and regulations " as Rangoon saw the largest march yet .
He blamed the protests on " destructive elements " opposed to peace in Burma .
President George W Bush is set to announce fresh US sanctions on Burmese leaders , the White House says .
The sanctions , which will include a ban on US visas , will be announced during Mr Bush 's speech at the United Nations on Tuesday , US National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said .
The military government has so far showed restraint against the protests .
Monks are highly revered in Burma and correspondents say any move by the junta to crush their demonstrations would spark an outcry .
But there are fears of a repeat of 1988 , correspondents say , when the last democracy uprising was crushed by the military and some 3,000 people were killed .
' Communist plot '
Some monks ' representatives had called for the entire country to join them in their campaign to overthrow the government , which began eight days ago .

Monday saw marches in at least 25 towns and cities , including Mandalay , Sittwe and Pakokku .
Turnout estimates in Rangoon , Burma 's biggest city , range from 50,000 to 100,000 .
According to state media , the minister for religion spoke after meeting senior members of the Buddhist clergy , whom he warned to control the militant young monks who appear to be leading the current street protests .
In the first public response by the junta to the mass protests , he said action would be taken against the monks ' protest marches " according to the law if they cannot be stopped by religious teachings " .
No further details were forthcoming , but there was no hint of reconciliation in the government 's message , BBC Asia correspondent Andrew Harding reports .
State television said the demonstrations of the past week were being fomented by communists and exiled media and student groups .

Five columns of monks , one reportedly stretching for more than 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) , entered the city centre to cheers and applause from thousands of bystanders .
Civilians who joined in included officials from the opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party , led by Aung San Suu Kyi .
The authorities are likely to be under huge pressure from their close neighbour China to avoid bloodshed and instability , our correspondent notes .
But if the demonstrations continue , he adds , the generals may see their authority ebb away and their options narrow .
The European Union has urged the junta to show the " utmost restraint " in dealing with the protests and to take the opportunity to " launch a process of real political reform " .
The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has given his backing to the monks ' call for freedom and democracy but urged the military not to react with violence to the protests .
UK Ambassador Mark Canning said Burma 's leaders were now in uncharted territory and he expressed concern about a possible government counter - reaction .
" That ... would be a disaster , although in terms of probability it , I 'm afraid , ranks quite high , " he told the BBC .
Detained leader
A hard - core group of more than 1,000 of the maroon - robed monks and 400 sympathisers went to Aung San Suu Kyi's street at the end of Monday 's march , the Associated Press reported .
They chanted a prayer for peace in the face of the riot police blocking access to her home , where she is under house arrest , before dispersing peacefully .
Monks have been urging Burmese people to hold 15 - minute evening prayer vigils .
The organisation that has emerged to lead the protests , the Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks , has vowed to continue marches until it has " wiped the military dictatorship from the land " .
The protests were triggered by the government 's decision to double the price of fuel last month , hitting people hard in the impoverished nation .

I 'm a University student from Mandalay .
I think Mandalay needs a leader as people are very afraid .
But they want to get freedom .
Now I saw 10,000 monks and a number of other people .
Juee , Mandalay
I witnessed the big protests in Rangoon today .
I am really sorry for our country and our people because we are under the control of the wicked junta .
We have n't got arms , we wish for peace , a better future and democracy .
We are hoping that the UN security council will put a pressure on the junta .
Kyi Kyi , Rangoon
I saw more than 100,000 monks march to 8 - mile junction , from south to north , I 'm not sure where they lead to .
This situation could be worse more if junta could n't control softly .
We want some changes in Burma , but we want these changes leading to good ways .
I can say surely that killing the monks is insulting the Buddhism religious .
Sun , Rangoon
I saw about 40,000 to 50,000 people , including monks , nuns and ordinary people , marching along Prome road .
That was at around 3:30 pm .
The protests will grow bigger day by day and I hope that they are not going to start killing people .
We need help to save our people .
Mr Tun , Rangoon
It is astounding to see such a great mass of people on both sides of the roads , some clapping and some crying , but all demonstrating their support for the monks and those chanting prayers .
It 's for sure that all these people showing their support are willing to be part of the mass protest .
They do not trust the government though and think that they could be crushed , just like it happened in 1988 .
But if we are just bystanders , today 's rare and momentous events might not lead to the fall of the regime .
Kyaw , Rangoon
I am not sure where these protests are going to lead to , but I am sure that it 's not at all a good sign .
Many people are expecting that there will be a great change coming soon .
I am not sure if the monks will be joined by students , workers , or even soldiers .
We are very insecure because we do n't know what the government is planning to do .
There are some news in the government - controlled newspapers that the monks are trying to agitate the public .
This can be a big excuse for them to start attacking the monks .
I really want some changes in Burma but I am not sure where the change is going to lead us to .
I hope there wo n't be any blood - bath this time like there was in 1988 .
Soe Soe , Mandalay
We need a little reason to combine all opposition resources into one mass movement .
This reason must be a political issue .
The current situation can lead to a civil war because hardline junta still holds the power and the opposition might use this opportunity to form an armed struggle .
After 1988 , many activists , including students , ran to the border and took up the arms against the government .
This time we want things to change peacefully , not through a civil war .
But if there 's no way to avoid the arms struggle , the people will choose it and the conditions in our poor country may become worse .
The international pressure , including from China and Russia , is very important for the future of Burma at this moment .
Mg Khar , Rangoon
One of the monks who took part in the protests came to us and told us about his experiences .
He said : " We are not afraid , we have n't committed a crime , we just say prayers and take part in the protests .
We have n't accepted money from onlookers although they offered us a lot .
We just accept water .
People clapped , smiled and cheered us . "
The monk seemed very happy , excited and proud .
But I 'm worried for them .
They care for us and we pray for them not to get harmed .
Mya , Rangoon
One reason why the generals are hesitating , may not be merely reverence .
Spiritually speaking , if one is a Buddhist , one will clearly know that one of Buddhist 's big sin is the physical harming of a monk who had taken the vow .
Such bodily harm of a monk will carry the worst penalty of sufferance in hell .
From the perspective of a devout Buddhist nation , that maybe the reason for the junta 's unwillingness to act , hoping the march will fizzle out on its own .

Inviting a showdown with congressional leaders over the firing of U.S. attorneys , a defiant President Bush on Tuesday refused to make White House political strategist Karl Rove available for public questioning under oath .
Bush agreed to let lawmakers interview Rove and former White House Counsel Harriet E. Miers in private , but the concessions failed to placate Democrats , who have accused the White House and Justice Department of dismissing eight federal prosecutors for political reasons .
The House and Senate Judiciary committees readied plans for today and Thursday to authorize subpoenas for Rove and other officials .
Bush said his staff would oppose the subpoenas , setting the stage for a possible constitutional confrontation in which past and current members of the White House staff could be held in contempt of Congress .

Bush , speaking to reporters in the early evening after returning from a trip to Missouri , criticized Democrats for trying to “ score political points . ”
He urged them to accept his offer of private interviews with Rove and Miers , and he pledged to release all White House documents related to the firings .
“ These extraordinary steps demonstrate a reasonable solution to the issue , ” Bush said .
“ However , we will not go along with a partisan fishing expedition aimed at honorable public servants .
“ It will be regrettable if they choose to head down the partisan road of issuing subpoenas and demanding show trials when I have agreed to make key officials and White House documents available . ”
Bush also firmed up his support for Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales amid rising calls for his resignation .
“ I ’ve got confidence in him , ” Bush said .

The president denied the firings were politically motivated .
He also denied they were meant to shut down corruption investigations of Republicans or to speed up probes into Democratic wrongdoing .
“ The Justice Department , with the approval of the White House , believed new leadership in these positions would better serve our country , ” Bush said , describing the moves as “ normal and appropriate . ”
He said the announcement of the decisions and the explanation of the changes had been “ confusing and in some cases incomplete . ”
But he promised to “ correct the record . ”
“ I ’m sorry that the situation has gotten to where it ’s got , ” he said .
“ But that ’s Washington , D.C. , for you .
You know , there ’s a lot of politics in this town . ”

The administration strategy appeared to set both sides on a collision course unlike any in recent years .
Openly defying a subpoena has little precedent .
Congress could vote to find in contempt those who refused to comply , but such a case normally would be prosecuted by the Justice Department , said Beth Nolan , a White House counsel in the Clinton administration .
Nolan said Congress could use other tactics if an official refused to cooperate .
They include withholding funding for an agency or refusing to approve administration nominees for executive positions that require Senate confirmation .
Although it would give Democrats a rare opportunity to question Rove , who has become a lightning rod for administration critics , Bush ’s proposal drew complaints .

“ We will move forward to authorize subpoenas for current and former White House and Justice officials , as well as documents , ” said Rep. John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
He said the panel would “ take whatever steps are necessary and within our congressional authority to get to the bottom of what has become a horrible mess that is undermining American trust in our federal criminal justice system . ”
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said , “ It is not constructive and it is not helpful to be telling the Senate how to do our investigation or to prejudge its outcome .
“ Testimony should be on the record and under oath .
That ’s the formula for true accountability . ”

Moderate Republicans indicated they wanted to give the White House proposal a chance in the hope of avoiding a fight .
“ I would prefer to have the interviews in public , but it is more important to get the information promptly than to have months or years of litigation , ” said Sen.
Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
“ If we are dissatisfied with the information provided in the manner offered by the president , we can always issue subpoenas . ”
The exchange came the same day that the Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation that would strip the Justice Department of the authority to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without congressional oversight , and a day after the department released 3,000 documents offering an unusual inside look into how the eight presidential appointees were pushed from office .
Also , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) said she wanted to know more about the departure of a ninth prosecutor , the former U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , Debra Wong Yang , who resigned in October , a few months after Yang ’s office had opened an investigation into ties between Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - Redlands ) and a lobbyist .

“ Was she asked to resign , and if so , why ? ” Feinstein said to reporters .
“ We have to ferret that out . ”
Yang , a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher , said she left of her own accord .
The law firm issued a statement Tuesday night saying the decision to leave the post was “ entirely her own . ”
The Justice Department has also said Yang was not asked to leave .
The roles of Rove and Miers in the removal of U.S. attorneys have drawn attention as the White House and Justice Department offered shifting explanations of how and why the prosecutors were replaced .
Last week , the White House said the idea originated with a proposal by Miers two years ago to replace all 93 U.S. attorneys as part of a post-election housecleaning .
Officials said Rove vaguely recalled knowing about the proposal and thinking it was a bad idea .
Advertisement
E-mails made public last week indicated that Rove also had raised the issue of replacing some or all of the prosecutors .
The White House backtracked on whether the idea originated with Miers and said it could not be sure who proposed it .
Besides Rove and Miers , who resigned in January , the White House offered to arrange interviews with Deputy Counsel William Kelley and J. Scott Jennings , a deputy White House political director .
White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding said in a letter to congressional leaders Tuesday that the proposal struck a balance between providing the information that Congress needed and preserving confidences of the president under the doctrine of executive privilege .
He said the White House was prepared to offer Capitol Hill investigators communications between the White House and the Justice Department , and communications between White House staff members and third parties , including members of Congress or their staffs .
Advertisement
Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) said the offer of documents excluded some of the most relevant information , including communications among White House staff members .
“ This is giving us the opportunity to talk to them but not giving us the opportunity to get to the bottom of what really happened here , ” Schumer said .
“ It is a clever proposal .
“ We obviously will present a counteroffer to them that will be far more complete and far more extensive .
We will move forward with the subpoenas on Thursday .
Mr. Fielding indicated that he did not want to negotiate , but that does not mean we are not going to try . ”

Back story
Last year , the Justice Department informed eight U.S. attorneys that they were being fired .
Bush administration officials have said the federal prosecutors -- all appointed by the president -- were dismissed primarily because of concerns over job performance , including not being aggressive enough in pursuing border crime .
But the prosecutors , some of whom testified before Congress , have disputed those characterizations .
Democratic lawmakers have charged that the firings were orchestrated to shut down GOP corruption investigations or to jump - start probes into alleged Democratic wrongdoing .

The result has been a political embarrassment for the administration , and has led to calls for the resignation of Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , one of Bush ’s closest advisors .

Facebook CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP )  President Hugo Chavez announced Monday he would formally pull Venezuela out of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , a largely symbolic move because the nation has already paid off its debts to the lending institutions .
" We will no longer have to go to Washington nor to the IMF nor to the World Bank , not to anyone , " said the leftist leader , who has long railed against the Washington - based lending institutions .
Chavez said he wanted to formalize Venezuela 's exit from the two bodies " tonight and ask them to return what they owe us . "
Venezuela recently repaid its debts to the World Bank five years ahead of schedule , saving $ 8 million .
It paid off all its debts to the IMF shortly after Chavez first took office in 1999 .
The IMF closed its offices in Venezuela late last year .
Chavez made the announcement a day after telling a meeting of allied leaders that Latin America overall would be better off without the U.S. - backed World Bank or IMF .
He has often blamed their lending policies for perpetuating poverty .
The leftist president also has repeatedly criticized past Venezuelan governments for signing structural adjustment agreements with the IMF that were blamed for contributing to racing inflation .
Under former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez in 1989 , violent protests broke out in Caracas in response to IMF austerity measures that brought a hike in subsidized gasoline prices and public transport fares .
Enraged people took over the streets in violence that killed at least 300 people — and possibly many more .
The riots came to be known as the " Caracazo , " and Chavez often refers to it as a rebellion against the status quo .

( CNN ) --
An Ohio police officer has been put on paid administrative leave after his own police cruiser 's dash camera captured him using a stun gun to subdue a handcuffed woman , an attorney for the city of Warren , Ohio , told CNN on Thursday .
Warren City , Ohio , police officer Rich Kovach said he used his stun gun seven times on Heidi Gill .
Warren City police are investigating a September 2 incident in which the officer repeatedly used a Taser to control the woman , who police allege was wildly out of control after being forced from a bar .
According to Officer Rich Kovach 's own police report , he shocked Heidi Gill , 38 , seven times -- twice after she had been handcuffed .
In the report , filed September 4 , Kovach describes responding to a " fight / disturbance inside the bar " and finding a belligerent Gill , who began cursing , refused to give her real name , then tried to flee .
The video shows Gill stumbling , with her arms flailing , and screaming while Kovach uses the stun gun on her .
Watch the police video »
After Gill was handcuffed and placed in a police cruiser , " she started kicking the rear driver side window and broke it , " the report said .
The woman then tried to climb into the front seat , at which point Kovach used the Taser device on her for a sixth time , he wrote .
" I deployed a second Taser cartridge into her , and the violent turbulent action stopped immediately " he wrote .
Kovach used the Taser for the seventh and final time while trying to transport Gill from one police cruiser to another .
In the video , the officer can be heard saying , " You 're going to walk to that car or you 're going to be Tasered again . "
Gill fell down , knocked her head on the pavement and lay there unconscious , Kovach wrote in his report .
An ambulance then took her to a hospital .
Gill could not be reached for comment Friday .
Her attorney issued a statement saying , " Please respect my client 's privacy and restrain from contacting her .
You will be contacted once this office has had an opportunity to investigate all issues . "
The attorney would not comment on Gill 's physical condition , her response to the incident or her whereabouts Friday .
After Gill 's arrest , she was charged with felony assault , falsification , resisting arrest , criminal damaging and vehicle trespass .
She pleaded not guilty to all charges and posted a $ 5,000 bond , a deputy clerk at Warren Municipal Court told CNN .
She is expected to appear in court October 25 .
According to the Warren City Law Department , the police department adheres to a " use of force policy " concerning Taser devices , and officers are trained on how and when to use them .
The incident comes as University of Florida officials are trying to sort out what caused two campus police officers to use an electronic stun gun to subdue a student Monday .

All About Law Enforcement
Here in the Binghamton area , three schools named in the original complaint — two in Elmira , N.Y. , and one in Horseheads — are rebelling against the ruling , in the latest in a series of arguments over fulfilling the requirements of Title IX , which has been a source of contention among educators , athletes and feminists alike since its adoption in 1972 .
James Young , a lawyer for the Horseheads Central School District , said cheerleaders there compete in their own tournaments and are not seen as support players .
He noted that the “ Rowdy Raiders ” pep group is already dispatched to cheer for boys ’ and girls ’ teams alike .
“ We regard our cheerleaders as athletes , while they are working on a 1970s stereotype that cheerleaders are here to support the boys , ” Mr. Young said of the education department ’s ruling .
“ We have a really solid women ’s athletics program and we support it our way . ”
Richard T. Stank , president of the Southern Tier Athletic Conference , which represents the 17 schools in the Binghamton area named in the complaint , said even some of the school officials and coaches complying with the ruling question its validity .
“ I do n’t see how cheerleaders having to be at boys ’ and girls ’ games is what Title IX was set up to do , ” he said .
Under Title IX , all schools and colleges that receive federal money are prohibited from gender discrimination in any area , from academics to athletics .
The education department has interpreted that mandate to mean , among other things , that girls ’ and boys ’ teams must receive equal treatment , from the salaries of their coaches to the condition of their locker rooms .
Intended to expand opportunities for female athletes , Title IX essentially requires schools and colleges to spend equivalent amounts on men’s and women ’s sports programs .
But some Title IX supporters complain that some schools have twisted the letter of the law to skirt its spirit , cutting lower - profile men ’s sports like wrestling or swimming to offset the costs of football rather than adding women ’s teams .
But others complain that the law has expanded women ’s teams of limited interest at the expense of more popular boys ’ teams .
Cheerleading has long been a source of contention .
Some women ’s sports advocates complain that schools count it as a varsity sport as a sneaky way to increase the numbers of the female side of the athletic department balance sheet without changing historic disparities .
Others see the varsity letters as a mark of respect for the athletic and acrobatic feats the squads perform .
“ THE medium - term outlook for the company is very positive , ” declared Northern Rock 's chief executive , Adam Applegarth , unveiling its first - half results in July .
He spoke of a credit book that was “ robust ” .
Who would have guessed that less than two months later Britain 's fifth - largest mortgage lender would be fighting for its life , its branches besieged by customers demanding their savings back ?
The run on Northern Rock is the most dramatic symptom of the contagion gripping the financial markets .
Here was a bank that had grown rich from the innovations of recent years , using abundantly stocked wholesale markets to fund its lively growth , using those same markets to offload bits of its loan book as and when they became unattractive .
But the very innovations on which Northern Rock thrived have savaged its business .
The company does no lending to speak of overseas .
Nevertheless , its fate was determined by the distant turmoil in America 's mortgage market .
When that spilled over into the securities markets , the money markets that Northern Rock had depended on for years dried up in a single day at the start of August .
The brave new world that enabled banks like Northern Rock to grow so fast is founded on “ securitisation ” — the process that transforms mortgages , credit - card receivables and other financial assets into marketable securities — and the innovation it spawned in “ structured ” products .
This was a revolution that brought huge gains .
But across the financial world investors and regulators are asking themselves whether it also brought costs that are only now becoming clear .
Investigations begin
In America the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets , which includes the Federal Reserve and the Treasury , has launched a probe into securitisation and the rating agencies , which monitor it .
IOSCO , a global regulators ' body , has begun an investigation of its own .
And the two biggest securitisation clubs on either side of the Atlantic held an emergency summit this week to look for ways to coax investors back into moribund asset - backed markets .
It is hard to overstate the extent of this reversal in fortunes , if only because it is hard to overstate the effect that securitisation has had on financial markets .
Until the early 1980s , finance hewed to an “ originate and hold ” model .
Banks generally held loans on their balance sheets to maturity ; some debts were sold on loan - by - loan , but this market was small and lumpy .
This began to give way to an “ originate and distribute ” model after America 's government - sponsored mortgage giants issued the first bonds with payments tied to the cash flows from large pools of loans .
Wall Street built on this innovation , and securitisation took off soon after , then paused before exploding in the 1990s ( see chart 1 ) .
It was given a lift by America 's savings - and - loan crisis , which encouraged mortgage lenders to jettison their riskier loans , and by new technologies , such as credit - scoring , that facilitated loan - pooling .
Around 56 % of America 's outstanding residential mortgages were packaged in this way , including more than two - thirds of the subprime loans issued in 2006 .
Thanks largely to securitisation , global private - debt securities are now far bigger than stockmarkets .
Banks have come to see securitisation as an indispensable tool ( see chart 2 ) .
Global lenders use it to manage their balance sheets , since selling loans frees up capital for new business or for return to shareholders .
Small regional banks benefit too .
Gone are the days when they had no choice but to place concentrated bets on local housing markets or industry .
Now they can offload credits to far - away investors such as insurers and hedge funds , which have an appetite for them .
Michael Milken , of junk - bond fame , called securitisation the “ democratisation of capital ” .
Studies suggest that the explosion of this “ secondary ” market for bank debt has helped to push down borrowing costs for consumers and companies alike .
There are other “ systemic ” gains , too .
Subjecting bank loans to valuation by capital markets encourages the efficient use of capital .
And the broad distribution of credit risk reduces the risk of any one holder going bust .
Even in the midst of turmoil , it is hard to find a banker , regulator or academic who wants to see the clock turned back .
But the crisis has exposed cracks in the new model that were hidden or ignored during the credit bubble .
The three most glaring are complexity and confusion , a fragmentation of responsibility and the gaming of the regulatory system .
Take each in turn .
Too clever by 50 basis points
The past few weeks have shown that financiers did not fully understand what they were trading .
The boom in derivatives was one of those moments when financial engineering raced ahead of back offices and risk - management departments , leaving them struggling to value or account for their holdings .
Pierre Pourquery , of Boston Consulting Group , says it is not uncommon for investors to break their exotic purchases into smaller pieces in order to feed them into their risk - management systems .
This brings new risks , particularly that the parts will behave differently from the whole under stress .
Steven Schwarcz , a professor at Duke University and writer on securitisation , has come across contracts which are so convoluted that it would be impractical for investors to try to understand them : they would have to spend more money hiring experts to deconstruct them than they could ever hope to earn in extra returns .
In a recent paper * on credit derivatives , David Skeel and Frank Partnoy concluded that collateralised debt obligations ( CDOs ) , one of the most common derivatives , are too clever by half .
The transaction costs are high , the benefits questionable .
They conclude that CDOs are being used to transform existing debt instruments that are accurately priced into new ones that are overvalued .
Complexity confuses investors about the risks they are taking on .
The more eclectic CDOs bind together the fate of assets that have few real economic links .
Imagine a lowly rated energy bond and top - notch bank paper in the same structure .
Separately , they would not normally move in tandem .
Put them in a CDO , however , and in a credit squeeze they fall together , by virtue of being in the same murky structure , as investors rush for the exit or seek to hedge their risks .
The lack of transparency plagues the bundling of loans into securities , too .
These days , for instance , lenders are less likely to foreclose on defaulting borrowers : in America , less than a quarter of loans 90 days late or more are in foreclosure , compared with three - quarters in the late 1990s , points out Charles Calomiris , of Columbia University .
When a late payer gets back on track his loan is once again labelled “ current ” , and his chequered history does not have to be fully disclosed when the loan goes into a securitised pool .
So even the most diligent buyer would struggle to spot that some of the “ prime ” collateral of mortgage - backed bonds was , in fact , of questionable quality .
Investors seeking redress have encountered unforeseen problems .
Securitisations are generally structured as “ true sales ” : the seller wipes its hands of the risk .
In practice buyers have some protection .
Many contracts allow them to hand back loan pools that sour surprisingly quickly .
Some have done just this with the most rancid subprime mortgages , requesting an injection of better - quality loans into the pool .
But there were so many bad loans that originators could not oblige .
“ What we thought was an effective secondary - market punishment mechanism turns out to be faulty when the problem grows beyond a certain size , ” says Anthony Sanders , a subprime expert .
The second lesson of the past few weeks is that securitisation has warped financiers ' incentives .
It is sometimes portrayed as bank “ disintermediation ” , but in fact it replaces one middleman with several .
In mortgage securitisation , for instance , the lender is supplanted by the broker , the loan originator , the servicer ( who collects payments ) , the investor and the arranger , not to mention the rating agencies and mortgage - bond insurers .
This creates what economists call a principal - agent problem .
The loan originator has little incentive to vet borrowers carefully because it knows the risk will soon be off its books .
The ultimate holder of the risk , the investor , has more reason to care but owns a complex product and is too far down the chain for monitoring to work .
For all its flaws , the old bank model resolved the incentives in a simple way .
Because loans were kept in - house , banks had every reason both to underwrite cautiously and also to keep tabs on the borrower after the money left the vault .
Investors in loan - backed securities could have pushed for tougher monitoring .
But most were too taken with the alluring yields on offer — an addiction Alan Greenspan , the Fed 's former chairman , has likened to cocaine abuse .
Debt investors are usually sober types , but as the bubble grew , it was increasingly their urges , and not the creditworthiness of homeowners , that determined loan - underwriting standards .
Wall Street took full advantage of this appetite .
It was well known that investors such as Germany 's IKB , a lender to small companies which was bailed out last month , had a weakness for exotic products .
The securities firms peddling mortgage - backed bonds did little to disabuse them of the notion that a CDO with a high rating must be as safe as houses — after all , the buyers were sophisticated institutions , not widows or orphans .
Moreover Wall Street has every reason to shovel securitised debt out as fast as it can .
The loan - origination platform has high fixed costs , so it is a scale business .
This can lead to trouble when there are not enough creditworthy new borrowers , as in subprime lending .
Banks may be tempted to keep feeding the machine at the expense of laxer lending standards .
“ Once you get into it , it 's a bit like heroin , ” says Joseph Mason , an academic who has written on securitisation .
When AAA paper is repeatedly compared to Class A drugs , you know something is wrong .
Rating the raters
Complexity and warped incentives foster the third cost of securitisation : gaming the regulations .
Politicians are scrutinising the role of rating agencies , as they did with auditors after the dotcom bubble burst .
Regulatory dependence on ratings has grown across the board .
Banks can reduce the amount of capital they have to set aside if they hold highly rated paper , for instance , and some investors , such as money - market funds , must stick to AAA - rated securities .
But not all top -rated paper is the same .
The agencies appear to have been too free in giving out prized AAA badges to structured products , especially CDOs .
This was partly because their models were faulty , failing to pick up correlations between different markets , and partly because of a conflict of interest : theirs is one of few businesses where the appraiser is paid by the seller , not the buyer .
This made it easier for the banks securitising and further repackaging debt to create the greatest possible number of securities with the lowest regulatory cost ( that is , highest rating ) .
Investors restricted to investment - grade paper assumed ( or at least hoped ) that the rating was a guarantee of strength .
It might have helped if the agencies had properly monitored their ratings after issuing them .
But with low fees per security there is little incentive to stay on the case .

From dodgy American mortgages to the British high street
Avinash Persaud , of Intelligence Capital , a consultancy , argues that securitisation has let banks ( as regulated “ holders ” of credit risk , with the capacity to keep it through bad times ) pass it on to unregulated “ traders ” of risk with smaller balance sheets , such as hedge funds , which sell when trouble strikes .
As a result , he says , although the risk of bank runs has fallen , the risk of market runs has increased .
In fact , some hedge funds are patient investors in illiquid assets .
But Mr Persaud is right that risk changes , chameleon - like , depending on the holder .
A bank with a plump capital cushion can use its balance sheet to hold on to out - of - favour credits until markets regain their balance .
An investment fund that is several steps removed from the borrower , vulnerable to margin calls and constrained by daily risk models will have less room for manoeuvre .
The rise of such investors has led , paradoxically , to more of a herd mentality because of “ convergence in the way risk has been diversified ” , says Mr Schwarcz .
Fans of securitisation argue that it has made the system safer , because risk ends up with those who want to shoulder it .
It is true that few banks have failed in recent years , in spite of the Asian crisis , the failure of Long - Term Capital Management , the dotcom bust and so forth .
But this could have more to do with economic stability than securitisation .
Indeed , André Cappon , a consultant , warns of the “ circularity of risk ” .
The hedge funds that buy mortgage - linked debt also borrow heavily from the prime - brokerage arms of banks that originated many of the underlying loans .
So a bank can push risk out of the front door , only to find it sneaking through the back .
Shine a light
What should banks and regulators do about all this ?
In the short run , the focus will be on transparency .
Investors need to know who is holding what and how should it be valued .
One idea is to force investment banks to reveal more about the performance and price of privately traded asset - backed instruments .
Another is for the Securities and Exchange Commission , Wall Street 's main regulator , to ensure consistent valuation of such assets across firms .
More information on the vehicles that issue asset - backed commercial paper would also help .
There will also be calls for greater standardisation of structured products .
This could undermine the “ over the counter ” ( off - exchange ) markets .
Exchange groups like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Deutsche Börse have been trying to take business away from the banks , offering centrally cleared foreign - exchange trading and credit products .
Regulators like these because they are more transparent than privately traded deals .
The crisis could tip the balance in the exchanges ' favour , says Benn Steil , a market - watcher at the Council on Foreign Relations .
If investors continue to shun the most complex products , Wall Street will have to offer simpler fare .
Tom Zimmerman , head of asset - backed research at UBS , sees parallels between the CDO bust and the blow - up in collateralised mortgage obligations ( CMOs ) in the mid-1990s .
CMOs , which pool prepayment risk , became so convoluted that investors could no longer see where the dangers lay .
When they stopped buying , investment banks made the product more straightforward and it took off again .
As for the rating agencies , they have probably grown more powerful than anyone intended .
Regulators will want to see their interests aligned more closely with investors , and to ensure that they are quicker and more thorough in reviewing past ratings .
Moody 's is thinking about adding new letter codes to cover liquidity and volatility risk for complex products .
Fixing the problem of fragmented responsibility will be a balancing act .
Mr Sanders thinks subprime default rates would not have spiked if loan originators had been forced to set aside capital to cover , say , 10 % of each securitised pool .
But framing the terms of this sort of co-insurance would be tricky .
Would 10 % be enough ?
Or too much ?
Should a reputable bank have to pay as much as a small specialist - lender ?
With investors , too , there is a risk of heavy - handedness .
Calls for federal legislation on “ assignee liability ” , which would hold secondary - market investors liable for loan losses , could do more harm than good .
The soul - searching has led some analysts to speculate that mortgage lending could , for a time , go back to being a bank - led lend - and - hold market .
But do not expect a rush back to the ways of the 1960s .
Securitisation has become far too important for that .
Indeed , it has not yet fulfilled its promise .
Wall Street eggheads may be licking their wounds at present , but they will soon be coming up with even more products .
And , given time , there will no doubt be another wave of buying .
More importantly , the transformation of sticky debt into something more tradable , for all its imperfections , has forged hugely beneficial links between individual borrowers and vast capital markets that were previously out of reach .
As it comes under scrutiny , the debate should be about how this system can be improved , not dismantled .
* “ The Promise and Perils of Credit Derivatives ” , by David Skeel and Frank Partnoy , University of Cincinnati Law Review , 2006
Which might explain why a third candidate suddenly became such a serious contender .
Until eight weeks ago , François Bayrou , a centrist former minister of education , was a marginal figure , down there in the polls with the Marxists and the “ save the organic truffle ” brigade .
Since then , he has leapt to join the leaders .
He has stalled in third place , but one poll this week predicted that if Mr. Bayrou and Mr. Sarkozy face off in the clinching second round of the election , in May , Mr. Bayrou would win .
The question is , pourquoi ?
Well , Mr. Bayrou is the anti-excitement candidate , a sort of political Prozac after all the amphetamines of the Sarkozy - Royal conflict .
He is fairly young at 55 , and he has a relatively full head of hair , but so far he has left the paparazzi in a soporific daze .
He wants to unite everyone — he ’s a member of a centrist party but might well appoint a Socialist prime minister ; he is a Catholic but a staunch defender of secularism in schools .
The message is that if he can unite God and the atheists , surely he can unite France .
Most of all , he is something that even urban voters see as quintessentially French — a farmer .
His official
Web site shows him pitchforking hay on the family farm , and he was recently quoted in the weekly Le Point as saying : “ My friends and I are n’t the jet set .
We ’re the tractor set . ”
One should not underestimate the strength of this rustic image in the national psyche .
If you gave an average Frenchman the choice between a reforming president who would plug the country ’s huge deficit and a good cheese , he would probably opt for the cheese .
This is why in France , candidates not only kiss babies , they kiss cows .
Politicians flocked into the recent Agriculture Fair in Paris to be photographed embracing livestock .
And no one looked more convincing in the clinch with a four - legged , hairy friend than Mr. Bayrou .
His rise in the polls seems to prove that , despite what they say , the French are upset by upheaval , revolted by revolt .
They want things to stay the way they have always been .
Even Louis XVI was able to provoke his subjects into guillotining him only because he tried to flee the country , thus making himself look a traitor .
If he had stayed in Paris and hugged a few prize bulls , France would probably still be a monarchy .
Starting November 20 , 2007 , all foreign nationals landing in Japan will be required to submit to fingerprinting and having their picture taken .
Yōkoso !
Smile !
You ’re a terrorist suspect !
This controversial new procedure snuck its way into existence on May 24 , 2006 when the Japanese Diet passed a law requiring all foreign nationals ( with a few exceptions , such as children under 16 , diplomats , and special - status permanent residents such as Zainichi Koreans ) to submit biometric data to prove they ’re not Osama bin Laden or one of his cronies .
I ’ll spare you the details ; if you have five minutes to waste , please check out the cheesy video put out by our friends at the Immigration Bureau .
Basically , the tatemae justification for this new law is that immigration officials will be able to capture any potential terrorists at the airport before they have a chance to commit their heinous crimes on Japanese soil .
Sounds fair enough .
After all , nobody likes terrorism ; what ’s the big deal about putting your fingers on a scanner and sucking it up for the camera if it could potentially save lives ?
Therein lies the rub .
Anyone who has followed the news for the past few decades is aware that the threat of domestic terrorism is much greater than that of foreign terrorism in Japan .
Historically , the only terrorism Japan has faced has been from Japanese fringe groups like the Red Army and Aum Shinrikyo .
Lest you should think that home - grown terrorism in Japan is ancient history , just this Tuesday news broke of a Japanese man who had explosive substances and was allegedly planning to blow up parts of the Tokyo subway system , having been inspired by the 2005 London attacks .
Who presents a greater danger to the citizens of Japan , faraway fundamentalists , or Japanese nationals , disenfranchised with the current system and looking for somewhere to vent their anger ?
The logical thing to do would be to fingerprint everyone in Japan who has fingers .
Well , it ’s not that simple .
Japanese may not legally be fingerprinted in Japan unless they are officially charged with a crime .
All the easier to get away with chikan !
Foreigners , however , in spite of being officially welcome under the Visit Japan “ Yokoso ! ” Campaign , are not offered the same protection under Japanese law .
The actual fingerprinting machine to be used in Japan
The actual fingerprinting machine to be used in Japan
My knee jerk reaction upon hearing this news was to assume that Japan was , once again , copying American foreign policy .
Upon further inspection , however , it seems that Japan has taken the whole fingerprinting business a step further .
Permanent residents of the United States are not required to submit biometric data when they return home – only tourists are .
Japan , however , a country that probably ranks pretty low on Al Qaeda ’s destruction priority scale , has taken a stronger stance than the U.S. , requiring that all foreign permanent residents submit their foreign fingerprints as well .
This means that us gaijin with permanent residence status , will be treated differently from our Japanese spouses and children when passing through customs .
What an awkward situation , especially when with the little ones …
“ See you soon son , daddy has to go and line up over there to be fingerprinted with the lovely gaijin “ dancers ” ..again ” .
Personally , I would be for any measure that could prevent terrorism , even if it was a little bit flawed .
The problem is that the fingerprinting methods used in the U.S. , the same ones that are about to be introduced into Japan , would not have stopped any of the 9/11 hijackers from entering into the U.S.
Is it possible that this new system is an uyoku ( right wing ) attempt to crack down on foreign crime ( just kidding , George ) and visa overstays ?
The Immigration Bureau ’s FAQ is rather unclear on how the biometric data will be used , except for that it follows the government guidelines on protection of personal information , in which , if you read close enough , you will notice get thrown out the window in criminal cases ( Chapter 5 , Article 45 ) .
None of this is an accident .
The Democratic Party of Japan submitted an alternative version of the bill requiring that biometric data be deleted once an overseas national leaves Japan or is granted permanent residency , but this draft was voted down .
Indignant gaijin are not the only ones upset about this law .
The Japanese Federation of Bar Associations has published a statement declaring this law to be a bad idea and a half .
Amnesty International in Japan has put out a similar appeal against the new law .
It turns out that many Japanese government officials disagree with or have n’t even heard of the law !
We ’ll see how it all pans out soon enough .
Old Style Japan Alien Registration Card with Fingerprint Old Style Japan Alien Registration Card with Fingerprint
As a side note , fingerprinting is not a new concept for those long term gaijin amongst us .
All foreigners staying more than three months in Japan are required to get an infamous “ Gaijin Card ” ( Alien registration card ) .
Up until the late 1990 ’s , the fingerprint of your left index finger appeared on this card .
And even though in actual fact , all ten fingers were squeezed against the ink - pad as part of registering one self as an alien , we still loved to joke that we could be safe committing a crime , as long as we only used nine fingers ..
Anyway , it looks like mandatory fingerprinting is back , and this time not only for long - stay gaijin , but for every alien coming into the land of the taihen cloud .
Will our re-entry permits still permit us to line up at the Nihonjin passport booth ?
I ca n’t help but think this is going to land us back into the long snaking gaijin lines , where we will have a frustrating wait for the jumbo full of Chinese tourists ( that landed 5 minutes beforehand ) to be fingerprinted .
Only time will tell .
In the meantime , if any Stippy readers are planning a trip home this Christmas , just be prepared for a special O - kaeri from immigration officers .
Remember to smile , and if you ’re feeling particularly cheeky , why not throw up a peace sign ?
After a 10 hour flight , you deserve it .
So what do you think ?
Is this a heartfelt attempt from the government of Japan to protect us all from terrorism , or are they just using the current state of world affairs as an excuse to crack down on gaijin crime and illegal immigration ?

The XO Laptop will bring children technology as a means to freedom and empowerment .
The success of the project in the face of overwhelming global diversity will only be possible by embracing openness and by providing the laptop 's users and developers a profound level of freedom .
As the children grow and pursue new ideas , the software and the tools need to be able to grow with them and provide a gateway to other technology .
Benefits
Learning is our main goal .
We do not focus on computer literacy , as that is a by - product of the fluency children will gain through use of the laptop for learning .
Children — especially young children — need the opportunity to learn far more than Word , Excel , and Powerpoint .
Of course , picking up these skills , having grown up with a laptop , will be readily accomplished .
Epistemologists from John Dewey to Paulo Freire to Seymour Papert agree that you learn through doing .
This suggests that if you want more learning , you want more doing .
Thus OLPC puts an emphasis on software tools for exploring and expressing , rather than instruction .
Love is a better master than duty .
Using the laptop as the agency for engaging children in constructing knowledge based upon their personal interests and providing them tools for sharing and critiquing these constructions will lead them to become learners and teachers .
As a matter of practicality and given the necessity to enhance performance and reliability while containing costs , XO is not burdened by the bloat of excess code , the “ featureitis ” that is responsible for much of the clumsiness , unreliability , and expense of many modern laptops .

Yesterday , we wrote about the letter House Government Reform and Oversight committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) sent ( pdf ) to State Department Inspector General Howard J. Krongard , detailing numerous alleged improprieties committed by him .
Among these is the assertion that :
You impeded efforts by your investigators to cooperate with a Justice Department probe into allegations that a large private security contractor was smuggling weapons into lraq .
( page 2 of this pdf )
This morning , the AP 's Richard Lardner moved the ball forward a bit by identifying that company -- Blackwater :
Although the security company was not named in the letter , several senior administration officials confirmed it was Blackwater .
Blackwater is a very politically - connected company , as several have detailed .
More specifically though , the State Dep. IG Howard Krongard 's brother is A.B. " Buzzy " Krongard , who formerly was the executive director at the CIA ( its number three position - - he was replaced with the infamous Dusty Foggo ) .
In an article on the revolving door between Blackwater and the revolving door , Harper 's Ken Silverstein noted :
Robert Young Pelton , author of the new book , Licensed to Kill , says that an early Blackwater contract — a secret no - bid $ 5.4 million deal with the CIA — came in 2002 after Prince placed a call to Buzzy Krongard , who was then the CIA 's executive director .
Buzzy Krongard worked alongside Cofer Black , now Blackwater 's vice chairman , who was director of the CIA 's Counterterrorist Center until 2002 .
After his tenure at the CIA , Cofer Black worked at the State Department as its Ambassador - at - Large — a roving ambassador — for counterterrorism , before going to work at Blackwater in February 2005 .
In addition to that , the parent company of Blackwater , the Prince Group , hired former Defense Department Inspector General Joseph E. Schmitz as its chief operating officer and general counsel in 2005 as he was coming under suspicion for also engaging in inappropriate acts that compromised the integrity and independence of the Pentagon Office of Inspector General .
Schmitz was investigated by the President 's Council on Integrity and Efficiency 's Integrity Committee and exonerated , though questions remain about the PCIE investigation , one source tells POGO ( more on this hopefully to come ) .
So , Blackwater 's Joseph Schmitz , who knows the ins and outs of IG investigations , works with Blackwater 's Cofer Black , who worked with the brother ( Buzzy Krongard ) -- who may have helped Blackwater out early on himself - - of the Inspector General ( Howard Krongard ) responsible for investigating Blackwater .
It 's a small world indeed .
Stay tuned .
UPDATE : TPM Muckraker Spencer Ackerman flags us and adds more to the story on Blackwater 's influence .

Politics - Federal Security Summit the Latest Step Toward Corporate Continentalism By Ryan McGreal
Published August 23 , 2007
Yesterday , RTH reported an alleged incident of police officers attempting to infiltrate the protesters at the North American security summit in Montebello , Quebec to incite violence and give the police reason to arrest them .
It 's not the job of the police to take sides in political confrontations .
It 's their job to enforce the law , period .
When the protesters are non-violent , as they clearly were in the video , the police have absolutely no business trying to transform a peaceful demonstration into a riot .
In fact , it runs directly counter to their proper role .
However , the purpose of the agents provocateurs is to undermine the purpose of the demonstration by associating it with violence and radicalism in the minds of observers and the public .
Such behaviour by the police is profoundly anti-democratic .
Of course , that 's in keeping with the anti-democratic spirit of the summit itself .
Corporate Colonialism
A long colonialist thread runs through Canada 's collective history and will .
Canada started as a British colony and over the 20th century turned into a de facto American colony .
This was due in part to Canada 's system of branch plant industrialization , in which American companies were allowed to sell their products in Canada in exchange for opening subsidiary manufacturing plants here .
As a result , most of Canada 's biggest corporations are arms of American corporations , and their executives want what 's good for the head office .
The Canadian business and political elites who operate in this milieu seek to ingratiate themselves more closely with their colonial masters on the Potomac .
However , most Canadians , like the citizens of most countries , viscerally reject this abasement and politically resist eroding what makes Canadians distinct .
In this case , due to our relative geographic isolation and the overweening influence of our much larger neighour , being Canadain is usually defined as opposed to being American .
The reality is that Canadian and American culture are very similar .
They spring from the same cultures of origin , have experienced similar histories on the same continent , struggle with many of the same problems , govern themselves according similar political systems , and consume the same popular media productions ( mostly produced in the US with an American perspective ) .
Canadian distinction seems to have boiled down to supporting universal health care and slightly more generous social programs , having a high quality state - owned but independently operated media network ( the venerable CBC ) , and maybe driving a higher proportion of hatchbacks .
Of course , our business elites want to roll these distinctions back as well .
Rhetorical Nationalism , Practical Continentalism
In their attempts to manage the competing streams of popular nationalism and elite colonialism , Canadian politicians try to distance themselves rhetorically from the US even as they simultaneously work to engineer closer continental integration in the background .
Attempts to wipe out national sovereignty through business - friendly multilateral frameworks is nothing new .
It 's the impetus behind the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade ( GATT ) and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , and it was the impetus behind the failed Multilateral Agreement on Investment ( MAI ) , which tried to move all social services under corporate control across the 28 OECD members .
In North America , that impetus took the shape of the Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) and the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , passed against majority opposition in Canada , which abrogated much Canadian sovereignty in exchange for ostensible access to American markets .
In reality , it was an investment agreement rather than a trade agreement , eliminating controls and performance requirements for cross - border investments .
It also tagged on an agreement prohibiting Canada from reducing its energy exports to the US for any reason ( so much for the " free trade " part ) .
In the next few years , as natural gas production goes into sharp decline , this will become a political flash point .
The problem in Canada , as in the US , is that both major parties support this agenda of continental harmonization under the US umbrella .
The continental security summit is part of a formal process started by former Prime Minister Paul Martin , a corporatist Liberal who owns an international shipping company ( flying under flags of convenience to avoid Canadian labour law ) and with close ties to the financial sector .
A Continental Framework
While the Liberals were making anti-American noises to attract the left - leaning and independent elements of the traditional Liberal base - like announcing Canada would n't join the " Coalition of the Willing " or rejecting ' partnership ' in the US Ballistic Missile Defense program - they were also laying the foundations for an continental framework that subsumes Canadian interests from trade and investment to labour and environmental policy , immigration , law and security , and continental defence .
The biggest difference between Martin , whose party lost re-election in 2006 over an influence peddling scandal , and Stephen Harper , the current Prime Minister , is that the former supported colonial integration tacitly whereas the latter supports it openly .
The Conservative Party 's platform closely mirrors that of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives ( CCCE ) , which lobbied relentlessly to support the FTA and NAFTA when it was still called the Business Council on National Issues .
The CCCE plan for " 21st Century Institutions " would cede Canada 's authority to supranational entities – " A North American court on trade and investment " , " Extension of the NORAD model of binational operational management to the defence of critical infrastructure " , " A formal mechanism to enable the sharing of information and intelligence at the provincial , state and local levels " , and , of course , " Formal exchanges among senior levels of the business community in all three countries . "
The Incremental Approach
Since winning a minority government , Harper has had to tone down his pro-American sentiments the same as he has had to tone down his opposition to universal health care ( before joining the Conservatives , he spent nearly a decade as the president of a corporate lobby group dedicated to ending universal health care ) .
Nevertheless , he is still moving incrementally toward his larger goals .
Realistically , this summit is more about pomp and ceremony than substance , but it represents a commitment among the leaders in Canada , the US and Mexico to continue moving toward a continental integration that puts the finishing touches on the continental economic model that has emerged over the past two decades .
The continental economy is characterized by cheap Canada energy and resources , cheap Mexican labour , and an overarching trend toward protecting and nurturing US corporate interests at the expense of civil liberties , democracy , social welfare and the environment .

Noriega is wanted in Panama for the murder of a political opponent
A federal judge rejected arguments by Noriega 's lawyers that his status as a US prisoner of war negated the request .
Noriega , 72 , is due in September to end a 1992 prison term for drug - trafficking and racketeering in Miami .
His lawyer Frank Rubino said Noriega was " very disappointed , very displeased " about the verdict .
Mr Rubino said : " He was hoping that the judge would have done the right thing and sent him back to Panama , his home country , and he 's completely disappointed . "
Noriega was made a US prisoner - of - war after his arrest during the US invasion of Panama more than 17 years ago .
He is due to appear before US magistrate William Turnoff on Tuesday when the French request for extradition is expected to progress .
In a 12 - page decision , Judge William Hoeveler said Noriega 's status was not meant " to shield him from all future prosecutions for serious crimes he is alleged to have committed " .
The French authorities want his extradition so that he can serve out a sentence on a 1999 money - laundering conviction obtained in absentia .
But Panamanian President Martin Torrijos has said he would like the former military leader returned to Panama to serve a sentence for the murder of a government opponent .
Stalwart supporter
Manuel Noriega was once one of Washington 's top allies in Latin America , with close ties to former presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush Senior .
The Panamanian military ruler was seen as a stalwart supporter in the fight against communism and drug - trafficking in the region .
However , in 1988 a Florida court charged Noriega with helping Colombian drug - traffickers smuggle tons of cocaine into the US , and the White House went on to accuse the Panamanian leader of election - rigging and violating human rights .
In 1989 , more than 20,000 US troops invaded Panama , ousting and detaining Noriega , who was replaced by Guillermo Endara .
Among arguments used by President Bush to justify the invasion were alleged threats to the lives of US citizens in Panama and the neutrality of the Panama Canal , as well as need to combat the drugs trade .
At least 200 Panamanian civilians were killed as US troops battled Noriega 's security forces in an invasion condemned by the Organization of American States .
Some researchers have said the overall number of Panamanian deaths numbered several thousand .
Police are now conducting an investigation at the scene
A 14 - year - old girl was also seriously injured in the incident in Royd Street , Slaithwaite , on Sunday afternoon .
The teenage girl has been taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary with stab wounds .
Her condition is described as serious .
West Yorkshire Police are treating the death as murder .
Two men , one aged 47 , have been arrested in connection with the incident .
BBC correspondent Danny Savage said the girl had eventually fallen in the street after being attacked , and that specific area was being examined .
She was complaining she could n't breathe , that she was going to die
Waqar Zaman , shopkeeper
The owner of a corner shop at the end of Royd Street said he had tried to help the girl .
Waqar Zaman , 34 , said he found the girl lying in the street and removed his T - shirt to try to stem the flow of blood .
" She had a stab wound on her face which went straight through her mouth , she had stab wounds in her stomach just under her rib cage , all over the place , " he said .
" She was complaining she could n't breathe , that she was going to die . "
Local residents expressed their disbelief over the incident .
Neighbour Paul O'Shea said : " We are very shocked .
It happened right across the road from us .
" Seven or eight houses have been blocked off and the residents are not being allowed out .
" The first we heard about anything was when the police arrived .
It 's a terrible thing to happen . "

In the first part of “ Storm Warning , ” John McQuaid explored lessons we have n’t learned from Katrina — even as climate change increases the risk of catastrophic storms and flooding far beyond the Gulf Coast .
The Bush administration has yet to devise a national strategy for protecting the nation from such disasters .
But the Dutch did it — 50 years ago , after a major storm breached a network of dikes similar to New Orleans ’ levees , killing close to 2,000 people .
Today , McQuaid assesses what we can learn from the Netherlands .
— The Editors
In the centuries - long battle to protect New Orleans from rising waters , the hurricane levees are an afterthought .
Built over the past 40 years , they are short , weak , and ramshackle structures , especially when compared to the river levees that keep the Mississippi River in its narrow navigation - channel banks .
Ports , shipping , and barge companies all have influential lobbies , and over the decades the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became a one - stop shop for pork - barrel river projects , sometimes justified with cooked cost - benefit analyses .
The Louisiana landscape is dotted with these and includes the now - infamous Mississippi River - Gulf Outlet , a shipping channel not far from the Old Gentilly Landfill in eastern New Orleans .
Though it has n’t received substantial traffic in decades , it did cause significant marsh erosion and turned out to be a conduit for storm surges into New Orleans .
By contrast , hurricane levees have no economic benefit other than preventing disasters , and thus no constituency other than the public itself .
The Corps ’ now - notorious slapdash engineering in New Orleans ( see “ Broken : the Army Corps of Engineers “ ) was n’t happenstance .
It was the logical result of this dysfunctional system .
Two years after Katrina exposed the fragility of the hurricane levees and
the system that made them , the city remains exposed and vulnerable .
Since
Katrina , the Corps has embarked on an ambitious program to repair and
fortify the levee system by 2011 , one whose price tag keeps rising .
Last
week , Corps officials announced they would be asking Congress for an
additional $ 7.6 billion , bringing the project total to $ 14.7 billion of
improvements : compacted clay and mud , concrete armoring , floodgates , and
pumping stations .
It ’s a clear upgrade from the shoddy pre-Katrina
system .
It includes , for example , a proposed floodgate on the Intracoastal
Waterway , which should provide a measure of protection for the Old Gentilly
Landfill and the residents nearby .
But even if the Corps can pull this off — and it ’s not clear that it can — this
huge investment is still , in some sense , a mere stopgap .
Statistically , the
odds that any spot in this enhanced system will be overtopped in 30
years — the life of a mortgage — are about 1 in 4 , and probably greater given
the eroding landscape and the increased risk of severe storms that may
accompany climate change .
So today Louisiana politicians are demanding “ Category 5 ” protection , a system of flood defenses capable of repelling the worst that a hurricane could dish out .
Congress has ordered the Corps to study the matter and report back next year with some options .
But what , exactly , does Category 5 protection mean ?
Right now , nobody knows .
There is no master plan for New Orleans .
But models for this kind of endeavor already exist , and the best of them is in the Netherlands .
Over the past 50 years , the Dutch have built the world ’s most sophisticated system of flood defenses .
I went to see them two months after Katrina .
After weeks of looking at decidedly low - tech structures of mud , steel , and concrete , it was like materializing into a Star Trek episode .
I was soon strolling under a giant canopy of tubular white girders in the Maeslant storm surge barrier , a gateway across a shipping channel into Rotterdam .
Completed in 1997 , it ’s the last piece of a massive project to fortify the coast , begun after a 1953 flood that busted hundreds of dikes and inundated the country ’s south , killing 1,835 people .
The barrier is both functional and beautiful : From the air , it resembles a delicate butterfly .
When a storm surge approaches on the North Sea , an electronic warning system activates the barrier automatically , and the two gates — the butterfly wings — swing out into the water on ball bearings 30 feet in diameter to close the channel and block the storm surge .
But it ’s not the machinery so much as the political and legal system behind it that offers lessons for America .
After an intense debate following the 1953 disaster , the Dutch decided to junk the philosophy that had guided them for hundreds of years .
Instead of building hundreds of miles of dikes around inhabited areas — the approach now employed in New Orleans — they decided to raise gated barriers across the three large estuaries where the sea enters Dutch territory .
( North of the estuaries , the coastline is hardened with walls and gates , dunes high enough to block storm surges are scrupulously maintained , and a 20 - mile seawall was built to close off a large inlet from the sea . )
Like positioning soldiers in a mountain pass , the estuary plan focused resources at the most critical places , preventing storm surges from getting near settled areas farther back .
It ’s a system engineered to a safety standard 100 times more stringent than the current goal ( not yet achieved ) for New Orleans ’ most heavily populated areas .
Even Dutch pasturelands have more protection than the Big Easy .
To do all this , the Dutch had to push their science in new directions .
“ For a hydraulic engineer , this was like putting a man on the moon , ” Tjalle de Haan , a government engineer who worked on the projects , told me .
But the true innovation was the acknowledgement that as environmental conditions change , humans must get out in front of them — and stay there .
As land sinks , or the sea rises , the government must upgrade its flood defenses ; in the Netherlands , that ’s a legal mandate , not a question to be debated , one pork - barrel project at a time , with each new legislative session .
America is not the Netherlands , of course .
The differences in landscape alone make it impossible to exactly replicate the Dutch model — there is no way to build a wall around the entire Mississippi delta , nor is that advisable .
But the larger , and more critical , difference is that the United States has nothing resembling the Dutch mandate for protection .
The Netherlands ’ approach — designing projects based on estimated risk — long ago became routine for the private U.S. nuclear , aviation , and energy industries , and for the government agencies that build bridges and other infrastructure .
But not for the federal agency charged with protecting millions of people from floods , the Corps of Engineers .
Congress allocates money for water projects on the basis of political power , not a scientific accounting of who ’s most at risk .
This year ’s Water Resources Development
Act , the final version of which passed the House earlier this month and is expected to be green - lighted by the Senate in September , is a cornucopia of earmarks , including beach - replenishment projects demanded by vacation communities in New Jersey and Florida , as well as money to study the navigation impacts of one of Alaska Republican Rep .
Don Young ’s two infamous “ bridges to nowhere . ”
There ’s money for short - term fixes to New Orleans ’ levees , and a modest provision that would require outside review of the design of big Corps projects .
But there ’s little funding set aside for much - needed flood defense upgrades in other vulnerable communities .
The White House , which should be devising a long - term strategy for protecting the population , has also done nothing on this front .
Further confusing matters , President Bush has threatened to veto the bill if Congress does n’t cut its $ 21 billion price tag .
Tomorrow , the conclusion of “ Storm Warning , ” which examines the lax response to Katrina , the enormity of the task at hand , and why it could take another catastrophic storm for the government to finally take action .

Mothers - to - be who gorge on junk food may be more likely to give birth to a child with a sweet tooth , research shows .
The study , one of the first of its kind , suggests that a mother 's diet during pregnancy , and even when breastfeeding , can affect her unborn child 's taste for foods .
Researchers warned that women who use pregnancy as an excuse to indulge in fatty foods when " eating for two " may be inadvertently putting their children at risk of obesity in later life .
The finding comes as Britain fights the worst weight problem in Europe with almost a quarter of adults classed as obese .
Child obesity rates have trebled over the last 20 years , with 10 per cent of six - year - olds and 17 per cent of 15 - year - olds now obese .
By 2050 , half of all primary school - age boys and a fifth of girls could be so overweight that their health is at serious risk .
Experts have warned that unless the Government acts now , an entire generation faces an old age blighted by heart disease , cancer , diabetes and other diseases brought on by obesity , with today 's children dying at a younger age than their parents .
The latest research suggests that some of the roots of obesity can be traced back to the first days of life , with exposure to fatty and salty foods in the womb and through breastmilk having long - lasting effects on the development of those parts of the brain that control appetite .
Dr Stephanie Bayol ( CORR ) , the study 's main author , said : " Our study has shown that eating large quantities of junk food when pregnant and breastfeeding could impair the normal control of appetite and promote an exacerbated taste for junk food in offspring .
" This could send the offspring on the road to obesity and make the task of teaching healthy eating habits in children even more challenging . "
Dr Bayol , of the Royal Veterinary College in London , looked at the effect of maternal diet on the appetite and weight of more than 300 rat pups .
Half of the mother rats were fed normal rat food , while the others were also given unlimited access to junk foods , including jam doughnuts , chocolate chip muffins , marshmallows and chocolate .
The baby rats exposed to junk foods in the womb or through their mothers ' milk were more likely to be overweight ten weeks after birth , the British Journal of Nutrition reports .
Further analysis showed these creature ate more junk food themselves , and were particularly fond of treats high in fat , sugar and salt - the nutrients thought to activate the brain regions responsible for making food taste good .
Dr Bayol , whose work was funded by the Wellcome Trust , said the finding could also explain why some people crave fatty and salty snacks more than others .
She said : " Exposure to a maternal junk food diet during their foetal and suckling life might help explain why some individuals might find it harder than others to control their junk food intake even when given access to healthier foods in later life . "
Fellow researcher , Professor Neil Strickland , said it was important that women were made aware of the potential consequences of " eating for two " .
He said : " The Government is trying to encourage healthier eating habits in schools , but our research shows that healthy eating habits need to start during the foetal and suckling life of an individual .
" Giving children better school dinners is very good but more needs to be done to raise awareness in pregnant and breastfeeding women as well .
" Future mothers should be aware that pregnancy and lactation are not the time to overindulge on fatty , sugary treats on the misguided assumption they are ' eating for two ' . "
A Firefox Bankcard !
How cool is that ?
This is my Firefox bankcard :
My bank offered the possibility to use my own image on my bankcard .
You could order it through a web interface , so I uploaded the Firefox logo onto mine and picked up the card a few days later from the bank .
The graphic for the Firefox logo can be found in the Mozilla Style Guide .
Update :
My bankcard became the number one story of the day on Digg , possibly becoming the most seen bankcard ever ...
Below is a screenshot of Digg when the story was number 1 .
Over the years , each new bankcard I got had the Firefox logo on it .
The recent ones actually look nicer in my opinion ( like the one below from 2011 ) .
The only thing is that by now it 's the old Firefox logo , but still .
A new law expanding the government 's spying powers gives the Bush Administration a six - month window to install possibly permanent back doors in the nation 's communication networks .
The legislation was passed hurriedly by Congress over the weekend and signed into law Sunday by President Bush .
The bill , known as the Protect America Act , removes the prohibition on warrantless spying on Americans abroad and gives the government wide powers to order communication service providers such as cell phone companies and ISPs to make their networks available to government eavesdroppers .
The Administration pushed for passage of the changes to close what it called a " surveillance gap , " referring to a long - standing feature of the nation 's surveillance laws that required the government to get court approval to capture communications inside the United States .
While the nation 's spy laws have been continually loosened since 9/11 , the Administration never pushed for the right to tap the nation 's domestic communication networks until a secret court recently struck down a key pillar of the government 's secret spying program .
The Administration argues that the world 's communication networks now route many foreign to foreign calls and emails through switches in the United States .
Prior to the law 's passage , the nation 's spy agencies , such as the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency , did n't need any court approval to spy on foreigners so long as the wiretaps were outside the United States .
Now , those agencies are free to order services like Skype , cell phone companies and arguably even search engines to comply with secret spy orders to create back doors in domestic communication networks for the nation 's spooks .
While it 's unclear whether the wiretapping can be used for domestic purposes , the law only requires that the programs that give rise to such orders have a " significant purpose " of foreign intelligence gathering .
The law :
Defines the act of reading and listening into American 's phone calls and internet communications when they are " reasonably believed " to be outside the country as not surveillance .
Gives the government 6 months of extended powers to issue orders to " communication service providers , " to help with spying that " concerns persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States . "
The language does n't require the surveillance to only target people outside the United States , only that some of it does .
Forces Communication Service providers to comply secretly , though they can challenge the orders to the secret Foreign Intelligence Court .
Individuals or companies given such orders will be paid for their cooperation and can not be sued for complying .
Makes any program or orders launched in the next six months perpetually renewable after the six month " sunset " of the new powers last for a year after being authorized
Grandfathers in the the current secret surveillance program – sometimes referred to as the Terrorist Surveillance Program – and any others that have been blessed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
Requires the Attorney General to submit to the secret surveillance court its reasons why these programs are n't considered domestic spying programs , but the court can only throw out those reasons if it finds that they are " clearly erroneous . "
Requires the Attorney General to tell Congress twice a year about any incidents of surveillance abuse and give statistics about how many surveillance programs were started and how many directives were issued .
Makes no mention of the Inspector General , who uncovered abuses of the Patriot Act by the FBI after being ordered by Congress to audit the use of powerful self - issued subpoenas , is not mentioned in the bill .
In short , the law gives the Administration the power to order the nation 's communication service providers – which range from Gmail , AOL IM , Twitter , Skype , traditional phone companies , ISPs , internet backbone providers , Federal Express , and social networks – to create possibly permanent spying outposts for the federal government .
These outposts need only to have a " significant " purpose of spying on foreigners , would be nearly immune to challenge by lawsuit , and have no court supervision over their extent or implementation .
Abuses of the outposts will be monitored only by the Justice Department , which has already been found to have underreported abuses of other surveillance powers to Congress .
In related international news , Zimbabwe 's repressive dictator Robert Mugabe also won passage of a law allowing the government to turn that nation 's communication infrastructure into a gigantic , secret microphone .
UPDATE : This analysis originally said that the orders entered under the new rules could be renewed indefinitely .
That is not accurate .
I conflated the ability of the government to continue indefinitely the programs under way under FISA before the law was signed , with the section that says that the programs under the new law go for a full year , despite the 6 month sunset .
That said , if a future bill includes the same grandfather clause that this bill has , the spying outposts could easily permanent .
Those interested in seeing how I made this mistake , look at Section 6 of the bill .
I regret the error .
UPDATE 2 : James Risen , the New York Times reporter who broke the story of the warrantless wiretapping program , has an analysis piece here .

The Mexican government has admitted to staging a dramatic kidnap rescue for the benefit of a prime - time television audience .
The raid , televised on December 9 , in which Mexico 's equivalent of the FBI burst into a farmhouse at dawn , guns at the ready , to subjugate four alleged kidnappers and liberate three victims , had been presented by the government as proof that it was winning the battle against organised crime .
This week a presidential spokesman , Ruben Aguilar , accepted it was staged and called it a mistake .
The authorities had sought to share the blame with journalists that they claim asked the police to replay arrests carried out hours before .
" All we tried to do was serve you , the media , " the attorney general , Daniel Cabeza de Vaca , told a news conference .
" That and show the public that there is an institution that is working for them , that has successes and that arrests people . "
The two main television companies , which both broadcast the images , have been embarrassed by the revelation .
Not only did they film the swoop on the farmhouse just south of Mexico City , but they also followed the heavily armed police team inside and stuck microphones in the faces of the detainees and the three kidnap victims .
The revelation has also raised questions about the authenticity of other events presented as live in the past , including the rescue last year of the kidnapped manager of a Mexican football team , Cruz Azul .
Televisa , the country 's biggest network , has sacked the reporter who worked on the farmhouse story .
Sources inside the corporation said an internal investigation into how it happened has been launched .
Television Azteca has insisted it received an early morning tip - off from the police and merely sent a reporter and camera crew to the scene .
Official confirmation that this was , in fact , not - so - reality TV was prompted by the publicity given to one of the alleged kidnappers arrested on camera , who has consistently claimed she was the victim of a farce .
Florence Cassez , a French citizen , says she was detained the day before the raid , kept overnight in a police vehicle and planted inside the farmhouse , where her ex-boyfriend lived , shortly before the television crews arrived .
Ms Cassez and her former boyfriend , Israel Vallarta , are accused of belonging to a kidnapping gang known as The Zodiacs .
Police say the couple were holding a mother , her 11 - year - old son , and another young man when the farmhouse was raided , first in a real operation and then again for live TV .
Ms Cassez is in custody in Mexico City while the attorney general 's office builds its case .
The government has made it clear , however , that while it now accepts that part of her story is true , it does not see how this alters her legal status .
The country 's organised crime tsar , José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , told reporters : " The interesting thing would be to ask the [ rescued kidnap ] victims what they think of the show being staged by the kidnappers ' defence in order to attain impunity in this case . "

For those who did n’t have the opportunity to watch the Values Voter Debate last evening , you missed quite a display of political pandering , ridiculous rhetoric and all - around right - wing lunacy .
You also missed this lovely rendition of “ God Bless America ” performed by the Church of God Choir , from Springfield , Ohio – reworded to better reflect the Right ’s agenda :
;
Lyrics transcribed below :
Why should God bless America ?
She ’s forgotten he exists
And has turned her back on everything
That made her what she is
Why should God stand beside her
Through the night with the light from his hand ?
God have mercy on America
Forgive her sin and heal our land
The courts ruled prayer out of our schools In June of ‘ 62
Told the children “ you are your own God now
So you can make the rules ”
O say can you see what that choice Has cost us to this day America , one nation under God , has gone astray
Why should God bless America ?
She ’s forgotten he exists
And has turned her back on everything
That made her what she is
Why should God stand beside her
Through the night with the light from his hand ?
God have mercy on America
Forgive her sins and heal our land
In ‘73 the courts said we could take the unborn lives
The choice is yours do n’t worry now
It ’s not a wrong , it ’s your right
But just because they made it law
Does not change God ’s command
The most that we can hope for is
God ’s mercy on our land
Why should God bless America ?
She ’s forgotten he exists
And has turned her back on everything
That made her what she is
Why should God stand beside her
Through the night with the light from his hand ?
God have mercy on America
Forgive her sins and heal our land
( Reading from 2nd Chronicles 7:14 )
If my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then will I hear from heaven and forgive their sin and heal their land
God have mercy on America forgive her sins and heal our land .
The Chemistry Of Game Design
1. Moving Beyond Alchemy
By Daniel Cook “ … it was clear to the alchemists that " something " was generally being conserved in chemical processes , even in the most dramatic changes of physical state and appearance ; that is , that substances contained some " principles " that could be hidden under many outer forms , and revealed by proper manipulation . ”
I recently happened across a description of alchemy , that delightful pseudo - science of the last millennium that evolved into modern chemistry .
For a moment I thought that the authors were instead describing the current state of the art in game design .
Every time I sit down with a finely crafted title such as Tetris or Super Mario Brothers , I catch hints of a concise and clearly defined structure behind the gameplay .
It is my belief that a highly mechanical and predictable heart , built on the foundation of basic human psychology , beats at the core of every single successful game .
What would happen if we codified those systems and turned them into a practical technique for designing games ?
In A Time Before Science
“ Throughout the history of the discipline , alchemists struggled to understand the nature of these principles , and find some order and sense in the results of their chemical experiments — which were often undermined by impure or poorly characterized reagents , the lack of quantitative measurements , and confusing and inconsistent nomenclature . ”
Historically , the process of understanding games has been limited by numerous factors ranging from messy experimental practices , spiritual reliance on untested theories of play , and confused terminology .
We are still alchemists of our trade , mixing two parts impure story with one part polluted game play with three parts market voodoo .
As an industry , we need to beyond the mystical hand waving that defines modern game design .
It is now possible to craft , test and refine practical models of game design built from observable patterns of play .
We can describe what the player does and how the game reacts .
Recently , we ’ve begun to crack open why players react to certain stimuli and are able to create models that predict pleasure and frustration .
This essay will describe into one such model .
Fundamental Science Forms The Future
Diagram 2 : Condensation polymerization of Nylon ,
( a substance not available to alchemists )
The bigger hope is to move our alchemical craft towards the founding of a science of game design .
We currently build games through habit , guesswork and slavish devotion to pre-existing form .
Building a testable model of game mechanics opens up new opportunities for game balancing , original game design and the broader application of game design to other fields .
The advent of basic chemistry gave us tools to build a new world of technologies far beyond that imagined by our alchemist forefathers .
Plastics , engines , fabrics , power sources revolutionized our lives .
It is a worthy effort to crack the fundamental scientific principles behind the creation of games .
2. The Foundations Of A Model Of Game Design
Where chemistry separated itself from alchemy by building testable models of physical atoms , a science of game design concerns itself with testable models of human psychology .
Many of the attempts to define games have focused on the mechanistic elements of the game , such as the primitive actions that the system allows the player to perform or the tokens that the player manipulates .
The approach has been to treat games as self contained logical system .
Mechanics and aesthetics are certainly important pieces of any model of game design , but in the end , such analysis provides little insight into what makes a game enjoyable .
You end up with a set of fragmented pieces that tell you almost nothing about the meaningful interactions between the game as a simulation and the player as an active and evolving participant .
Games are not mathematical systems .
They are systems that always have a human being , full of desires , excitement and immense cleverness , sitting smack dab in the center .
To accurately describe games , we need a working psychological model of the player .
Player Model
Our player model is simple :
The player is entity that is driven , consciously or subconsciously , to learn new skills high in perceived value .
They gain pleasure from successfully acquiring skills .
Diagram 3 : The player follows clues to the acquisition of a new skill
Let ’s dig into three key concepts in our player model .
· Skills
· Driven to learn
· Perceived value
Skill
A skill is a behavior that the player uses to manipulate the world .
Some skills are conceptual , such as navigating a map while others are quite physical , such as pounding in a nail with a hammer .
Driven To Learn
Play is instinctual .
In low stimulation environments where we are not actively pursuing activities related to food and shelter , people will begin playing by default .
Strong feedback mechanisms in the form boredom or frustration prod us into action .
Given a spare moment , we throw ourselves into playing with blocks or dolls as children and more intricate hobbies as adults .
It is a sign of our need for meaningful stimulation that solitary confinement remains a vicious punishment for the most hardened criminals .
1
The flip side is that we are rewarded for learning .
The sensation that gamers term ‘ fun ’ is derived from the act of mastering knowledge , skills and tools .
When you learn something new , when you understand it so fully you can use that knowledge to manipulate your environment for the better , you experience joy .
There is a reasonable amount of neuroscience available to support this claim .
Edward A Vessel , a cognitive neuroscientist at the NYU Center for Neural Science writes :
“ These “ aha ” moments , when a concept or message is fully interpreted and understood , lead to a flood of chemicals in the brain and body that we experience as pleasurable .
It feels good to “ get ” it .
The deeper the concept is , the better it feels when we are finally able to wrap our head around it . ”
Upon the click of comprehension , a natural opiate called endomorphin , a messaging chemical in the brain similar in structure to morphine , is released .
As humans , we are wired to crave new information constantly .
In some sense , what you and I term curiosity can be interpreted as our brain looking for its next fix of deliciously fascinating information .
As game designers , we deal with the fun , boredom and frustration on a regular basis .
It is good to recognize that these are biological phenomena , not some mystical or mysterious sensation .
For more thoughts on the topic , I encourage you to have a quick read through Raph Koster ’s book “ A Theory of Fun for Game Design ”
Perceived Value
Players pursue skills with high perceived value over skills with low perceived value
Play is , perhaps counter intuitively , a deeply pragmatic activity .
Our impulses to engage in play are instinctual , selected for by evolution because it provides us with the safe opportunity to learn behaviors that improve our lot in life without the threat of life threatening failure .
We play because we are built to expect the eventual harvesting of utility from our apparently useless actions .
We stop playing when we fail to find that utility .
The perception of value is more important than an objective measurement value .
Humans are not creatures of pure logic .
We know people exhibit consistent biases in how they weight their actions .
For example , they ’ll often undertake bizarre risks because they are unable to properly evaluate statistical odds .
We ’ve also realized that people have substancial limits on how much information they can take into account when making any one decision .
Many decisions are made based off highly predictable ‘ gut ’ reactions that have their own subconscious rules .
Chapter 3 : Skill Atoms
With our player model in hand , we can describe how the player interacts with the game .
The basic ingredients of a game are , if not standardized , at least well described in a variety of books and rambling by designers across the past decade or two .
I ’ve taken the basic ingredients of tokens , verbs , rules , aesthetics , etc and remixed them into a self contained atomic feedback loop called a skill atom .
Each unit describes how the player gains a new skill .
Diagram 4 : The player follows clues to the acquisition of a new skill
A skill atom feedback loop is composed of four main elements :
- Action : The player performs an action .
For a skill atom encounter by a new player , the action might involve pressing a button .
More advanced atoms might instead require the player execute a batched set of actions such as navigating a complex maze .
- Simulation : Based off the action , an ongoing simulation is updated .
A door might open .
- Feedback : The game provides some form of feedback to the player to let them know how the simulation has changed state .
This feedback can be auditory , visual , or tactile .
It can be visceral in the form of an exploding corpse or it can be symbolic in the form of a block of text .
- Modeling :
As the final step , the player absorbs the feedback and updates their mental models on the success of their action .
If they feel that they have made progress , they feel pleasure .
If they master a new skill or other tool , they experience an even greater burst of joy .
If they feel that their action has been in vain , they feel boredom or frustration .
A shorthand diagram that I find useful for recording atoms is as follows :
Diagram 5 : Our canonical skill atom
For example , let ’s dissect the act of jumping in Mario
Diagram 6 : The skill atom of the player learning how to make Mario jump
· Action :
An inexperienced player pushes a button .
· Simulation :
The simulation notes the action and starts the avatar of Mario on the screen moving in an arc .
· Feedback :
The screen shows the user an animation of Mario jumping .
· Modeling :
The user forms a mental model that pressing the button results in jumping .
Implicit in this model is that the atom is often looped through multiple times before the user understand what it teach .
The first pass may only clue the user that something vaguely interesting happened .
The user then presses the button again to test their theory and Mario once again bounces up into the air .
At this point , the player smiles since they realize they ’ve acquired an interesting skill that may be of use later on .
This Thing We Call Play
“ Man is a Tool - using Animal . . . .
Nowhere do you find him without Tools ; without Tools he is nothing , with Tools he is all . ” – 19th century essayist Thomas Carlyle
Upon the acquisition of a shiny new skill from a skill atom , players experiment with it .
They try it out in different environments and see if it does anything useful .
This semi-random exploration is the classic ‘ play ’ activity that we see children perform .
For example , when a new player masters how to jump , you ’ll notice they ’ll almost immediately start happily hopping about the level .
On the surface , it is a silly frivolous activity .
In reality , we are observing humanities instinctual process of learning in action .
In the course of experimenting , the player will occasionally stumble across something in the environment that gives them interesting information that might lead to the mastery of a new skill .
At this point , you ’ll see the behavior of the player become more deliberate .
A mental model begins coalescing in their minds .
In our jumping example , the player starts bumping against a platform .
They may even reach the top of a platform .
It is very common that skills acquisition requires multiple passes through the new skill atom before mastery is achieved .
Eventually , the player uses an existing skill to grok another skill .
They experience a wash of pleasure and start the process all over again .
Chaining Of Game Mechanics
We can visually represent how players learn by linking our basic skill atoms together to create a directed graph of atoms called a skill chain .
Diagram 7 : Two linked atoms
The skill from one atom feeds into the actions of another atom further down the chain .
By linking more and more atoms in , you build a network that describes the entire game .
Every expected skill , every successful action , every predicted outcome of a simulation , every bit of required feedback can be included in a simple , yet functional fashion .
Diagram 8 : Sample skill chain for Tetris
( Click here for the full sized PDF )
A skill chain is a general notation that can be used to model pretty much any game imaginable .
Your design can be broken down into dozens of simple atoms that link together to form a clear and easily readable map of how the game plays .
The skill chain , with its ability to describe the player experience instead the mere mechanics of the game , provides a far richer description of the meaningful moments that occur during gameplay .
How Players Interact WithA Skill Chain
Players will travel from atom to atom like Pac - Man following a trail of dots towards the power pellet .
They move from one skill to the next even when they have only a vague concept of the ultimate destination .
Chomping up those dots is good .
One of our peculiarly human limitations comes into play at this point .
Players are unable to predict the value of a new skill more than a couple atoms down the chain .
As long as there a new skill with potential value within our prediction horizon , players will pursue it .
There may be no long term payoff other than the pleasure of the experience , but we do n’t care .
As long as the short term rewards keep coming , we assume that there will be some final benefit from our efforts .
Diagram 9 : Players have limited foresight
If you look at this from an evolutionary perspective , our behavior makes quite a bit of sense .
Many useful skills take upwards of five to 10 years to master .
During those early days of our education , the basic playful activities such as gossiping about which girls have cooties seem rather silly .
Later on however , our mastery of politics , science , or in the case of the cooties , mating rituals , yields a hugely positive impact on our well being .
The just - so story here is that playful folks that instinctually engaged in long term learning with no immediate benefit were the ones that mastered agriculture , hunting and language .
These folks thrived .
Those that did not died off .
However , our brains never evolved to deal with modern games .
The existence of a set of skill atoms that are tuned just to entertain us and that never actually lead up to a real world skill is something new to the world .
At their most puerile , games are a grand hack .
The minute by minute experience fits all our biological heuristics and sounds all the right bells .
So we keep on playing .
And we wonder why so many games have such horrible endings .
4.Status Of Atoms In The Skill Chain
A skill chain provides some rather useful information about the state of the player as they engage the game .
Imagine that the skill chain is the instrumented dashboard that lights up with the player ’s progress .
At any point in time you can tell the following information
Mastered skills :
Skills that have been recently mastered .
: Skills that have been recently mastered .
Partially mastered skills : Skills that the player is toying with , but has not yet mastered .
Skills that the player is toying with , but has not yet mastered .
Unexercised skills :
Skills the player has yet to attempt .
: Skills the player has yet to attempt .
Active skills :
Skills that the player is actively using .
( aka the Grind )
: Skills that the player is actively using .
( aka the Grind ) Burned out skills : Skill atoms that the player has lost interest in exercising .
Diagram 10 : Icons for skill status
We ’ve talked a little bit about mastered and partially mastered skills .
Unexercised skills are pretty self explanatory .
If a player ca n’t perform the actions necessary to understand a skill , that atom will never be exercised or mastered .
Mastery flows down the chain and if players are blocked early on , they ’ll never each the further atoms .
The two states that are worth a bit more explanation are active skills and burned out skills .
Active Skills
The player only experiences the joy of mastery for an atom only once .
After the moment of mastery , a biological feedback system kicks in that dampens the pleasure response to exercising those same pathways again .
What was once exciting becomes boring .
However , players will continue exercising an already mastered atom as a new tool for manipulating their world .
A mastered atom is as good as a shiny new hammer hanging from a workman ’s belt .
When a new opportunity comes up , typically in the form of an atom further down the skill chain , the player makes use of their new skill to advance their knowledge .
Players have enormous patience .
They are willing to exercise a basic skill atom thousands of times in order to achieve mastery of a higher order atom .
Players jump innumerable times in Super Mario Brothers in order to reach more powerful skillsets further down the chain .
A skill that has been mastered and is now simply being used to activate other icons is represented by the lit light icon .
Diagram 11 : Active Icon
Burnout
Players do n’t always bridge the gap between one atom and the next .
They master a new skill , they play with it but fail to find any interesting use for it .
This is known as burnout .
Diagram 12 : Burned out icon
For example , suppose our player pressed the jump button .
They performed the jump and we recorded their mastery of the skill .
However , this particular player never figured out that how the jump might be useful .
Perhaps they did n’t jump near the platform and receive interesting feedback on the next atom .
After a short period of experimentation with no interesting results , the player stopped pressing the jump button entirely .
When a player burns out on a particular atom , the consquences ripples up and down the chain .
Early Stage Burnout
In the example above , the Reach Platform atom will never be mastered .
The foundational skills are not in place .
In a deeply linked skill chain , a burnout early on can chop off huge sections of the player ’s potential experience .
You can think of learning curves in terms of managing early stage burnout .
Later Stage Burnout
On the other hand , a burnout later on down the chain can devalue active skills .
For example , assume we have a single platform in our jumping game and there is really nothing on it .
The player jumps on the platform , discovered no interesting new activities and so stops jumping on platforms .
This , in turn , atrophies the Jump skill , because if the player does n’t need to jump on platforms , why would he bother jumping ?
Burnout Is Our Gateway To Testability
Burnout is a very clear signal that our game design is failing to keep the players attention .
As you watch burnout creeps across a game ’s skill chain , it is a signal that players will soon stop playing the game .
They are becoming bored , frustrated and perhaps even angry .
Perhaps most importantly , we can measure when burnout occurs for an individual atom .
This gives us , as game designers , unprecedented qualitative insight into how a particular design is performing with play testers .
When you start tracking burnout along with the other skill states , you can visualize the problematic areas with great clarity and accuracy .
The entire topic of measuring performance of a game through instrumentation of its skill chain is a rich topic for further exploration .

5. Advanced Elements Of A Skill Chain
We ’ve covered the basic elements of a skill chain and how to record that status of the player ’s progress .
There are only a few more pieces we need so that you can start building your own skill chains .
Pre-existing skills :
How the skill chain is jump started .
: How the skill chain is jump started .
Red Herrings :
How we represent story and other such useless , but pleasurable aspects of modern game design .
Pre-existing Skills
Players bring an initial set of skills to a game .
These skills always form the starting nodes of a skill chain .
Accurately predicting this skill set has a big impact on the player ’s enjoyment of the rest of the game .
Diagram 14 : How pre-existing skill feed into initial skill atoms
Lack Of The Correct Initial Skills
If the player lacks expected skills , they will be unable to engage the initial atoms in the game .
In our example about jumping , imagine a player that did n’t realize that you need to push the button on the joystick in order to do something .
Such an example may seem ludicrous , but it is one faced by many non-gamers whenever they are faced with a freakishly complex modern controller .
Many game designs automatically assume the ability to navigate a 3D space using two fiddly little analog stick and a plethora of obscure buttons .
Users without this skill give up in frustration without ever seeing the vast majority of the content .
It is very important to realize that such users are n’t stupid .
They merely have a different initial skill set .
One of our jobs as designers is to ensure that the people who play our game are able to master the game ’s early skill atoms .
Ultimately this means making an accurate list of pre-existing skills for the target demographic and building our early experience around those skills .
Do n’t assume skills that may not be there .
Pre-mastery Of Skills Taught In The Game
The flip side of all this is that if players have already mastered existing skills , the process of mastering early atoms is likely to be quite boring .
When a player , who has completed a dozen hardcore titles , plays a game sporting a 10 minutes navigational tutorial they become bored .
All the reward notes are sour because their jaded brain does n’t react at the appropriate points .
If a game does n’t teach the player anything new , the player is very likely to experience burnout on the early atoms .
Targeting the correct set pre-existing skills is a balancing act .
If you choose correctly , you ’ll end up with an ‘ intuitive ’ game that players enjoy .
If you choose incorrectly , you risk frustration , boredom and inevitable burnout .
Red Herrings
Games are laden with story , setting , and imagery intended to evoke a particular mood and other intriguing but useless elements .
Gamers derive great pleasure from this feedback .
We can represent much of this mélange of artistry with the use of a special type of atom known as a red herring .
Red herrings are atoms that designer knows will never result in a useful in - game skill , but that still evokes the pleasure of partial mastery in the player .
When the player experiences the information cues , existing player memories are activated and the brain greedily sucks up the clues .
For example , many players have pre-existing associations with mushrooms .
If you are of a certain age and a certain liberal background , you may even own a rainbow colored T - shirt that sports a mushroom or two .
When such a person plays Super Mario Brothers for the first time , they are quite likely to perk up at the sight of magic mushrooms .
A skill atom in their brain is activated and they begin free associating why might dear Miyamoto have placed such a counter culture reference in the game .
Of course , the reality is that the mushrooms mean nothing of the sort .
The combination of the player ’s limited prediction horizon with the chemicals gained from associating the in game feedback with their existing mental structure is enough to create a jolt of pleasure that the player will happily seek again .
The downside of Red Herrings in their games is that most players rapidly burnout on such sleights of hand .
The first time you see the mushroom , you might think it interesting .
The second time , you see it as its true nature : a key that unlocks another skill that helps you advance .
6. Conclusion
We ’ve covered a lot of ground in this essay .
Hopefully , the diagrams give you a good understanding of how to describe a game using skill chains .
Using Skill Chains
As a tool , I ’ve found that skill chain diagrams dramatically improve my understanding of how a game works , where it fails and where there are clear opportunities for improvement .
Creating a skill chain provides you with the following information :
Clearly identify the pre-existing skills that the player needs to begin the game
Clearly identify the skills that the player needs to complete the game
Identify which skills need feedback mechanisms .
Identify where the player experiences pleasure in your game
Alert the team when and where players are experiencing burnout during play
Provide a conceptual framework for analyzing why players are experiencing burnout .
Though it takes a little practice , skill atoms are n’t all that complicated to define and are really no more of a burden than writing unit tests for a chunk of code .
Future Topics
Skill chains are a deep topic and we ’ve described only the most basics aspects of how they function .
Further topics of inquire include :
Use of instrumented skill chains as a tool in iterative development
How skill chains related to traditional interaction design
The role of timing and other reward distribution technique in skill chains
Critiques of common games using skill chains
Limitations of skill chains
From Alchemy To Chemistry
I like to imagine that models like skill chains will help raise the level of intent and predictability in modern game design .
With the concepts in this essay , you can start integrating this model into your current games and collecting your own data .
We ’ve got some immensely bright people in our little market and it is almost certain that they can improve upon this foundational starting point .
By sharing what you ’ve learned , we can begin to improve our models of design .
What happens if game designers embrace the scientific process and start build a science of game design ?
The alchemists of ages past dreamt of turning lead into gold .
They performed mad experiments with imprecise equipment and questionable theories of how the universe worked .
Modern game designers are not really so different .
Those not simply here for the sake of profit instead rally around equally fantastical dreams such as creating a game that makes the user cry or enlightening the world with games of politics or hunger .
We crib cryptic notes from past successes and chortle merrily when our haphazard experiments manage to mildly entertain our audience .
We are on the leading cusp of deep human / software interaction and yet we know so little .
It is only by gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of design that game designers with gain the power to break free from the accidental successes of the past .
With practical techniques gained from controlled experiments , we will create radically effective new applications .
When we have our basic chemistry , our basic systems of measurement and our basic atomic theory , perhaps then we can consistently build games that tap into the heart of human psychology .
The reproducible application of psychological manipulation of individuals and groups using software is big heady stuff .
In the short term , I would hope that a deep understanding of models like skill chains help us crack open the rigid craftsmanship of existing genres so that we can build better , more potent games .
Long term , it will be interesting to see what world changing uses we can find for our ever improving psychological technology .

Abstract : “ From hand - held DVD players to hundred - inch plasma screens , much of today 's technology is driven by the human appetite for pleasure through visual and auditory stimulation .
What creates this appetite ?
Neuropsychologists have found that visual input activates receptors in the parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward , and that the brain associates new images with old while also responding strongly to new ones .
Using functional MRI imaging and other findings , they are exploring how human beings are " infovores " whose brains love to learn .

Relationship of Skill Chains to MDA ( Mechanics , Dynamics , Aesthetics )
This is a question that has been posed on occasion .
MDA is a game analysis framework put forth by Robin Hunicke , Marc LeBlanc and Robert Zubek .
It is one of many descriptive techniques that catalog the elements of a game .
The hope is that in the process of defining the pieces of a game , the designer will clarify their thinking about a design .
This is certainly an admirable goal .
The major differences between the two approaches is that in MDA there is little attempt to model the actual player experience with the game .
MDA analysis also fails to provide any objectively testable structure .
With skill chains , you can always hook up logging software and observe where atoms light up and where they burn out .

Cold War II
Noam Chomsky
ZNet , August 27 , 2007
These are exciting days in Washington , as the government directs its energies to the demanding task of “ containing Iran ” in what Washington Post correspondent Robin Wright , joining others , calls “ Cold War II . ” [ 1 ]
During Cold War I , the task was to contain two awesome forces .
The lesser and more moderate force was “ an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever means and at whatever cost . ”
Hence “ if the United States is to survive , ” it will have to adopt a “ repugnant philosophy ” and reject “ acceptable norms of human conduct ” and the “ long - standing American concepts of `fair play ’ ” that had been exhibited with such searing clarity in the conquest of the national territory , the Philippines , Haiti and other beneficiaries of “ the idealistic new world bent on ending inhumanity , ” as the newspaper of record describes our noble mission . [ 2 ]
The judgments about the nature of the super - Hitler and the necessary response are those of General Jimmy Doolittle , in a critical assessment of the CIA commissioned by President Eisenhower in 1954 .
They are quite consistent with those of the Truman administration liberals , the “ wise men ” who were “ present at the creation , ” notoriously in NSC 68 but in fact quite consistently .
In the face of the Kremlin ’s unbridled aggression in every corner of the world , it is perhaps understandable that the US resisted in defense of human values with a savage display of torture , terror , subversion and violence while doing “ everything in its power to alter or abolish any regime not openly allied with America , ” as Tim Weiner summarizes the doctrine of the Eisenhower administration in his recent history of the CIA . [ 3 ]
And just as the Truman liberals easily matched their successors in fevered rhetoric about the implacable enemy and its campaign to rule the world , so did John F. Kennedy , who bitterly condemned the “ monolithic and ruthless conspiracy , ” and dismissed the proposal of its leader ( Khrushchev ) for sharp mutual cuts in offensive weaponry , then reacted to his unilateral implementation of these proposals with a huge military build - up .
The Kennedy brothers also quickly surpassed Eisenhower in violence and terror , as they “ unleashed covert action with an unprecedented intensity ” ( Wiener ) , doubling Eisenhower ’s annual record of major CIA covert operations , with horrendous consequences worldwide , even a close brush with terminal nuclear war . [ 4 ]
But at least it was possible to deal with Russia , unlike the fiercer enemy , China .
The more thoughtful scholars recognized that Russia was poised uneasily between civilization and barbarism .
As Henry Kissinger later explained in his academic essays , only the West has undergone the Newtonian revolution and is therefore “ deeply committed to the notion that the real world is external to the observer , ” while the rest still believe “ that the real world is almost completely internal to the observer , ” the “ basic division ” that is “ the deepest problem of the contemporary international order . ”
But Russia , unlike third word peasants who think that rain and sun are inside their heads , was perhaps coming to the realization that the world is not just a dream , Kissinger felt .
Not so the still more savage and bloodthirsty enemy , China , which for liberal Democrat intellectuals at various times rampaged as a “ a Slavic Manchukuo , ” a blind puppet of its Kremlin master , or a monster utterly unconstrained as it pursued its crazed campaign to crush the world in its tentacles , or whatever else circumstances demanded .
The remarkable tale of doctrinal fanaticism from the 1940s to the ‘ 70s , which makes contemporary rhetoric seem rather moderate , is reviewed by James Peck in his highly revealing study of the national security culture , Washington ’s China .
In later years , there were attempts to mimic the valiant deeds of the defenders of virtue from the two villainous global conquerors and their loyal slaves – for example , when the Gipper strapped on his cowboy boots and declared a National Emergency because Nicaraguan hordes were only two days from Harlingen Texas , though as he courageously informed the press , despite the tremendous odds “ I refuse to give up .
I remember a man named Winston Churchill who said , `Never give in .
Never , never , never . ’
So we wo n’t . ”
With consequences that need not be reviewed .
Even with the best of efforts , however , the attempts never were able to recapture the glorious days of Cold War I .
But now , at last , those heights might be within reach , as another implacable enemy bent on world conquest has arisen , which we must contain before it destroys us all : Iran .
Perhaps it ’s a lift to the spirits to be able to recover those heady Cold War days when at least there was a legitimate force to contain , however dubious the pretexts and disgraceful the means .
But it is instructive to take a closer look at the contours of Cold War II as they are being designed by “ the former Kremlinologists now running U.S. foreign policy , such as Rice and Gates ” ( Wright ) .
The task of containment is to establish “ a bulwark against Iran ’s growing influence in the Middle East , ” Mark Mazzetti and Helene Cooper explain in the New York Times ( July 31 ) .
To contain Iran ’s influence we must surround Iran with US and NATO ground forces , along with massive naval deployments in the Persian Gulf and of course incomparable air power and weapons of mass destruction .
And we must provide a huge flow of arms to what Condoleezza Rice calls “ the forces of moderation and reform ” in the region , the brutal tyrannies of Egypt and Saudi Arabia and , with particular munificence , Israel , by now virtually an adjunct of the militarized high - tech US economy .
All to contain Iran ’s influence .
A daunting challenge indeed .
And daunting it is .
In Iraq , Iranian support is welcomed by much of the majority Shi’ite population .
In an August visit to Teheran , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki met with the supreme leader Ali Khamenei , President Ahmadinejad and other senior officials , and thanked Tehran for its “ positive and constructive ” role in improving security in Iraq , eliciting a sharp reprimand from President Bush , who “ declares Teheran a regional peril and asserts the Iraqi leader must understand , ” to quote the headline of the Los Angeles Times report on al - Maliki ’s intellectual deficiencies .
A few days before , also greatly to Bush ’s discomfiture , Afghan President Hamid Karzai , Washington ’s favorite , described Iran as “ a helper and a solution ” in his country . [ 5 ]
Similar problems abound beyond Iran ’s immediate neighbors .
In Lebanon , according to polls , most Lebanese see Iranian - backed Hezbollah “ as a legitimate force defending their country from Israel , ” Wright reports .
And in Palestine , Iranian - backed Hamas won a free election , eliciting savage punishment of the Palestinian population by the US and Israel for the crime of voting “ the wrong way , ” another episode in “ democracy promotion . ”
But no matter .
The aim of US militancy and the arms flow to the moderates is to counter “ what everyone in the region believes is a flexing of muscles by a more aggressive Iran , ” according to an unnamed senior U.S. government official – “ everyone ” being the technical term used to refer to Washington and its more loyal clients . [ 6 ]
Iran ’s aggression consists in its being welcomed by many within the region , and allegedly supporting resistance to the US occupation of neighboring Iraq .
It ’s likely , though little discussed , that a prime concern about Iran ’s influence is to the East , where in mid-August “ Russia and China today host Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at a summit of a Central Asian security club designed to counter U.S. influence in the region , ” the business press reports . [ 7 ]
The “ security club ” is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , which has been slowly taking shape in recent years .
Its membership includes not only the two giants Russia and China , but also the energy - rich Central Asian states Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Tajikistan .
Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan was a guest of honor at the August meeting .
“ In another unwelcome development for the Americans , Turkmenistan ’s President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov also accepted an invitation to attend the summit , ” another step its improvement of relations with Russia , particularly in energy , reversing a long - standing policy of isolation from Russia .
“ Russia in May secured a deal to build a new pipeline to import more gas from Turkmenistan , bolstering its dominant hold on supplies to Europe and heading off a competing U.S. - backed plan that would bypass Russian territory . ” [ 8 ]
Along with Iran , there are three other official observer states : India , Pakistan and Mongolia .
Washington ’s request for similar status was denied .
In 2005 the SCO called for a timetable for termination of any US military presence in Central Asia .
The participants at the August meeting flew to the Urals to attend the first joint Russia - China military exercises on Russian soil .
Association of Iran with the SCO extends its inroads into the Middle East , where China has been increasing trade and other relations with the jewel in the crown , Saudi Arabia .
There is an oppressed Shi’ite population in Saudi Arabia that is also susceptible to Iran ’s influence – and happens to sit on most of Saudi oil .
About 40 % of Middle East oil is reported to be heading East , not West . [ 9 ]
As the flow Eastward increases , US control declines over this lever of world domination , a “ stupendous source of strategic power , ” as the State Department described Saudi oil 60 years ago .
In Cold War I , the Kremlin had imposed an iron curtain and built the Berlin Wall to contain Western influence .
In Cold War II , Wright reports , the former Kremlinologists framing policy are imposing a “ green curtain ” to bar Iranian influence .
In short , government - media doctrine is that the Iranian threat is rather similar to the Western threat that the Kremlin sought to contain , and the US is eagerly taking on the Kremlin ’s role in the thrilling “ new Cold War . ”
All of this is presented without noticeable concern .
Nevertheless , the recognition that the US government is modeling itself on Stalin and his successors in the new Cold War must be arousing at least some flickers of embarrassment .
Perhaps that is how we can explain the ferocious Washington Post editorial announcing that Iran has escalated its aggressiveness to a Hot War : “ the Revolutionary Guard , a radical state within Iran ’s Islamic state , is waging war against the United States and trying to kill as many American soldiers as possible . ”
The US must therefore “ fight back , ” the editors thunder , finding quite “ puzzling … the murmurs of disapproval from European diplomats and others who say they favor using diplomacy and economic pressure , rather than military action , to rein in Iran , ” even in the face of its outright aggression .
The evidence that Iran is waging war against the US is now conclusive .
After all , it comes from an administration that has never deceived the American people , even improving on the famous stellar honesty of its predecessors .
Suppose that for once Washington ’s charges happen to be true , and Iran really is providing Shi’ite militias with roadside bombs that kill American forces , perhaps even making use of the some of the advanced weaponry lavishly provided to the Revolutionary Guard by Ronald Reagan in order to fund the illegal war against Nicaragua , under the pretext of arms for hostages ( the number of hostages tripled during these endeavors ) . [ 10 ]
If the charges are true , then Iran could properly be charged with a minuscule fraction of the iniquity of the Reagan administration , which provided Stinger missiles and other high - tech military aid to the “ insurgents ” seeking to disrupt Soviet efforts to bring stability and justice to Afghanistan , as they saw it .
Perhaps Iran is even guilty of some of the crimes of the Roosevelt administration , which assisted terrorist partisans attacking peaceful and sovereign Vichy France in 1940 - 41 , and had thus declared war on Germany even before Pearl Harbor .
One can pursue these questions further .
The CIA station chief in Pakistan in 1981 , Howard Hart , reports that “ I was the first chief of station ever sent abroad with this wonderful order : ` Go kill Soviet soldiers ’ .
Imagine !
I loved it . ”
Of course “ the mission was not to liberate Afghanistan , ” Tim Wiener writes in his history of the CIA , repeating the obvious .
But “ it was a noble goal , ” he writes .
Killing Russians with no concern for the fate of Afghans is a “ noble goal . ”
But support for resistance to a US invasion and occupation would be a vile act and declaration of war .
Without irony , the Bush administration and the media charge that Iran is “ meddling ” in Iraq , otherwise presumably free from foreign interference .
The evidence is partly technical .
Do the serial numbers on the Improvised Explosive Devices really trace back to Iran ?
If so , does the leadership of Iran know about the IEDs , or only the Iranian Revolutionary Guard .
Settling the debate , the White House plans to brand the Revolutionary Guard as a “ specially designated global terrorist ” force , an unprecedented action against a national military branch , authorizing Washington to undertake a wide range of punitive actions .
Watching in disbelief , much of the world asks whether the US military , invading and occupying Iran ’s neighbors , might better merit this charge — or its Israeli client , now about to receive a huge increase in military aid to commemorate 40 years of harsh occupation and illegal settlement , and its fifth invasion of Lebanon a year ago .
It is instructive that Washington ’s propaganda framework is reflexively accepted , apparently without notice , in US and other Western commentary and reporting , apart from the marginal fringe of what is called ‘ the loony left . ”
What is considered “ criticism ” is skepticism as to whether all of Washington ’s charges about Iranian aggression in Iraq are true .
It might be an interesting research project to see how closely the propaganda of Russia , Nazi Germany , and other aggressors and occupiers matched the standards of today ’s liberal press and commentators ..
The comparisons are of course unfair .
Unlike German and Russian occupiers , American forces are in Iraq by right , on the principle , too obvious even to enunciate , that the US owns the world .
Therefore , as a matter of elementary logic , the US cannot invade and occupy another country .
The US can only defend and liberate others .
No other category exists .
Predecessors , including the most monstrous , have commonly sworn by the same principle , but again there is an obvious difference : they were Wrong , and we are Right .
QED .
Another comparison comes to mind , which is studiously ignored when we are sternly admonished of the ominous consequences that might follow withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
The preferred analogy is Indochina , highlighted in a shameful speech by the President on August 22 .
That analogy can perhaps pass muster among those who have succeeded in effacing from their minds the record of US actions in Indochina , including the destruction of much of Vietnam and the murderous bombing of Laos and Cambodia as the US began its withdrawal from the wreckage of South Vietnam .
In Cambodia , the bombing was in accord with Kissinger ’s genocidal orders : “ anything that flies on anything that moves ” – actions that drove “ an enraged populace into the arms of an insurgency [ the Khmer Rouge ] that had enjoyed relatively little support before the Kissinger - Nixon bombing was inaugurated , ” as Cambodia specialists Owen Taylor and Ben Kiernan observe in a highly important study that passed virtually without notice , in which they reveal that the bombing was five times the incredible level reported earlier , greater than all allied bombing in World War II .
Completely suppressing all relevant facts , it is then possible for the President and many commentators to present Khmer Rouge crimes as a justification for continuing to devastate Iraq .
But although the grotesque Indochina analogy receives much attention , the obvious analogy is ignored : the Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan , which , as Soviet analysts predicted , led to shocking violence and destruction as the country was taken over by Reagan ’s favorites , who amused themselves by such acts as throwing acid in the faces of women in Kabul they regarded as too liberated , and then virtually destroyed the city and much else , creating such havoc and terror that the population actually welcomed the Taliban .
That analogy could indeed be invoked without utter absurdity by advocates of “ staying the course , ” but evidently it is best forgotten .
Under the heading “ Secretary Rice ’s Mideast mission : contain Iran , ” the press reports Rice ’s warning that Iran is “ the single most important single - country challenge to …US interests in the Middle East . ”
That is a reasonable judgment .
Given the long - standing principle that Washington must do “ everything in its power to alter or abolish any regime not openly allied with America , ” Iran does pose a unique challenge , and it is natural that the task of containing Iranian influence should be a high priority .
As elsewhere , Bush administration rhetoric is relatively mild in this case .
For the Kennedy administration , “ Latin America was the most dangerous area in the world ” when there was a threat that the progressive Cheddi Jagan might win a free election in British Guiana , overturned by CIA shenanigans that handed the country over to the thuggish racist Forbes Burnham . [ 11 ]
A few years earlier , Iraq was “ the most dangerous place in the world ” ( CIA director Allen Dulles ) after General Abdel Karim Qassim broke the Anglo - American condominium over Middle East oil , overthrowing the pro-US monarchy , which had been heavily infiltrated by the CIA . [ 12 ]
A primary concern was that Qassim might join Nasser , then the supreme Middle East devil , in using the incomparable energy resources of the Middle East for the domestic .
The issue for Washington was not so much access as control .
At the time and for many years after , Washington was purposely exhausting domestic oil resources in the interests of “ national security , ” meaning security for the profits of Texas oil men , like the failed entrepreneur who now sits in the Oval Office .
But as high - level planner George Kennan had explained well before , we cannot relax our guard when there is any interference with “ protection of our resources ” ( which accidentally happen to be somewhere else ) .
Unquestionably , Iran ’s government merits harsh condemnation , though it has not engaged in worldwide terror , subversion , and aggression , following the US model – which extends to today ’s Iran as well , if ABC news is correct in reporting that the US is supporting Pakistan - based Jundullah , which is carrying out terrorist acts inside Iran . [ 13 ]
The sole act of aggression attributed to Iran is the conquest of two small islands in the Gulf – under Washington ’s close ally the Shah .
In addition to internal repression – heightened , as Iranian dissidents regularly protest , by US militancy — the prospect that Iran might develop nuclear weapons also is deeply troubling .
Though Iran has every right to develop nuclear energy , no one – including the majority of Iranians – wants it to have nuclear weapons .
That would add to the threat to survival posed much more seriously by its near neighbors Pakistan , India , and Israel , all nuclear armed with the blessing of the US , which most of the world regards as the leading threat to world peace , for evident reasons .
Iran rejects US control of the Middle East , challenging fundamental policy doctrine , but it hardly poses a military threat .
On the contrary , it has been the victim of outside powers for years : in recent memory , when the US and Britain overthrew its parliamentary government and installed a brutal tyrant in 1953 , and when the US supported Saddam Hussein ’s murderous invasion , slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Iranians , many with chemical weapons , without the “ international community ” lifting a finger – something that Iranians do not forget as easily as the perpetrators .
And then under severe sanctions as a punishment for disobedience .
Israel regards Iran as a threat .
Israel seeks to dominate the region with no interference , and Iran might be some slight counterbalance , while also supporting domestic forces that do not bend to Israel ’s will .
It may , however , be useful to bear in mind that Hamas has accepted the international consensus on a two - state settlement on the international border , and Hezbollah , along with Iran , has made clear that it would accept any outcome approved by Palestinians , leaving the US and Israel isolated in their traditional rejectionism . [ 14 ]
But Iran is hardly a military threat to Israel .
And whatever threat there might be could be overcome if the US would accept the view of the great majority of its own citizens and of Iranians and permit the Middle East to become a nuclear - weapons free zone , including Iran and Israel , and US forces deployed there .
One may also recall that UN Security Council Resolution 687 of 3 April 1991 , to which Washington appeals when convenient , calls for “ establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery . ”
It is widely recognized that use of military force in Iran would risk blowing up the entire region , with untold consequences beyond .
We know from polls that in the surrounding countries , where the Iranian government is hardly popular —
Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan — nevertheless large majorities prefer even a nuclear - armed Iran to any form of military action against it .
The rhetoric about Iran has escalated to the point where both political parties and practically the whole US press accept it as legitimate and , in fact , honorable , that “ all options are on the table , ” to quote Hillary Clinton and everybody else , possibly even nuclear weapons .
“ All options on the table ” means that Washington threatens war .
The UN Charter outlaws “ the threat or use of force . ”
The United States , which has chosen to become an outlaw state , disregards international laws and norms .
We ’re allowed to threaten anybody we want — and to attack anyone we choose .
Washington ’s feverish new Cold War “ containment ” policy has spread to Europe .
Washington intends to install a “ missile defense system ” in the Czech Republic and Poland , marketed to Europe as a shield against Iranian missiles .
Even if Iran had nuclear weapons and long - range missiles , the chances of its using them to attack Europe are perhaps on a par with the chances of Europe ’s being hit by an asteroid , so perhaps Europe would do as well to invest in an asteroid defense system .
Furthermore , if Iran were to indicate the slightest intention of aiming a missile at Europe or Israel , the country would be vaporized .
Of course , Russian planners are gravely upset by the shield proposal .
We can imagine how the US would respond if a Russian anti-missile system were erected in Canada .
The Russians have good reason to regard an anti-missile system as part of a first - strike weapon against them .
It is generally understood that such a system could never block a first strike , but it could conceivably impede a retaliatory strike .
On all sides , “ missile defense ” is therefore understood to be a first - strike weapon , eliminating a deterrent to attack .
And a small initial installation in Eastern Europe could easily be a base for later expansion .
Even more obviously , the only military function of such a system with regard to Iran , the declared aim , would be to bar an Iranian deterrent to US or Israel aggression .
Not surprisingly , in reaction to the “ missile defense ” plans , Russia has resorted to its own dangerous gestures , including the recent decision to renew long - range patrols by nuclear - capable bombers after a 15 - year hiatus , in one recent case near the US military base on Guam .
These actions reflect Russia ’s anger “ over what it has called American and NATO aggressiveness , including plans for a missile - defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland , analysts said ” ( Andrew Kramer , NYT ) . [ 15 ]
The shield ratchets the threat of war a few notches higher , in the Middle East and elsewhere , with incalculable consequences , and the potential for a terminal nuclear war .
The immediate fear is that by accident or design , Washington ’s war planners or their Israeli surrogate might decide to escalate their Cold War II into a hot one – in this case a real hot war .

Facebook now accounts for 1 % of all net traffic
The function will initially allow anyone who is not registered with the site to search for a specific person .
More controversially , in a month 's time , the feature will also allow people to track down Facebook members via search engines such as Google .
The firm said that the information being revealed is minimal .
Privacy erosion
The public search listing will show the thumbnail picture of a Facebook member from their profile page as well as links allowing people to interact with them .
But , in order to add someone as a friend or send them a message , the person will have to be registered with Facebook .
Users who want to restrict what information is available to the public or opt out of the feature altogether can change their privacy settings .
They have a month to do so .
Despite assurances from Facebook , critics have expressed disappointment at the move .
" This move transforms Facebook from being a social network to being a quasi- White Pages of the web , " commented technology writer Om Malik in his blog GigaOm .
Mr Malik , and others , are concerned about the data trail that people are routinely leaving behind them on social networking and other sites .
There are concerns that personal content will become aggregated for marketing or other purposes .
Security experts have pointed out the dangers of publicising your date of birth - one of the options in a Facebook profile - because of the way it has been traditionally used as a way of identifying bank customers .
Facebook began life as a way of keeping US college students in touch with each other .
Devised by Harvard drop - out Mark Zuckerberg , the site now accounts for 1 % of all net traffic and is the sixth most visited site in the US
The social networking site is thought to have about 39 million members .
Numbers have jumped since the firm removed the need to have an academic e-mail address in September 2006 .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The California Republican
Party is coming under criticism for its decision to hire political operatives who are not American citizens for two top jobs .
In March , the state party hired an Australian , Michael Kamburowski , to be its chief operating officer .
He now lives in America on a so - called green card , but he was ordered deported in 2001 .
That order was eventually lifted , though he is now suing the Department of Homeland Security for $ 41 million over an episode in 2004 where he was jailed for 30 days by immigration authorities , according to court records .
Recently , the party gave the position of research and political technology director to a Canadian , Christopher Matthews .
Mr. Matthews is presently in America on a special work visa for Mexican and Canadian nationals , but California GOP officials applied for and received a coveted " H1B " visa for him , a party spokesman said .
The H1B program is the subject of intense lobbying by the technology industry , which has urged Congress to increase the annual allotment of 65,000 visas for skilled workers .
Last night , one of the men abruptly resigned .
" The California Republican Party Operations Committee held a teleconference tonight with Mike Kamburowski where he offered his resignation , which has been accepted , " the state party chairman , Ronald Nehring , said in a terse statement e-mailed to The New York Sun .
" We thank him for his service . "
Reports in the San Francisco Chronicle about the unusual hires prompted puzzled , angry , and obscene reactions from Republicans , along with some ridicule from Democrats .
" Are you kidding me ?
Is our COO suing America ? " a party vice chairman from Southern California , Jon Fleischman , asked on his blog yesterday .
The flap comes as the Republican Party is riven by a fractious debate over immigration legislation championed by President Bush .
The international hiring has also led to the mocking of California Republicans on national television .
" The Republican Party here in California has obtained a special visa to hire a Canadian to be the state deputy political director , because they say they can't find a qualified American to do the job , " Jay Leno joked on NBC's " Tonight Show " last week .
" Apparently , working for Republicans is one of those icky jobs Americans just do n't want to do . "
A former spokeswoman for the California GOP , Karen Hanretty , called the hiring decisions unfathomable .
" It 's insulting but also embarrassing ... to bring people from the outside who do n't know the difference between Lodi and Lancaster ... and who can't even vote , " she told the Chronicle .
" The Republican grass roots are up in arms about it , " a strategist for the California Democratic Party , Robert Mulholland , said .
" At the very time they 're arguing at the national level against Bush 's immigration proposal , they 've got their own story about bringing in foreigners . "
Mr. Kamburowski worked in the 1990s on projects for an anti-tax group , American for Tax Reform , which is run by a prominent conservative activist , Grover Norquist .
Mr. Nehring also has close ties to Mr. Norquist .
Mr. Kamburowski's last job was working for a real estate broker in the Dominican Republic , the Chronicle reported .
Mr. Nehring initially defended the hires as part of an open - door approach by the party .
Mr. Matthews was chosen because of his political work in Canada , Britain , and San Diego County , a party spokesman , Hector Barajas , said .
While it is believed that employers looking to hire under the H1B visa program must show that no qualified American is willing to take the job , one critic of the program called that " an urban legend . "
" There is no requirement to demonstrate that there 's not qualified Americans " in many cases , a computer programmer from Sacramento , Kim Berry , said .
He said firms that get 15 % of their work force from H1B visa holders are supposed to show that they advertised the jobs , but most do not have to file any proof of a labor shortage .
" I do n't think this should be happening , " Mr. Berry said .
He said he has no objection to admitting people with exceptional or unusual skills , but that many people being admitted under the H1B program were doing " very mundane " work .
In an e-mail to Republican leaders a few days ago , Mr. Kamburowski said the flap was unwarranted .
" When we promote individuals who have displayed great skills but who just happen to hail from another country , we are pegged as hypocrites , " he complained .
" No one ever raised eyebrows when James Carville and other Democrat operatives traveled to Israel , the U.K. , and elsewhere to lend their political skills to foreign political campaigns . "
Thank you Jive Records , MTV , Clear Channel and members of Congress for the opportunity to present my assessment of Britney Spears ’ career .
Which , according to nearly every objective metric , is going completely , totally awesome .
Sure , progress made over the last few months has been uneven -- the number of Star magazine “ not normal ” incidents is still disturbingly high -- but we are hitting most of our major benchmarks .
To wit , not only has there not been one single divorce this year , there also have n’t been any marriages , significantly curtailing the assessed threat of divorce .
In recent months , despite brutal summer heat , we have achieved progress in the underwear - wearing arena .
Shoe wearing in public bathrooms is up 38 % , while T - shirt messages with the phrase “ baby daddy ” are down 46 % .
Hair regrowth objectives are being met , and recent advances in wig and hair extension technology have proved surprisingly effective .
Conducting sensitive negotiations directly in the field , we have been increasingly able to get Ms. Spears to wear just the blond wig instead of switching between the black and blond ones , which has provided a force - multiplier effect on public credibility .
While Ms. Spears ’ weight is not yet at pre-Federline levels , we think we will be able to achieve minimum BMI by next spring .
We have gained the initiative on Ms. Spears ’ McDonald ’s consumption by wresting fast - food eating sanctuaries -- most notably the automatic windows lock on her SUV -- from her control .
I ’d also like to direct you to this chart , showing the 99 billion served meals not consumed by Ms. Spears .

As shown by this other chart , public approval of Ms. Spears is up roughly 1 trillion percent over this time last year , though to properly explain the methodology would require one of those nerdy laser - pointer thingies Al Gore uses , so you ’ll just have to trust me .
The recent performance at the MTV Video Music Awards vastly exceeded initial projections of awesomeness .
Not only did the few dancing moves she executed get her heart rate up to 145 -- prime fat - burning range -- but Ms. Spears did not fall or cry .
Though the time lapse between recorded music and lip sync was off by an average of 2.5 seconds , this was a vast improvement over the House of Blues tour , where the average was actually forever , because she did n’t know the words to her new song .
Though she still has n’t memorized the lyrics -- which , for the record , are “ gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme ” -- she now mouths other words in its place , some of which clearly do involve giving her things .
Tabloid magazine covers are down 22 % in six of the last eight weeks , the lowest level since the New Year ’s Eve party collapse , thanks largely to our Brangelina rumors propaganda .
Other successes include disruption of sex - tape distribution , containment of make - out sessions with female friends to above - the - neck contact , and the quick resolution of the incident in which Ms. Spears attacked a photographer ’s SUV with an umbrella , thanks to our well - executed giant fan maneuver creating a “ Mary Poppins effect ” that the mainstream media has under - covered .
To put this all in perspective , if Ms. Spears were a movie , and that movie was “ The Bourne Ultimatum , ” then Ms. Spears would have grossed $ 210 million .
Improvement of Ms. Spears ’ parenting skills has been substantial , as evidenced by the fact that 100 % of her children are alive .
Neither has been dangled over a railing or placed near a crocodile .
One has already been weaned off soda and is now eating solid candy bars .
Secondhand smoke is 88 % tar - reduced , exactly on target .

We have launched a series of offensive operations , many involving Paris Hilton , aimed at neutralizing senior - level suitors , including Stavros Niarchos , Travis Barker , Brandon Davis , Wilmer Valderrama , Zsa Zsa Gabor ’s husband , three backup dancers and , in a particularly dangerous maneuver in Las Vegas in which Ms. Spears sustained limited tongue damage , a naked Italian man who turned out to be an ice sculpture .
In describing the recommendations I have made , I should note again that I believe Ms. Spears ’ problems will require a long - term effort , like 40 to 45 years .
I suggest we continue doing the same exact thing we have been doing thus far : skimpy outfits , gyrations , mindless techno music with lyrics implying extreme horniness .
By the time Ms. Spears is 65 or 70 , this strategy should work perfectly .
The important thing to remember is that to secure our national interests , we need Britney Spears .
If Al Qaeda knew it had the power to destroy our former teen pop stars , it would feel empowered to mess with Zac Efron ’s Facebook profile , or expose the real identity of Hannah Montana .
Democracy depends on our resolve .

On the periphery of history in antiquity , there was a land known as Kush .
Overshadowed by Egypt , to the north , it was a place of uncharted breadth and depth far up the Nile , a mystery verging on myth .
One thing the Egyptians did know and recorded — Kush had gold .
Scholars have come to learn that there was more to the culture of Kush than was previously suspected .
From deciphered Egyptian documents and modern archaeological research , it is now known that for five centuries in the second millennium B.C. , the kingdom of Kush flourished with the political and military prowess to maintain some control over a wide territory in Africa .
Kush ’s governing success would seem to have been anomalous , or else conventional ideas about statehood rest too narrowly on the experiences of early civilizations like Mesopotamia , Egypt and China .
How could a fairly complex state society exist without a writing system , an extensive bureaucracy or major urban centers , none of which Kush evidently had ?
Archaeologists are now finding some answers — at least intriguing insights — emerging in advance of rising Nile waters behind a new dam in northern Sudan .
Hurried excavations are uncovering ancient settlements , cemeteries and gold - processing centers in regions previously unexplored .
Come July 4th , the city ’s hottest new destination could also be the coolest – a floating swimming pool off the Brooklyn Heights waterfront , complete with gorgeous harbor views and a manmade beach .
The 25 - meter pool , carved into an old barge , will lower its gangways between Piers 4 and 5 near Joralemon Street for a 10 - week trial run this summer .
Sunbathers can also soak up the rays on a one - acre makeshift beach , complete with rentable umbrellas , beach chairs and hamburger and hot dog stands .
“ It ’s going to be the coolest spot in Brooklyn ! ” raved Borough President Marty Markowitz .
The seven - lane “ Floating Pool Lady ” is the brainchild of author Ann Buttenwieser , who was researching a book when she stumbled on references to the “ floating baths ” popular from the early 19th century until about World War II .
She now runs a foundation dedicated to repopulating city waters with floating pools , and this is her first .
The pool will be 4 feet deep and hold up to 175 people .
It will be open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m .
The beach can hold 1,000 people .
Both are preludes to the planned 85 - acre Brooklyn Bridge Park , to be built mostly on the massive piers jutting out of the shoreline from Atlantic Avenue to just north of the Manhattan Bridge .
Critics argue there ’s too much luxury housing planned for the park , and not enough recreational activities – and some say the floating pool is just a temporary ruse to shut them up .
“ A pool that can just be towed away in the middle of the night , that is my concern , ” said Roy Sloane of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Defense Fund .
“ I want a real commitment to recreation – I do n’t want a snow job , or a sand job . ”
The beach will be modeled after the successful Water Taxi Beach in Long Island City , Queens , with one big exception – no alcohol .
“ We made a decision not to try to get a liquor license , ” said Harry Hawk , a partner in the Brooklyn burger joint Schnack , which is operating the hot dog stands .
“ It would be a nice thing to do , but it ’s all about making small steps and seeing how everything works , how many people we attract . ”
From the Borough Hall subway station , it ’s an eight - block walk along Joralemon Street to the pool and beach .
A shuttle is also planned .

First , I downloaded Ned Batchelder 's coverage .py module .
Next , get this script to colorize the coverage output .
I saved it as coverage_color .
py
Put both files somewhere on the python path .
I put it at Python24 \ Lib\site - packages
Now we need to modify the django unit test runner to include coverage .
Head over to your django\test directory and edit the simple .
py file
At the top , add the following line : import os , coverage , coverage_color Scroll down to the run_tests function .
You will see a line like this : unittest .
TextTestRunner(verbosity=verbosity ) .run( suite )
destroy_test_db( old_name , verbosity )
Modify it to read like this : coverage. start ( )
unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=verbosity ) .run( suite )
coverage.stop ()
if not os.path.exists(settings.COVERAGE_DIR ) :
os.makedirs(settings.COVERAGE_DIR )
for module_string in settings .
COVERAGE_MODULES :
module = __import__( module_string , globals ( ) , locals ( ) , [ " " ] )
f , s , m , mf = coverage.analysis( module )
fp = file ( os.path.join(settings .COVERAGE_DIR , module_string + " .html " ) , " wb " )
coverage_color.colorize_file(f , outstream=fp , not_covered=mf )
fp.close ()
coverage.erase ( )
destroy_test_db( old_name , verbosity )
What that does is to record the coverage when running the tests .
It then creates a directory for putting the HTML output , creates the colorized version of the source and dumps it into the output directory .
At the end of everything , it cleans up the coverage data
We now need to configure the COVERAGE_DIR and COVERAGE_MODULES settings .
Open your Django settings.py file and add the following lines : COVERAGE_DIR = " scripts/build / coverage " #
Where the HTML output should go
COVERAGE_MODULES = [ " apps.catalyst.views " , " apps.catalyst.models " ] #
The modules that you want colorized Save and run your Django unit tests .
After running , you will have a html file for each module in the specified directory with the colorized coverage output
One of the things that I like about Django is that it allows you to run unit tests on the code with relative ease .
So I have a bunch of unit tests now , and I was looking to expand it .
For that I first needed to know which parts of the code had good coverage and which parts had no coverage .
I needed to integrate code coverage with the unit testing framework .
In the end , it involved modifying a few files .
This is what I did : Check out the output :
The lines in red were not executed by any of the unit tests .
Looks like there is a function that I 'm not testing at all !

The first test of the new dress code in Indianapolis Public Schools went smoothly Monday as the district began enforcing the rules at its eight year - round schools .
Administrators watched closely as students arrived Monday to ensure they wore white , navy or red collared shirts and dressy slacks or shorts .
But they caught few dress code scofflaws .
" This morning when we came in , we had 20 students that were n't in compliance , " Longfellow Middle School Principal Phyllis Barnes said .
" Then we got it down to nine that were n't completely in compliance . "
For Longfellow students whose parents could n't bring the appropriate attire to school , teachers supplied clothing they had bought with their own money , or the students were placed in a discipline room for the rest of the day .
In most classrooms , though , row after row of students wore the white , red and navy polo shirts .
Superintendent Eugene
White instituted the dress code , which is so strict that many refer to it as a uniform .
Among the many types of clothing banned are jeans , T - shirts , jackets and anything with writing or designs on it .
Shirts must be tucked in , and pants must be worn on the waist .
White argued that the dress code would send a message that IPS had high expectations and help students to focus on their priorities .
He has said this year the district will change how students dress , behave and learn .
The true test will come Sept. 4 , when the district begins enforcing the policy for all of its 36,000 students , including those at its seven high schools .
District officials have lined up donations and support from township poor relief funds for students whose families can't afford the clothes .
Many parents in the district have supported the policy , although students have grumbled .
" I do n't like it , " said Phillip Lewis , 14 , as he sat in social studies class at Longfellow .
" They 're ugly . "
But he and all of his classmates were in the uniform .
At Donnan Middle School , Principal Dexter Suggs said only three or four students had violated the dress code .
A boy stood outside the front office in the morning and changed from a T - shirt into a red polo shirt .
As students walked down the hall , a few were pulled aside for minor violations , and students without belts were given yellow cord to tie up their trousers .
The most serious violations there and at other schools were students wearing black shirts , which are n't permitted , or having small stripes on shirts .
Administrators stood outside the front doors at Marshall Middle School and separated students who violated the dress code .
About 30 were sent to the auditorium and required to call home for other clothes .
Although everyone else obeyed the dress code , many remained unhappy about it .
A boy in a white polo shirt and tan slacks took out his frustration as he walked through the front door and called out , " I ca n't wear this . "
なんか以前のコーディング規約といい、ヤヴァいとこ踏みまくってますが。
ソフトウェアをリリースするときのバージョン番号って、あれは絶対なにかあるね。自分だけで作ってリリースするだけならもちろんご自由にどうぞ、でいいんだけども、こっちが依頼して、こういう番号にしてくれとまで言って、それがただの番号だからね、と何度言っても、ほんとうに通じない。さいとうさんがAさんに以下のようにバージョン規約をお願いしたとしよう。
仕事の区切りや経理の締めなどで、さいとうが契約上正式に受領したものはメジャーバージョンを1つあげ、マイナーバージョンを0にリセットした番号を付ける。 さいとうとAさんの間で、テストやデバッグなどの理由で適宜必要に応じてソースを渡す場合は、現行のメジャーバージョンにマイナーバージョンを1つあげてつける。
メジャー・マイナー間の番号の繰り上がりは無い。番号9の次はそのまま10、11、12、...と続ける。
たったこれだけの事が実に通じない。どう通じないのか挙げてみよう。なにかの法則が見えるかもしれない。
最初の0.1、0.2くらいまではいいが、0.3あたりから付けるのを渋り始める。
0.7、0.8あたりになると「まだ0.8とは言えないんですが」と怪しい言い訳を始める。
0.9を過ぎると0.91とか0.92とかいう番号を使い始める。無用なteenyを足し付けるのも常套手段。
" 0.7 " の番号の後ろに以下の文字を意味無く(ここ重要)付けたがり始める : " alpha、beta " のギリシア文字英語表 記
" RC " 、" Preview " といった、リリースの意味合いを付加したもの
" 0.7 ksaito " みたいに自分や会社の名 前 上記の意味無し文字を付けた後にまた修正が入ると、なぜか(ここがまたわからんのだが)、その後は平気で文字列の後ろにベタに10進数を書く。
" 0.7alpha2 "
" 0.8ksaito4 " 上記の複数桁、teeny、各文字列の使用方法が一環せず、ひとつを採用して何度かバージョンを上げてはまた別の方法を採用する。 " 0.95.4ksaitoRC2 " 番号は、マイナーバージョンの後ろに採用された方法ほど少なくなる。
複数の方法(マイナーバージョンを含めて大体3方法程度)を並行採用して複雑な番号体系になってしまうと、いきなり番号を付けなくなる。 番号無しでリリース
日付で付け る
" 最新( latest ) " などと形容す る
こんなとこですか 。
全然まとまらんが 、
" リリース 1.0 " = 「 やったねオレ !!」という感情 小数表記と桁上がり感 なんかかっこいい
という気持ちが入り混ざってるんでしょうかねえ。私は番号は「仕事/契約上、かならずすぐわからなければならないことが、書類も見ず話も聞かずに一目でわかるように」つけるのが一番助かるので、それで付けるようにしてます。フリーソフトウェアとちょっと考えが違うのは、
大きな仕様変更もあるけど、相手に正式納品した時点でメジャーを上げる。
開発中の場合はマイナーだけをいじる。だから、マイナーが0以外のものは客が文句を言ってもサポート対象にならないので、しない。
ってあたりかな。この何年か、やたらと奇数偶数でやりたがるのが居ますが、客相手に「開発版」も無いだろうよ、ってことで却下。0.9の次が0.10なのは気持ち悪いって人の気持ちはわからないでもないけれど、なにせこっちは仕事ですから、「開発開始から10回以内にリリース」なんて事はあるわけないし、じゃあどう付けようか、などとそんな事で頭を使いたくないのでそのまま連番。
書き出した時はなんかちょっとは結論がつくはずだったんだが、今日はここでおしまい。オチがやったねと小数だけじゃ全然ダメダメだが、なにしろ腹が減った。風呂入って晩飯にしよう。もう午前だけど。
