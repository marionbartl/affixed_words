Picture this .
It ’s the first day of trying to live 100 % environmentally sustainably .
You are in a constant hyper - alert state about what you choose to do .
You bike to work … doing good .
You eat only from sustainable venues … doing great !
And then … catastrophe .
The porcelain gods are angry with you .
This is the story of my hard lesson about living sustainably in America in 2008 , which has since transformed my approach to the sustainable living project .
It came in the form of a toilet .
The World Health Organization recommended in its 2000 report on global water that “ at least 20 liters per person per day from a source within one kilometer of the user ’s home ” be considered the basic measure of rightful access to fresh water [ 1 ] .
Of course , fresh water natural resources vary from region to region .
Because of local resources like watersheds and rivers , the amount of fresh water that an individual can sustainably consume each day is probably significantly higher in Western Pennsylvania than it is in Ethiopia .
Nevertheless , lacking this data and expressing my empathy for water - strained populations across the planet ( 1.1 billion lack appropriate clean water access [ 2 ] ) , I decided that I would accept for myself the measure of 20 liters of water use per day .
One flush of the common public bathroom American Standard toilet at the university ’s bathrooms uses 13.2 L of water .
To my dismay , I did the math in my head … that left 6.8 L of water for the whole rest of the day .
As I washed my hands at the sink , my heart sunk .
I would probably use more than 6.8 L that day .
I had n’t counted on the importance of flushing of a single toilet .
And that was just one flush .
The average person visits the bathroom between six and eight times a day .
That ’s at least four times one ’s sustainable water usage–wasted on only your personal waste !
Using a composting toilet and conserving water when washing myself , my clothes and my dishes , I am typically living well under a 20 liter per day quota .
This is positive : it illustrates how sustainable living is n’t some far off dream , but rather , possible and normal , right now .
( There are also low - flush toilets that , while still using water , only use .9 to 1.6 gallons per flush .
Plus–you just do n’t have to flush each time ) .
On the other hand … putting myself in a situation that means absolutely NO access to such water conserving mechanisms , such as when I go downtown for a few hours a day to work on producing and editing the Sust Enable episodes , spells disaster for a goal of sustainable living .
In Garbage Land , Elizabeth Royte ’s 2005 wake - up call about our national waste systems , she documents the process of municipal sewage collection and treatment … and by doing so , naturally illustrates its absurdity .
She muses about “ … how little sense it makes , when our population is so large and our clean water supply shrinking , to dilute our solids with water and then , at great expense , separate the two ” ( 227 ) .
On May 1 , 2008 , that awareness was driven home .
My dream of proving how easy and carefree living 100 % sustainably as an American could be , was rapidly flushed away .
Then , I began to see how my objective should change .
Now , my goal is to learn how to live 100 % environmentally sustainably .
It is not instantly possible for any American to achieve a 100 % environmentally sustainable lifestyle that is , within itself , self - sustaining .
However , my hope is that it is still possible to innovate that lifestyle –with the right research , applied practices and original transition period .
Sure , I felt silly about being defeated by a toilet .
But now , the victory will be mine .
I will work to put obsolete , yet common systems like these where the belong –down the drain .

The cocaine was hidden in secret compartments Police in the US have uncovered cocaine with a street value of $ 400,000 ( £ 200,000 ) - in a police car .
An undercover officer in Dallas discovered nearly 50lb ( 22kg ) of the drug as he was cleaning the car his squad had been using for two months .
The cocaine was hidden in hydraulically controlled secret compartments .
The vehicle was seized at a crime scene earlier this year .
It was put into police service after a search by the narcotics squad found nothing unusual .
They use multiple switches and relays , and you have to know the sequence in order to make the panel open
Julian Bernal
Dallas police narcotics division " These compartments have recently been more and more popular with drug operations , " Julian Bernal , deputy chief of the narcotics division , told local media .
" Because of the use of hydraulics , you normally do n't have any indication that the car has been altered in any way .
" They use multiple switches and relays , and you have to know the sequence in order to make the panel open , " he told the Dallas Morning News .
Second car
The vehicle was seized in March , after officers responded to a report of a violent altercation and gunshots .
They found $ 34,000 in cash , a set of scales and a small amount of cocaine at the address .
Police impounded the two - door 2004 Infiniti and a second car , which was later sold at auction .
Mr Bernal said police wanted to track down the buyer to check whether any drugs had been hidden in that car .

Cooking With Bacon Grease
I always save the grease from bacon to use for cooking and baking ( even my teenagers and husband will save it ! ) .
Put the fresh hot liquid grease into a glass jar ( a plastic containers will melt ) and place a lid on it and stick it in your fridge .
When frying raw or cooked potatoes put some in the frying pan first , do n't bother adding much more salt because the bacon grease has salt in it already .
When cooking potatoes or vegetables the little bit of bacon grease I put into the water helps the foam from developing and boiling over and once again I do n't add any more salt .
When frying meat that does n't have any " inside " fat such as chicken , deer or rabbit I use the bacon grease to coat the frying pan .
Advertisement
Any time that I make pancakes or waffles , I take my bacon grease out of the fridge and warm the jar in the microwave for 30 seconds or so , just enough to liquify the grease and use it instead of melted butter or margarine .
Anytime that I need melted butter or oil in cooking or baking I ask myself whether the bacon grease would work .
When using it , you do n't need to add any salt to your cooking or baking , it also gives a nice flavor to whatever dish you are preparing .
It took about 15 years but I have finally about a year ago persuaded my sister - in - law that potatoes when boiling do NOT have to boil over each time and make a mess on her stove .
A tsp. of bacon grease ( she uses margarine ) keeps the boiling in the pot only .
Also , my mother - in - law grew up using the pure fat that comes when you cook a chicken in the oven .
You need to freeze this fat .
She would make cookies from it .
I have also done so and you would never know that margarine was not used but rather chicken fat was .

It used to be that everything was fried in bacon grease .
My in - laws used to keep a coffee can with the grease they got from frying bacon every morning .
They boiled potatoes for one meal and fried them for the next , in bacon grease .
I always liked fried potatoes with onion , slow fried in bacon grease .
Of course the eggs were fried in it too .
Some chopped raw bacon can be put in with fresh green beans when cooking .
My in - laws kept the grease in the side of there stove , but I refrigerate mine .

Bacon grease is great for frying potatoes , eggs , flavoring muffins and cornbread , and for greasing pans , so save your bacon grease !

Freezing Bacon Grease
Advertisement
I have used bacon grease for frying the usual - potatoes , eggs and of course , in green beans .
But I also use some when frying onions , mushrooms and green peppers for any reason ( from sausage subs to a side for a steak meal ) .
I go to my market and purchase what is considered " bacon ends " ( irregular slices from the ends of the slab ) at about half price .
I then cut the slices in half .
I fry the entire package which is usually about 2 lb .. all at one time , in batches .
After the bacon has cooled , I wrap the strips in waxed paper and then in a freezer bag .
When I need some bacon for blt 's etc. , it is already done .
The grease is first put into a glass bowl to cool down and then , when cool enough , I put it into a quart size freezer bag and sit it upright in my freezer so it freezes into a " log " .
When I need a tsp. or two , I slice it off and away I go .

A Little Bacon Grease for Dogs
If you 're on a low carb lifestyle , like I am , you 'll probably end up with a lot more bacon grease than you 'll know what to do with .
I keep it in a tin by the stove , like others suggested .
I also drizzle a small amount on my dogs ' food every day .
Just mix it in .
The dogs love it and I 'm sure it gives their bland boring dog food a great bacon flavor .
As well , the oil is great in keeping them regular and keeping their coats shiny .

For Stove Top Popcorn
If you make your own popcorn on the stove , It tastes great popped in bacon grease .
My grandmother always made it like this and we gobbled it up .
Also pour a small amount on your dog 's dry dog food .
It 's very good to keep their coat shiny .

Microsoft and Yahoo are engaged again in buyout talks , Techcrunch is reporting .
We ’ve got multiple sources at both Yahoo and Microsoft telling us that official talks are back on between the two companies .
But we ’re hearing something different than CNET – the talks are about a full buyout again , not a sweetened search - only deal .
Yahoo stock is up sharply , apparently on this report , after languishing at even for most of the day .
As of this writing , Yahoo was trading at nearly $ 23 , a gain of more than 7 percent on the day .
Techcrunch says information on price is " thin , " but is said to be less than the $ 33 on the table when talks broke off .
Adding weight to the report is Microsoft's " no comment , " which , author Michael Arrington says , " actually contains more information than it appears to .
For well over a month , Microsoft has officially been saying they 're no longer interested in Yahoo . "
An online advertising partnership between Yahoo and Google is facing opposition from consumer and civic groups that did not wait for an official deal announcement to voice their discontent .
Top Google executives said they were interested in a partnership with their closest rival but did n’t indicate how close they were to an agreement .
A coalition of 16 civil rights and rural advocacy groups , including the Black Leadership Forum and the League of Rural Voters , urged federal regulators to investigate the potential combination .
The Black Leadership Forum is an umbrella group of 36 civil rights organizations , including the NAACP and the National Urban League .
The groups argued in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnett , head of the Justice Department ’s anti-trust division , that the deal would give Google almost 90 per cent of the search advertising market and strengthen its influence over Internet users ’ access to information .
Separately , the Centre for Digital Democracy ( CDD ) , a consumer advocacy group , said it will push US regulators to block any deal and is already urging European consumer groups to raise concerns with European Union officials .
The EU generally takes a tougher approach on anti-trust , fining Microsoft $ 1.3 billion for anti-competitive conduct earlier this year .
“ You ca n’t allow Google to operate a portion of its leading competitor out of its back pocket , ” said CDD executive director Jeffrey Chester .
Read
While previous attempts to block deals by both the CDD and civil rights organisations have proved unsuccessful , their opposition wo n’t be the only hurdle to a Google - Yahoo partnership .
The Justice Department has already made inquiries about an ad partnership test the two had for two weeks last month .
And , Sen. Herb Kohl , who chairs a subcommittee overseeing anti-trust issues , said last month he would closely scrutinize any permanent deal .
The civil rights groups noted in their letter to Barnett that Google has about 70 pc of the search advertising market , and Yahoo 20 pc .
[ digg - me ] We understand the world through story .
Fables , parables , fairy tales , religious accounts , myths , campaign narratives , history .
These stories contain – beyond characters , plot , and style – truths about how the world works .
The fable of the ant and the grasshopper demonstrates how hard work pays off in the end ; through Little Red Riding Hood , we learn of the dangers of the forest and the world at large ; with the story of Abraham and Isaac , we see demonstrated the radical nature of faith .
The truths in these stories are often subtle things – allowing differing interpretations , competing lessons , contrasting understandings .
But with each telling , the story offers something complete – some understanding about the world and an implied prescription or proscription .
I wrote earlier about making an “ emotional argument ” – about making an argument based on that “ great unconscious mass of our knowledge – the subtle hints , the forgotten information , the half - remembered , the projections based on our past experience ” which we have not “ analyzed and understood . ”
To make this kind of argument is to argue using story , using narrative , using myth .
Every narrative contains an unstated understanding – and this is the emotional argument .
Emotional arguments in a political context often have concrete policy implications – which is why we should pay close attention to the media and to the stories told by politicians .
Drew Westen struck a related theme in writing The Political Brain : The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation in which he tried to explain how the Democratic Party has often failed to use emotional arguments to make their case – instead trying to argue dry policy .
Mr. Westen describes the methods of a winning political candidate :
They tell emotionally compelling stories about who they are and what they believe in … .
They run on who they are and what they genuinely care about , and they know their constituents well enough to know where they share their values and where they do n’t… .
They speak at the level of principled stands .
They provide emotionally compelling examples of the ways they would govern , signature issues that illustrate their principles and foster identification .
What Mr. Westen realizes is that the Democrats have been losing election for the past twenty years ( despite greater popularity for most of their positions ) in a large part because they have disdained the value of story , and have neglected emotional arguments in favor of policy arguments .
What any informed citizen must realize is that the stories we tell each other form the baseline by which we judge the world .
Just as we indoctrinate children by reading them fairy tales , telling them religious stories , and teaching them history , so we too are shaped .
I ’m going to look at one concrete example of how one story has affected recent history , and how a change in emphasis in the story greatly changes it ’s message .
September 11
The popular re-telling of the story of September 11 goes like this :
19 radical Islamic terrorists hijacked four places taking advantage of the freedoms of our society and our own technology , and launched one of the most deadly attacks in American history .
Our national security apparatus was unable to do its job and protect us because it was unnecessarily constrained by laws protecting terrorists and criminals .
These terrorists are only the harbringer of things to come – and there are many others inspired as these men are who want to kill us and destroy our way of life and who are willing to kill themselves in order to do so .
As America is such a vast nation , it is impossible to effectively prevent an attack – there are too many targets , too many people , too many weaknesses .
To protect ourselves , we must go on the offense and attack our enemies abroad ; at home , we must give up certain liberties for public safety and allow the federal government , the police , the FBI , the CIA , and the NSA to protect us .
We need to give the federal government whatever tools are necessary to allow it to protect us – and anyone who opposes this is – in effect , if not in intention – helping the terrorists .
Told this way , the story of September 11 leads us almost inevitably to simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and increasing secrecy and expanding police powers for the government at home .
This story was used by the Republican Congressional leadership to push their position regarding the wiretap bill ; it was used by President George W. Bush in the 2004 election , and was even largely accepted by his Democratic opponents – though they quibbled over particular measures ; this story was invoked in ads against former Senator Max Cleeland the Democrats generally in the 2002 ; it has been used as a justification for policies and as a political weapon .
An informed citizenry
But with a slight shift in emphasis , the story of September 11 has a different message and leads to very different policy prescriptions .
It is a story of how the federal government – powerless to protect itself or the American people – was instead protect by an assorted , diverse , random selection of informed citizens .
A group of radical fundamentalist Muslim terrorists decided to attack four prominent symbols of American economic , military , and political power : the two towers of the World Trade Center , the Pentagon , and either the White House or Capitol Building .
Americans and people around the world watched in shock and with numbed horror as smoke billowed from the Twin Towers and the Pentagon , as people jumped from the buildings , as firefighters and police officers and emergency personnel ran into the buildings , into the fire .
The attack was horrifying and unexpected .
We watched transfixed as dust and ash transformed Lower Manhattan into an image out of some doomsday scenario .
We barely noticed as , over Pennsylvania , a group of passengers on another hijacked plane learned of what had happened in New York and Washington , D.C. Armed with this knowledge , determined to act , they alone on that day foiled a potential mass casualty attack .
There were no U.S. Marshals on the plane ; there were no orders from the CIA or FBI .
Instead , there was a random group of people who , once they were informed of the threat , acted to eliminate it .
It was n’t our vast military that protected us on that day ; it was n’t the federal government , wiretaps , the FBI , the police .
It was a group of informed citizens acting together , in the right place at the right time – and they were able to do what the government could not .
The implication of this history is clear : the federal government cannot be everywhere .
But the best defense of our way of life , of our institutions , of our government , of our people is the American people themselves – properly informed .
Stephen Flynn , who deserves the credit for bringing to my attention this particular idea of the relevance of the story of United 93 wrote in a Foreign Affairs piece :
Americans should celebrate – and ponder – the reality that the legislative and executive centers of the U.S. federal government , whose constitutional duty is to “ provide for the common defense , ” were themselves defended that day by one thing alone : an alert and heroic citizenry .
The story of United 93 also raises a serious question that the 9/11 Commission failed to examine : might the passengers on the other three planes have reacted , too , if they had known the hijackers ’ plans ?
The 9/11 Commission documents that in the years leading up to the attacks on New York and Washington , a number of people inside the U.S. government had collected intelligence suggesting that terrorists were interested in using passenger airliners as weapons .
But because that information was viewed as sensitive , the government never shared it with the public .
What if it had been widely publicized ?
How would the passengers aboard the first three jets have behaved ?
The next president needs to embrace the United 93 story – and consider these questions – in order to reawaken the spirit of community and volunteerism witnessed throughout the nation in the months immediately following 9/11 .
If U.S. history is a guide , people will respond to the call to service .
They only need to be asked .
Suddenly , with a change in emphasis based on the historical record we all know , September 11 is not about terror , but about the power of an informed and active citizenry , about community and volunteerism .
This is the power of story to change how we see the world , to change the terms of the political debate .
What we need today – to change our course as a nation , as a clear majority of Americans want – is a politician who can change the stories that undergird our political conversation , who can transform the story of September 11 from one of terror to one pointing us to the beginnings of a solution , who can explain why we need health care reform by telling the story of America instead of citing statistics .
You all know who I think that is .

Can two alien cultures coexist in one writers room ?
Sci
Fi is entering a brave new world by teaming television writers with video - game designers to create a franchise that is both a television series and a massive multiplayer game on the Internet -- more than that , the fans who play the game will actually help shape the show ’s story arc with their virtual exploits .
“ This is the Holy Grail for us , without a doubt , ” said Dave Howe , president of the Sci Fi Channel , which has teamed with Trion World Network , an on - the - rise gaming company based in Redwood City , Calif .
“ This is groundbreaking , and I do n’t say that lightly . ”
Sci Fi Channel executives are mum about the title of the show and game and their premise , but they do hint that it will be set 80 to 100 years in the future on an Earth that looks very different from today .
The team has summer 2010 as the targeted launch ; more details are expected to be announced in July at Comic - Con International in San Diego .
Massive multiplayer online role - playing games ( a mouthful term shortened to the only slightly better MMORPG ) have become a sensation , especially World of Warcraft , which has 10 million subscribers who pay about $ 15 a month to explore , battle and interact with one another and magical beasties in a land called Azeroth .
The game pulled in $ 1 billion last year , and Legendary Pictures has plans to make a $ 100 - million tie - in film that will hit theaters next year .
Advertisement
Howe said bundling a World of Warcraft player community with a series and an on - line social community is something the Sci Fi Channel has tried to puzzle out for several years .
“ A television show that is on once a week is n’t enough .
The fans today want the experience to go beyond that , ” Howe said .
“ For example , we can tell them that there will be an alien invasion at a certain place in the game , at a certain time , and to be there with all their friends and be ready .
The outcome depends on them .
And then that battle will be part of the universe in the show . ”
It sounds intriguing , but there are significant challenges .
The MMORPG field is already crowded , but no competitor has been able to come anywhere close to Warcraft , which has about 60 % of the marketplace audience .
Also , the new venture might remind fans of the Matrix Online , an MMORPG based in the universe made famous by the Wachowski siblings ’ films .
After much buildup , the game fizzled in the eyes of many fans and highlighted the aesthetic chasm between screenplay entertainment and gaming worlds .
The games find their strongest settings in vast and dangerous worlds where any character can have his or her own quest to follow , while an episodic television drama is far more adept at zeroing in on a handful of individual protagonists .
It ’s the difference between aerial footage of the Normandy invasion and the intimacy of a foxhole monologue .
Advertisement
“ That is absolutely the challenge , and it ’s an exciting one , ” said Adam Stotsky , Sci Fi ’s executive vice president of global brand strategy and market development .
“ Putting these creative people from very different fields in the same room together creates a lot of energy , and there ’s strong curiosity about each other ’s craft . ”
Lars Buttler , co-founder and chief executive of Trion , said that the game will live entirely online and that vistas will open as the television series takes the characters throughout their world .
The game will continue to grow , and “ footage ” of players in battles or other mass gatherings will be incorporated into the series .
The TV show will match the game in its look , with a green - screen hyper reality , much like the film “ 300 , ” Howe said .
Buttler ’s company is partnered with Hewlett Packard and has raised $ 30 million from investors such as Time Warner and General Electric .
He said the focus of the company is to pounce on the concept that discs and downloads are being left behind and that online games are the “ clear future . ”
The virtual world that pulls in fans of the show will also give Buttler and his team hard data about which characters , settings and story lines stir the most interests .
He said that will help the show ’s producers bend their story lines to audience tastes -- a notion that might not sit well with some purists who think a drama should be guided by decisions of art rather than market research .
Clearly , though , the very nature of television programming is in flux , and Howe said fans have an appetite for a new level of participation and tailored entertainments .
Advertisement
“ This will be a state - of - the art game and it will be a strong television show , and watching how those two things interact will be fascinating , ” he said .
Early on , Sci Fi planned to take the existing universe of the channel ’s signature show , the Peabody Award - winning “ Battlestar Galactica , ” and launch a series and gaming community through its familiar mythology .
But Stosky said the decision was made to start from scratch .
“ In ‘ Battlestar , ’ the fans have a sense of who is good and who is not , which side they want to be on and the parameters and definitions of the universe around them , ” Stosky said .
“ We realized that for us to truly do this in a powerful way , it would be best to start over with many of those questions still hanging . ”

Note to the religious right : auto - replace is not your friend
Auto - correct can be a very helpful feature of any word - processing program .
But when conservatives use it , they run the risk of embarrassing themselves .
Some far - right sites that subscribe to the Associated Press feed , for example , will use auto - correct to change “ Democratic Party ” to “ Democrat Party . ”
This , of course , is because they have the temperament of children .
But the American Family Association ’s OneNewsNow website takes the phenomenon one step further with its AP articles .
The far - right fundamentalist group replaces the word “ gay ” in the articles with the word “ homosexual . ”
I ’m not entirely sure why , but it seems to make the AFA happy .
The group is , after all , pretty far out there .
The problem , of course , is that “ gay ” does not always mean what the AFA wants it to mean .
My friend Kyle reported this morning that sprinter Tyson Gay won the 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials over the weekend .
The AFA ran the story , but only after the auto - correct had “ fixed ” the article .
That means — you guessed it — the track star was renamed “ Tyson Homosexual . ”
The headline on the piece read , “ Homosexual eases into 100 final at Olympic trials . ”
Readers learned :
Tyson Homosexual easily won his semifinal for the 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials and seemed to save something for the final later Sunday .
His wind - aided 9.85 seconds was a fairly cut - and - dry performance compared to what happened a day earlier .
On Saturday , Homosexual misjudged the finish in his opening heat and had to scramble to finish fourth , then in his quarterfinal a couple of hours later , ran 9.77 to break the American record that had stood since 1999 . [ … ]
Homosexual did n’t get off to a particularly strong start in the first semifinal , but by the halfway mark he had established a comfortable lead .
He slowed somewhat over the final 10 meters - nothing like the way - too - soon complete shutdown that almost cost him Saturday .
Asked how he felt , Homosexual said : “ A little fatigued . ”
Now , the AFA has since changed the article back to the way it was originally written by the AP reporter , but do n’t worry , Kyle got the screen - grab before the AFA edited the piece back .
There ’s just something helpful about starting a Monday morning on a hilarious note .

My friend Leslie Zukor has been running a service project for a few years now where she donates freethought books to prisoners .
It ’s to balance out the amount of Christian literature that seems to be prevalent in prisons everywhere .
The prisoners who request and / or receive the freethought books are usually very excited and thankful .
One of them recently sent Leslie a letter , which she shared with me .
The transcribed letter ( with slight grammar fixes ) is below .
Take note of the amusing middle paragraph :
Dear Leslie , I ca n’t tell you how thrilled I was to receive your kind package containing a number of freethought books .
It is also important for you to know how extremely valuable your service is to people in my situation , for currently you represent the only source of distribution for such material .
And for that you deserve much praise .
You most certainly have found a gaping niche and are filling it admirably .
As a point of amusement you will no doubt be interested to learn that when I was called to the mail - room to take delivery of the above , the officer , upon examining some of the titles , immediately sought the chaplain ’s opinion .
And , although the look of disdain on his face spoke volumes , he nevertheless was obligated to allow me possession of the entire parcel .
He now ignores me in the hallways !
I sincerely hope that you will continue to provide assistance to folks such as myself for many years to come , for I am keenly aware of its significance .
Therefore , here ’s wishing you much further success .
And again , thank you for your kindness , generosity , and prompt attention to my letter .
Be well !
Ben
So , to recap :
If you ’re a prisoner , the officer is fine with you .
If you ’re a prisoner who reads Richard Dawkins , then the officer gets worried .
That makes sense …
By the way , if you want support Leslie , you can donate books , donate funds , or request books at her website .

Mounting questions about Colombian hostage operation
By Bill Van Auken
7 July 2008
As right - wing politicians on three continents basked in the reflected glory of an ostensibly brilliant July 2 rescue of hostages held by Colombia ’s FARC ( Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia ) guerrillas , doubts have surfaced as to the real character of this operation .
The freeing of Ingrid Betancourt , the French - Colombian citizen and former presidential candidate , three US military “ contractors ” employed by the Northrop Grumman corporation and 11 other hostages has been exploited to refurbish the Bush administration ’s discredited Latin American policy , to make a hero out of Alvaro Uribe , the Colombian president implicated in drug trafficking and paramilitary massacres , and to boost the sagging popularity of France ’s right - wing president , Nicolas Sarkozy .
Even Senator John McCain , the Republican Party ’s presumptive presidential nominee , who staged a visit to Colombia ( a fortuitous coincidence ? ) the day before the hostage release , got in on the act .
While in Colombia , he received a briefing from Uribe , enabling him to associate himself with the upcoming operation .
There is virtually nothing to distinguish McCain from his Democratic opponent on the question of Colombia .
Senator Barack Obama issued his own statement hailing the operation , calling the FARC a “ terrorist organization ” and affirming his support for the Colombian government “ making no concessions ” to the guerrillas .
Nonetheless , if Uribe could do any favors politically , it would no doubt be to the Republicans , after six years as the Bush administration ’s closest ally in Latin America .
What all of these figures sought to exploit was the undoubted public sympathy for Betancourt , a mother of two held in the jungle for six years , and the other hostages .
In addition , they cast the Colombian operation as a brilliant intelligence coup — described by some as straight out of a Hollywood movie — in the “ global war on terror . ”
Of course the sympathy generated by government officials and the mass media for Betancourt , not just in Colombia , but in the US , France and throughout Europe , does not extend to many others who have been kidnapped and imprisoned under worse conditions .
There is , after all , another place in the Americas where hundreds have been held prisoner for six years , facing torture and brutality after being abducted from their homes .
These prisoners , held without charges , have little chance of being similarly rescued , as they are imprisoned by the US military in Guantánamo Bay .
Nor , it should be noted , have the many hundreds of political prisoners languishing in Colombian jails or abducted by the right - wing paramilitary organizations that are intimately tied to the government and the armed forces , received any similar attention .
Their social backgrounds are generally quite dissimilar from that of the French - educated Ingrid Betancourt , the daughter of a former government minister and product of the Colombian oligarchy .
As for the operation itself , the comparison to Hollywood may be unintentionally revealing .
According to the official story from the Colombian military , intelligence agents succeeded in infiltrating the guerrilla movement and “ duping ” FARC leaders into believing that elite commandos disguised in Che Guevara T - shirts and military pilots were aid workers , guerrillas and journalists involved in a plan by FARC itself to transfer the hostages by helicopter to another location .
Praise for the operation included the repeated observation that “ not a shot was fired . ”
That veteran guerrillas would simply turn over the FARC ’s most valuable hostages to unknown individuals arriving in a helicopter strains credulity .
What makes this account particularly suspect , however , is the entire record of the Colombian military , which hardly calls to mind operations in which “ not a shot is fired . ”
In fact , it has carried out one of the bloodiest campaigns in the hemisphere over the course of decades , fueled over the last 10 years by some $ 5.4 billion in US military aid .
Between 2002 and 2007 , human rights groups documented the extrajudicial killing of nearly 1,000 civilians by the country ’s military , as well as another 3,500 murders and disappearances carried out by the right - wing paramilitary units — routinely operating with military support .
It was in December 2002 that the Colombian government concluded a ceasefire agreement with the paramilitaries , essentially exonerating them for their crimes , which accounted for the bulk of civilian casualties in the country ’s protracted civil war .
Nonetheless , the assassinations and massacres have continued .
During the same period , the guerrillas — both the FARC and a smaller organization , the ELN — with whom no ceasefire had been concluded , were responsible for barely half as many civilian deaths as the paramilitaries .
Moreover , the Uribe government has shown no interest in effecting a peaceful release of the hostages in the past .
Indeed , the last attempt by French negotiators to secure the release of Betancourt and others was disrupted in March , when the Colombian military staged a cross - border raid on a FARC camp in Ecuador , killing the guerrillas ’ chief negotiator Raul Reyes , who was apparently targeted in order to block any agreement .
Betancourt ’s family repeatedly expressed fears that Uribe ’s actions would result in her death .
It is this record that lends credibility to accounts circulating in Europe casting doubt on the heroic tale told in Bogota .
Citing a source “ close to the events , ” Swiss public radio reported that the hostages ’ freedom had been bought with a $ 20 million ransom , and that the “ whole operation afterwards was a set - up . ”
The political purpose of staging such a performance is clear .
Both the Uribe government and the Bush administration have classified FARC as a “ terrorist organization ” and have insisted that they reject any negotiations with such groups .
According to the report from Switzerland — whose government had together with France and Spain been involved in the hostage negotiations — Washington played the leading role in organizing the deal .
The report added that the arrangement was made by using the captured wife of one of the guerrilla leaders as a go - between .
According to this account , she was sent back to the FARC camp and persuaded him to change his allegiance for money .
In France , where Betancourt arrived Friday to a hero ’s welcome , Dominique Moisi , one of the country ’s top foreign policy experts , appeared to support this version of events .
He told French state television that it was “ probable ” that money had secured the cooperation of FARC leaders .
“ They were bought in order to turn them around , like Mafia chiefs , ” he said .
Meanwhile , Mediaparte , the French news web site founded by the former chief editor of Le Monde and other journalists , reported that the rescue was “ not an achievement of the Colombian military , but due to the surrender of a group of the FARC members ” following “ direct negotiations by the Colombian secret services with the guerrilla group that held Betancourt captive . ”
Citing Colombian sources , it reported that Uribe had told a group last May that a surrender of those holding the hostages was being negotiated .
Mediaparte added that the Sarkozy government agreed to offer the ex-guerrillas sanctuary in France after their surrender .
The government has access to large amounts of money supplied by Washington to make payoffs to guerrillas for changing sides .
This was evident in the slaying last March of FARC leader Ivan Rios , whose bodyguard killed him and then presented his severed right hand to authorities to collect a $ 2.5 million US bounty .
Another version , from sources close to the FARC leadership , charged that the Colombian government operation was staged as the FARC itself had reached an agreement with European negotiators and was preparing to release the hostages , either this weekend or next .
The purpose of the intervention , according to this account , was to turn the release into a public relations coup for the government , rather than boosting the image of the FARC .
Whatever the precise details of the strange “ rescue operation , ” the release of Betancourt , the US mercenaries and the others , with Uribe and his American allies taking credit , is another indication of the severe crisis of the FARC .
With its political roots in Colombia ’s Communist Party , the FARC emerged out of the bitter civil war that bled the country from 1948 onward , a period known as “ La Violencia ” which saw the largest armed struggle over land in the Western Hemisphere since the Mexican revolution .
Formed in 1964 , the FARC has always based itself on the Stalinist perspective of subordinating the struggles of the workers and peasants to the “ progressive ” wing of the national bourgeoisie .
It used its armed actions in the countryside — which at its height in the 1990s brought it into control over 40 percent of Colombia ’s territory — as a means of pressuring the government .
Its perspective over the recent period has been to force the government into negotiations , allowing it to follow the well - worn path of other Latin American guerrilla groups by turning itself into a bourgeois political party .
With little support among Colombia ’s urban workers , the FARC has rested on a layer of the peasantry , increasingly dependent upon taxes collected from coca cultivators in return for protection .
Like the bourgeois state , the military and the paramilitary organizations , it has been corrupted by the immense revenues generated by the drug- producing and trafficking industry .
The blows suffered by the FARC over the past period have done nothing to stem the flow of cocaine .
According to the UN ’s World Drug Report , coca cultivation in Colombia rose by 27 percent last year .
The defeat of the guerrilla group would merely mean that other state and private actors would collect the revenues currently underwriting their operations .
Incapable of providing any genuine political or social alternative to the rule of Colombia ’s oligarchy , the guerrilla movement has increasingly been cast by the political establishment as the source , rather than a symptom , of the country ’s protracted crisis and bloodletting .
In the apparent absence of any progressive way out of the impasse , Uribe has gained popular support on the basis of a promise to impose order with a strong hand .
No doubt , the supposed success of the military in this operation will be utilized by Uribe to consolidate his presidential dictatorship and distract from the multiple political crises confronting his government .
The president and his closest supporters are deeply implicated in the so - called parapolitica scandal , which has exposed ties between them and the rightist paramilitary organizations responsible for massacres and thousands of killings .
At least 33 members of Colombia ’s Congress are currently under arrest and some 60 more under investigation — nearly all of them Uribe ’s backers — for such connections .
The president himself has been implicated in one of the most savage massacres of the 1990s .
Moreover , the release of the hostages comes little more than a week after the country ’s high court found that the Colombian president secured a constitutional amendment allowing him to succeed himself in 2006 by bribing members of Congress .
The ruling , which resulted in the sentencing of one legislator , has called into question the legitimacy of Uribe ’s second term .
In response , the Colombian president has called for another vote , essentially counting on a popular referendum to overrule a constitutional decision .
There are growing suspicions that he will try to parlay this maneuver into a third term .
Dem congressman calls on McClellan to testify about book 's revelations Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 28 , 2008

Print This Email This Already getting grief from his former White House colleagues , former Bush spokesman Scott McClellan is now being asked to testify before Congress about the revelations contained in his scathing new memoir .
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , a key Bush antagonist and member of the House Judiciary Committee , says McClellan needs to tell Congress the full story about potential White House conspiring around the leak of a CIA officer 's name and propaganda efforts that preceded the invasion of Iraq .
Wexler released a statement Wednesday calling for McClellan to tesitfy under oath before the Judiciary committee .
 The admissions made by Scott McClellan in his new book are earth - shattering and allege facts to establish that Karl Rove and Scooter Libby  and possibly Vice President Cheney - conspired to obstruct justice by lying about their role in the Plame Wilson matter and that the Bush Administration deliberately lied to the American people in order to take us to war in Iraq , " Wexler said .
" Scott McClellan must now appear before the House Judiciary Committee under oath to tell Congress and the American people how President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , and White House officials deliberately orchestrated a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people .
 The allegations by this former top White House aide  that Rove and Libby deliberately coordinated their stories in order to obstruct justice in the Plame case , that the President deliberately disregarded contradictory evidence related to Iraq , should outrage every American and Congress must respond by initiating immediate aggressive oversight starting with an appearance by McClellan before the House Judiciary Committee , " he continued .
" Any continued obstruction by this Administration to prevent White House officials from appearing before Congress cannot be tolerated by this Congress in the face of these shocking revelations . 
You have to watch this video .
It shows Tom Cruise , with all the wide - eyed fervor that he brings to the promotion of a movie , making the argument for Scientology , the bizarre 20th - century religion .
Making the argument is an understatement .
The Hollywood actor , star of movies such as Mission Impossible , is a complete fanatic .
" When you 're a Scientologist , and you drive by an accident , you know you have to do something about it , because you know you 're the only one who can really help ...
We are the way to happiness .
We can bring peace and unite cultures . "
There 's much much more .
Let me put it this way : if Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah 's couch was an 8 on the scale of scary , this is a 10 .
[ There was a video here ]
This video's been passed around privately by reporters and writers investigating Cruise 's ties with Scientology .
Most reporters have been wary of taking on the Scientologists , because they have a history of both litigation , and the harassment of critics .
The publication of Andrew Morton 's biography of Tom Cruise , which claims he is the second most powerful person in the cult , has seems to have opened the floodgates .
Several indoctrination videos were available on Google Video , on Sunday , and showcased on Gawker , before being removed by the person who had originally posted them .
Yesterday , for a few hours , the clip of Tom Cruise discussing his beliefs as a Scientologist appeared on Youtube , and was republished by Radar and Defamer .
That video is no longer available , most likely after the Church of Scientology sent in a copyright infringement notice .
Gawker is now hosting a copy of the video ; it 's newsworthy ; and we will not be removing it .
Returning from a vacation to Germany in February , freelance journalist Bill Hogan was selected for additional screening by customs officials at Dulles International Airport outside Washington .
Agents searched his luggage , he said , " then they told me that they were impounding my laptop . "
Shaken by the encounter , Hogan examined his bags and found the agents had also inspected the memory card from his camera .
" It was fortunate that I did n't use [ the laptop ] for work , " he said , " or I would have had to call up all my sources and tell them that the government had just seized their information . "
When customs offered to return the computer nearly two weeks later , Hogan had it shipped to his lawyer .
How common Hogan 's experience is remains unclear .
But an April ruling by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees Customs and Border Protection , does have full authority to search any electronic devices without suspicion in the same way that it can inspect briefcases .
Now , businesses and other organizations are pushing back , Congress is investigating , and lawsuits have been filed challenging how the program selects travelers for inspection .
The ninth circuit ruling was the result of more than 20 lawsuits involving electronics seized from travelers who were nearly all of Muslim , Middle Eastern , or South Asian descent .
Citing the lawsuits , customs officials decline to say how many computers , storage drives , cellphones , and BlackBerrys they have confiscated or what happens to them afterward .
Officials declined to testify at a recent Senate hearing , although they wrote in a prepared statement that officers " have the responsibility to check items such as laptops and other personal electronic devices to ensure that any item brought into the country complies with applicable law and is not a threat to the American public . "
But congressional investigators say that copies of drives are sometimes made , meaning customs could be duplicating corporate secrets , legal and financial data , personal E-mails and photographs , along with stored passwords for accounts with companies ranging from Netflix to Bank of America .
The practice of storing and duplicating material might be something that both opponents and supporters of seizure could agree to regulate , says Kansas Republican Sen.
Sam Brownback , an otherwise staunch supporter of customs ' authority .
Larry Cunningham , an assistant district attorney from New York , told the hearing : " I am aware of no authority that would permit the government , without probable cause to believe it contains contraband , to keep a person 's laptop or to copy the contents of its files . "
Whatever the case , the controversial practice has prompted some businesses to change their policies about traveling with corporate information .
Many now require employees to access data remotely to avoid confiscations .
" [ Seizure ] immediately deprives an executive or company of the very data — and revenue — a business trip was intended to create , " says Susan Gurley , head of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives , which is lobbying for greater transparency and government oversight of the confiscations .
" As a businessperson returning to the U.S. , you may find yourself effectively locked out of your electronic office indefinitely . "
Indeed , while Hogan 's computer was returned within two weeks , others say they have had theirs held for months .
Customs insists that terrorism and child pornography are sufficient justification for electronics searches .
And even civil libertarians agree it makes sense for customs to search luggage , which could pose immediate dangers to aircraft and passengers .
But , says Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , " customs officials do not go through briefcases to review and copy paper business records or personal diaries , which is apparently what they are now doing in digital form .
These pda's do n't have bombs in them . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve on Friday pushed ahead with a proposal to stop abuses by credit card issuers , a day after two other key bank regulatory agencies proposed effectively the same package of new rules .
The move comes at a time when the $ 2 trillion industry has come under increasing scrutiny .
" The proposed rules are intended to establish a new baseline for fairness in how credit card plans operate , " said Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , which regulates many U.S. banks .
" Consumers relying on credit cards should be better able to predict how their decisions and actions will affect their costs . "
Among other things , the plan would allow consumers more time to pay monthly bills .
It would also prevent companies from applying interest - rate increases retroactively to pre-existing balances .
And it would ban " double cycle billing , " a practice that computes finance charges based on previous billing cycles .
A top financial services lobbyist blasted the plan .
" The Federal Reserve 's proposal is an unprecedented regulatory intrusion into marketplace pricing and product offerings , " said Edward Yingling , chief executive of the American Bankers Association .
On Thursday , the Office of Thrift Supervision , responsible for overseeing the nation 's savings and loans , and the National Credit Union Administration , approved proposed rules the Fed " substantively similar . "
The reforms will be subject to public comment for 75 days .
The agencies expect to finalize any new regulatory changes by the end of the year .
Regulators under pressure to act
Under the new scheme , companies that issue credit cards would be required to outline the factors that determine which of several advertised interest rates and credit limits a customer will receive .
In addition , the rules would prevent companies from charging fees to open an account and receive credit .
Regulators , most notably the Fed , have been under pressure from politicians to do a better job of overseeing the banking industry in general or risk losing some of their regulatory powers .
At the same time , lawmakers have pushed to make the credit card industry more consumer friendly at a time when Americans struggle with debt and increasingly rely on their credit cards to make ends meet .
U.S. consumers were saddled with $ 850 billion in credit card debt as of the end of last year , according to the Consumer Federation of America .
Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , joined by a group of fellow Democratic lawmakers , unveiled legislation on Wednesday that incorporated some of those same regulatory proposals and added some new ones such as preventing issuers from charging customers a fee to pay a credit card bill by phone .
Earlier this year , Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , introduced a legislative plan dubbed the Credit Cardholders ' Bill of Rights , which garnered attention at a House hearing last month .
Industry says rules could choke off credit
Card industry representatives have been quick to warn that the passage of new legislation or additional regulation could hurt all credit card carriers .
" We are deeply concerned that these rules will result in less competition , higher consumer prices , fewer consumer choices , and reduced consumer access to credit cards , " said Yingling , the banking industry advocate .
In short , everyday consumers will bear the real cost of these proposals .
Americans with shabby credit histories , for example , may no longer have similar access to credit .
At the same time , consumers with good credit could soon find themselves facing higher interest rates .
In the early 1980s , before issuers relied on credit scores in vetting customers , interest rates hovered around 18 % and everyone paid an annual fee .
Nowadays consumers pay an average interest rate of just over 13 % , and three quarters of card issuers do not charge an annual fee , according to the bankers group .
The consumer federation and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said they were encouraged by the joint proposal , but added that regulators did not address other problems like unwarranted interest rate changes and aggressive marketing to college students .
" It 's a good first step in addressing a number of abusive practices , " said Travis Plunkett , legislative director at the consumer federation .
" However , it will still be necessary for Congress to step in because the proposal only deals with a few of the problems that have been identified . "
At the same time , legislators could have quite a fight on their hands .
Previous efforts trying to reform the industry have largely failed , while recent legislative proposals have found little support among GOP lawmakers .
Oh , this will warm your heart : Fox News has dubbed Michelle Obama Barack 's " Baby Mama . "
See , because " baby mama " is a term originating in the African American community used to delineate a status of romantic partner , somewhere between common - law spouse and " boo , " that one attains by fathering or giving birth to a child .
Over the years , as the term — which rhymes not only with " Obama " but more common terms like " drama " and " Cappadonna " — grew more common , it was embraced and co-opted by the Caucasian community to the point that it un-controversially became the name of a Tina Fey movie with two white leads and even , I believe , once used by my father as a term of endearment for my mother , who incidentally , popped out her firstborn ( me ) three years after exchanging vows with him .
All of which is to say : is n't this great ?
It still is n't fully acceptable for even the most " down " white dudes to refer to their black friends as " My N — — " — and , let 's be honest , " my nizzle " sounds really stupid — but thanks to Fox News it 's now okay for white folks to refer to such a fearsomely accomplished , disciplined black woman as Michelle Obama as Barack 's " baby mama . "
Does n't she seem more approachable already ?
Anyway , that and China finally says something to Darfur about their genocide problem , another " consummate Washington insider " finds himself on the outs , Nigerian pirates and why I called Geraldine Ferraro " sweetie " with Megan after the jump .

MOE : Okay sooooo … you know how I always say I genetically do n't have the capacity to get " offended " ?
Uh , well .
Ummmmm…holy shit .
And here I thought we could maybe get in some real news today , like about how Mugabe is sort of doing on a mass scale with Zimbabweans what that weird New Jersey couple did with their foster kids and getting a few fat while leaving the less - special ones to starve …
MOE : Or how pirates control the seas off Nigeria or how this Genocide Olympics stuff has finally put pressure on China to ask the Sudanese government to uh " push forward the peacekeeping mission and political process in a balanced manner " or the great Korean Beef Beef .
MEGAN : I was just about to send you the Michelle Obama thing , too .
Query : what other potential first lady has been referred to not as " the wife and the mother of his children " but as a candidate 's " baby mama ? "
Because I 'm going to say none .
I guess it 's apparently ok , though , because she 's , like , black and that 's , like , what " they " call each other , right ?
No subtext there , let 's just make sure to remind everyone that the Obamas are n't white .
MOE : Unrelated : The Boy Scout leader they are interviewing on Fox re some natural disaster is kind of , you know , foxy .
But why the open shirt , kid ?
MOE : Okay , back to my belle though .
Whoever approved that needs to be fired STAT .
MEGAN : Yeah , I 'm gonna guess : not .
Though E.D.
Hill did get the ax for the terrorist fist bump thingie , even though she was , apparently , quoting an overblown story from the crazy right - wing site Human Events which I 'm not going to link to .
MOE : One thing that actually really surprises me about all this too is that yesterday I was watching Fox , and O'Reilly had on that guy who made " Hillary : The Movie " — he 's made a new movie about the Obamas ! — and O'Reilly was all , " Oh just shut up about Michelle 's antiamericanism already , she 's explained it , that was back in February , she seems like a nice person , why beat up on the guy 's wife , " etc. etc .
MOE : And dude , that was O'Reilly .
MEGAN : Yeah , for real .
But the HTM guy is , like , a total wack job , did I tell you I met him ?
MOE : Incidentally he also told the guy to stop kvetching about how the campaign had n't released Obama 's college thesis on nuclear disarmament .
" We all write boneheaded stuff in college , get a life . "
MEGAN : Oh , and you know why they had to rush " production " of the movie ?
So they can advertise it without FEC intervention .
MOE : I still have n't watched it but I found it the other day whilst looking for important documents .
MEGAN : I 'm just sad no one is trying to read my college thesis .
It was like a solid 6 months of my life and in the whole universe , only 4 people read it .
MEGAN : Oh , well , totally get drunk and watch the movie , it 's only worth watching altered .
MOE : Seriously dude , though , WHAT THE FUCK MEGAN .
MOE : Oh by the way , readers who were offended by my addressing Geraldine Ferraro " sweetie " in my Hirshman rebuttal ; the original line was : " Sweetie , John McCain left his first wife in the wake of a debilitating car accident and called his second a " cunt " in front of reporters .
" That was a sort of rhetorical device , meant to contrast " sweetie " ( representing the Obama 's most noted offense against womanity ) with " cunt " ( representing McCain's . )
It did n't work out so well in the edit , because apparently you are n't allowed to use the word " cunt " in the Washington Post , though " sweetie " is apparently passable .
MEGAN : Also , Jesus Christ , people , a little satire ?
MEGAN : Oh , wait , I forgot , we 're all supposed to be humorless and opinion - free .
This is a news outlet !
MOE :
This is getting me off - topic , but there is a ( very very bronze ) Hillary supporter making the rounds on Fox saying Hillary supporters are choosing McCain because they can't tolerate a " less experienced " candidate than Hillary , which I think is a crock of shit , but it was probably smart that they reverse their " sexism " argument in time for Fox to employ the term " Baby Mama . "
Unless Tina
Fey told them it was okay ?

MEGAN : Yeah , I saw her yesterday !
She said she 'd really like to see Clinton on McCain 's ticket , so , frankly , I do n't really think she 's concerned with " feminist " issues per se .
MOE : Hot new phrase alert !
" Consummate political insider " … spotted in today 's Times and Jim Hoagland 's column … three makes a trend !
As I am the consummate idiot savante regarding the Beltway corporate interest groupies , I am wondering if you 'll explain to me whether this Jim Johnson thing is a big deal or like if the McCain thing is that big a deal and whether there is anyone in Washington who is going to survive a campaign that banishes anyone who takes money from the corporations who actually make it or whether we are going to be left with Kucinich as a running mate .
MOE : And speaking of Kucinich , who was on O'Reilly last night as well , WHERE DID HIS WIFE GO .
I miss Elizabeth .
MEGAN : I think she 's probably somewhere working for peace .
9:30 AM
MEGAN : I mean , I do n't think the rich stuff about Jim Johnson is a huge deal .
I think the stuff about him getting a special loan from Countryside is n't really good .
MEGAN : But I think the bigger problem is how to integrate what has essentially been an " outsider " campaign with the Democratic party machine .
MEGAN : And the people that go with it , some of whom are sketchy .
It 's not like all lobbyists are Republican , it 's not even like all corporate lobbyists are Republican or all shady lobbyists are Republican .
There 's plenty of shadiness in both parties .
MOE : Okay , we gotta return to Michelle .
I 'm cynical , sure , but I find this shit actually chilling .
But also : it is sort of fascinating .
There is so little range when it comes to public stereotypes of black women .
Like , part of them are trying to cast her as a cold imperious vengeful anti-American bitch , and the rest are just like " no man , just call her BABY MAMA . "
Think of all the illicit sex they must have had that summer with all the Spike Lee movies .
I hear they had chocolate ice cream on their first date .
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S CODE FOR ????
MEGAN : mmmm , chocolate ice cream
MEGAN : Oh , wait , right , we were talking about race .
MEGAN : I actually sort of beat MoDo to the punch yesterday , after I 'd read a bunch of really good bloggy stuff about it .
MEGAN : Like , where are all the women who were crying sexism two weeks ago ?
Because all the stuff I 've seen about baby mama and Michelle Obama — until fucking Maureen Dowd — in the MSM has been written by men .
MEGAN : It seems like most of them are still crying over Clinton even as the right wingers are re-writing their 1992 attacks about Clinton 's fitness to be First Lady because of her baking skills and ( gasp ) having a career to suit Michelle , with a lovely little side of racial overtones .
From TMZ.com :
Sources say last night an Irvine police car was waved down by people near the place Rampage was staying who said he was acting weird .
This , of course , following the insane chase the day before in which the UFC fighter hit several cars in his monster truck and was arrested at gunpoint .
We 're told Irvine cops saw Rampage , deemed him a danger to himself and others , and took him to a hospital for observation .
Cops wo n't officially confirm if it's a psychiatric hold .
BloodyElbow.com is trying to confirm if this is true or not .
Stay tuned .
Props to the folks in the FanPosts for being on top of this .
Mike Chiapetta has the scoop :
Former UFC light - heavyweight champion Quinton " Rampage " Jackson was admitted to a hospital on Wednesday for a mental health evaluation following an incident in which he was exhibiting " unusual behavior , " Irvine , Calif. , police Lt. Rick Handfield told NBCSports.com on Thursday .
This incident came on the heels of Tuesday 's arrest following a car chase in Costa Mesa , Calif .
Handfield said that a passing officer was flagged down on a city street at about 4:30 pm on Wednesday , and one of the people at the residence who was an acquaintance or relative of his told police they were " concerned about some alarming statements and unusual behavior he was exhibiting . "
The responding officer spoke to Jackson , who was cooperative , and officers detained him and transported him to a local hospital for a mental evaluation .
Handfield said Jackson is not being charged with any crime , and was considered a " mental health detainment . "
Jackson 's present status is unclear , as California 's HIPAA laws guarding medical privacy preclude police from giving any further information .
UFC did not immediately return calls for comment .
[ UPDATE ] by Nick Thomas - Dana
White 's first interview since the Rampage arrest ( KLOS in L.A. ) ( 7/16 ) :
[ UPDATE ] by Michael Rome - Dave Melter has the details :
According to Lt. Rick Handfield of the Irvine , CA , police department , an officer was pulled over while driving past Jackson 's house in the city , and a friend of Jackson 's asked for help .
He told the officer he was worried about the fighter 's behavior .
The officer made contact with Jackson , evaluated him , and asked him to come to the hospital for observation .
Jackson was completely cooperative with the officer at all times .
Due to HIPPA laws , the department is not allowed to release any information about what the evaluation entailed or discovered .
From what I can tell , a friend was worried about his behavior and wanted police to check his mental health .
It 's a far cry from an arrest .
When Joe Lieberman agreed to headline John Hagee ’s Christians United For Israel Washington Summit , it was some months ago , before the political controversy over Hagee ’s radical worldview , and before even John McCain decided Hagee is a little too nutty to be associated with .
I thought it was at least possible that Lieberman , citing his loyalty to McCain , would back out of the event .
No such luck .
Mr. Lieberman was greeted by a boisterous standing ovation in a room decked out with United States and Israeli flags .
“ I am your brother Joseph , ” he said .
Asserting that Mr. Hagee had worked hard to fight anti-Semitism , Mr. Lieberman said : “ I do n’t agree with everything Pastor Hagee has said , and I can safely say that the pastor does n’t agree with everything that I ’ve said .
But there ’s so much more than that that we agree on . ”
Mr. Lieberman added , “ I will tell you tonight the bond that I feel with Pastor Hagee and each and every one of you is much stronger than that and I am proud to stand with you tonight . ”
I argued a while back that Lieberman either a ) has no idea what Hagee believes , but stands by him anyway ; or b ) knows what Hagee believes , but does n’t care .
Given Lieberman ’s speech last night , it ’s clearly the latter .
Indeed , Lieberman acknowledged the controversy surrounding Hagee , and proceeded to compare the radical evangelical to Moses .
Seriously .
A friend of mine alerted me to this transcript of Lieberman ’s remarks :
“ The political controversy that has swirled around Pastor Hagee reminds me of one of the unique lessons in the Bible about leadership .
In Greek mythology , the leaders were flawless and virtual demi-gods .
It was impossible for mere mortals to try to emulate them .
The heroes of the Bible , however , are humans , great humans , but with human failings .
“ Even Moses fell short of God ’s expectations .
He made a mistake and hit the rock rather than speaking to it as God commanded .
His sister , the prophetess Miriam , sinned too when she spoke badly about Moses .
But this did n’t make Moses and Miriam bad people or failed leaders .
Their shortcomings were only part of the larger fabric of their remarkable lives of faith and service .
And that ’s the way the Bible and those who read it view them .
“ And that ’s why I would say Moses and Miriam were fortunate that they did not live in the merciless attack - counterattack political culture of our time which would undoubtedly have stressed their shortcomings and ignored their great deeds .
I can only imagine what the bloggers of their day would have had to say about Moses and Miriam . ”
Keep in mind , Lieberman thinks liberal bloggers are foul - mouthed , and political leaders should n’t be associated with groups like MoveOn.org , but John Hagee is respectable because of his life work fighting anti-Semitism and building bridges between Christians and Jews .
I see .
So , Lieberman is fine with the fact that Hagee ’s support for Israel is “ rooted in the belief that the Jewish state will — soon — be the site of Armageddon , ” and his “ brand of Christian Zionism closely links support for Israel to the end of the world and the conversion of the Jews to Christianity . ”
And Lieberman is fine with the fact that Hagee believes Jews have been persecuted over the centuries , but it ’s their own fault .
And Lieberman is fine with the fact that Hagee ’s “ support ” for Israel is rooted in the notion that Hagee welcomes Israel ’s destruction .
It ’s not that Hagee loves Israel , so much as he foresees a blood - soaked war in the Middle East that leads to Jesus ’ return , at which point the Jews who survive will become Christians .
This is the man Lieberman wants to be associated with — and publicly compares to Moses .
For that matter , I ’m emphasizing Jewish concerns , but let ’s not forget that Hagee has also levied jaw - dropping attacks against Catholics , African Americans , women , Muslims , and gays .
The NYT reported , “ Over 40,000 signatures were delivered to Mr. Lieberman ’s office encouraging him not to speak at the event . ”
For the sake of what ’s left of his reputation , he really should have listened .
Your Business Blogger was recently asked by a small business owner to evaluate a manager ’s management skill set .
The manager was being overwhelmed .
And he is not alone .
If you are like most managers , you feel you could be doing better .
Much better .
As you set out to plan , organize , lead and control , how can you get the results you want ?
The most common complaint I hear from managers is on time management .
But there may be something even more important on which a manager should focus .
Discipline .
We all want military - like discipline as we run our business units .
The Army has the perfect definition for discipline .
It has two components .
Most would be familiar with the first part :
1 ) Prompt obedience to orders .
But it ’s the second part that managers really need from subordinates :
2) Initiation of appropriate action in the absence of orders .
Most often , we think prompt obedience will get the manager more time .
Efficiency .
But what most managers really need is initiative from their team .
More effectiveness .
This is a review of the basics to get more discipline in your business .
Following are 10 tips to remember as you knock about your office :
1 ) Desk
Think of your desk as a pyramid with the apex pointing up .
Paper does not rest on your desk , nor your boss ’s desk .
Paper is never allowed in horizontal file piles .
Whenever a memo or an email attachment comes to you , it will slide off — back to whoever carried it in .
Using your OPT - in management skills .
It will have your signature on it , an action to be taken ( by someone else ) , filed or destroyed ( by someone else ) .
You will not let it rest on your desk as you think about it because you use your …
2 ) Calendar
If an action comes to you from a subordinate , it should only require a decision .
If you cannot make a decision immediately , direct your staff to return later with more detail .
Open your calendar and you both set an appointment .
Do not say , “ I ’ll think about it . ”
This puts the action on your desk and nothing , of course , is on your desk .
And nothing should be on your mind , except making your tee time .
Here ’s the sign of a real professional manager :
Say those same words , “ I ’ll think about it , ” and have the subordinate to return later with the action item .
The seasoned manager knows that most any decision will be OBE , overcome by events and become irrelevant .
But use this as a learning experience .
You synchronize calendars with your subordinate and ink in a return time for him to brief you .
Again .
If some thought is necessary , your direct report does the thinking .
( Because you ask all the right questions . )
Your staff develops options , and returns with suggested courses of actions and recommendations .
You do not have to have all the answers all the time .
And nobody needs to know this .
With a fully staffed , staff recommendation you can use your …
3 ) Phone
Which you will use to get the resources your staff needs to accomplish the project .
Like magic .
Your voice and your charming personality will be needed to secure the extra budget needed to move the enterprise to the next level — with the ideas bubbling up from the cubicle farm down the hall .
If you are not getting the responses or the initiative you need , you will use …
4 ) Shoe leather
Management by walking around made the rounds a few years ago and is still useful if you need to plant your boot on a backside .
Or to deliver an atta-boy in real life .
The most effective persuasion is done face - to - face .
Toe to toe .
Walk over and overwhelm in person .
And to memorialize your praise , you will use your …
5 ) Fountain Pen
A hand - written note , black ink , heavy card stock , delivered by snail mail .
Or lugged over by your lackey .
Your cursive writing will almost balance your cursive yelling .
Neutron Jack
Welsh was hated by many of those he fired ( and his first two wives , I think ) .
But loved by those who received his hand - written notes .
GE knows how to train .
The single biggest reason people quit jobs is because they do n’t feel appreciated .
They may feel they do not measure up with your …
6 ) Ruler
Your standards and measurements should be open and transparent .
A subordinate should never be surprised by personnel evaluations .
Other measures may be more objective .
It is often difficult to measure precisely a forecast , a budget , a winner .
The good manager will include a margin to exploit delightful opportunities or a cushion if blind - sided with setbacks .
Keep 20 % of any budget up your sleeve .
Of your well - tailored …
7 ) Uniform
Your appearance should mirror the leaders in your industry .
Not your staff .
You must be seen to be different .
In America we have a common mis-belief :
We are all equal in the eyes of the law ; but we are not equal to each other .
Understand snobbery .
( Just like when Your Business Blogger was a ghost - writer for a former Presidential candidate … )
A white hardhat , custom made shirts ( yes , French cuffs and no pocket ) .
You no longer carry a lunch pale , you carry a …
8 ) Briefcase
This is your tool box .
Which is nothing more than a bag to carry cables , adapters and chargers .
As you advance up the food - chain , you will carry less and less .
Fewer and fewer ‘ tools . ’
You will lose the briefcase / sample case , then car keys , then house keys , then cash .
I ’m not talking senior moments or divorce .
As a professional manager you are not burdened with earthly possessions or a load bearing equipment harness .
You will get lighter and lighter .
Until , like the President of the United States , or an MLB player you carry nothing at all .
Do not carry papers in your briefcase .
You get paid for your wisdom in making decisions .
Not schlepping around pulp .
Does the CEO of Enron Exxon lug a briefcase ?
Or does he have a sherpa to do the heavy lifting ?
Watch your lower - level employees to see if get it by carrying a bag that is exactly like thier immediate boss’s .
Imitation and flattery and discreet sucking - up is necessary for the smooth functioning of the machinery of a small business .
And to hit your tee time .
However , just like a big - time CEO , you wo n’t always be caught red - handed empty - handed .
Like an out - of - town - consultant , you will always be carrying your …
9 ) Laptop
With a detailed dossier on everyone you know .
( Translation : CRM )
And noting every time you send them a thank you card .
( Using the fountain pen , natch . )
With a separate contact database for your Christmas card list .
The typical congressman has 1500 names of his closest friends on his yearly season ’s greeting snail mail card .
Set a goal of 200 names for your yearly mass mailing .
This will complement your more frequent emails from your …
10 ) Blackberry
A typical span of control is 10 .
An Army squad .
A football team .
( The President ’s Cabinet is a bit unwieldy at 14 . )
You do not need to control every action of every individual in your organization .
Just your 10 direct reports .
That ’s all .
Follow - up and pestering supervision these days is easier with email .
Remember with any incoming email , reply ASAP even if you have no substance — do let the sender know his message was received and acknowledged .
Your email inbox must be treated the same manner as your desk .
They both are pyramids where everything slides off .
You will notice one office accoutrement not listed above : A clock .
Forget Time Management
This was not an exercise in time management .
The above ten tips will get most small business owners more discretionary time .
More time to simply think and to dispense wisdom .
Initiation of appropriate action by your team will free - up time .
True discipline will give you those moments to reflect , per chance to dream .
The clock will now become your friend .
10 Republicans Abstain , Measure Passes 238-180 ...
Jon Ponder Byon
7/17/2008 , 8:34 am PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
There will be a hearing related to Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's Article of Impeachment against George Bush in the House Judiciary Committee .
That was assured by a vote of 238 to 180 on Tuesday .
( Details on that hearing , now posted here . )
But , according to Keith Olbermann on MSNBC's " Countdown " last night , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has mandated that questioning in the hearing be relegated to Bush 's abuses of power , not his criminal wrongdoing .
“ There ’s never been one [ hearing ] that accumulated all the things that constitute an imperial presidency , ” said Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , according to CQ Politics .
He indicated topics covered in the hearing would include the firing of U.S. attorneys for political reasons , the betrayal of CIA agent Valerie Plame and Bush 's alleged lying to Congress about the reasons for invading Iraq .
Kucinich 's single Article of Impeachment only deals with Bush 's lies to Congress .
There were no Democratic votes against holding the hearing .
While 180 Republicans voted to follow their Dear Leader lock - step over the cliff , 10 Republicans abstained and nine Republican members of Congress voted with the Democrats .
Here are their names ...
Rep. Kevin Brady ( Texas )
Rep. Wayne Gilchrest ( Md. )
Rep. Walter B. Jones ( N.C. )
Rep. Don Manzullo ( Ill . )
Rep. Tim Murphy ( Penn . )
Rep. Ron Paul ( Texas )
Rep. Dave Reichert ( Wash . )
Rep. Christopher Shays ( Conn . )
Rep. Mike Turner ( Ohio )
Kucinich , who earlier this week smartly summarized why Impeachment matters , promises a surprise witness against Bush .
Also from CQ Politics : " An unidentified government official of a U.S. ally wants to participate if and when Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich makes his case to impeach President Bush before the House Judiciary Committee , according to the Ohio Democrat . "
By Dave Lindorff
The sorry performance of the US corporate media , which blacked out stories questioning the official line on the so - called “ Iraq Threat ” until the nation was deeply mired in to pointless , bloody war in that country , and which has almost completely ignored a three - year , nation - wide movement calling for the impeachment of the president and vice president , has continued .
Search far and wide , and you will find no reporting on the fact that Rep. Dennis Kucinich , who has filed a total 36 proposed articles of impeachment against President Bush , is finally going to get to formally present his case to the House Judiciary Committee , beginning on July 25 .
Although this is not an impeachment hearing , it is putting impeachment “ on the table , ” from which it has been banned for two years by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Although the House last week voted 251- 166 to send Kucinich ’s articles to the Judiciary Committee for hearings , the New York Times , the Washington Post and the nation ’s television news organizations ignored this breakthrough ( which included 24 Republicans voting for the measure ) .
Only USA Today , at least in its online edition , even mentioned it , with a headline saying “ Pelosi cracks door open on impeachment resolution ” -- and that was just a five - sentence story .
Another critically important story that is being blacked out by the corporate media is the Bush / Cheney administration ’s march towards war with Iran .
On Sunday , the London Times ran a well - researched and reported piece headlined President George W Bush backs Israeli plan for strike on Iran , saying that Bush has given the “ amber light ” to Israel to get its air force ready for an aerial assault on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The article , which quoted an unnamed “ senior Pentagon official , ” reported that while an actual attack would require a further “ green light ” from the president , the “ amber light ” meant planning could proceed .
The article also stated that the president was acting , “ Despite the opposition of his own generals and widespread skepticism that America is ready to risk the military , political and economic consequences of an airborne strike on Iran . ”
Surely such news of an increased possibility of the US being dragged into yet a third war in the Middle East should at least warrant a mention in the mainstream media .
The Times of London is , after all , hardly a fringe publication .
Though owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s NewsCorp .
it has a sterling reputation .
If it reported on a gossipy story about another sex scandal involving the British royal family , you can bet the American media would be quoteing it ad nauseum .
Yet while the rest of the world is holding its collective breath wondering if such a cataclysmic attack might be about to happen with US sanction and assistance ( Israel would be flying American - made planes in any attack , and would have to be given clearance to fly over US - controlled airspace in Iraq , even if it was denied access to US airbases along the way ) , Americans are being left blissfully unaware of this latest crime in the making by their war - mongering president .
This is news of major import , and it is nothing short of a shame and a scandal that it is not being reported in the American media , which more and more is resembling state propaganda .

そろろ ろRailsについて本音を書いてみるか
後、デバッグの環境は 、Javaに比べて貧弱だと思う。Railsでデバッグをする７つの方法を見てほしい。IDEでソースにブレークポイントを設定(ソースコードを書き換えるのではなく)して、ステップイン、ステップオーバー、メモリの状態を見たりなんてのに慣れているJavaから比べると、すっごく大変に見える。
喜ばしいことに 、Rails 2.0ではruby - debug を使ったdebuggerが正式に採用されました。 これの使い方は非常に簡単です。
まずは、以下のようにブレークポイントをコード中に書き込みます。

続いて 、Webサーバをデバッグモードで実行します。
1 % ./ script/s erver -u
これだけです。あとは、実際にブレークポイントを仕掛けた

Steve has been home for six months now .
To be more precise , he has been here in the States , staying with various friends and relatives , since he returned from a tour of duty with the Marines in Iraq just before Christmas .
Going back to where he was born and raised — the projects of South Jamaica , in the New York City borough of Queens — is not an option , he says .
It ’s not physical dangers that are keeping him from his old stomping grounds .
After a year in Iraq and a year in Afghanistan ( and a class with me between those two tours of duty — oh , my ! ) ,
Steve can handle himself when there is a threat .
Likewise , he is not avoiding his past , I think :
Most of his family and friends are n’t in the neighborhood anymore .
Equally important , he says , is the fact that he ’s " changed . "
Although I could see ways in which he ’s worked , or is working , through questions about his life and his world , I asked him " How so ? "
" I understand now that I do n’t owe allegiance to anyone or anything besides my mother , the guys who were there with me , and maybe a couple of other people . "
Though his pronouncement did n’t surprise me , I was taken aback .
To say the least , it is a stunning reversal from the oaths Marines and other members of the armed forces take upon joining .
In fact , it flies in the face of just about anything most of us have been taught or have absorbed from our schools , workplaces and nation .
To hear those words from someone who just two years ago could not drink legally made them still more jarring , at least for me .
He announced that he wanted " nothing more to do " with any aspect of any military or paramilitary organization , anywhere .
He stays in touch with " a couple of buddies " who , like him , came to realize that they were no more fighting for their country — " whatever that is , " he sneers — than Fox News is in the business of conveying the truth to the public .
( I can only imagine the conversations they have or the e-mails they exchange ! )
Other than those friendships , he says he wants nothing more from his time in the Marines .
So intent is he on breaking his ties that he wo n’t avail himself to the psychiatric and medical care the government offers veterans .
" Those doctors are the worst , " he groans .
Family members and friends have urged him to take advantage of those services .
" After all , you ’re entitled to them , " they say .
To them , he responds , " Just because you ’re entitled to something , that does n’t mean it ’s good for you ! "
He echoes a belief commonly held among veterans — one for which there is more than anecdotal evidence — that the purpose of military medicine is to " patch up and cover up . "
The doctors and psychiatrists " only know how to fix someone up enough to get him on the battlefield " and " cover up their mistakes , which they make a lot of . "
Fortunately for him , he did n’t suffer any physical injuries beyond a couple of superficial wounds .
However , he feels anger at the way he feels his country " abandoned " him and his buddies by sending them into a conflagration sparked by US involvement in the region and continuing by ongoing American presence .
To aid the causes of duplicitous plutocrats , he and his buddies were sent through desolate , hostile areas to drive empty , unarmored vans .
To protect themselves , they and their families provided them with flack jackets and other gear at their own expense .
And , after paying for his own defense while ostensibly serving in his country ’s defense , he is now spending the money he has been earning from various odd jobs for the services of a psychiatric social worker .
He plans to return to school , although his goals may differ from those he had when he was my student , he says .
In the meantime , he says , " I want to get at the truth and get myself together . "
To that end , he has read " more than I ever have before , " including two books by Vietnam veterans that I recommended : Song of Napalm , a collection of poems by Bruce Weigl , and At Hell ’s Gate by Claude Anshin Thomas .
I also steered him to a number of anti-war essays and articles , including some that have been published on this site , just to show him how diverse are those who want and work for peace and prosperity .
What has he learned , I asked him .
" At the end of the day , there are only people .
We only have each other .
Sometimes we can depend on them , but we can only be sure of ourselves .
And do n’t expect any organization — especially any government — to give you what you need or make you whole . "
If only I had such understanding when I was his age !
Then again , I guess I should count my blessings that I did n’t have to experience what he has in order to gain the wisdom we now share .

I 've been using RSpec exclusively on my latest project .
I 'd say I 'm still fairly new to it , but it has won me over for the time being .
However , the view testing has been a real problem .
You can test views quite easily and nicely with RSpec , however , when you do something subtly wrong , it can cause RSpec to fail without any visible error !
In fact , Autotest does n't report a failure at all , and the only way I know it is failing is either I pay close attention to the number of examples it said it ran , or more likely , my cruisecontrol.rb CI server will actually fail ( because it detects the commands exit status ) .
For example , while Autotest says everything is fine , the CI server will show something like this ( note for easier reading I 've trimmed this a bit ) :
/widgets/index.html.erb
- should render list of widgets
/bobbles/index.html.erb
Finished in 4.977586 seconds
175 examples , 0 failures
rake aborted !
Command /usr / bin/ruby1.8 - I" /var/cruisecontrolrb/projects/myproject/work/vendor/plugins/rspec/lib "
" /var/cruisecontrolrb/projects/myproject/work/vendor/plugins/rspec/bin/spec " " spec/controllers/bobbles_controller_spec.rb " ...
-- options /var/cruisecontrolrb/projects/myproject/work/spec/cruisecontrol_rcov.opts failed
( See full trace by running task with -- trace )
-- trace
/bobbles/index.html.erb
As you can see , RSpec is reporting , yet rake fails .
This is because in reality RSpec is returning an exit code of 1 instead of 0 .
But , looking at the output , it 's certainly not revealing .
Running withis of no help either .
What I now know to pay attention to in situations like this is the fact that that last spec it ran , theone has no examples listed under it .
That is thus the culprit ( you can also argue that it 's the last thing to " run " and then rake fails , so it 's likely in this , etc . ) .
The real pain comes when you try to figure out what the heck is causing this .
You have zero feedback , and no way that I know of to somehow debug or inspect the test to see what 's failing .
In my experience to date with these , it boils down to some problem in your mocks and stubs , but this can be difficult to figure out .
I admit , the one that prompted me to write this blog entry is one I 've still yet to figure out , and finally just punted on .
I 've been hearing a lot about not testing views , or testing very little of the views .
I agree in general on this , and am now looking into using Webrat to do integration testing to really test " view " functionality , and leave the rest of my view testing mostly to testing my helpers , controllers , and models .
Here are a couple of blog entries related to all this :
Baltimore
If you 've seen HBO 's " The Wire , " you know why those of us who live in Baltimore are often asked whether our city really is the hellhole it is portrayed to be on TV .
Our answer is , well , yes .
Baltimore deserves the Third - World profile it has developed because it has expanses of crumbling , crime - riddled neighborhoods populated by low - income ...
In the spring of 2002 , archaeologists were nearly finished excavating the site of a planned housing development in Amesbury , a town in southwestern England .
It had been a “ routine excavation — bread and butter , as it were , ” says archaeologist Andrew Fitzpatrick , leader of the team from Wessex Archaeology conducting the dig .
The team had uncovered a small Roman cemetery , a fairly common finding .
Now all that was left to check out were two rough patches of ground — “ blobs , ” Fitzpatrick calls them — in a far corner of the site .
Early on that Friday in May , the crew went to work on the blobs with their trowels .
By midmorning , they had determined that the blobs were graves .
By lunchtime , they ’d realized the graves predated the Roman cemetery by more than 2,500 years ; in one , they uncovered the first of five clay funerary pots , having a “ beaker ” style associated with Britain ’s Bronze Age ( 2300 - 700 B.C. ) .
Then a worker found “ something shiny , ” as the crew leader reported that afternoon in a phone call to Fitzpatrick , who hurried to the site .
The shiny “ something ” was a piece of gold .
Fitzpatrick ordered the workers to collect all the earth from the graves so that his staff back in the lab could sift through it and recover any fragments of relics or remains .
With no way to hire guards for the site on the eve of a three day holiday weekend , the team had to complete the job right away .
After the sun went down , they illuminated the area with car headlights , finishing at 1:42 a.m. that Saturday .
Later , when the sifting was done , 100 artifacts had been retrieved — the richest Bronze Age grave ever discovered in Britain .
There were two male skeletons , the most important of which was interred in a timber - lined grave on its left side , facing north .
The legs were curled in a fetal position , common in Bronze Age burials .
An eroded hole in the jawbone indicated that he ’d had an abscess ; a missing left kneecap was evidence that he ’d sustained some horrific injury that ’d left him with a heavy limp and an excruciating bone infection .
A man between 35 and 45 years of age , he was buried with a black stone wrist guard on his forearm of the kind used to protect archers from the snap of a bowstring .
Scattered across his lower body were 16 barbed flint arrowheads ( the shafts to which they presumably had been attached had long since rotted away ) and almost 100 other artifacts .
The archaeologists started calling him the Amesbury Archer , and they assumed he had something to do with Stonehenge because the massive stone monument was just a few miles away .
Because of his apparent wealth , the press soon dubbed him the “ King of Stonehenge . ”
Begun about 3000 B.C. , Stonehenge was built in stages over 1,400 years .
The structure , whose purpose remains a mystery , started out as a huge earthen ditch with wooden posts and walls .
The familiar 4- , 20 - and 30 - ton standing stones were erected between 2400 and 2200 B.C. — about the time the archer was buried nearby .
Because radiocarbon dating has about a 200 - year margin of error , however , not everyone is ready to call the archer a king .
Mike Parker Pearson , archaeology professor at the University of Sheffield in England , points out that the archer may have come on the scene several decades after the stones were erected .
Compared with the glittering tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun , who reigned some 1,000 years after the mysterious Stonehenge figure , the archer ’s possessions may not seem like much : in addition to the arrowheads and wrist guards , the grave held five pots , three tiny copper knives ( one barely an inch long ) , a cache of flint - and metalworking tools , including a cushion stone — a hand - size piece of rock shaped like a sofa cushion that served as an anvil — and a clutch of boars ’ tusks .
The grave also held a pair of gold hair ornaments — the earliest gold objects found in Britain .
Other graves in the area , on the other hand , typically contain little more than a clay pot ; by comparison , the archer died a very rich man indeed .
“ Most people would not have had the ability to take such wealth with them into their graves , ” says Mike Pitts , author of Hengeworld , who calls the find “ dynamite . ”
The concepts of individual wealth and status were just taking root in Europe during the Bronze Age , when most trade was still conducted by barter .
The preceding Stone Age is marked by what appears to have been relative economic equality , with no grave appreciably richer than any other .
Archaeologists long thought this egalitarianism extended into the Bronze Age .
The Amesbury Archer has overturned that idea .
The archer ’s mourners had undoubtedly wished him well , says Fitzpatrick .
But what did his grave goods signify ?
Did his stone wrist guard mean that he was an archer in life , or was it conferred on him posthumously to honor his high status ?
Were the bow and arrows intended to help him hunt , or to protect him in the next world ?
Nobody knows .
“ How the archer acquired his wealth and what it signified are questions that are impossible to answer , ” Pitts says .
But forensic archaeology has revealed some telling details .
One of the most sensational came straight from the archer ’s mouth .
To scientists , a person ’s tooth enamel is like a GPS for pinpointing his childhood home .
The main ingredient of tooth enamel , apatite , is composed of calcium , phosphorous , oxygen and other elements .
The composition of the oxygen molecules in apatite depends on the water a person drank as a child , and that , in turn , can reveal a great deal about where he grew up — from the temperature of rain or snow to the distance from a coast and the area ’s altitude .
Using a laser scan to determine the makeup of the oxygen in the archer ’s tooth enamel , a team at the British Geological Survey led by geoscientist Carolyn Chenery concluded that he grew up in a cool region of Central Europe , most likely somewhere close to the Alps or present - day southern Germany .
The notion that he hailed from the Continent has farreaching implications .
For decades , scientists believed that beaker pottery , like the pots found in the archer ’s grave , was brought by invaders across continental Europe to the British Isles .
But most archaeologists now say the pottery — and the knowledge needed to create it — diffused peacefully , through trade or through travelers who were skilled craftsmen .
A more significant imported skill was metalworking .
Around 2300 B.C. , the stone tools and weapons that had defined Britain ’s Stone Age were being replaced with metal implements .
The Bronze Age varies from culture to culture , but it is thought to have started in southeastern Europe about 4000 B.C. and then spread westward across the Continent before reaching Britain 4,000 years ago .
The archer would have been at the vanguard of the flashy new trade , which sometimes produced items just for show : Fitzpatrick says the archer ’s copper knives , for instance , which are too soft to have been used primarily as weapons , were probably for display or eating .
( It would take at least another century after the archer ’s arrival before the technology of alloying copper and tin to make sturdier implements reached Britain . )
The evidence that the archer not only carried metal but knew how to work it comes mainly from the cushion stones found in his grave .
Researchers say it is unlikely that such a tool would have been buried with anyone but its owner .
( Carbon dating , and the absence of metal objects from earlier graves , suggest the archer ’s arrival roughly coincides with the arrival of metalworking to the British Isles . )
The archer ’s skill would have allowed him to move freely from community to community .
“ The knowledge in his hands and in his head , ” Fitzpatrick says , “ was the key to his status .
He brought a unique or exceptionally rare skill .
You can think of the archer as a kind of magician .
You can revere metalworkers , but you can also fear them . ”
Arriving 4,300 years ago in an area we now call Wiltshire , the archer would have likely encountered a rural setting of round timber houses with conical thatched roofs .
( Today , Amesbury center is graced by red brick and pastel - colored stucco buildings , and enterprises beyond the archer ’s wildest fantasies : Amesbury Tandoori , for example , and Hair by Joanna . )
Of course , the lure of Wiltshire then , as now , was Stonehenge .
Speculation about its purpose has centered on the notion that the monument was built in part to capture the rays of the rising sun during the summer solstice , the longest day of the year .
A new idea is that Stonehenge was about the winter solstice , or the shortest day of the year .
“ Stonehenge has been looked at the wrong way around , ” says Parker Pearson , one of the winter theory ’s proponents .
In the past year , archaeologists have reanalyzed material excavated in the 1960s from a nearby monument built about the same time as Stonehenge .
Pig remains from wooden structures found within this henge , called Durrington Walls , show that feasting rituals went on in the winter .
“ What is happening around that time is a tremendous religious revival , ” says Parker Pearson .
“ We ’re dealing with more sophisticated societies than we give them credit for .
Stonehenge was built for the ancestors whose funerary rites were held at Durrington Walls and along the river to Stonehenge , with the festival of the dead celebrated at midwinter . ”
It is unlikely the archer set off from the Alps expressly to see Wiltshire ’s massive structures , though Fitzpatrick says there may have been whisperings on the Continent about their existence .
But about the same time he arrived , “ something utterly unprecedented , unique in scale and vision took place , ” says Pitts : the erection of the 20 - and 30 - ton stones .
Most archaeologists believe the massive stones were hauled to the monument ’s location on the Salisbury Plain from the Marlborough Downs , 20 miles to the north — a colossal distance for a society without wheels .
And it ’s even possible the archer may have provided the catalyst to get the project started .
“ He could have brought with him the stock of imagination to conceive of something quite extraordinary , ” Pitts says .

A ground - breaking study of 4117 marijuana smokers in California1 reveals that the ' Gateway Theory ' probably had it backwards .
Instead of enticing young people to use other drugs , this study suggests that marijuana may have the opposite effect .
This first - ever clinical examination of a large number of medical marijuana applicants depicts a population that is remarkably normal .
The percentages earning bachelors ' degrees and doctorates are nearly identical to the national numbers .
They are , in the main , productive citizens with jobs , homes and families who smoke marijuana weekly or daily – and have in some cases for decades .
For the vast majority of these applicants , their use of cannabis ultimately led to a decrease in the use of tobacco , alcohol , and hard drugs .
Asked to compare their current alcohol consumption with their lifetime peak , over 10 % claimed to be abstinent and nearly 90 % claimed to have cut their drinking in half .
They also report using cannabis as self medication for stress and anxiety – with fewer side effects than the legal pharmaceutical alternatives .
As children , a significant percentage of the male applicants had been treated for ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ) .
Today their routine morning use of minimal amounts of cannabis strongly suggests that it enhances their ability to concentrate by allowing them to focus on one problem at a time .

Failure is part of the maturing process in the startup world .
If you have n't failed ... you are n't trying hard enough , or you are n't " pushing the envelope " far enough .
I have always said " Success is a terrible teacher .
Success masks over flaws that may hurt you later . "
Roger Ehrenberg - the co-founder of Monitor 110 , wrote a story on the lessons he learned from this recently failed startup .
[ found via Fred Wilson ]
He lists " seven deadly sins " that lead to their demise .
The lack of a single , " the buck stops here " leader until too late in the game
No separation between the technology organization and the product organization
Too much PR , too early
Too much money
Not close enough to the customer
Slow to adapt to market reality
Disagreement on strategy both within the Company and with the Board
In my opinion there are two key reasons Monitor 110 failed ; first , no clear CEO leader , and second , too much money .
Trying to run a startup as a group of friends or make decisions by committee will never work .
Too much money allows you to waste time , ignore danger signals , and continue down a wrong path for too long .

KAMPALA ( Reuters ) - Changing weather patterns in Uganda may lead to the extinction of the east African country ’s key export , coffee , in coming decades , a report by British charity Oxfam said on Thursday .
Uganda is Africa ’s second biggest coffee producer after Ethiopia and has become a major player in robusta coffee production after political unrest in former top grower Ivory Coast slashed output .
“ The outlook is bleak .
If the average global temperatures rise by two degrees or more , then most of Uganda is likely to cease to be suitable for coffee ... this may happen in 40 years or perhaps as little as 30 , ” the report said .
The report , “ Turning up the heat , Climate Change and Poverty in Uganda , ” said effects of global warming like increasing temperatures , more intense rains and storms , had led to erratic rainfall patterns in Uganda .
Coffee output in 2007 /08 ( Oct - Sept ) is seen at 2.85 million bags , up from 2.7 million the year before .
“ According to the United Nations Environmental Program , only patches of land on the periphery will still be able to grow coffee ...
In the meantime , coffee farmers are going to have to adapt to rising temperatures , ” the report said .
Across much of Uganda , the climate is bimodal , meaning that there are two rainy seasons -- the first from March to June and the second from October / November to December / January .
Rainfall during the rainy seasons has become unreliable , it said , adding that reduced rain during the March to June season was causing drought , reductions in crop yields and plant varieties .
The late season rainfall was coming in more intense and destructive downpours , bringing floods , landslides and soil erosion , it said .
“ But , farmers have continued to invest in Uganda ’s Robusta coffee and export earnings have continued to increase .
This has helped protect losses from climatic problems , ” said Philip Gitao , head of the East African Fine Coffees Association .
Farmers have also adopted good husbandry practices such as using more hardy coffee plants , added Gitao , who was quoted in the Oxfam report .

Recent X -ray Spectroscopy studies have revealed that modern theories of the structure of liquid water are incorrect .
( Courtesy : Stanford Linear Accelerator Center )
The traditional picture of how liquid water behaves on a molecular level is wrong , according to new experimental evidence collected by a collaboration of researchers from the Department of Energy 's Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) in California , RIKEN SPring - 8 synchrotron and Hiroshima University in Japan and Stockholm University in Sweden .
The team , involving SLAC scientist Anders Nilsson , used advanced X - ray spectroscopy techniques to create a more detailed picture of water 's molecular behavior .
Published as the cover story in the June 30 edition of the journal Chemical Physics Letters , the findings could soon help overturn the established orthodoxy surrounding the substance most essential to life .
Water , by any measure , is strange stuff .
It behaves unlike any other liquid .
It has a tremendous capacity for carrying heat — which is why the Gulf Stream keeps Europe warm .
Water 's solid phase — ice — is less dense than the liquid , which is why ice floats ; life on Earth could never have formed if oceans and lakes froze from the bottom up .
Water also has unusually strong surface tension — a property essential for the capillary action at work in the roots of plants and within our cells .
These strange properties are what make water such an essential substance to the existence of life .
But despite its prevalence and importance , liquid water is not well understood , and its molecular structure has been the subject of intense debate for decades .
Ice , whose structure was long ago well established , forms a tight " tetrahedral " lattice of molecules each binding to four others .
The prevailing model of liquid water holds that as ice melts , the molecules loosen their grip but remain generally arranged in the same tetrahedral groups .
In the recent study , Nilsson and colleagues probed the structure of liquid water using X - ray Emission Spectroscopy and X -ray Absorption Spectroscopy .
These techniques use powerful X - rays , generated by a synchrotron light source , to excite electrons within a water molecule 's single oxygen atom .
Tuning the X - rays to a specific range of energies can reveal with tremendous precision the location and arrangement of the water molecules .
In this way Nilsson 's team found that water is indeed made up of tetrahedral groups , but clear evidence also emerged for the dominance of a second , less defined structure in the mix .
The idea that liquid water is made up of two structures is not new .
German physicist Willhelm Conrad Röntgen , who discovered X - rays in the late 19th century , published a paper proposing that liquid water comprised two different structures — one tetrahedral " ice - like " structure , and another more loosely arranged structure , which helped explain why water behaves in such unusual ways .
Now , more than a century later , the current study is giving new life to Röntgen 's " two structure " model .
" It is amazing that the modern usage of X - rays demonstrates that Röntgen , more than 100 years ago , was on the right path , " said Nilsson .
" Water is still not fully understood , although it is the basis of our existence .
I expect more surprises to be discovered in the future . "
Settling the debate about water 's molecular structure holds tremendous importance for a range of fields including medicine , chemistry and biology .
Current molecular dynamics models , which are used to understand chemical and biological processes , are notoriously limited in their ability to predict water 's behavior .
The current study is the most recent addition to a growing body of evidence for a new theory about the structure of liquid water .
In 2004 , Nilsson and colleagues sparked controversy with a paper published in Science that suggested the tetrahedral model of water was incorrect .
Nilsson agrees that the debate is far from settled and that much work remains before a clear picture of liquid water emerges .
" Over the last decade or so we have discovered that materials once considered homogeneous exhibit complex nanoscale order , " said Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory director Jo Stöhr .
" In my view , the work on water is yet another example of the actual complexity of matter , this time within a simple liquid .
Modern X - ray work appears to be triggering a new understanding of liquids and we may have only seen the beginning of a paradigm shift in our understanding . "

ACLU : Mukasey wants Congress ' to subvert ' Constitution Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008
Print This Email This Attorney General Michael Mukasey prompted Congress Monday morning , during a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute , to create new rules governing the rights of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The American Civil Liberties Union immediately responded to Mukasey 's request , calling his proposals nothing short of asking Congress to subvert the Constitution .
Mukasey " proposed that Congress subvert the right of habeas corpus with a new scheme of procedures that will hide the Bush administration 's past wrongdoing - an action that would undermine the constitutional guarantee of due process and conceal systematic torture and abuse of detainees , " the group charged .
" Mukasey is asking Congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office , in a media advisory .
" Anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial .
This is clearly the last gasp of an administration desperate to rationalize what is a failed legal scheme that was correctly rejected four times by the Supreme Court . "
The Associated Press , acknowledging a Congress eager to transition into a busy election season , notes the rules are not likely to be approved .
Mukasey 's requests come on the heels of a Supreme Court decision granting detainees the right to challenge their captivity in US federal court .
Under Mukasey 's proposals , a detainee would be able to challenge their detention , but would receive no extradition to the United States for the proceedings .
According to the Washington Post : " Under the Justice plan that Mukasey talked about today , the U.S. government could hold prisoners indefinitely so long as the armed conflict with al - Qaeda persisted . "
Senator Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) accused the attorney general of trying " to create an election - year security issue where there is nt one . "
" Our federal courts are capable of handling these cases , and no dangerous detainees held at Guantanamo will be released anytime soon , " read a prepared statement from Sen.
Feingold sent to RAW STORY .
" By repeatedly mishandling these cases , the administration has delayed justice from being served .
If congressional action is needed to clean up the mess the administration created at Guantanamo , it should be taken alongside a new administration that doesnt have such contempt for the rule of law . "
" There is simply no need to invent yet another set of legal rules to govern the detention and trial of prisoners held on national security grounds , and the rules that the attorney general is proposing are fundamentally inconsistent with the Constitution , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project , in a media advisory .
" The prisoners at Guantanamo , some of whom have been held without charges for more than six years , should be allowed a meaningful opportunity to challenge their detention in court .
The handful of prisoners that have actually been charged with crimes should be tried under rules that conform to the Constitution and that the rest of the world will recognize as fair . "
Among the rules Mukasey is seeking : - Barring federal courts from allowing the detainees to be brought or released into the United States .
He said detainees could participate in the court hearings by video link from Guantanamo if necessary .
" Many of them pose an extraordinary threat to Americans , " he said .
- Protecting counterterror intelligence gathered and used to detain the suspects from being turned over to courts .
- Prohibiting detainees charged with war crimes from challenging their capture until after they stand trial .
Additionally , detainees should not be allowed to appeal their imprisonment under more than one legal standard .
- Assigning one federal court , and one judge , to oversee the detainee release cases to make sure they are heard in a coordinated effort .
- Underscoring that the United States has the authority to detain suspects it has identified as enemy combatants .
" The United States has every right to capture and detain enemy combatants in this conflict , and need not simply release them to return to the battlefield - as indeed some of them have , " Mukasey said .
Excerpts from ACLU press release : # " This is clearly the last gasp of an administration desperate to rationalize what is a failed legal scheme that was correctly rejected four times by the Supreme Court .
With as little as five work weeks left in this Congress , there are more important issues than helping the lame - duck president cook up an indefensible plan to lock people up forever and throw away the key with no due process rights and limited judicial review . "
" The attorney general 's proposal would hide the torture and abuse conducted since 9/11 , " Fredrickson said .
" This is one more effort to cover up the illegal activities authorized by the president and his administration .
Attorney General Mukasey might be ok with helping in a cover - up , but there is no reason to think that Congress will assist him . "

Lawyer :
In denying role in Siegelman case , Rove ' actually incriminated himself ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 24 , 2008
Print This Email This Although Karl Rove has repeatedly refused to testify under oath before the House Judiciary Committee about the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , he has now sent a letter to a Republican member of the committee denying any involvement in the case .
In that letter , Rove writes , " I have never communicated , either directly or indirectly , with Justice Department or Alabama officials about the investigation , indictment , potential prosecution , prosecution , conviction , or sentencing of Governor Siegelman , or about any other matter related to his case , nor have I asked any other individual to communicate about these matters on my behalf .
I have never attempted , either directly or indirectly , to influence these matters . "
" Sounds like a firm denial , " began MSNBC's Don Abrams in commenting on the letter .
However , he immediately pointed out that " Rove did not address specifically the question of whether he contacted any non-government officials about the case -- and specifically , whether he ever spoke to his old friend Bill Canary ... an influential Republican in Alabama who just happens to be married to the US Attorney Leura Canary whose office brought the case against Siegelman . "
Abrams then asked Siegelman himself about Rove 's charge that he " has not offered a single piece of evidence that I played any role whatsoever in his case " and that " before giving credence to Siegelman 's baseless allegations of impropriety , the committee should require Siegelman to substantiate his allegations . "
" We know that this Department of Justice has been political , " Siegelman replied .
" David Iglesias ... was fired because he refused to file a case against a Democrat right before an election .
And I know that my case was politically motivated . "
" It 's a fair question about selective prosecution , " Abrams agreed .
" But you have n't responded yet to the question specifically that Rove lays out ... that you have not offered a single piece of evidence with regard to your case that Karl Rove was involved . "
" There has been sworn testimony before the United States Congress Judiciary Committee by a Republican lawyer , " Siegelman answered , referring to whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson .
Abrams noted that Rove has raised questions about Simpson 's credibility .
" But does that change the fact that he has n't testified in front of Congress ? " he asked , turning for comment to former House Judiciary Committee counsel Julian Epstein .
" I think what the Republicans tried to do with this letter is to give Rove an excuse for not coming before the [ Judiciary ] Committee , " Epstein replied .
" ' Let 's send him a softball letter , he can send us evasive answers , and then we can pretend that he 's actually responded to the Committee . ' "
Epstein further pointed out that Rove " actually incriminated ... himself in the answer , because he distinctly refused to answer the question about whether he had contacted other individuals ... about this case .
Did he contact the husband of the prosecutor ?
Did he contact the son of [ Governor Bob Riley ] ? "
" Even Republicans off camera will agree that the case on Don Siegelman was a case that was fixed , " Epstein continued .
" I think what will happen with the Judiciary Committee now is they 're going to proceed with this , they 'll go in and file civil contempt in a federal court .
I do n't think this will get resolved in the next six months ... but I think this will get resolved at the end of the day . "
" The Bill Canary thing , I think , is the key question here , " Abrams emphasized in conclusion .

She went on to lament the silence of those who did not speak up against it .
Candy Crowley , covering the campaign for CNN , said that for the most part , she did not see a drumbeat of sexism in the daily reporting , “ but I certainly did see it in the commentary . ”
Still , Ms. Crowley said , “ it was hard to know if these attacks were being made because she was a woman or because she was this woman or because , for a long time , she was the front - runner . ”
The perception that sexism tainted coverage of the Clinton campaign  a view expressed on Internet postings and in conversations among women  appears to be gaining ground more in political circles than in the mainstream news media .
Howard Dean , chairman of the Democratic Party , who says he was slow to pick up on charges of sexism because he is not a regular viewer of cable television , is taking up the cause after hearing an outcry from what he described as a cross-section of women , from individual voters to powerful politicians and chief executives .
“ The media took a very sexist approach to Senator Clinton ’s campaign , ” Mr. Dean said in a recent interview .
“ It ’s pretty appalling , ” he said , adding that the issue resonates because Mrs. Clinton “ got treated the way a lot of women got treated their whole lives . ”
Mr. Dean and others are now calling for a “ national discussion ” of sexism .
Mrs. Clinton may have begun that discussion in her concession speech on Saturday when she said that women deserve equal respect , along with equal pay , and that “ there are no acceptable prejudices in the 21st century in our country . ”
She was referring to what emerged as conventional wisdom during the campaign that racism is no longer tolerated in America , but sexism is .
Cable television has come under the most criticism .
Chris Matthews , a host on MSNBC , called Mrs. Clinton a “ she - devil ” and said she had gotten as far as she had only because her husband had “ messed around . ”
Policy Note
I edit and improve most of my posts after I initially place them .
I will not hesitate to do this , and without cross-outs , as my main goal is to teach and discuss clearly and well , to help with understanding and good idea creation , not to leave a historically accurate evolution of my writing .
In fact , if you think the writing of a post has clunky spots or mistakes , you might want to try looking at it hours or days later .
These things may be fixed , plus valuable new material may have been added .
My writing really tends to improve with seasoning .
I will , however , note if I have made a major change of opinion , or corrected an important mistake of fact that could be substantially harmful to a person or party .
This is subject to interpretation , however .
For example , if the post was up for two minutes before I fixed it , I may not write a correction note .

Barack Obama , wrapping up a news conference while campaigning in Bend , Ore. , had a terse reply when asked about a terse report by columnist Robert Novak on the prospects of an Obama - Hillary Clinton ticket .
" Close - in supporters " of Obama 's presidential campaign , Novak wrote , " are convinced he never will offer the vice presidential nomination " to Clinton because of antipathy toward her by the frontrunner 's wife , Michelle Obama .
" My wife does not talk to Bob Novak on a regular basis , " Obama told the reporters gathered around him , who included The Times ' Robin Abcarian .
Somehow , we do n't imagine the candidate does , either .
We also do n't know if Sen .
Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts was one of Novak 's " close - in " sources , but he had gone on the record about an Obama - Clinton ticket , telling Al Hunt of Bloomberg News that , " I do n't think it 's possible . ''
Michelle Obama was not cited by Kennedy as the reason for his comment ; instead , a spokesman for him later said his prediction was based on the " tenor of the campaign ' ' of late .

The United States is operating " floating prisons " to house those arrested in its war on terror , according to human rights lawyers , who claim there has been an attempt to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees .
Details of ships where detainees have been held and sites allegedly being used in countries across the world have been compiled as the debate over detention without trial intensifies on both sides of the Atlantic .
The US government was yesterday urged to list the names and whereabouts of all those detained .
Information about the operation of prison ships has emerged through a number of sources , including statements from the US military , the Council of Europe and related parliamentary bodies , and the testimonies of prisoners .
The analysis , due to be published this year by the human rights organisation Reprieve , also claims there have been more than 200 new cases of rendition since 2006 , when President George Bush declared that the practice had stopped .
It is the use of ships to detain prisoners , however , that is raising fresh concern and demands for inquiries in Britain and the US .
According to research carried out by Reprieve , the US may have used as many as 17 ships as " floating prisons " since 2001 .
Detainees are interrogated aboard the vessels and then rendered to other , often undisclosed , locations , it is claimed .
Ships that are understood to have held prisoners include the USS Bataan and USS Peleliu .
A further 15 ships are suspected of having operated around the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , which has been used as a military base by the UK and the Americans .
Reprieve will raise particular concerns over the activities of the USS Ashland and the time it spent off Somalia in early 2007 conducting maritime security operations in an effort to capture al - Qaida terrorists .
At this time many people were abducted by Somali , Kenyan and Ethiopian forces in a systematic operation involving regular interrogations by individuals believed to be members of the FBI and CIA .
Ultimately more than 100 individuals were " disappeared " to prisons in locations including Kenya , Somalia , Ethiopia , Djibouti and Guantánamo Bay .
Reprieve believes prisoners may have also been held for interrogation on the USS Ashland and other ships in the Gulf of Aden during this time .
The Reprieve study includes the account of a prisoner released from Guantánamo Bay , who described a fellow inmate 's story of detention on an amphibious assault ship .
" One of my fellow prisoners in Guantánamo was at sea on an American ship with about 50 others before coming to Guantánamo ... he was in the cage next to me .
He told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship .
They were all closed off in the bottom of the ship .
The prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on TV .
The people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in Guantánamo . "
Clive Stafford Smith , Reprieve 's legal director , said : " They choose ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers .
We will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their legal rights .
" By its own admission , the US government is currently detaining at least 26,000 people without trial in secret prisons , and information suggests up to 80,000 have been ' through the system ' since 2001 .
The US government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are , where they are , and what has been done to them . "
Andrew Tyrie , the Conservative MP who chairs the all - party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition , called for the US and UK governments to come clean over the holding of detainees .
" Little by little , the truth is coming out on extraordinary rendition .
The rest will come , in time .
Better for governments to be candid now , rather than later .
Greater transparency will provide increased confidence that President Bush 's departure from justice and the rule of law in the aftermath of September 11 is being reversed , and can help to win back the confidence of moderate Muslim communities , whose support is crucial in tackling dangerous extremism . "
The Liberal Democrat 's foreign affairs spokesman , Edward Davey , said : " If the Bush administration is using British territories to aid and abet illegal state abduction , it would amount to a huge breach of trust with the British government .
Ministers must make absolutely clear that they would not support such illegal activity , either directly or indirectly . "
A US navy spokesman , Commander Jeffrey Gordon , told the Guardian : " There are no detention facilities on US navy ships . "
However , he added that it was a matter of public record that some individuals had been put on ships " for a few days " during what he called the initial days of detention .
He declined to comment on reports that US naval vessels stationed in or near Diego Garcia had been used as " prison ships " .
The Foreign Office referred to David Miliband 's statement last February admitting to MPs that , despite previous assurances to the contrary , US rendition flights had twice landed on Diego Garcia .
He said he had asked his officials to compile a list of all flights on which rendition had been alleged .
CIA " black sites " are also believed to have operated in Thailand , Afghanistan , Poland and Romania .
In addition , numerous prisoners have been " extraordinarily rendered " to US allies and are alleged to have been tortured in secret prisons in countries such as Syria , Jordan , Morocco and Egypt .
The Chinese government planned the year of the Olympic games in Beijing on 8 - 24 August 2008 as a demonstration of the country 's pride and confidence on the global stage .
So far , it has not turned out that way .
The Tibet protests in mid-March , and the disruption of the Olympic - torch relay that followed , have created confusion in government circles .
Now , the earthquake in Sichuan on 12 May has presented the authorities with another severe challenge of management and public relations .
A triumphal year is becoming ever more tense .
Li Datong is a Chinese journalist and a former editor of Bingdian ( Freezing Point ) , a weekly supplement of the China Youth Daily newspaper
Among Li Datong 's recent articles in openDemocracy :
" Beijing 's Olympics , China 's politics " ( 22 August 2007 )
" China 's media change : talking with Angela Merkel " ( 6 September 2007 )

" Taipei and Beijing : attitudes to historical truth " ( 12 December 2007 )
" Xiamen : the triumph of public will " ( 16 January 2008 )
The official reaction to this series of events is part of a pattern that reveals much about how China is ruled and how its leaders think .
In this sense , their response is not random but a case - study in the nature of modern governance in China .
The torch of merit
The Olympic - torch relay suffered unprecedented disruption in Britain , France and other countries , and has at times descended into chaos .
In response , the Chinese government , through the media , launched an unprecedented counterattack .
Now that the torch is back on Chinese soil , the media war has abated .
The Chinese government 's fury is easily understood - the protests were a total humiliation for China .
This is the biggest blow to the country 's image for twenty years .
The only comparable setback came after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 .
Then , China 's reputation suffered almost irreversible damage in the face of international condemnation and sanctions from the United States and Europe .
But at least the government was prepared for the consequences of its post - Tiananmen repression .
Chinese leaders were ready to make the sacrifice necessary in order to hold onto power .
Deng Xiaoping knew that sanctions against such a large country as China could not go on indefinitely , and that China could ride out the storm .
Deng also understood the importance of repairing China 's image , and as early as 1990 put forward the plan for China to apply to host the Olympics .
The Chinese government never expected such embarrassment over the torch relay .
Over twenty years , the influence of Tiananmen has been diluted , and to international amazement , China 's rapid economic development has made it one of the world 's largest economies .
Every major country has been affected by China 's development .
After its unsuccessful bid to host the 2000 Olympics , China was favourite to be awarded the 2008 games , and emerged victorious .
As a country of over a billion people , a member of the United Nations Security Council and of the World Trade Organisation , China had no less right to be awarded the games than had the Korean military regime in 1988 .
Also , China 's size means that it will be unlikely to slip into debt due to the Olympics , unlike Greece .
In terms of hard facts and figures , China was definitely one of the best - qualified countries to host the games .
The Chinese government was full of confidence , and in principle the torch relay was an idea that would be welcomed by the rest of the world .
But things did not go according to plan .
The claim of right
What the Chinese government did n't realise was that " soft power " , rather than hard power , has become key .
Soft power stems from a country 's human - rights situation .
It depends on the progress a country has made in maintaining universal values , and trust in the country from the international community .
However much the claim is made that the Olympics are and must be separate from politics , there is at least a political minimum that countries have to achieve to qualify as hosts .
It would be hard , for example , to imagine the games being awarded to South Africa under apartheid .
To be fair , China 's human - rights situation has improved since 1989 .
The situation now is the best it has been since 1949 , and this is why the Chinese government feels that is has been treated so unjustly .
" Why does no one talk about our achievements ? " the government wonders .
The answer lies in the rule of law and institutions .
The increasing freedom and improving human rights of the Chinese people lack any substantial legal or systemic foundation .
The government 's overarching concern is still to keep the ruling party in power .
Unrestrained government power can be relaxed and contracted at will .

That is to say , the progress China has made is not necessarily a one - way street .
When things are good , progress can be allowed , but at the first sign of trouble the one - party totalitarian system automatically reverts to type .
It is at these times that the government 's obtuseness and crudeness shocks the world .
For example , as the preparation for the Olympics began in earnest , at a time when the whole world was looking at China 's human - rights record , the government locked up Hu Jia - a fragile young man who has done nothing but publish some articles on the internet - on charges of " subverting the state " .
Questioned on this by foreign media , the normally eloquent Chinese premier Wen Jiabao could only respond that China " is a country with the rule of law " .
In light of the fact that freedom of speech is protected by the Chinese constitution , this answer seems both weak and ridiculous .
Why the government acts so idiotically is beyond comprehension .
The call of Tibet
The recent Tibetan troubles could also have been handled differently .
If a few people want to come out of the temples and protest , what is the problem ?
If the route and time are arranged in accordance with the law , and the people conduct their march , shout their slogans and then go home , why should this cause trouble ?
The more people are repressed , the more they want to rebel , and the consequence is chaos .
A country ruled by law should guarantee its citizens ' right to protest .
In those circumstances , if citizens break the law , they should be stopped without hesitation .
But China has things the wrong way around .
The lawful right to protest of a number of monks was crudely taken away , and then when trouble started there was no timely intervention due to fears over international opinion .
This allowed the riots to get out of control and resulted in loss of life and damage to property .
This theme is exemplified in other respects .
There was a lack of information and preparation on the Tibet issue before the violence broke out , and then after the events the government went into its conditioned response of shutting out foreign journalists , before bringing them back in on organised tours .
The government first blamed anything and everything on the Dalai Lama , and then - after coming under international pressure - announced that it would enter into talks with him .
All of this demonstrates both the government 's passivity and the stupidity ingrained in the totalitarian system .
Whereas some Chinese have been stirred to nationalist emotions by the problems with the torch relay , the Chinese government is in shock .
It needs time to digest the facts .
It needs to ask itself : in the eyes of the world , why are a few people shouting " free Tibet " more persuasive than the hundreds of billions of yuan that the government has invested in Tibet ?
Why does the western public put more trust in information from the media than from the Chinese government ?
Why is an increasingly powerful China seen as a threat rather than a force for peace ?
The bond of law
The tragedy in Sichuan has made headlines across the world .
An intense effort of search and rescue is underway in very difficult terrain .
The Chinese government is acutely aware of the need to perform this task efficiently .
But now that it is more exposed than ever to the scrutiny of its own people as well as foreign media , the mechanisms of control and persuasion it is used to operating by are newly vulnerable .
The problem of trust is just below - and occasionally emerges above - the surface .
The tensions between hard and soft power are on display .
So when will the Chinese government finally wise up ?
The answer is simple - when it does things by the law .
When it unconditionally guarantees the rights of citizens set down in the constitution , and cracks down on those who break the law .
The Chinese government needs to understand that in response to the western media , an independent and free Chinese press would be much more credible than a government spokesperson .
The truth lies not in one voice , but slowly becomes apparent amidst a diverse range of voices .
An understanding of this underlies the effective deployment of soft power .
Whatever happens , the Beijing Olympics will provide many lessons for the Chinese leadership .
If they still have the ability to learn , China 's leaders will be able to turn this would - be triumphal year 's early humiliation into a force for change .
“ There ’s definitely something happening , ” said Peter W. Wood , executive director of the National Association of Scholars , which was created in 1987 to counter attacks on Western culture and values .
“ I hear from quite a few faculty members and graduate students from around the country .
They are not really interested in fighting the battles that have been fought over the last 20 years . ”
Individual colleges and organizations like the American Association of University Professors are already bracing for what has been labeled the graying of the faculty .
More than 54 percent of full - time faculty members in the United States were older than 50 in 2005 , compared with 22.5 percent in 1969 .
How many will actually retire in the next decade or so depends on personal preferences and health , as well as how their pensions fare in the financial markets .
Yet already there are signs that the intense passions and polemics that roiled campuses during the past couple of decades have begun to fade .
At Stanford a divided anthropology department reunited last year after a bitter split in 1998 broke it into two entities , one focusing on culture , the other on biology .
At Amherst , where military recruiters were kicked out in 1987 , students crammed into a lecture hall this year to listen as alumni who served in Iraq urged them to join the military .
In general , information on professors ’ political and ideological leanings tends to be scarce .
But a new study of the social and political views of American professors by Neil Gross at the University of British Columbia and Solon Simmons at George Mason University found that the notion of a generational divide is more than a glancing impression .
“ Self - described liberals are most common within the ranks of those professors aged 50 - 64 , who were teenagers or young adults in the 1960s , ” they wrote , making up just under 50 percent .
At the same time , the youngest group , ages 26 to 35 , contains the highest percentage of moderates , some 60 percent , and the lowest percentage of liberals , just under a third .
When it comes to those who consider themselves “ liberal activists , ” 17.2 percent of the 50 - 64 age group take up the banner compared with only 1.3 percent of professors 35 and younger .
With Wanted ripping up the box office and polarizing action fans , I decided to take a look at some recent action sequences that have really had me on the edge of my seat .
Personally , I was n’t very impressed by Timur Bekmambetov ’s over - the - top approach , but I may be in the minority .
His use of bullet time , slow motion , fast motion , p.o.v. and CG has inspired some while inciting some major eye rolling from others .
Personally , it ’s not the CG that bothers me , but rather the stale approach .
Just have a look at the following list for examples of complex , CG - heavy set pieces with some serious weight behind them .
Better yet , we ’ll also look at the simple approach in creating the ultimate visceral action experience .
Before we begin , there ’s one major stipulation to this list : I ’m only looking at films from the year 2000 on .
I ’ve also decided against including films that I have not yet seen or have not yet been made .
I ’ll be saving those for my ’ 10 Films Which Have n’t Been Made Yet That , Based on Leaked Set Photos and Concept Art , May Include Action Sequences That Will Shake My Reality ’ list .
It ’s interesting to note that of the ten choices , there are only 7 directors .
That ’s right , three directors have two films on this list .
Eat that !
I ’m sure there ’s a shitload of notable films I ’ll be leaving off of here , so feel free to share some examples or contend my choices in the comments section .
10 . Spider - Man 2 – Train Sequence
Spider - Man 2 is probably my favourite super - hero film of all time .
I find it utterly rewatchable .
This is mainly due to it ’s precise tonal balancing act , teetering back and forth between a perfect mix of fantasy and drama .
I think it ’s safe to say I ’m not alone on this one .
I was excited to see the re-teaming of Raimi and cinematographer Bill Pope ( Army of Darkness , Darkman ) , and thrilled that the re-union seemed to have put Sam in a nostalgic state of mind .
I know some Spider - Man purists may have found Raimi ’s Doc Ock ‘ hospital sequence ’ a little too self - refrential , but I thought it was a great return to form and a reminder of how much I ’ve missed the old Sam .
Having said that , as much as I loved that scene , it ’s NOT the number 10 on this list .
As far as CG heavy action sequences go , I ’d have to say Spider - Man 2 ’s subway sequence is the best of the entire trilogy .
I love the use of space around the fast - moving elevated cars as a platform for Raimi to exploit the powers of Spidey and Doc Ock .
It ’s almost dizzying watching the two battle it out standing upright on the side of the car , flipping the axis of the scene and thus adding an whole new dimension .
I especially love Doc Ock slamming Spider - Man through the car windows .
The problem when you get two somewhat balanced super - power ’s fighting it out is the lack of a threat .
Things can get boring pretty quickly .
Thankfully , a subway car full of innocent bystander ’s provides some good collateral damage .
Spidey spends most of his time catching flying bodies in giant make - shift web - based safety nets , all the while holding Doc Ock at bay .
Pretty intense .
Not to mention his final self - sacrificial human - train - brake stunt .
All in all a good time and a creative use of CG .
9. King Kong – Dino - Chase
Although I was n’t a HUGE fan of Peter Jackson ’s King Kong , I must admit his Spielberg - ian ‘ dino - chase ’ set piece was pretty intense .
( If this was a top 20 , Jurassic Park : Lost World would ’ve made my list . )
I just love how ridiculously out of control things get when the Bronto ’s clumsily stumble over eachother .
Sure the compositing may have been a little sketchy , but the image itself was pretty stunning .
Then we ’re stuck in a narrow cavernous pit as T - Rex ’s hang from vines , just out of reach of Ann Darrow .
This scene had me smiling simply due to the ‘ damned if you do , damned if you do n’t ’ nature of it all .
The second things seem to be looking up , the situation just gets worse and worse .
I specifically remember the audience in the theatre responding strongly to Jackson ’s disgusting , giant insects .
Definitely one of the creepier uses of computer generated creatures .
8. United 93 – Storming the Cockpit
I suppose it ’s debatable whether or not this sequence belongs on an ‘ action ’ list ( possibly even a bit disrespectful ? ) , but there ’s no deying that the final 15 minutes of Paul Greengrass ’ ‘ United 93 ′ ( My number 1 film of 2006 ) was one of this decades most intense , visceral , and overall stressful moments in cinema .
An impressive feat considering we all know how it was going to end .
People are pretty down on the ‘ shakey cam ’ action , but I think it ’s a tool that , when used appropriately , can be quite powerful .
This particular scene benefitted greatly from the verite approach .
The sloppiness of this scene is one of the more positively frustrating things I ’ve seen on film .
Watching this group of people attempt to breach the cockpit as the entire plane is banked left and right is almost unbearable .
I still ca n’t believe the level of immersion Greengrass achieved with this scene .
One notable element is the music , which relies on a slow aching build rather than a typically percussion - heavy approach .
How people can write this film off as ‘ boring ’ blows my mind .
7. Oldboy – Hallway Fight
Speaking of sloppy fights , I was especially surprised to see such an ungracious action sequence in an Asian film .
( Is that racist ? )
I think the hallway fight scene in Oldboy was the most memorable moment for me .
( Even beating out the live Octupus ! )
I love the complete aversion to cutting and shakiness , instead relying on a simple dolly movement to allow you to completely analyze the action .
Also , the side - scrolling video game imagery is pretty cool .
I just love the desperation of the scene .
6. Eastern Promises – Naked Knife Fight
The approach is simple and effective .
A knife fight in a bath house .
The catch ?
A naked Viggo Mortensen .
The power of this scene is in its simplicity , relying on pure hand to hand combat with a twist .
Putting the ‘ hero ’ in such a vulnerable setting triples the threat and helps the audience sense every swing of the knife blade , wincing twice has hard every time the blade makes contact .
Not only is it physically intimidating , but the idea of 1 . wrestling with a naked man covered in blood , and 2 . defending yourself form a knife wielding Russian in the nude , are equally unimaginable and disgusting .
It works from both points of view .
To top it off , Cronenberg manages to find some wonderfully brutal ways to put an end to the whole sha-bang .
A great scene .
5. Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the Ring – Troll Fight
Although Jackson ’s giant battle sequences did n’t do much for me , I do remember really reacting to the Troll Fight in the first film .
In fact , it may be the only part of the trilogy I really remember .
I think what made this scene work for me was the choice to drop the score .
The sound design sells the entire scene .
Looking back on it now the CG effects do feel a touch dated , but the man - in - suit Goblins are still pretty creepy .
I do n’t think the remaining films of the trilogy ever captured such a viscerally compelling action sequence .
I love the shaft of light in the middle of the room .
4. Bourne Ultimatum
Rather than focusing on actual sequences , I ’d like to point out two specific moments in The Bourne Ultimatum that sent shivers up my spine .
The first ; Matt Damon jumping from one building through the window of an opposite building .
A pretty standard move that is made thrilling by the camera weilding stuntman that follows right behind him !
What a great shot .
This is what I mean when I talk about wanting to feel as though the camera man is right there , face first in the shit .
The fact that they did it practically makes it all the more awesome .
Second is the ‘ desperate measures ’ taken by Bourne whenever he ’s in a pinch .
This guy will do whatever it takes , no matter how bruised and battered the resulting actions will leave him .
In this case , he drives full speed in reverse off the top of a parking garage .
I love the fact that it ’s not pretty , and definitely not graceful .
He does what he has to do and does n’t give a fuck if it looks like ballet .
GO BOURNE !
3. Kill Bill – Crazy 88’s
The next two choices are both Tarantino films .
Odd , considering that in the 90’s , he was simply known as the guy who can write great dialogue .
The body count goes through the roof as Uma Thurman cuts her way through the Crazy 88 ’s in a carefully choreographed sequence that reminds me how it can be to watch carefully choreographed action unfold under controlled , cinematic conditions .
Robert Richardson ’s trademark spot - lit overhead key lights add a fantastic glow to everything , and Tarantino ’s knack for combining music with imagery ( in this case , the 5,6,7,8’s ) really shines through here .
I ’m excited to see the uncut version , sans black & white .
I have a strange love / hate relationship with kung fu .
I ’m not a fan of wire work , but it seems the sloppier it is , the more I dig it .
In this case , Tarantino seemed to be challenging the Shaw Brothers kung fu films of the 1970’s .
There ’s no concern for realism .
In fact , the opposite holds true .
This fight is meant to be pure cinema .
Blood spraying as a representation of death rather then a realistic portrayal of it .
2. Death Proof – Car Chase
Although I loved the entire film , even hater ’s have to admit the two major action set pieces in Tarantino ’s Death Proof are amazing .
The final 30 minutes of the film are essentially built as a tribute to stunt drivers and the road films of the 70’s , showcasing Zoe Bell as a new female talent in the industry .
Tarantino manages to capture every possible cool angle throughout this chase , and does proudly without any CG .
( Maybe some wire removal ? )
Everything is shot low to the ground as the road blurs by , tipping you off as to how fast they really are going .
It ’s a lengthy sequence that ends with a surprising twist , and a definite return to form for Kurt Russel .
If only Neil Marshall ’s ‘ Doomsday ’ took this similar approach to it ’s car sequences .
1. Children of Men – The Long Take
Here is the perfect example of how to use CG in an action scene ; invisibly .
As with the previously mentioned hallway scene in Oldboy , Alfonso Cuaron seems to be inspired by the first person immersion of video games like Call of Duty and Medal of Honour , choosing to play out his two major action sequences in long , single takes .
( with hidden cuts of course )
The goal , of course , is to simulate the look and feel of war journalism .
Mission accomplished .
The final scene of the film plays out like a Universal Studios ride .
( minus the creepy mechanical E.T. saying your name as you exit )
Blood splatters onto the lens , explosions shoot dust and debris everywhere , characters cross paths only to lose each other and eventually meet up again in different locations .
Watching Clive Owen traverse the battle field is probably the closest I ’ll get to experiencing the thrill of paint ball .
Or war I suppose .
Nah , paintball .
Talks between Iraq and the United States over long - term security arrangements are deadlocked because of U.S. demands that encroach upon Baghdad 's sovereignty , the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki said Friday .
The negotiations are aimed at providing a legal basis for a long - term U.S. troop presence in the country when a United Nations mandate expires on Dec. 31 , as well as separate long - term deals on political , economic and security ties between the two countries .
In his strongest comments yet on the debate , al - Maliki echoed concern by Iraqi legislators that the U.S. proposals would give Washington too much political and military leverage over Iraqi affairs .
" The first drafts presented left us at a dead - end and deadlock , " he told reporters in Amman , Jordan .
" So , we left these first drafts and the negotiations will continue with new ideas until the sides reach a formula that preserves Iraq 's sovereignty . "
Officials say proposals to entrench powers of arrest for American troops and to give them immunity from prosecution in Iraq are the most controversial measures being discussed .
" One of the important issues that the U.S. is asking for is immunity for its soldiers and those contracting with it .
We reject this totally , " al - Maliki said .
U.S. hopeful talks will succeed
U.S. negotiators offered new proposals this week after Iraqi legislators expressed outrage over the direction of the negotiations , claiming that accepting the U.S. position would cement American military , political and economic domination of this country .
The U.S. embassy in Baghdad stressed the pact was important for Iraq 's security .
" Those discussions are based on the fundamental principle of U.S. recognition of and respect for Iraq 's sovereignty , " embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo said .
" We remain hopeful , as do our Iraqi government partners , regarding a successful conclusion to these negotiations , " she added in an e-mailed statement to the Associated Press .
The mounting Iraqi criticism has raised doubt that a deal could be reached before the U.S. presidential election in November .
The issue also has taken on importance among Iraq 's fractured political parties as they prepare for provincial elections expected in the fall .
An aide to Iraq 's pre-eminent Shiite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , urged negotiators to protect the national interest during a sermon Friday in the holy city of Karbala .
Democrats also doubtful
" Iraq 's sovereignty and economy must be protected , " the aide told worshippers .
Democrats in the United States have also expressed unease about the negotiations , fearing that an agreement could lock the next U.S. administration into a long - term troop presence in Iraq that a Democratic administration might want to curtail .
The United States has similar pacts , known as " status of force agreements , " with 80 countries .
I ’m not totally sure this is n’t a hoax , but there is a website out there encouraging people to vote for George W. Bush in 2008 .
How ?
By writing in his name .
What about term limits ?
Why those pesky things are man ’s law , not god’s .
The God who parted the Red Sea is surely not worried about so - called “ term limits ” .
When you vote your faith you let Almighty God take care of the details .
What makes me suspect it is a hoax are the bumper stickers , which they are selling for $ 8 a pop , with catchy slogans like

Obama begins firsthand look at Baghdad RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008
Print This Email This ( White House sought ' clarification ' after Iraqi PM backed Obama Iraq plan ) Barack Obama began Monday his first on - the - ground inspection of Iraq since launching his bid for the White House , with U.S. commanders ready to brief him on progress in a war he long opposed and Iraqi leaders wanting more details of his proposals for troop withdrawals .
His stops in Baghdad  and other areas of the country  marked the second major leg of a war zone tour that opened in Afghanistan .
The contrasts in tone and message were distinct .
Obama sees the battle against the resurgent Taliban and al - Qaida in Afghanistan as America 's most crucial fight and supports expanding troop strength to counter a sharp rise in attacks .
But Obama had stood against the Iraq invasion and now worries that an open - ended U.S. combat mission will sap military resources and focus  at a time when Iraq violence has dropped to its lowest level in four years .
The Illinois senator  traveling in a congressional delegation with Sens. Jack Reed , D - R.I. , and Chuck Hagel , R - Neb .
 arrived in the country early Monday .
Their first stop was Basra , the U.S. Embassy said .
Basra is the center for about 4,000 British troops involved mostly in training Iraqi forces .
An Iraqi-led offensive begun in March reclaimed control of most of the city from Shiite militia believed linked to Iran .
Travel plans for the Democratic presidential candidate were kept secret , but he was seen arriving for a meeting with Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in the heavily protected Green Zone .
Obama has made no public statements since arriving in Iraq .
There was no noticeable tightening of security on Baghdad 's streets and inside the Green Zone .
The meetings were expected to include the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and other military chiefs outlining the significant gains in recent months against both Shiite militia and Sunni insurgents including al - Qaida in Iraq .
The White House and military leaders  and many residents of Baghdad  trace the momentum back to last year 's buildup of more than 30,000 troops in areas around Iraq 's capital .
Obama 's challenger , Sen. John McCain , has tried to hammer Obama on his critical remarks before the so - called " surge . "
In an interview Monday on ABC's " Good Morning America , " McCain said he hoped Obama would now " have the opportunity to see the success of the surge . "
" This is the same strategy that he voted against , railed against , " McCain said .
" He was wrong about the surge .
It is succeeding and we are winning . "
All five surge brigades have left Iraq , but there are still about 147,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq , more than in early 2007 .
Obama has endorsed removing U.S. combat forces over a 16 - month period , but has been less precise on the size and type of U.S. military role needed in Iraq after an exit from the battlefield .
Iraqi leaders are expected to press Obama for more clarity on his long - term vision .
Such discussions have added importance since Iraq and U.S. negotiators appear stalled in efforts to reach a long - range pact to define future U.S. military presence and obligations .
American diplomats hoped to reach a final accord by the end of the month , but it now seems the goal is a stopgap " bridge " document that would maintain the status for U.S. forces once a U.N. mandate on their presence expires at the end of the year .
Such as move would leave the hard bargaining to the next president .
Iraqi leaders , meanwhile , have gained a new measure of self assurance with revenue from record high oil prices and Iraqi- led successes to hobble Shiite militias believed linked to Iran .
Recently , Iraqi leaders have increasing pressure for some kind of timetable for U.S. troop withdrawals .
Last week , the White House agreed to work on a " general time horizon " for removing U.S. troops  a significant reversal from President Bush 's longheld opposition to discuss any timeframes .
Obama is likely to face more questions about his pullout plans from al - Maliki .
Al - Maliki was quoted last week by a German magazine appearing to endorse Obama 's 16 - month timetable .
The Iraqi leader 's aides have since said his remarks were misunderstood , and he is not taking sides in the U.S. election .
The New York Times reports that " Maliki 's interview prompted immediate concern from the Bush administration , which called to seek clarification from Mr. Malikis office , American officials said . "
The Times article continues , " Scott M. Stanzel , a White House spokesman with President Bush at his ranch in Crawford , Tex. , said that embassy officials explained to the Iraqis how the interview in Der Spiegel was being interpreted , given that it came just a day after the two governments announced an agreement over American troops .
' The Iraqis were not aware and wanted to correct it , ' he said . "
In addition , " Diplomats from the United States Embassy in Baghdad spoke to Mr. Malikis advisers on Saturday , said an American official , speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss what he called diplomatic communications .
After that , the governments spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , issued a statement casting doubt on the magazines rendering of the interview .
The statement , which was distributed to media organizations by the American military early on Sunday , said Mr. Malikis words had been ' misunderstood and mistranslated , ' but it failed to cite specifics . "
" Unfortunately , Der Spiegel was not accurate , " the governments spokesman told the Times .
" I have the recording of the voice of Mr. Maliki .
We even listened to the translation . "
However , the paper notes , " the interpreter for the interview works for Mr. Malikis office , not the magazine .
And in an audio recording of Mr. Malikis interview that Der Spiegel provided to The New York Times , Mr. Maliki seemed to state a clear affinity for Mr. Obamas position , bringing it up on his own in an answer to a general question on troop presence .
The following is a direct translation from the Arabic of Mr. Malikis comments by The Times : ' Obamas remarks that  if he takes office  in 16 months he would withdraw the forces , we think that this period could increase or decrease a little , but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in Iraq .
Who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in Iraq . ' "
It was unclear whether Obama would make any public appearances or comments while in Iraq .
But even a low - key visit may garner more scrutiny than any stage of his overseas trip , which is scheduled to move on to Jordan , Israel and European capitals .
Iraq is one of the lighting rods in the presidential showdown with McCain .
McCain has been critical of Obama 's position on Iraq , saying the decision to pull out should be determined by progress , not a timetable .
McCain also strongly backed the troop surge into Iraq last year .
McCain 's foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , said Obama " is stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal that places politics above the advice of our military commanders , the success of our troops , and the security of the American people . "
There is no question that Iraq is a significantly different place than during Obama 's first visit in January 2006 , when the country was caught in a growing Sunni insurgency and was moving toward a flood of Sunni - Shiite violence .
Militant attacks and targeted killings by sectarian death squads is sharply down  by many measures back to levels before the rise of the Sunni insurgency in 2004 .
So far this month , the U.S. military has reported nine soldier deaths in Iraq , in addition to the discovery of two bodies of soldiers abducted last year .
The lowest monthly toll of the war was this May , when 19 military deaths were reported .
In Afghanistan , meanwhile , U.S. military officials say the number of attacks in eastern regions , where most of the foreign troops are American , has increased by 40 percent so far in 2008 compared with the same period in 2007 .
But there are pockets of concern in Iraq .
Bombings and slayings have been creeping higher in the northern city of Mosul , the last main urban stronghold for al - Qaida in Iraq .
Insurgents also remain entrenched in the Diyala Province northeast of Baghdad and a main gateway to the city .
Iraqi authorities have announced plans to send more forces into the area .
Iraqi leaders also continue to stumble on some political measures supported by Washington .
The nation 's election commission on Sunday proposed delaying important provincial elections from this October until near the end of the year .
Iraq 's parliament has been unable to reach agreement on the guidelines for the voting , which would hand greater powers to regional authorities and is seen as a vital step toward national reconciliation .
Obama arrived following a brief stop in Kuwait , a key U.S. ally .
The delegation met Sunday with the emir , Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah , and other senior officials , the Kuwait News Agency reported .
In Afghanistan , Obama met with U.S. military commanders and troops and held talks with President Hamid Karzai .

Open Letter to Barack Obama
DIGG THIS
Mr. Barack Obama U.S. Senate Washington D.C .
Dear Senator Obama :
As a libertarian , I must of course support for the presidency of the U.S. in the upcoming election whoever is the candidate of the Libertarian Party .
( It ’s a libertarian thing ; you would n’t understand . )
However , as a citizen , and political actor , I must acknowledge that the three people with by far the best chance of being elected in the fall are you , Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
I favor you above the other two .
Why ?
In a word , foreign policy .
I think you are the least likely to utilize nuclear weapons against a country ( Iran ? China ? ) that has not attacked us .
I think you are the most likely to withdraw our troops from Iraq most quickly and expeditiously .
Not that I trust you entirely on these matters .
It is just that I think bellicose Hillary , and Mad Bomber McCain , are far more likely to instigate the nuclear horror , and to refrain from ending the debacle in Iraq , than you are .
Foreign policy in my view is more important than either economics or civil liberties .
For it is in wartime that rights in these two other areas are typically abrogated ( see here , here and here ) .
And , in this area , you stand head and shoulders above the other two major candidates .
( This is n’t saying all that much , given their views , but , when you limit your scope to the major candidates , you ’ve got to accept the best you can get . )
What of civil liberties and civil rights ?
None of you three are going to abolish affirmative action , political correctness law , the myriad of laws of this sort that now plague us .
McCain might even be better than you and Hillary on these issues , but , as I say , this is relatively unimportant .
What of economics ?
Here , all three of you are socialists of various stripes .
McCain has recently been trying to " pass " as a born - again free enterpriser .
But I ’ll never forget his gratuitous attack on " profits " during one of the Republican debates .
He may talk the talk , as he is now instructed to do by his advisors , but I know that in his heart he is no supporter of free markets .
Hillary will say and do whatever she thinks she needs to do to become elected ; in a sense , she has no heart at all .
You are different .
I discern , or at least think I do , that beneath your ultra-liberal ( socialist ) voting record , and mindless demagogic sloganeering ( " Yes we can . "
Come on , give me a break ; does n’t this sort of thing embarrass you ? ) , there is a real concern for people , particularly the poor .
So , I ’m rooting for you , at least vis–vis Clinton and McCain .
In return for my valuable support ( I also championed the candidacy of Kerry , and you know where that got him ) , I would like to obligate you to at least listen to some friendly , constructive , advice I am now about to offer you .
1 . If Hillary somehow , do n’t ask , wins the Democratic nomination and offers you the Vice Presidency on her campaign , do seriously consider taking it .
Why not ?
In another eight years , you will still be a relatively young man .
On the other hand , if you win as expected , do NOT , if you value your life , offer her second position on your ticket .
I do n’t know how to say this without possibly running afoul of the law against libel , so let me just say this : Vince Foster .
No rational insurance company would underwrite your life for more than six months with that virago as your veep .
2. Getting out of Iraq ?
Good .
No , excellent !
But why , pray tell , go into Afghanistan ?
They , too , pose no serious threat of an attack on the U.S. , surely the only justification for a declaration of war .
( Not that anyone , nowadays , avails himself of so old - fashioned a congressional approval . )
As Ron Paul has said on more than one occasion , 9/11 was the work of a bunch of thugs , not that of a sovereign state .
In any case , most of the culprits were Saudi Arabians ?
Should we attack them ?
Hardly .
Why then Afghanistan ?
No , bring the troops home , and keep them there , until and unless an actual invasion is threatened .
We have some 700 plus military bases in over 100 different countries .
Does that sound like defense to you ?
Thought not .
3. Learn some economics , for goodness sakes .
If you really want to help the poor , realize that minimum wages , unions , tariffs , price controls , and fiat currency , are not exactly the right way to go about accomplishing this task .
Of the three major candidates , you seem by far to be the one most open to alternative viewpoints .
Go get Adam Smith ’s The Wealth of Nations , or better yet , pretty much any of the publications of Ludwig von Mises or Murray N. Rothbard , and read them .
Here are two great introductory places to start : Henry Hazlitt ’s Economics in One Lesson and Rothbard ’s What Has Government Done To Our Money ?
You wo n’t even have to buy either ; they are both available on the web for free !
And , I promise that if you so much as look at these latter two publications , I will stand ready to answer any questions you may have and to otherwise tutor you on basic economics .
Yours truly , Walter E. Block , Ph.D .

A new audit concludes that rookie attorneys with Republican roots got interviewed for plum Justice Department jobs while their liberal - leaning counterparts got passed over .
The Justice Department audit released Tuesday found that a screening program installed in 2002 weeded out job applicants who had liberal or Democratic ties .
Improper use of the screening program peaked in 2006 , when politics and ideology disqualified what the audit called a significant number of newly graduated lawyers and summer interns seeking jobs .
READ THE REPORT : Dept. of Justice audit ( pdf file )
The long - awaited report confirms widespread criticism last year that the once fiercely independent Justice Department was victim to political meddling by the Bush administration .
The scandal led to the resignation last September of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
" Many qualified candidates were deselected by the screening committee because of their perceived political or ideological affiliations " in 2006 , the audit concludes .
It found that such disqualifications " constituted misconduct and also violated the department 's policies and civil service law that prohibit discrimination in hiring based on political or ideological affiliation . "
Two of the people who ran the job applicant screening program in 2006 no longer work at Justice , however , and " are no longer subject to discipline by the department for their actions , " the report found .
Democrats quickly seized on the report to bludgeon the Bush administration for playing politics with law and order .
" Yet again , the department has been putting politics where it does n't belong , " House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich . , said in a statement .
" When it comes to the hiring of nonpartisan career attorneys , our system of justice should not be corrupted by partisan politics .
It appears the politicization at Justice was so pervasive that even interns had to pass a partisan litmus test . "
Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , called the audit " troubling " and said he expects to see more evidence later " on the extent to which the Bush administration has allowed politics to affect and infect the department 's priorities . "
The audit is the first of several reports to be issued this year looking at how deeply politics seeped into the Justice Department during the Bush administration .
Internal Justice watchdogs — at the department 's Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility — also are looking at the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 and management problems by Gonzales during his two years as attorney general .
Gonzales ' successor , Attorney General Michael Mukasey , said he agrees with all the audit 's recommendations to prevent politics from influencing the screening process — and has already moved on them .
" I have also made clear , and will continue to make clear , that the consideration of political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees is impermissible and unacceptable , " Mukasey said in a statement .

Burglary suspect dies after Taser shock in NE Houston
A burglary suspect died early Monday after being shocked twice with a Taser during a struggle with police officers in northeast Houston .
The incident began about midnight with a burglary report from a home in the 9700 block of Galaxy , police spokesman John Cannon said .
An officer who responded to the call saw the man running from the home into a wooded area near North Wayside and pursued him , Cannon said .
The officer caught up with the man and was struggling with him on the ground when another officer , R.P. Johnson , arrived and used his Taser to stun the suspect , who was described as weighing at least 250 pounds .
" The suspect remained combative , rolling around on the ground , " Cannon said .
Johnson fired another Taser dart at the man , and the struggle ended , Cannon said .
Paramedics took the man , who was not carrying any identification , to Memorial Hermann Northwest Hospital , where he was reported dead at about 2:25 a.m. , Cannon said .
Late Monday , officials still had not identified the man .
HPD homicide detectives and internal affairs officers classified the incident as an " in-custody death , " he said .
Since HPD began using Tasers in December 2004 , officers have used the electrical shock devices about 1,600 times , Cannon said .
" Not one time has it been the official cause of death of a suspect at the hands of a Houston police officer , " Cannon said .
The Harris County Medical Examiner 's Office will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death and whether the man was under the influence of alcohol or drugs .

i Phone fans in the UK have struggled to get their hands on the latest version of the popular smartphone .
A glitch with the online registration system run by the O2 network meant that many people could not activate their devices at Apple stores .
The same glitch hit O2 stores but was quickly resolved , according to the firm , which is the only network to offer the iPhone in the UK .
In addition , many stores sold out within hours of opening .
The new version , which is cheaper and faster , went on sale in 22 countries .
More than 1,500 people lined up outside one Tokyo store , whilst guards in kevlar vests and helmets stood watch over 500 devices in Hong Kong .
US discontent Some customers who had waited patiently to buy the new iPhone could not get them activated and those who were trying to upgrade were left disappointed with blocked or broken phones , Maggie Shiels writes from Silicon Valley .
One Palo Alto customer was pleased , but some in the US were unhappy Dale Larson , who queued up in San Francisco for 36 hours so he could be first to get into the store said : " The iPhone was cool because you did n't have to deal with bad service .
I am certainly disappointed they have reverted it . "
A spokesman for AT&T , the exclusive carrier for the iPhone in the US said there was a global problem with Apple 's iTunes servers that prevented the phones from being fully activated in - store , as had been planned .
Spokesman John Britton said " There is so much demand on the infrastructure , it 's slowing things down considerably . "
Unlike last year 's launch when customers activated their phones at home , this year Apple and AT&T planned to perform the procedure in stores to get customers on a contract and to thwart those that illegally unlock the handset .
At&T are now advising customers to sync their iPhones with iTunes at home .
Christopher Finke told the TechCrunch blog " If you stand in line to be one of the first people to buy a new gadget , do n't be surprised when things do n't go smoothly .
That 's the price you pay for being first . "
There has been no comment from Apple .
Software glitch A student in New Zealand who queued for more than 60 hours was thought to be the first to buy a device .
Jonny Gladwell waited in freezing temperatures to get his hands on the phone , which also now sports GPS .
" I 'm going to put this on charge , have a play around with it and have a nice long sleep , " he said .
In the UK many people waited through the night to be the first through the doors of stores selling the phone .

So this is a game - changer - but Apple has written some very rigid rules .
It controls access to the Apps Store and to the iPhone
Rory Cellan - Jones , BBC technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full About 150 people were outside Apple 's flagship store in London 's Regent Street waiting for it to open at 08:02 GMT .
Student David Suen bought his place at the front of the Regent Street queue off eBay for less than £ 50 .
He said : " I 've been waiting for this since the last iPhone because of 3G . "
Many shops rapidly sold out , despite some shops limiting sales to one per customer and two for business customers .
" We had queues at most stores , " said an O2 spokesperson .
" Where those queues exceeded the number of devices we had in the stock room , we let people at the back of the line know this first thing so they would n't have to wait in vain . "
Both O2 and the Carphone Warehouse had to suspend online orders for the iPhone earlier this week , after " incredible demand " .
Exclusive deal
In addition a system needed to register customers for an O2 contract went down on Friday morning .
" We always have resiliency built in so we quickly moved to our plan B which worked smoothly and after some initial hold ups first thing this morning we were able to process customers at normal speeds in O2 and Carphone stores , " said the spokesperson .
However , Apple stores did not have access to the same back - up systems and have had to either turn customers away or collect their details to register their phones at a later date .
O2 IPHONE PRICES 16GB iPhone monthly contract £ 30 per month - £ 159 £ 35 per month - £ 159 £ 45 per month - £ 59 £ 75 per month - free
In the UK the iPhone is only available on the O2 network on a monthly contract .
Existing customers can upgrade for free if they agree to a new 18 month contract .
Other fees may apply depending on which tariff customers sign up for .
Like the first iteration , the new model is a music player , web browser and phone though the new version can use faster mobile networks and tap into location - based services via GPS .
It is available with either 8 or 16GB of memory onboard .
The phone can also support programs not written by Apple .
Prior to the launch Apple opened up its App Store on which can be found add - on applications for the phone .
Early applications include games , social networking applications , instant messaging and online auction software .
Many of the programs are free to use and download but others must be bought .
Apple has also faced criticism from some software developers who say the process of picking which programs feature on the App Store is angled in favour of US firms .

July 16 : This post has been corrected .
Republicans are blocking a bill that would force the disclosure of donors to President Bush ’s library , according to Democrats .
Yesterday we reported that the White House and the president ’s library foundation did not respond to questions about whether there would be any disclosure of donors .
We asked after a lobbyist was caught on tape suggesting that the former president of Kyrgyzstan make a hefty contribution to the library as a way to help procure a meeting with senior administration officials .
Fundraising for presidential libraries is unregulated , and has proven controversial in the past , especially for former President Clinton , who still has n’t released the names of all his foundation ’s donors .
Since last year , a bill has been stalled in the Senate that would require disclosure of major donors to presidential libraries .
The bill , sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , passed the House with only 34 Republicans voting against it .
But the Senate has proven a higher hurdle .
The bill would require the disclosure of contributions to the presidential libraries of all living presidents , current and former , but would not require that donations made before the bill takes effect be disclosed .
“ Republicans have a hold on it because Bush is opposed , ” said Stephen Krupin , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) .
The White House and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ’s ( R - KY ) office did not reply to requests for comment .
The bill cleared the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with bipartisan support in August of 2007 .
But when Democrats sought to pass the bill by unanimous consent in February , Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) objected unless it included an amendment that made it applicable only to future presidents .
" I have always supported transparency in these matters , " Stevens said on the Senate floor , but " I do not believe it is fair to change the rules " on the Bush administration .
" Changing them now would put a greater burden on them than on any other past administration which already finished collected the majority of donations for their libraries . "
Stevens spokesman Steve Wackowski said Stevens is still blocking passage of the bill , because he has not been allowed to offer his amendment .
Update : Late today , Rep. Waxman told us via a statement : " This is one of a series of open government bills currently stalled in the Senate .
We are working with the Senate and hope that the legislation will move expeditiously and be enacted into law . "
What do we do with all that calculation power ?
We build fast cars , giant jumbo jets and worldwide information highways , all of which , in their turn , raise energy consumption .
We also construct opaque financial products , rickety electronic voting systems and contradictory global warming scenarios .
Mechanical calculators may be an inferior technology , but they had the benefit of keeping things on this planet relatively simple .
A brief overview of the most remarkable models .
Being an obsolete technology now , some of these 19th and 20th century calculators are surprisingly sophisticated and fashionable .
Moreover , most are powered by a crank , which makes these gadgets " green " .
Today 's pocket calculators are no power hogs , either .
The thing is that computers took over most calculating jobs from calculators , and a large supercomputer consumes as much energy as a convoy of trucks .
Multiplying and dividing numbers was not always that easy .
Before the arrival of cheap electronic pocket calculators and computers in the 1970s , people relied on an array of low - tech means and machines to calculate taxes , profits or the properties of engineering parts .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Logarithms ( 1614-2008 )
For most of history , people relied only on their brains when they had to make a calculation .
The idea that a machine could count , was unheard of .
The abacus , the only instrument which has been available for some thousands of years ( and is still being used in some places ) , is not really a calculation machine but a memory aid , similar to the writing down of a calculation .
Things changed in the 17th century , when John Napier invented logarithms .
With a logarithm , a multiplication can be transformed into an addition ( and a division into a subtraction ) .
That makes it much easier to translate calculations into a mechanism .
The first mechanical calculation machines , developed by Wilhelm Schickhard , Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz , were not much of a success since they were not very reliable .
But they became the basis for the highly successful mechanical calculators built throughout the 19th and 20 century , when more accurate gears and wheels became available .
2. Mechanical desktop calculators ( 1820 - 1970 )
Mechanical desktop calculators resemble old typewriters , both in their size , weight and operation .
The machines had movable carriages and / or rows of keys .
They were an important tool in business and administration for more than 150 years , especially from the 1900s until the beginning of the 1970s .
The first reliable machine was the Arithmometer invented by Charles Xavier de Colmar in 1820 .
The concept was improved with the impressive pinwheel calculators ( picture below right ) invented by Baldwin and Odhner ( here you find the mechanism and the manual - scroll down the page - of a Pinwheel machine ) .
The Comptometer , introduced in 1885 , was the first mechanical calculator in which numbers were entered ( and processed ) by pressing keys , which made the operation of the machine easier .
Instead of having 10 keys for the numbers from 0 to 9 ( like the keyboards we use today ) , these " adding machines " had columns of 10 keys each , to introduce successively units , tens , hundreds , and so on .
The most " powerful " calculators had up to 20 columns in their full keyboards .
This is how they worked ( picture left : mechanism of a comptometer ) .
Multiplying and dividing required several operations and could take some time .
The keyboard of adding machines was better for fast additions and subtractions , while the carriage of the pinwheels was better for multiplying and dividing .
Some machines ( like the one pictured above ) combined both technologies .
Electric ( not electronic ) driven calculators became common in the 1940s , but hand driven calculators remained popular because they were quieter , smaller , lighter and cheaper .
3 . Slide adder pocket calculators ( 1617 - 1982 )
Napier bones and slide rules , both based on the concept of algorithms logarithms , were invented in the 17th century .
They remained the only portable calculation aids until the Arithmographe , invented in 1889 by the Frenchman Troncet .
Of this device , which was soon known as a " Troncet " , millions were sold .
It was on the market until the 1970s .
These calculators had very diverse and fashionable designs , not unlike a mobile phone or an mp3 - player today .
Both cheap and extremely expensive models existed .
Some of them were operated with a small metal pen , like a PDA now .
The machines were later known as Addiators , after a brand that was created in Germany in 1920 ( and was on the market until 1982 ) .
Some marvellous photo collections of Troncets and Addiators can be found here and here .
A good description of the workings of the device can be seen in this scanned manual from a very popular device in the US , the Baby Calculator .
Contrary to slide rules , these " slide adders " were digital devices , but their mechanism is more related to slide rules and the abacus than to mechanical calculators .
4. Mechanical pocket calculators ( 1947-1970 )
The Curta was the first ( and only ) portable mechanical calculator .
Designed by a prisoner in a concentration camp , it became the most precise portable computer until the arrival of electronic pocket calculators ( with 11 to 15 digits it is even more accurate than most simple electronic models today ) .
The Curta was introduced in 1947 , the last models were produced in 1970 .
The Curta works according to the same principles as the mechanical desktop calculators , but its mechanism is much more compact - the device fits in the palm of your hand .
The Curta combines low - tech sense ( operated by a crank , built to last ) with high - tech precision ( see how it works and how it looks when you take it apart ) .
The only advantages of an electronic calculator over the Curta are portability ( an electronic calculator is even smaller ) and speed - a not too complicated multiplication or division can take up to a dozen of cranks .
Owners of the device say that turning the crank is a real pleasure due to the excellent gearwork .
Later models could also perform squares , cubes , percentages and cosines .
About 140,000 Curta 's were built .
More information on this device can be found here and here .
UPDATE : operate a virtual curta online ( via ) .
5. Mechanical supercomputers ( 1822-2008 )
All calculating devices mentioned above were not suited for very complicated calculations , like those needed by science and navigation .
Until the 1960s , complicated computations were done with the help of mathematical tables , where one can look up the result for every possible calculation that might be needed ( they are still used for some complex calculations , also in computers , where they can increase calculating speed ) .
These columns of numbers - similar to simple multiplication tables - were made by teams of people , called " computers " , who were calculating all day ( often using the machines mentioned above ) .
Producing those tables was labour - intensive and prone to mistakes .
The English inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage took up the plan of automating this process .
He designed a machine that would handle numbers of up to 33 digits and that would print the results , so that not just calculation mistakes but typographical mistakes could be avoided , too .
He presented his first design in 1822 ( The Difference Engine no.1 ) and a second one in 1849 ( The Difference Engine no.2 - find the complete scanned designs here ) .
In between , he completed a design for the first computer ever ( The Analytical Machine , in 1834 ) , which was meant to be driven by steam power .
Babbage never built his machines , except for some parts , but other people did .
In 1853 , father and son Scheutz from Sweden completed a smaller version of the difference engine and in 1875 Martin Wiberg built a version the size of a sewing machine .
A 5 ton replica , based on the original plans of Babbage , will be on display for a year in the American Museum for Computing History , starting this weekend .
Another one can be found in the London Science Museum ( both museum pages contain pictures of the machines ) .
These are the largest mechanical calculators ever built ; the counterparts of the Curta .
A good explanation of the importance of Difference Engines can be found in this chapter of " Computing before computers " ( heavy download ) .
The Difference Engine shows both the marvels and the limitations of mechanical calculators .
The reliability of a mechanical computer depends on the accuracy of the gears , and the heavier they are , the better .
Some people have built Difference Engines with meccano or lego bricks , but those machines deliver less precise results because of the higher flexibility of the lightweight parts .
Constructing a mechanical computer with the calculation capacities of a modern computer would create a monstrous machine , larger than our largest buildings , that would have to be cranked several generations long to produce a result .

One night in Rangoon I had a hard time sleeping and got up early , while it was still dark , and walked a few blocks down to the harbor along the Irrawaddy River , near the Botataung Pagoda where they keep a single strand of the Buddha ’s hair .
It ’s a sacred relic for the Burmese , more than 2,000 years old , encased in gold .
During the Second World War the British bombed the pagoda to rubble , but when the monks dug through the heap they found the hair in perfect condition inside a small box , a miracle , and they rebuilt the shrine around it .
There were dogs sleeping on the street like they owned the place , and a line of 30 or 40 young monks walking single file , from tallest to shortest , exiting the pagoda after early morning prayers .
On a concrete runway along the river , which was perhaps a half - mile wide , men and women were exercising in the dark , doing tai chi and walking backward , listening to the bbc or voa in Burmese on transistor radios .
The sun came up through the thick air , dark red and monstrous .
The river turned from slate to blood to pea soup .
I was depressed .
We ’d come to Burma to see if there might be some hope of a revolution , but people seemed more concerned with making money to buy Game Boys and cell phones , even though a cell phone sim card cost $ 3,000 , the equivalent of 12 years of work at the average yearly salary of about $ 260 .
I do n’t know how many people had told me they were hoping the United States would invade .
The doorman at our hotel said , “ I want you to tell President Bush to send his army .
They will be welcomed by all Myanmar people .
Tell them we have plenty of beer for them to drink . ”
But President Bush … President Bush…oh , I was depressed .
Along the water , the concrete benches under the palm trees were mostly filled by sleeping teenagers , boys and girls , one to a bench .
But at the end of the pier , six boys lay fully awake , listening to their friend sing and play a guitar .
He was maybe 16 years old and the guitar had an iron cross acoustics sticker on the front of it .
I sat down a few feet away , rolled a cigarette , and listened .
The kid had a clear voice , a strong voice , and he was pouring his heart out in a love song , as real as Willie Nelson .
They ’d been up all night , maybe high on methamphetamines , but their clothes were clean , shorts and baseball hats , and they were polite .
I did n’t have a lighter , and the youngest one noticed this and waved to a man walking by and told him to give me a light .
So I sat there and listened and started disintegrating .
This has happened twice before .
The first time was in the Tiki Room at the Bombay Oberoi , listening to a Bengali play guitar and sing “ My Way . ”
The second time was in a Zapatista village in the mountains of Chiapas , listening to a young woman from Montana play guitar and sing “ Redemption Song . ”
Both times I was left in little pieces that took a long time to push back together .
And there along the river , listening to our music , all about yearning for freedom , I again felt overwhelmed by the same juxtapositions and ironies .
Burma is a forgotten country .
You might have a hard time finding it on a map , and it may not even be called Burma on the map you ’re looking at .
It might be called Myanmar , as that ’s the official name for it now .
It ’s an extremely fucked - up place , the size of Texas , located between Thailand and India , south of China .
For the past 44 years , it ’s been cut off from the rest of the world by a junta of xenophobic and superstitious generals calling themselves the State Peace and Development Council .
Others call them mendacious assholes and hungry ghosts .
The population is about 50 million , and they live like imprisoned children , with very little knowledge of their own history and very little opportunity to learn .
Their government controls nearly every aspect of their lives — what they can read , what they can say and think , where they go , how they make money .
Nothing much comes into the country , and nothing much goes out — except opium , teak , and jade by way of the black market , which is also controlled by the military .
Strangely , Burma is open to tourism , but not many people care to visit .
I lied on my visa application , saying I was a college professor ; my travel companion wrote in “ Spiritual Adviser , ” partly as a joke and partly because we were supposed to be visiting the Buddhist temples that dot the landscape .
The country is sometimes called the Golden Land because the bell - shaped pagodas are often covered in gilt .
Before going to Burma , I ’d read how its people are living through an Orwellian nightmare , how in 1988 they turned out in the streets en masse shouting , “ Dee - mo - ka - ra - see ! ” This protest ended with at least 3,000 dead , shot by their own military .
A couple of weeks later , Aung San Suu Kyi , the daughter of the founding father of Burma ’s democratic movement , made a speech from the steps of the Shwedegon Pagoda in Rangoon calling for a second Burmese revolution , and she ’s been under house arrest pretty much ever since — even after she won a national democratic election in 1990 , making her the rightful leader of the country ; even after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 .
So I expected to see a military presence on the streets in Rangoon , the capital city , or what used to be the capital city until late last year when the astrologers of the chief hungry ghost , Chairman Than Shwe , foresaw that it would be prudent to move all government offices 200 miles north to a small malarial city where they could be better defended from enemies foreign or domestic .
I expected to see tanks shaking the ground , or soldiers inside bunkers at the intersections , or checkpoints and roadblocks … something demonstrating who was in control and who was not .
Up in the mountains , the Burmese military was busy burning ethnic tribal villages to the ground , systematically raping women , and forcing hundreds of thousands into slave labor camps .
But in Rangoon it took two days to even see a policeman — traffic cops dressed in white coats and white British Raj helmets , armed only with whistles .
The traffic became gridlocked and no one even honked a horn .
And the people on the streets , who I imagined would be huddling and scurrying about like caged rats , seemed rather calm and even happy , strolling along , the men sashaying in long skirts and sandals , some sitting on the broken sidewalks in kindergarten - sized chairs , drinking tiny cups of tea .
The women , some of them , smeared light brown cellulose paste in circles on their cheeks , which looked sort of wild and exotic , but is actually a traditional way to protect their skin from the sun .
At one of the busier intersections downtown there was a government billboard that said , in English :
PEOPLE’S DESIRE
Oppose those relying on external
elements , acting as stooges , holding
negative views
Oppose those trying to jeopardize stability of the State and progress of the nation
Oppose foreign nations interfering in internal affairs of the State
Crush all internal and external destructive
elements as the common enemy
But up above the billboard , on the rooftops of the apartment buildings , there were fields of satellite dishes gazing up to the sky like sunflowers .
It did n’t make sense .
Inside their homes people were watching cnn , bbc , hbo , and mtv , while out on the street they were supposed to be wary of stooges .
Everywhere we went , we were watched .
Long , intense stares coming from every direction , as if we were out of place and out of time , and it was hard to tell whether the Burmese were wondering if we were “ external destructive elements ” or some second - rate soap opera stars they ’d seen on TV .
They did not , however , appear to be very friendly , and some of them laughed at us .
Yes , a mockery , seconded by legions of squawking crows in every tree .
Men did approach us , trying to sell us shoes , postcards , offering to change money , always some kind of business , and we ’d try to talk to them .
But it was always a pretend conversation .
The reason I say this is because the minute we ’d ask a question about their lives , like “ What ’s it like to live here ? ” the response would be the same — first a turning away , moving the body and the head to the side , then a glazing over of the eyes , a gaze without focus .
It was a turning inward , pulling a shell around their bodies .
“ It is dangerous for us , ” one man said .
“ There are spies everywhere . ”
He was a young social worker for the government , out drinking whiskey with two friends in the Chinatown part of the city .
“ Everyone in Myanmar has either gone to jail or knows someone who has gone to jail for saying the wrong thing .
I have a friend in Insein [ pronounced “ insane ” ]
Prison who held up a sign at a protest .
The sign said only one word , ‘ Freedom . ’
His sentence is seven years . ”
Even other Western tourists spoke in whispers , turning both directions to see if anyone was listening .
This syndrome has a name among some ngo workers — ” Burma Head . ”
In a 1977 book called Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison , Foucault discussed the social effects of surveillance , using a prison designed by Jeremy Bentham in 1787 , called the Panopticon , as a model .
The cells are arranged in a circle around a central observation tower , so that one person inside the tower can see into every cell at all times , but the prisoners , while able to see the tower , never really know whether there is a person in there watching them , or not .
The observer can see out , but the observed ca n’t see in .
Hence the major effect of the Panopticon : to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power .
So to arrange things that the surveillance is permanent in its effects , even if it is discontinuous in its action ; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual exercise unnecessary ; that this architectural apparatus should be a machine for creating and sustaining a power relation independent of the person who exercises it ; in short , that the inmates should be caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the bearers .
This was why there was no visible military presence in the city .
It was n’t necessary .
The people controlled themselves .
Even tourists were not immune .
In the Panopticon of Burma , you were a prisoner among prisoners , each with your own cell .
The effect was a deadening of desire , a flat - lining of curiosity and humor , and loneliness hung in the air , heavy as the smog cloud that covers all of Asia .
There was not a buzz or a whir or a whisper of testosterone among the men , and the women , although many were beautiful , had not an ounce of glamour , not a scent of sensuality among them .
The food was horrendous , cooked in the morning and left to sit through the day at room temperature , so that by dinner the stuff on the plate looked like dark brown entrails and tasted like pure msg .
And while there was a lot of rock and pop music being played all over town , most of it was just awful .
For instance , while on a bus we were subjected to a video of a girl dressed like Britney Spears singing , “ She ’s a maniac , a maniac , on the floor .
And she ’s dancing like she ’s never danced before . ”
Only she stood like a frightened child .
Behind her was a large photograph of Mother Teresa , and every time she came to the refrain she ’d turn around and sing to it .
This is how it went the first few days in Rangoon .
However , things changed , dramatically , on a Sunday evening when we saw a young man carrying a guitar .
Just a guitar .
We were standing outside the Baptist church across from the Sule Pagoda .
The sun was going down and the sky was turning orange and red , and the spotlights were coming on and illuminating the golden dome of the pagoda , traffic circling around the perimeter .
We ’d just come out of the Sunday service .
Christianity is permitted , but the rulers have a problem with anyone who professes a belief in a power higher than them , so being a Christian in Burma is a radical thing and Christians suffer some discrimination because of it .
For instance , they ca n’t rise very far in the military , and they ca n’t hold high positions within the government .
“ You know , ” my spiritual adviser said , “ Buddhists pray and meditate alone , but Christians do it together , in a group , and I think this is why people here become Christians .
Did you see how they stood up and sang those hymns in there ?
They were really into it , not at all like the solemn and glum singing in the churches my parents dragged me to as a kid .
There was a lot of energy in there . ”
Before I had time to agree with her , a young man about 18 or 20 years old came walking by carrying a guitar .
He had long , straight hair down to his shoulders , a little goatee under his chin , and a gold ring in his ear — a hipster .
A hipster with a yellow acoustic guitar in his right hand .
My friend ran over to him and desperately asked him if he would play a song .
He smiled and said he did n’t know how to play , he just liked carrying the guitar around .
“ Well , ” I said , “ if you could play , who would you play like ?
What music do you like to listen to ? ”
And he said , “ Chit San Maung , number one guitar in Myanmar .
Iron Cross , number one band . ”
“ He lives here , in Rangoon ? ”
“ Yes , he lives here .
All Iron Cross live here . ”
“ Do you know where we can find him ? ”
“ No , ” the kid said .
He smiled and walked away .
I guess we just had n’t been paying attention that well , because now we started seeing Iron Cross bumper stickers on the beat - up taxicabs around the city .
Sometimes the cabs had stickers that said , in English , “ Drive Safely . ”
But the only other sticker on any car was either iron cross acoustics or iron cross unplugged .
Also , we started seeing more teenage boys with guitars — sitting in doorways or outside apartment buildings , strumming , trying to learn how to play .
They all knew Chit San Maung .
One kid said he was “ the best guitar player in all of Asia , no question . ”
We heard Iron Cross songs in taxicabs , coming out of apartment windows , and from large speakers set up on the street by kids selling sunglasses .
Some of them sounded like Metallica , some sounded like Hawaiian cowboy music , some were covers , some were original , but the lyrics were always in Burmese .
Those kids selling sunglasses on the street with the big speakers , the song they were listening to was a good example of a typical Iron Cross song .
It started out with kind of a sultry funk , sort of the same mood as the way people in Rangoon walk down the street , kind of relaxed and cool , no problem , or maybe like watching a girl in a summer dress , but then it exploded into heavy metal and loud screaming .
It was the two sides to life in Burma — one calm and relaxed , the other brutally painful .
When I was seven years old , in 1964 , I went over to a friend ’s house after school .
He had a teenage sister , and we were in her bedroom , and she put “ I Want to Hold Your Hand , ” a 45 , on her little box record player .
She hung her head and swayed back and forth so her hair bounced off her cheeks .
Then she started dancing with her arms up in the air , twisting her ass , jumping up and down .
I ’d never seen anything like it , but I knew it was dangerous .
The first time we saw Iron Cross was the same .
We were in a coffee shop for tourists , where a TV screen showed European models strutting around in pajamas .
Then the channel changed to an Iron Cross live performance .
The sound was off , but it was clear they were into something loud and fast … and powerful .
The singer with a shaved head screaming into the microphone , the drummer in a frenzy , and Chit San Maung playing lead guitar as if he were struggling to tame it .
We did n’t need to hear the sound to know what the song was about — sticking it to the man .
It seemed very strange these guys were not in jail .
The next morning we were both sick , coughing up yellowish green phlegm , so we took a taxi to a health clinic inside one of the more expensive hotels in town ( Burma has close to the lowest health care standards of any country in the world ) .
The driver had an English - Burmese dictionary on the dashboard and wanted to talk .
He said he ’d grown up in a village in the mountains along the border with Thailand , but his life there was so boring he left and came to the city to seek his fortune .
“ I have not one good thing to say about the government , ” he said .
“ They ruin my country .
They lie about everything .
Nobody knows the truth .
We cannot .
Have you seen our newspaper ?
Only good news .
All a bluff .
First thing children learn in school is not ask questions .
At university you pay for grades , nobody learns , nobody knows how to make what we need .
We export rubber , we do n’t know how to make tires .
When we buy them , very expensive . ”
“ Could you leave the country if you wanted to go ? ” I asked .
“ Yes , we can go out , if we have money we can go out , but I do n’t have money , only military , black market men have money . ”
“ But if you could leave , would you stay away or would you come back ? ”
“ I love my country , you understand ?
I want to die in my country because I love my people .
If government says we live on 500 kyat [ 43 cents ] a day , we live on 500 kyat a day , okay .
We can do this and be happy with each other , love each other .
But this government is very bad men , ” he said .
“ Do you know the band Iron Cross ? ”
“ Yes , my friend is friend with Chit San Maung , guitar player . ”
By the time we came out of the clinic with some antibiotics , the cab driver had the phone number .
I called Chit and he spoke enough En­glish to understand what I was asking .
Mainly he said yes , yes , yes and that he ’d send a car to pick us up .
The car came at 8 p.m. , a new black Land Cruiser with tinted windows and bumper stickers I had n’t seen on any other car — one of the Jesus fish , and “ No Jesus , No Peace .
Know Jesus , Know Peace , ” “ Never Say Die , ” as well as iron cross acoustics — the name of their new album .
I asked the driver , a young man who said he was in Chit ’s family , if Chit was a Christian , and he said , “ Yes , for sure . ”
“ So are Iron Cross songs religious songs ? ”
“ No , ” he said , “ it ’s not allowed .
No words in English , no Christian words .
Only love songs . ”
Then he stuck in an Iron Cross cd and turned it up loud , maybe to get me to stop asking questions , maybe because it was a beautiful song .
The boulevards in Rangoon are lined with palms and banyan trees .
It ’s not a bad city , the way it ’s laid out , and better at night , weaving through traffic at 40 miles an hour , listening to a song that sounds like it ’s about a train coming down the tracks while passing buses packed tight with people , arms and heads hanging out the windows , flying by frog - legged men pedaling tricycle rickshaws , too fast to really see strange animist shrines with Christmas tree lights or a karaoke bar with women modeling onstage .
Chit ’s house had a wall around the outside and a sign out front that said ptl Digital Studios .
I asked the driver if ptl stood for “ Praise the Lord ” and he said yes .
But when I asked him if he ’d heard of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker , he said no .
Downstairs there was a small recording studio — a sound room and double - paned glass separating the control room .
We were taken up two flights into the production room — carpet on the floor , a large computer and big speakers sitting on a desk , 10 guitars hanging on the wall , Iron Cross concert posters , including one from a 2003 tour to America .
Chit came in and shook our hands , and he was like a 140 - pound lightbulb , so happy we ’d come .
He was with an older man he introduced as his uncle , who , he said , was going to help translate .
He did n’t look like Chit at all , more like a wiseguy type , but at the time I just accepted the thing without question .
Chit said he ’d started playing in church when he was five years old .
He grew up in the village of Henzada northwest of Rangoon , along the Irrawaddy River .
The church had a good choir and they sang “ Amazing Grace , ” things like that , and he also had a Chet Atkins tape that he listened to a lot .
When he was a teenager , he moved to Rangoon and studied with the most famous guitar player in the country at that time .
He was the one who came up with the name Iron Cross with respect , Chit said , to the World War I German medal for heroism , bravery , and leadership .
I asked him where they played in the States , and he said New York , Washington , D.C. , San Francisco , and Los Angeles .
“ Have you heard of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker ? ” I had to ask .
“ No , who are they ? ”
“ Oh , just a couple who had a TV show in America called The PTL Club .
It does n’t matter .
Your driver told us your songs are n’t religious , that the government wo n’t allow it . ”
“ Yes , we give them the words and if they do n’t like them they change the words . ”
“ Does that bother you ? ”
“ No , they do their job , we do ours .
We only play love songs , and sometimes it ’s hard to say who writes the words .
Sometimes the words are not important . ”
“ You know , the first time we saw you was on a TV and the sound was turned off so we could n’t even hear the music , but I saw you have power in your guitar .
It was obvious , just in the way you were playing , and I wondered why you were n’t in jail .
Why does the government let you play anything at all ? ”
Up to that point he understood my questions and answered them by himself , but suddenly he acted like he did n’t understand the question and turned to his uncle for help .
They talked for a minute in Burmese and then the uncle said , “ Iron Cross songs are not about politics . ”
“ But , ” I said , “ have you seen Woodstock , the movie of the concert ? ”
Chit nodded his head .
“ There ’s a part where Jimi Hendrix … you know Jimi Hendrix ? ”
Another nod .
“ There ’s a part where Jimi Hendrix plays ‘ The Star - Spangled Banner , ’ our national anthem , only he tears the hell out of it , kind of makes it burst into flames , and this was during the Vietnam War . ”
Another nod , only barely .
“ I know you can play like that .
I saw you do it on TV . ”
By that time he was turning around and looking at his uncle .
“ If I were the generals , I ’d be worried , big time . ”
Chit grabbed his cell phone from his pocket .
It had n’t gone off but he looked at it like it had and he excused himself and left the room .
I was so stupid .
I ’d lost my head and was talking to him like he was a rock star in America , immune from prosecution , thinking his uncle really was his uncle and his friend .
But the guy was a spook , there to monitor the interview , for sure .
So we sat there in silence for a minute with the uncle , and then my companion tried to break the tension by asking him if he meditates .
“ Yes , ” the uncle said , “ more when I was younger than now .
Now not as much as I would like . ”
“ What do you like about it ? ”
“ Meditation makes you free , ” he said .
“ No worries , no anxiety . ”
“ See ? ” she said to me .
“ You should meditate , it would make you less crazy . ”
And I must have been crazy because I just could n’t shut up .
I asked the uncle , “ Do you know what I ’m talking about ?
Do you understand what I ’m saying about the guitar ? ”
“ Yes , ” he said , “ I think it sometimes might be true , but what you say will not happen here .
People listen to Iron Cross to be happy , to forget their lives .
They gamble on football , English Premier League , for the same reason .
It ’s a diversion . ”
“ So you do n’t see another rebellion coming , like what happened in 1988 ? ”
“ No , people are busy finding money to buy things they want .
Boys today want to fight in video games , not in the street . ”
“ Then what can help ? ”
He thought for a minute and said , “ I ’m afraid nothing can help this . ”
Chit came back into the room , apologized again , and sat down .
There were beads of sweat on his forehead and his light had gone off .
I ’d blown it .
The interview was over .
But as we were leaving , Chit said Iron Cross was going to play on Friday in the park , outdoors , and if we wanted to come , he ’d have some tickets brought by our hotel .
The next day we went to an Internet café to try to find some information on Iron Cross .
We ’d gone in once before but left when the guy behind the counter told us to write down our passport numbers and the name of our hotel , and we noticed that his computer screen showed the website addresses that every customer in the room was visiting .
But people on the street would only tell us that Iron Cross was the best band in the country , nothing more .
And there had to be more , a lot more , than this .
So we went in and wrote down our information and Googled Iron Cross .
Only a few stories came up , but enough to realize the band was under pressure .
The first incident happened in 1995 when the band ’s lead singer , Lay Phyu [ pronounced “ pew ” ] , came out with a solo album called Power 54 .
The title was approved by the censors and the cd was on the shelves in the stores before the authorities realized that 54 is Aung San Suu Kyi ’s address on University Avenue in Rangoon .
The government sent men out in the streets with bullhorns demanding that anyone with a copy of the cd bring it out and hand it over so that it could be burned .
They called Lay Phyu in for a meeting , whereupon he insisted that the name had nothing to do with Aung San Suu Kyi , it merely connoted the number of songs produced by Iron Cross to date , nothing more , and if they wanted he would change the name to Power .
Iron Cross was banned from performing for a period of time , I do n’t know how long , but Lay Phyu did n’t stop causing trouble .
He refused to sing propaganda songs , and a tour to America was canceled .
His hair reached his waist and the government told him to cut it , so he shaved his head .
Iron Cross was asked , or ordered , to perform at the wedding of a military officer ’s son , and Lay Phyu refused , saying , “ These are not our people . ”
Lay Phyu was a rebel , very popular among the poor as well as among the sons and daughters of the military junta .
It was the latter who came to the concert , which was by a lake in an arena the size of a baseball infield , the perimeter surrounded by trees and beer stands .
The tickets cost $ 4 and the beer $ 1 , and a teacher or a lawyer in Burma makes $ 20 a month , so the young people who came , about maybe 4,000 , were not of this class .
Boys arrived with boys , girls arrived with girls , and there was little interaction between them .
About half the boys were dressed conservatively in button - up shirts ; the other half , the hipsters , wore T - shirts with dragons or Nirvana on the front , blue jeans , chains hanging from belts , necklaces , earrings , sneakers .
The girls , except for maybe five , pretty much covered up .
I saw three in short skirts and tight shirts and two in dresses and high heels , but that was about it for the fashion show .
The band came out and launched into a cover of a song I ’d heard before but could n’t name , maybe Nine Inch Nails or Metallica .
The hipsters danced with their hands in the air ; the others stood motionless .
No women danced .
And Lay Phyu was n’t there .
When the song ended , some of the crowd started chanting , “ Lay Phyu ! Lay Phyu ! Lay Phyu ! ”
But he did n’t come out , and the band played another cover of a song I ’d heard before but could n’t name , and then there was more chanting of “ Lay Phyu ! ”
But still no Lay Phyu .
I asked the guy next to me what was up , and he said Lay Phyu had been banned from performing .
It had happened recently and everyone there knew about it — everybody but us .
I wanted the revolution to start right there , but the band played on and the crowd forgot about Lay Phyu .
The hipsters got drunk and danced with their shirts off , tattoos bared , thrashing around in sort of a mosh pit type thing , getting more and more crazy , shaking their long hair and screaming out the words to the songs .
Everybody knew the words to the songs , and as the night went on the band slowed down and it became kind of a group sing - along , the same thing we ’d seen in the Baptist church .
It made me think we ’d made a big mistake after 9/11 by responding with military force .
All we ’ve accomplished so far in the war on terrorism is to make more terrorists , like the sorcerer ’s apprentice chopping up the broom with the ax .
We should drop boom boxes instead of bombs .
Tens of thousands of iPods falling with little parachutes … probably cost less than the smallest bomb we ’ve got .
But when it was over , it was over .
No encores , no lighters .
And the crowd , which had trickled in slowly , left as one great mass , like they could n’t get out of there fast enough , like they thought there was going to be trouble if they stayed , or they did n’t want to be seen as individuals .
Strength in numbers , even when running away .
We ended up in a cab that had the three girls in short skirts in the backseat .
Two of them spoke nearly perfect English , which I thought was a stroke of good luck , but when I asked them “ What ’s the deal with Lay Phyu ? ” they shut up and did n’t speak a word until they got out of the cab at their apartment building .
It was one quiet taxi ride , for sure .
A lot of people would n’t talk about it , and from those who did I got four or five different answers :
He was caught gambling at his house ; he got into an argument with someone else in the band — an ego thing ; he was a drug addict ; and …he ’d been out of the country and recorded a song that was critical of the government and they finally found out about it .
Nobody knew for sure , and this was okay with them .
The day we were leaving the country , Chit ’s Land Cruiser showed up at the Three Seasons and his driver brought in some Iron Cross dvds and cds , and I noticed on the back of one of the cds somebody had circled a song called “ Butterfly . ”
We put it on the house stereo and got a young Burmese woman to translate as best she could .
The song starts off with a woman singing a traditional folk song , just her voice , a loud forlorn wailing .
Then she fades out and drums fade in , followed by Chit ’s guitar exploding like a semi blowing its air brake down a steep hill .
Then it calms down and Lay Phyu starts singing about the village where he grew up , remembering how he could hear his heart beat while walking down the street , the snow falling in winter , the green grass in the spring , how the town was like a story unto itself , but he was a child and had no idea of the outside world and he wanted to know , he wanted to learn .
Then the music gets loud and hard again , violent and angry , and the refrain is something like “ I do n’t know what ’s in front of me , I ca n’t see how the world will end , but I ’m going to find out , whether I like it or not . ”
It ’s a song about a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis , being thrown into a world where time no longer runs in a circle but a straight line , a jet leaving a contrail that quickly evaporates , and there ’s no turning back and no backing down , just a full - on plunge into an uncertain future .
The Chilean portal , Terra.cl , has an absolutely incredible gallery of UPI photographs of the volcano Chaitén 's enormous ash plume intersecting with a thunderstorm .
Chaitén 's unexpected eruption began late last week .
Now , more than 4,000 people have been displaced by the volcano 's first activity in 450 years .
There 's 34 more pictures just like this one waiting for you at :

Mook put the rat poison in her husband 's spaghetti A conwoman who tried to poison her husband with rat killer and anti-depressant tablets has been jailed by a judge at York Crown Court .
Heather Mook , 58 , of Heslington Road , York , will be detained for at least five years as a result of the judge giving her an indeterminate sentence .
Mook gave her fourth husband , John , the poison to confuse him as she fleeced his mother out of £ 43,000 .
The judge said she was being jailed for the protection of the public .
The court heard that as part of her ploy to confuse her husband she mixed rat poison with his spaghetti as she set about stealing his mother 's life savings , money earmarked for her care .
I think she needs some serious help and I hope she gets it
John Mook
She was convicted in December of two counts of poisoning so as to endanger life .
Speaking after the case , her husband John Mook , who has recovered from the poisoning , said his wife needed treatment - not just prison .
Standing on the court steps he said : " I think she needs some serious help and I hope she gets it . "
During the court case the jury heard details of her life of lies and deception .
In 1982 , she poisoned her six - year - old daughter with anti-depressants .
She had stolen money and jewellery from a previous husband , and later pretended to be terminally ill in order to gain money .
The judge described her as a " dangerous woman " .

McCain slips : ' Get those offshore reserves exploited '

Republican presidential candidate John McCain let his tongue get the best of him at a town hall meeting Friday , revealing what critics would say is the true effect of opening US coastlines to drilling he now supports after years of opposing .
" I 'll do everything in my power to get those offshore reserves exploited ... um , er , explored , discovered and um ... "
McCain said , drawing some knowing chuckles from the largely Republican audience .
He had to stop and collect his thoughts .
Already he had been answering a woman 's question about lowering gas prices for nearly two minutes -- squeezing in a joke about France in the process -- and he seemed flustered .
Thoughts gathered , he continued .
The oil reserves around coastal states like Florida would be " explored and exploited and we will send the message ... all over the world that the United States is on the road to becoming independent from foreign oil . " ( emphasis his )
McCain has been criticized for reversing his prior opposition to expanding off - shore oil exploration , which environmentalists say would devastate pristine coastlines while doing virtually nothing to reduce the cost of oil .
McCain spoke during a town hall event in Hudson , Wisconsin -- nearly 1,500 miles from the coastlines he wanted to hand over to the oil companies .

The funnel cloud could have caused serious damage had it touched down Stormy weather across Lancashire and Merseyside has resulted in a funnel cloud forming in the sky .
The cloud , which is effectively a tornado which does not touch the ground , was spotted at about 1430 BST .
If the funnel had touched down it would have caused severe damage , a Met Office spokesman said .
Such clouds are formed when strong storms , often together with thunderstorms , amass where the wind blows in different directions .
' Excellent examples ' Nigel Bolton , a weather forecaster with the Met Office added : " We have about 30 to 40 touchdown tornadoes a year in the UK and if this funnel cloud had touched down it could have badly damaged a tree or a shed roof .
" However , because the cloud base was either too high or too weak it could n't make the ground so it just hung there in suspension .
In the UK they tend to be rain - wrapped so you do n't see them but this one was forming under a cloud that was n't yet raining

" In the UK they are quite common but they are not generally as good as this - these photos are excellent examples of a funnel cloud as they do not usually tend to be so well formed .
" In the UK they tend to be rain - wrapped so you do n't see them but this one was forming under a cloud that was n't yet raining .
" As soon as it started to rain , the funnel would collapse . "
According to Mr Bolton , who is also a member of the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation , funnel clouds are similar to a vortex of water seen when a plug is removed from a bath .
Police and Fire Services in Merseyside and Lancashire said there had been no reports of any damage caused by the funnel cloud .

What are these ?
Deep below the sea floor live massive colonies of primitive microbes .
Almost like one - celled zombies , these microbes use so little energy that it might be more accurate to call them undead rather than alive .
Yet scientists think that the species might provide a model for life on other planets .
Even on this planet , such microbes might account for a whopping 10 percent of the Earth 's biomass .
" In essence , these microbes are almost , practically dead by our normal standards , " said Christopher House , a geosciences professor at Penn State University , and the lead author of the paper , in a release .
" They metabolize a little , but not much . "
The cold , lightless and energy - poor conditions under the seafloor provide a promising research analog for the harsh conditions in subsurface Martian soil or near hydrothermal vents on Europa , Jupiter 's second moon .
" We do not expect the microbes in other places to be these microbes exactly , " said House .
" But , they could be living at a similar slow rate . "
Subseafloor microbes , according to a metagenomic analysis to be published Thursday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , are genetically distinct from life on Earth 's surface and oceans .
The Archaea the Penn State researchers found might look like bacteria , but they do n't eat or work like them .
While E. coli
might double its numbers in 30 minutes , Archaea could take hundreds or even thousands of years to accomplish the same amount of growth .
The researchers conducted their work off the coast of South America in a region known as the Peru Margin .
They sampled genetic material from the biomes at varying depths .
Below 160 feet , the researcher said
Archaea account for 90 percent of the life present , and represent the most unique environment thus far revealed by metagenomic analysis .
The Archaea represent a thus - far untapped genetic repository for scientists looking for novel genes for changing metabolism , withstanding cold or synthesizing chemicals .
UCLA molecular biologist Jim
Lake called the results " very exciting . "
He also noted that more research into populations of isolated Archaea communities like the one described in the paper could do more than reveal the attributes of the microbial life .
" Our whole concept of microbial evolution is up for grabs , " Lake said .
" People are realizing there is lots of exchange and gene transfers between organisms , and I think the whole area is about to explode . "
Lake noted that while many , like House and Biddle , think the Archaea are an ancient species , they could just be evolving very quickly because of their isolation , a bit like animals on the Galapagos islands .
The debate about how Archaea got so very different from other prokaryotes like bacteria highlights how little is known about them .
House 's co-author , astrobiologist Jennifer Biddle , said that even the most basic questions about this kind of life remain unanswered .
" For example , how do they die ? " asked Biddle .

Mice have been made resistant to HIV by sabotaging a gene in the blood cells that the virus normally infects .
Researchers who developed the treatment at Sangamo BioSciences , a biotechnology company in Duarte , California , US , hope to test it in patients by the end of 2008 .
If successful , the treatment could offer a more effective way for controlling HIV in patients with the disease , the researchers say .
Once the gene has been altered , the cells can no longer make CCR5 , a surface protein to which the virus attaches itself before sneaking inside .
With no “ door handle ” to hold onto , the virus can no longer infect the cell .
To sabotage the gene that makes CCR5 , they used a harmless virus to sneak a molecule called a zinc - finger nuclease into the cells .

Permanent change
The “ zinc - finger ” part of the molecule targets and binds exclusively to genetic material found only in the CCR5 gene .
The “ nuclease ” section is an enzyme that snips open and alters the gene so that it can no longer make the CCR5 protein .
After this process , the cell is then effectively immune to infection by HIV .
“ Once the job is done , the cell DNA is altered permanently , ” says Elena Perez at the Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania , who collaborated on the study .
Half the mice received human T - cells treated with the zinc - finger nucleases , and the other half received untreated T - cells .
Later the mice were infected with HIV .
Inherited trait
After six weeks , all the treated mice had become resistant to the virus .
“ We saw a tenfold suppression of the virus in the treated mice compared with controls , ” says Philip Gregory of Sangamo , “ and we saw a five - fold increase in the number of circulating T - cells , [ which are ] usually attacked by HIV . ”
In human trials , Sangamo plans to extract T - cells from HIV - infected patients , treat them in the lab to alter the gene that makes CCR5 , then return them to the bloodstream .
The hope is that because these cells are resistant to HIV , as they multiply they will become the dominant type within the body .
They could then provide longer - term protection than drugs that deny HIV access to cells by physically blocking CCR5 molecules .
“ What ’s really exciting is that the change in the genome is permanent , and inherited by all ‘ daughter ’ T - cells created when the altered T - cells multiply , ” says Gregory .
Drug fallback
“ The zinc - finger approach has significant potential compared to other strategies , ” says Ed Berger , a researcher credited with helping establish the CCR5 - HIV link at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , US .
“ With genetic knockout of CCR5 by the zinc finger , the cells lacking CCR5 have a selective advantage , ” he says .
Berger adds that , unlike other approaches where patients have to carry on taking CCR5 blockers , or which depend on molecules that must continuously stop CCR5 working , the zinc finger only has to do one operation , and the job is complete .
John Moore , co-discoverer of the link between CCR5 and HIV in 1996 , says the science is excellent , but doubts whether the gene can be sabotaged in enough T - cells to make a difference to patients .
He says that in any case , Maraviroc – a CCR5 blocking drug launched last year by Pfizer in the US and Europe – works well , and that others are in advanced clinical trials .

At a desert test site in Texas , a street battle rages between US soldiers and local " insurgents " .
It 's much like any other training exercise , except the soldiers are accompanied by a Mule ( Multifunctional utility / Logistics & Equipment ) , an armed robot the size of a Humvee .
The insurgents are positioned overlooking an intersection , a potential kill zone .
The commander pulls out what looks like a PlayStation gamepad and the Mule is sent forward .
It presents a tougher challenge than the typical human soldier .
The Mule can fire Javelin anti-tank missiles and has a turret - mounted machine gun , in addition to a digital " eyeball " with laser and heat - recognising target acquisition systems for aiming its weaponry .
It is semi-autonomous , using GPS to navigate and localised perception to avoid trees and buildings .
Its six wheels are on pneumatic legs , enabling it to climb over cars and barriers .
Within minutes , the formerly deadly intersection is secure .
In just a few years ' time , Lockheed Martin will start shipping the Mule to conflict hotspots .
The US army has 1,700 on order for 2014 .
Fifteen Warfighter brigades will be equipped with the units , constituting a human to robot ratio of 29:1 .
Many will be used to clear minefields and carry gear , but half will be armed .
Unfriendly fire
Foster - Miller is another company fielding Armed Unmanned Ground Vehicles ( AUGVs ) .
Three Swords robots - tracked devices the size of a chest of drawers fitted with light machine guns - were tested in Iraq last summer by the US army .
Apparently they were a success .
The company is now promoting a heavily armed version called Maars , which , according to the brochure , can be programmed to recognise no - fire zones .
" The robot has n't fallen over once , " says David Byers , assistant program manager for the Mule .
" In fact , last summer in testing , it was being used to pull soldiers out of a ditch . "
In the past five years , military use of robotic systems has increased dramatically .
The US army alone has fielded more than 6,000 , many of them in Iraq and Afghanistan .
They are mostly used to conduct reconnaissance and disarm explosives , but there are regular news reports of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) performing missile strikes on insurgents they were monitoring ( Launching a new kind of warfare , October 26 , 2006 ) .
" A lot has been learned from UAVs , " says David Chang at West Point Military Academy .
" UGVs are almost a decade behind UAVs in development and the technological challenges are far greater .
Picture the difference for a UAV at 20,000 feet with no obstacles , and contrast that with a UGV , which must navigate in a dense urban environment .
Sensors , fusion of information , detecting negative obstacles and real - time control is imperative to ensure safety . "
Byers says autonomous convoy experiments with the Mule , where the UGVs follow each other in a flocking pattern , have been going well .
" If the robot is lost , inertial navigation systems can put it out of harm 's way .
If the operator is taken out " - injured , killed or loses contact - " then control can be transferred to another authorised party . "
The reaction from the US army has been overwhelmingly positive .
The British army would not comment on whether it plans to use armed robots , but it already incorporates many of the unarmed models in its operations .
Stefan Kern , one of the organisers of the European Land Robot Trial , says : " The German army is strongly investigating the use of unmanned ground vehicles , but armed robots are not the focus of this process .
Short - term realisable robots are the major challenge at the moment . "
No one thinks the robots will be completely autonomous any time soon .
Chang says : " There are still challenges to be overcome in situational awareness and tactical behaviours .
When these units are eventually fielded , there will always be a human in the loop to make the tough decisions . "
Byers adds : " There will always be a soldier involved , at least part - time . "
Shooting second
In Australia , a company called Metal Storm has adapted the Packbot , produced by its American partner iRobot .
The Packbot is usually used to gather sensory data on dangerous locations , and has been adapted into a semi-autonomous killing machine called the Warrior : it can automatically acquire and fire at three targets in approximately 1.2 seconds , selecting the appropriate munition for each target .
Stationary versions of Metal Storm weapons are already used for perimeter security .
According to Joe Dyer of iRobot , the real benefit of the system is its resilience .
As he succinctly puts it : " A robot can shoot second . "
Nimblett of Lockheed is confident that army units with robotic capabilities will have a clear advantage over their enemies .
" Battlefield perception is much better with the robots , " he says .
" So the real advantage is in our situational understanding . "
You only have to watch the video of a Swords cruising into a potential combat zone , its gun turret rotating , to get the idea .
The only force outside the US with plans to deploy armed robots is the South Korean army .
Last year Samsung announced it had built an armed sentry to be deployed at the border with its northern neighbour .
The robot is essentially a machine gun turret , without the manoeuvreability or firepower of its US rivals .
It does n't interact with other battle units in the way the American , network - centric , models do .
For now , the US army has the clear advantage in armed robotics .
The technology it is developing gives them and their allies the ability to outmanoeuvre and outgun enemy combatants with unprecedented ease .
But wo n't that be unfair on human opponents who do n't have the US army 's resources ?
Byers is dismissive : " I hope it is unfair .
You should never go into a fair fight . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - World biodiversity has declined by almost one third in the past 35 years due mainly to habitat loss and the wildlife trade , the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) said on Friday
It warned that climate change would add increasingly to the wildlife woes over the next three decades .
“ Biodiversity underpins the health of the planet and has a direct impact on all our lives so it is alarming that despite of an increased awareness of environmental issues we continue to see a downtrend trend , ” said WWF campaign head Colin Butfield .
“ However , there are small signs for hope and if government grasps what is left of this rapidly closing window of opportunity , we can begin to reverse this trend . ”
WWF ’s Living Planet Index tracks some 4,000 species of birds , fish , mammals , reptiles and amphibians globally .
It shows that between 1970 and 2007 land - based species fell by 25 percent , marine by 28 percent and freshwater by 29 percent .
Marine bird species have fallen 30 percent since the mid-1990s .
The report comes ahead of a meeting in Bonn next week of member states of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity to try to find out how to save the world ’s flora and fauna under threat from human activities .
Some scientists see the loss of plants , animals and insects as the start of the sixth great species wipe out in the Earth ’s history , the last being in the age of the dinosaurs which disappeared 130 million years ago .
Scientists point out that most of the world ’s food and medicines come initially from nature , and note that dwindling species put human survival at risk .
“ Reduced biodiversity means millions of people face a future where food supplies are more vulnerable to pests and disease and where water is in irregular or short supply , ” said WWF director general James Leape .
“ No one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters and greater effects from global warming .
The head of Britain ’s world - renowned Kew Gardens in an interview last month likened biodiversity -- the broad array of plants and animals spread across the planet -- to a planetary health monitor .
“ First - aiders always check the ABC -- Airway , Breathing and Circulation -- of a patient to see if anything needs immediate attention , ” Stephen Hopper said .
“ Biodiversity is the ABC of life on the planet -- and it is showing it is in deep trouble , ” he added .
Kew is doing its part through the Millennium Seed Bank project , which is well on the way to collecting and storing safely 10 percent of the world ’s wild plants .
The next goal -- as yet a wish without any financial backing -- is to raise that total to 25 percent by 2020 .
Protests awaits Bush at S.C. college commencement
GREENVILLE , S.C. —
About 20 Furman University professors made plans to stand in silent protest during President Bush 's commencement speech Saturday night at the Baptist - founded school .
They also said they would wear " We Object " T - shirts as part of their opposition to Bush 's policies on the Iraq war , global warming and other issues .
" We think that this is a very respectful , very mild form of protest , " said Judy Grisel , an associate neuroscience professor who helped organize the protest .
Bush intended to urge students " to help build a culture of responsibility , " his press secretary , Dana Perino , told reporters Friday .
The speech , she said , " will reflect on how he went into public service because he was concerned about the culture and how he is heartened by the progress that has been made , especially in the young people who are embracing bedrock values of faith and family . " for the many young people today who he says are embracing bedrock values of faith and family .
The president also planned to the emphasize volunteering , military service and " living lives of integrity . "
In addition to the protest plans , 31 other professors have been granted " conscientious objector " status , allowing them to skip commencement exercises in objection to Bush 's visit , university spokesman Vince Moore said Friday .
There are 230 full - time professors at Furman .
Part of the animosity comes from the faculty 's disagreement with Furman 's president , David Shi .
They say he failed to consult them before inviting Bush , breaking a tradition of having students give commencement speeches .
Moore said Shi agreed with professors who voted this month to admonish him for not first consulting them .
After six rounds of balloting , he Libertarian Party yesterday picked former Republican congressman Bob Barr to be its presidential candidate .
Barr , a former U.S. representative from Georgia , defeated fellow Libertarian candidate Mary Ruwart by a vote of 324 to 276 on the final ballot .
Former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel , who recently abandoned the Democrats to join the Libertarian Party , was eliminated after he placed fourth with 73 votes in the initial balloting .
Gravel , ever gracious in defeat , indicated that this would be the end of his accomplished political career , saying , " I just ended my political career .
From 15 years old to now , my political career is over , and it 's no big deal .
I 'm a writer , I 'm a lecturer , I 'm going to push the issues of freedom and liberty .
I 'm going to push those issues until the day I die . "
Senator Gravel became disillusioned with the Democratic Party after he was excluded from all but the earliest presidential debates after failing to meet fund - raising and / or polling requirements .
He said the Democratic Party no longer represented his values because of its support of the Iraq War , the military - industrial complex , and American imperialism .
Senator Gravel will be remembered for his awakening of the America 's collective conscience when he read 4100 pages of the text of the Pentagon Papers into the Senate record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds .
The importance of recording the Papers to the Congressional Record was that , Article I , Section 6 of the United States Constitution provides that " for any Speech or Debate in either House , [ a Senator or Representative ] shall not be questioned in any other Place " , thus the Senator could not be prosecuted for anything said on the Senate floor , and , by extension , for anything entered to the Congressional Record , allowing the Papers to be publicly read without threat of a treason trial and conviction .
Among a host of other governmental wrongdoings , the Pentagon Papers revealed that the US deliberately expanded its war with airstrikes against Laos , coastal raids of North Vietnam , and U.S. Marine Corps attacks - before President Lyndon B. Johnson informed the American public , though promising to not expand the war .
The Gravel for President 2008 Campaign mailed the following message to supporters of Mr. Gravel :

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
As mentioned previously , my company sold the rights to one of our previous Windows software products to a much larger company a few years ago .
The much larger company keeps my company on retainer to advise them on the product ’s continued development .
The product ( let ’s call it Project Badger ) was originally written more than ten years ago now , with me as the sole original developer .
At the time , I treated C++ as simply an improved version of C. Microsoft Visual C 6.0 , my compiler of ( reluctant ) choice at the time , barely supported the newly - standardized C++ Standard Template Library ( STL ) ; the Boost library did n’t exist yet ; and I hated the non-standard and non-portable Microsoft Foundation Classes with a passion .
That did n’t leave much choice : I had to hand - code all the algorithms and data structures myself , and use the painfully primitive C string functions and the raw Win32 API .
( Yes , and walk barefoot in the snow to get to school everyday .
Uphill .
Both ways . 😉
But that ’s another story . )
Project Badger has grown a great deal since then , but it was still using the hand - coded data structures and algorithms that I originally came up with , and the C string functions and raw Win32 API .
Although they still worked , it was a very creaky and increasingly ugly infrastructure … grafting support for Unicode onto it ( as our customers demanded ) was a nightmare that required a lot of hand - crafted code , and it was only supported in certain places .
And we could n’t move to Unicode completely , because we still had to support Win9x ( Windows 95 , 98 , and Millennium ) , for reasons I wo n’t go into , and they did n’t support Unicode .
( Using the UNICOWS DLL , which is Microsoft ’s way of retrofitting Unicode support into Win9x systems , was deemed unacceptable in this case , again for reasons I wo n’t go into . )
This all came to a head a few weeks ago , when a customer reported a problem that should have been easy to fix , but that our bastardized infrastructure made nearly impossible .
For a few of its abilities , Project Badger has to open a copy of its EXE file and read some data from a table tacked onto the end ; this customer reported that these features would n’t work if the EXE file were placed in a path with Unicode characters .
The reason was easy to track down : we were using the GetModuleHandleA function to find the filename of the EXE , and CreateFileA to open it .
( The ‘ A ’ on the end means that they ’re the ASCII versions of those functions , rather than the Unicode versions , which would be denoted by a ‘ W ’ there . )
But fixing it , in a way that would n’t break Win9x compatibility … that was more interesting .
After one of our developers spent a frustrating couple days trying to work around the problem using the “ short filenames ” ( legacy of DOS and the FAT12 / FAT16 file system ) — to no avail — I proposed overhauling the entire program , replacing many hand - coded parts of the program with components from the STL and Boost libraries .
Since I was the only one on the team that had much experience with both , I volunteered to do the initial conversion .
It was a large undertaking , even larger than I ’d anticipated .
It took me ten straight days , working twelve to sixteen hours a day , to finish it ( I ’d estimated seven days , for a broader scope of changes ) .
But I think the result was worth the effort .
A key component to the overhaul was a way to support Unicode strings and functions similar to the way that the UNICOWS library does : on platforms where it ’s available , dynamically load the Unicode version of the API function and pass the Unicode parameters directly to it .
On Win9x platforms ( where the Unicode functions are n’t available ) , fall back on the ASCII versions of the functions , translate all strings to ASCII before passing them in , and translate any results to Unicode when passing them back .
To support this , I put together a specialized String class , using the Boost : : Variant library .
Here ’s a simplified version of its declaration ( the full version has conversion support for a few program - specific types as well ) :
namespace os { class String { public : String ( const std:: string& init ) : m Data ( init ) { } ; String ( const std::wstring& init ) : m Data( init ) { } ; String ( const char* init ) ; String ( const wchar_t* init ) ; std::string to_string ( ) const ; std::wstring to_wstring ( ) const ; const char* to_ptr ( ) const ; const wchar_t* to_wptr ( ) const ; bool isNull ( ) const ; bool isNativelyUnicode ( ) const ; bool isValidString ( ) const ; static std:: string _toAscii( const std::wstring& str ) ; static std::wstring _toUnicode ( const std::string& str ) ; private : typedef boost : : variant < const void* , std:: string , std::wstring >
Data ; Data m Data ; } }
Note that the boost : : variant typedef Data can accept a std:: string ( a standard ASCII string ) , a std:: wstring ( a Unicode string ) , or a raw ASCII or Unicode string pointer .
The pointer option was necessary because some Win32 API functions allow you to pass in an invalid string pointer , encoding ( usually via the MAKEINTRESOURCE macro ) some specialized information instead of a standard string .
With that in place , and using a set of simple template classes I wrote to handle the dynamic loading , I could write functions that would take either ASCII or Unicode strings and pointers ( or even a combination of different types ) and do any necessary conversion on the fly :
namespace os { HANDLE CreateFile ( const String& filename , DWORD acc , DWORD share , LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES sec , DWORD create , DWORD flags , HANDLE tpl ) { static StdFn7 < HANDLE , LPCWSTR , DWORD , DWORD , LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES , DWORD , DWORD , HANDLE > fn( " CreateFileW " , cKernel32 ) ; if ( fn && filename.isUnicode ( ) ) { return fn( filename.to_wptr ( ) , acc , share , sec , create , flags , tpl ) ; } else { return ::CreateFileA(filename.to_ptr ( ) , acc , share , sec , create , flags , tpl ) ; } } }
It ’s a good solution , though not a perfect one .
For one example , it ’s not as fast as the raw calls .
That does n’t matter in our case , because most such calls are in user - interface code ( where even the slowest machine is fast enough that much more inefficient code than that would n’t be noticeable ) , and the rest are in one - time operations where the speed is n’t critical .
Another limitation is that you ca n’t pass in a zero or NULL for one of the os :: String parameters , even when it might be supported ( as in the “ title ” parameter to the MessageBox function , which defaults to the localized “ error ” string if passed a NULL ) .
I got around that by defining
const os :: String NULLSTRING( static_cast<char *>( NULL ) ) ;
in the source file , and then putting
extern const os :: String NULLSTRING ;
in the header .
Then , whenever I needed to pass in a NULL , I just changed it to NULLSTRING , and everything worked as normal .
I could probably have also defined an os :: String constructor that accepted an int , but that seemed like overkill , and would have worked against type - safety .
The end result : minimal changes to the existing code , while adding maximum flexibility .
I ’m very happy with it . 🙂
The Heritage Foundation on Tuesday released the above chart headlined U.S. a Nonstarter in Nuclear Power .
The point of the chart was to show those who continue to question the value of nuclear power that other countries are making concrete decisions and moving forward in earnest .
Unfortunately , some felt the chart sent the wrong message .
By not explicitly putting the U.S. on the chart , they argued , we misrepresented the status of nuclear power ’s comeback here .
It ’s true that 17 utilities and consortia are in the permitting process to build up to 30 new nuclear reactors .
But the fact remains : None has started construction and much remains to ensure those 30 units will go beyond the permitting process and actually get built .
If it were simply a question of process , then perhaps the nation could rest assured that those reactors would be built .
But it ’s not .
This remains a question of policy .
Will the U.S. develop a sustainable nuclear waste management policy ?
Without a rational policy , there is no nuclear renaissance .
What about loan guarantees ?
Some argue that no reactors will be built without them .
Regardless of one ’s view , the debate demonstrates few believe everything is in place from a policy perspective for a successful nuclear rebirth in America .
The subtext of Heritage ’s chart was that the U.S. needs to stop squabbling about the value of nuclear energy – the technology is proven — and get to the business of making better policy to allow the building of more power plants .
It was in no way meant to ignore recent efforts .
The work of certain members of Congress , the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , as well as that of industry , has positioned us for that nuclear renaissance .
No question .
The bottom line is , nuclear energy has strong opponents that have made careers out of being anti-nuclear — and their propaganda continues to permeate the national debate .
So long as this dynamic manifests itself as fence - sitting elected officials who wo n’t take the right steps on nuclear energy policy , America ’s nuclear renaissance remains in doubt .
And it ’s these reluctant lawmakers who , despite America ’s thirst for new energy , continue to deny our citizens access to nuclear energy .
It ’s these lawmakers who assure that , to date , when it comes to building new nuclear plants , the U.S. , unfortunately , is a nonstarter .
“ They ’d need to justify not doing that , ” he said .
“ Why apes ? ”
Spain ’s Catholic bishops attacked the vote as undermining a divine will that placed humans above animals .
One said such thinking led to abortion , euthanasia and ethnic cleansing .
But given that even some humans are denied human rights , what is the most basic right ?
To not be killed for food , perhaps ?
Ten years ago , I stood in a clearing in the Cameroonian jungle , asking a hunter to hold up for my camera half the baby gorilla he had split and butterflied for smoking .
My distress  partly faked , since I was also feeling triumphant , having come this far hoping to find exactly such a scene  struck him as funny .
“ A gorilla is still meat , ” said my guide , a former gorilla hunter himself .
“ It has no soul . ”
So he agrees with Spain ’s bishops .
But it was an interesting observation for a West African to make .
He looked much like the guy on the famous engraving adopted as a coat of arms by British abolitionists : a slave in shackles , kneeling to either beg or pray .
Below it the motto : Am I Not a Man , and a Brother ?
Whether or not Africans had souls  whether they were human in God ’s eyes , capable of salvation  underlay much of the colonial debate about slavery .
They were granted human rights on a sliding scale : as slaves , they were property ; in the United States Constitution a slave counted as only three - fifths of a person .
As Ms. Newkirk pointed out , “ All these supremacist notions take a long time to erode . ”
She compared the rights of animals to those of women : it only seems like a long time , she said , since they got the vote or were admitted to medical schools .
Or , she might have added , to the seminary .
Though no Catholic bishop would suggest that women lack souls , it will be quite a while before a female bishop denounces Spain ’s Parliament .
Nineteen sixty - eight was one exciting moment in a much larger movement .
It spawned a whole range of movements .
There would n't have been an international global solidarity movement , for instance , without the events of 1968 .
It was enormous , in terms of human rights , ethnic rights , a concern for the environment , too .
The Pentagon Papers ( the 7,000 - page , top- secret US government report into the Vietnam War ) are proof of this : right after the Tet Offensive , the business world turned against the war , because they thought it was too costly , even though there were proposals within the government - and we know this now - to send in more American troops .
Then LBJ announced he would n't be sending any more troops to Vietnam .
The Pentagon Papers tell us that , because of the fear of growing unrest in the cities , the government had to end the war - it was n't sure that it was going to have enough troops to send to Vietnam and enough troops on the domestic front to quell the riots .
One of the most interesting reactions to come out of 1968 was in the first publication of the Trilateral Commission , which believed there was a " crisis of democracy " from too much participation of the masses .
In the late 1960s , the masses were supposed to be passive , not entering into the public arena and having their voices heard .
When they did , it was called an " excess of democracy " and people feared it put too much pressure on the system .
The only group that never expressed its opinions too much was the corporate group , because that was the group whose involvement in politics was acceptable .
The commission called for more moderation in democracy and a return to passivity .
It said the " institutions of indoctrination " - schools , churches - were not doing their job , and these had to be harsher .
The more reactionary standard was much harsher in its reaction to the events of 1968 , in that it tried to repress democracy , which has succeeded to an extent - but not really , because these social and activist movements have now grown .
For example , it was unimaginable in 1968 that there would be an international Solidarity group in 1980 .
But democracy is even stronger now than it was in 1968 .
You have to remember that , during Vietnam , there was no opposition at the beginning of the war .
It did develop , but only six years after John F Kennedy attacked South Vietnam and troop casualties were mounting .
However , with the Iraq War , opposition was there from the very beginning , before an attack was even initiated .
The Iraq War was the first conflict in western history in which an imperialist war was massively protested against before it had even been launched .
There are other differences , too .
In 1968 , it was way out in the margins of society to even discuss the possibility of withdrawal from Vietnam .
Now , every presidential candidate mentions withdrawal from Iraq as a real policy choice .
There is also far greater opposition to oppression now than there was before .
For example , the US used routinely to support or initiate military coups in Latin America .
But the last time the US supported a military coup was in 2002 in Venezuela , and even then they had to back off very quickly because there was public opposition .
They just can't do the kinds of things they used to .
So , I think the impact of 1968 was long - lasting and , overall , positive .
One of the pillars of the RIAA 's legal campaign has been its assertion that making a file available for download equates to copyright infringement under the copyright act .
There have only been a couple of decisions addressing the question so far .
One that came down today in Atlantic v. Howell is the biggest rejection yet to the RIAA 's " making available equals infringement " argument , as a federal judge has denied the labels ' motion for summary judgment , setting the stage for a trial later this year .
Atlantic v. Howell is unusual in that the husband and wife defendants are representing themselves .
But the couple has some knowledgeable allies on their side — the EFF submitted an amicus brief on their behalf after the RIAA moved for a summary judgment .
The RIAA sued the Howells in 2006 for copyright infringement , and the couple responded by claiming that KaZaA was " not set up to share " and that the songs listed in the complaint were for " private use " and " for transfer to portable devices , that is legal for ' fair use . ' "
In a deposition , Jeffrey Howell later admitted to installing KaZaA on his PC , but said that the only files that should have been in the shared folder were " pornography and free to the public software , e-books . "
( Apparently , the porn was of the amateur , not - copyrighted variety . )
Their defense got off to a rocky start , as Judge Neil V .
Wake initially granted the RIAA a summary judgment and awarded the labels $ 40,850 in statutory damages and court costs .
The Howells appealed , citing their lack of knowledge about how KaZaA works , specifically the fact that their " personal files " were shared on the network , and the judge subsequently vacated the summary judgment .
In its brief , the EFF argued strenuously against the RIAA 's position that making a file available on a P2P network is distribution .
Instead , the labels must show that distribution actually took place in order to prove infringement .
The only distribution that the labels can prove was n't unauthorized , says the EFF , because it was done by MediaSentry on behalf of the RIAA .
As was the case in London - Sire v. Does 1 - 4 , Judge Wake agreed with the EFF 's reasoning .
" The court agrees with the great weight of authority that § 106 ( 3 ) is not violated unless the defendant has actually distributed an unauthorized copy of the work to a member of the public , " wrote the judge in his order .
" Merely making an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted work available to the public does not violate a copyright holder ’s exclusive right of distribution . "
The recent Elektra v. Barker ruling said that making a file available infringes on the right of publication in the Copyright Act , but Judge Wake disagrees .
" A plain reading of the statute indicates that a publication can be either a distribution or an offer to distribute for the purposes of further distribution , but that a distribution must involve a ' sale or other transfer of ownership ' or a ' rental , lease , or lending ' of a copy of the work , " he wrote .
" The recording companies have not proved an actual distribution of 42 of the copyrighted sound recordings at issue , so their motion for summary judgement fails as to those recordings . "
Judge
Wake did take issue with one of the EFF 's arguments .
In its brief , the group said that MediaSentry 's downloading of music from Howell 's shared folder could not be considered copyright infringement , because the firm was acting as the RIAA 's authorized agent .
Indeed , the songs downloaded by MediaSentry are unauthorized versions , according to the judge , but he's not convinced that the Howells are ultimately responsible for making the files available .
The RIAA says the judge 's decision is an odd one : " This is a strange decision that is outside of the mainstream and inconsistent with countless court rulings on these issues , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars .
" We are currently considering all options going forward . "
EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann hailed the ruling as a " big victory , " saying that the judge delivered the " most decisive rejection yet " of the RIAA 's making available theory .
In the four cases that we know of where the making available issue has been argued in court , judges have sided with the defendants three times and the RIAA once .
Of course , none of these have made it to trial yet .
According to von Lohmann , Atlantic v. Howell will likely go to trial in September .
The verdict will also be in the hands of Judge Wake , because neither party has requested a jury trial .

By Major General Antonio Taguba , USA ( Ret . )
Maj .
General Taguba led the US Army ’s official investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal and testified before Congress on his findings in May , 2004 .
This report tells the largely untold human story of what happened to detainees in our custody when the Commander - in - Chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture .
This story is not only written in words :
It is scrawled for the rest of these individuals ’ lives on their bodies and minds .
Our national honor is stained by the indignity and inhumane treatment these men received from their captors .
The profiles of these eleven former detainees , none of whom were ever charged with a crime or told why they were detained , are tragic and brutal rebuttals to those who claim that torture is ever justified .
Through the experiences of these men in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Guantanamo Bay , we can see the full scope of the damage this illegal and unsound policy has inflicted — both on America ’s institutions and our nation ’s founding values , which the military , intelligence services , and our justice system are duty - bound to defend .
In order for these individuals to suffer the wanton cruelty to which they were subjected , a government policy was promulgated to the field whereby the Geneva Conventions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice were disregarded .
The UN Convention Against Torture was indiscriminately ignored .
And the healing professions , including physicians and psychologists , became complicit in the willful infliction of harm against those the Hippocratic Oath demands they protect .
After years of disclosures by government investigations , media accounts , and reports from human rights organizations , there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes .
The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account .
The former detainees in this report , each of whom is fighting a lonely and difficult battle to rebuild his life , require reparations for what they endured , comprehensive psycho- social and medical assistance , and even an official apology from our government .
But most of all , these men deserve justice as required under the tenets of international law and the United States Constitution .
And so do the American people .
Grocery Shopping Tips That Will Pad Your Pocket , Guaranteed !
Hang on to your grocery coupons !
All you ever wanted to know about grocery shopping .
How much do you spend on groceries ?
The answer varies depending on where you live , how many people you live with , and what your buying patterns are and can range from a very thrifty $ 50 a month per head in the most frugal American households to a more typical $ 150 a month per person or even to a more extravagant $ 300 and higher a month , per head .
You may cringe at thousand dollar grocery bills for your typical family of four but they ’re not unheard of , especially in California .
I have one particular colleague who shops exclusively in San Francisco Chinatown every weekend for the cheapest food items and buys everything else in bulk at Costco , adhering to a carefully planned budget .
His family consists of himself , his wife and young toddler and yet their grocery bill hits $ 500 a month — an average $ 166 a month per person .
As for us , I ’m too embarrassed to divulge our grocery bill numbers ( though they ’re not that far from that monthly $ 166 per head quoted figure ) : let ’s just say it ’s something that we can definitely improve upon but just have n’t had the inclination to do so in recent months .
Since food sensitivities and allergies run in our family , we ’ve shifted to organic and gluten - free products , thereby adding quite a bit to the bottom - line .
In looking at what we could do to slice those bills down , I found some really good pointers that can easily be applied to make a quick difference .
Republished with permission from Robert Wechsler
There ’s so much fodder here to get started : apparently , your average bill can probably be diminished by 30 % to 50 % by following some of these tips .
I never knew that grocery shopping can be so strategic , almost like a science , so I ’m convinced many people are n’t aware of even some of the basic actions they can take to save money on this front .
Nothing earth - shattering here : but the key is in the execution !
Easy Ways To Save On Your Grocery Bill
# 1 Gather your grocery coupons and use them “ the right way ” .
Read your coupons carefully because the fine print can yield information you may not be aware of .
The picture on a coupon may not tell you the whole story : for instance , discounts can apply to items of like kind or by the same brand , and not just the item displayed on the coupon .
Unfortunately for us , we ’ve only attempted passive coupon collecting — the kind that involves waiting for the coupons in the mail and using what ’s there .
But if you ’d like to be a more aggressive saver , you can be more proactive by going to web sites such as CouponMom.com or using coupon brokers online !
The downside to coupon hunting is that it can be time intensive so you may want to see if it ’s worth it to try .
# 2 Come in with a plan and a list .
Do you have a shopping plan ?
The easiest plan you can make is simply to write a list of the things you need before your trip to the store .
Beyond that , there are serious savers who prepare menu plans and who develop shopping systems that involve knowing the sales schedule of the stores they frequent , being aware of when discounts and markdowns are available , and buying loss leaders .
Consumers who have a list or a plan actually spend 40 % to 50 % less than those who do n’t !
One tip though : I ’d create a simple plan first so I ’d have better success with sticking to it for the long term .
# 3 Check and re-check your receipts !
The bane of my grocery shopping experience is the checkout counter because I always feel anxious about getting overcharged by mistake .
And you know what ?
My worries are NOT unfounded .
There ’s actually the issue of store scanner errors , which actually cost shoppers between $ 1 billion to $ 3 billion a year !
Just to show you how prevalent this is , a few weeks ago we found out that we were charged $ 37 for 1.55 pounds of shrimp , instead of the rightful price of $ 7.73 — a transposition error that could have been easily missed out !
# 4 Comparison shop .
This is one of the more obvious things to do — but we do n’t realize how strong our brand loyalty sometimes can be .
A good system is to break that loyalty .
Instead , follow the price and go with alternatives that are offering grocery coupons and discounts during your shopping exercise .
# 5 Shop when you ’re relaxed .
Another behavioral modification trick is to shop when you are relaxed and when the store is emptier .
Shop during non-peak hours so that you ’re not hassled enough to act impulsively .
During this time , you are less frazzled and less likely to be in a hurry to get out .
The less stressed out you are , the more likely you ’ll be to carefully inspect the goods that pile up in your cart and to avoid additional charges .
# 6 Do n’t shop hungry .
Yet something else to try — shop when you ’re full .
Apparently , studies show that if you ’re hungry , everything looks more palatable to you and you ’re more likely to make more purchases .
Stores will enhance the shopping experience further by making sure their stores smell nice and aromatic , in an effort to titillate your taste buds .
# 7 Check expiration dates so things do n’t spoil and waste .
Do you know what ’s in your fridge and pantry ?
Statistics show that Americans waste a lot of food : around 14 % of purchases , in fact !
A quick look at the expiration dates of your food and drug items can ensure that they have longer shelf and fridge life .
You would n’t want to have to discard stuff prematurely before it even makes it to your plate .
# 8 Avoid convenience items .
Bypass the junk aisle .
Prepackaged foods , diet foods and other conveniently packaged items tend to be more expensive .
Consider frozen food as an alternative to fresh foods for the lower cost .
You may think they ’re less healthy , but surprisingly , the difference in nutrition that you receive is n’t significant .
# 9 Check if medicines you buy can be covered by your flexible spending plan .
If you ’re prescribed regular medication , buying them through your flexible spending plan ( FSA ) will save you money because what you contribute to such a plan is not subject to payroll taxes .
Check with your employer about how this can work out for you .
But make sure you monitor and track how you ’re using your plan : I ’ve had sore luck on this matter and lost over a $ 1,000 on it last year because I failed to use my FSA sufficiently throughout the year .
How did this happen ?
Though I made proper claims , they were denied and not considered eligible for FSA use .
So beware !
Such a plan is subject to a “ use it or lose it ” policy which can bite you unexpectedly .
Take note of the details of your policy before you sign up and start contributing .
# 10 Check unit pricing .
We ’re all trained to think that bigger is cheaper and by buying more , we could be saving more per unit .
That ’s not necessarily the case !
Here ’s an example of this illusion .
You may be surprised that some smaller items can be cheaper than larger packaged goods .
Also , by applying discounts to smaller , lower cost items , the savings are even greater !
When grocery coupons allow you to take off a certain number of dollars and you apply it against lower cost items , this results in bigger percentage savings .
# 11 Shop on the outside .
That is , shop by starting out at the perimeter of the store .
Those areas are where the highest priority items are usually located .
The stuff you ca n’t do without — such as bread , dairy items , fresh fruits and vegetables and meats — should be stacked in your cart first before everything else so that you ’re less likely to make room for non-essentials .
# 12 Recognize that products at eye level are pricier .
Marketers want your money to follow where your eyes go .
So they place the more expensive items at eye level for easy plucking .
Be aware that this is their ploy so that you have the option to look elsewhere for what you need .
# 13 Buy in bulk , stock up on discounted items .
Bulk buying is a common way of getting materials at a better price .
Here ’s an informal study made by an individual who discovered that buying from a warehouse club such as Sam ’s Club , Costco or B.J. ’s really costs less .
His findings ( from SoundMindInvesting.com ) :
I found that a great majority of the items were indeed cheaper at Sam’s .
On average , the savings amounted to 31 % , more than enough to easily offset the $ 35 - 45 annual membership fee .
The big winners : cereal / bread , cooking / baking , snacks , and other averaged nearly 40 % savings .
Still not impressed ?
Buy some raisins , syrup , bottled water , and sandwich bags and you can save an average of 66 % .
And it does n’t stop there .
You can rack up even more savings by buying generics in bulk , where I found savings of up to 83 % on items like aspirin and hand sanitizer .
# 14 Use cash .
Though some may say it ’s not for them , you may try using cash to do your purchases .
This is because it is recognized that those who use cash to make their purchases save 10 % to 30 % more than those who use credit .
More formally , a study by Dunn and Bradstreet reveals that on average , we spend from 12 % to 18 % more using credit cards than if we used cash .
# 15 Buy at lower priced stores and even your local markets .
You may find that by checking a variety of stores and locations , that prices vary quite a bit across the board .
We have a farmer ’s market close to where we live and during the summer months , we buy our produce from there .
We found that the savings here were significant and the food so much fresher than if we got them from the neighborhood supermarket .
Plus , at these markets , there are so many stalls selling affordable organic fruits and vegetables !
I ’ve also got several friends who get their low - priced food items from the city ’s Chinatown district .
# 16 Do n’t shop with kids .
Supposedly , shopping with kids actually adds $ 100 to $ 400 a month to your bill .
That ’s because you end up lingering longer at the store when you have them in tow , plus impulse buying tends to go up when your kids get hit by the “ gimmes ” .
So either do n’t bring them along or be strongly conscious of your buying behavior when you have them tag along .
-ooOoo -
When grocery shopping , if you go unprepared , you ’ll pay more .
So knowing what you can do to make small changes to your routine can help you bring your tallies lower .
The magic number seems to be the $ 50 a head that the incredibly Economides family has achieved with their groceries including food and other products they purchase weekly .
Of course , you may know about a lot of these pointers already but unless you apply them ( and yes , some of them may seem a bit more work than others ) , you wo n’t make headway .
I ’ll admit that all these tips may not be something I ’d try out right away since there are tradeoffs involving time and practicality , though I ’m very certain that I ’ll be tackling some of the easier tips by our next grocery trip .
I ’d suggest you start with the easiest changes to see where that takes you .

The economic slowdown has swelled the ranks of people without health insurance .
But now it is also threatening millions of people who have insurance but find that the coverage is too limited or that they cannot afford their own share of medical costs .
Many of the 158 million people covered by employer health insurance are struggling to meet medical expenses that are much higher than they used to be  often because of some combination of higher premiums , less extensive coverage , and bigger out - of - pocket deductibles and co-payments .
With medical costs soaring , the coverage many people have may not adequately protect them from the financial shock of an emergency room visit or a major surgery .
For some , even routine doctor visits might now take a back seat to basic expenses like food and gasoline .
“ It just keeps eating into people ’s income , ” said James Corbin , a former union official who works for the local utility in Tucson .
Yesterday , McCain did a major reorganization of his campaign staff , the second such shake - up in a year .
But what should be setting off warning bells is the people who are now in charge of his campaign .
McCain elevated Steve Schmidt to full operational control .
Schmidt is considered a pupil of Rove , and he is a veteran of Bush ’s 2004 presidential campaign .
According to the NY Times , “ Mr. Schmidt ’s elevation is the latest sign of increasing influence of veterans of Mr. Rove ’s shop in the McCain operation . ”
Other Rove associates added to McCain ’s campaign include Nicolle Wallace , communications director for the 2004 Bush campaign , as a senior advisor , who will travel with McCain .
Greg Jenkins , another Rove veteran , has joined the McCain communications team .
Is it a coincidence that McCain has gone deeply negative in the last few days , attacking not only Obama , but Gen. Wesley Clark and Sen. Jim Webb ?
The Times also notes that , under Rove , Schmidt was in charge of the Bush campaign ’s “ war room ” and that “ one sign of Mr. Schmidt ’s increasing influence in the campaign ’s rapid response operation was the quickness with which it seized on a remark by Gen. Wesley K. Clark . ”
Consider this a warning that McCain ’s campaign is going very very negative .
Get ready for the same nasty tactics that were used against McCain himself in Bush ’s 2000 primary campaign .
UPDATE : They wasted no time at all — already releasing their first attack ad against Obama :
YANGON ( Reuters ) -
The first U.S. military aid flight to Myanmar landed in Yangon on Monday but emergency supplies remained at a trickle for 1.5 million people facing hunger and disease in the cyclone - ravaged Irrawaddy delta .
The C - 130 military transport plane flew in from an air base in neighboring Thailand carrying water , mosquito nets and blankets as U.S. President George W. Bush condemned Myanmar ’s military leaders for being either “ isolated or callous . ”
The junta ’s navy Commander - in - Chief Soe Thein received the U.S. supplies , which were accompanied by Admiral Timothy Keating , head of the U.S. Pacific Command , and Henrietta Fore , administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development .
A stream of other aid flights had already landed in Yangon , but only a fraction of the help needed has got to people in the flooded delta , partly because the junta has kept foreign aid and logistics experts out of the country or in Yangon .
In New York , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon made clear his exasperation with the junta and its “ unacceptably slow ” response to Cyclone Nargis since it struck Myanmar on May 3 .
Bush , who shortly before the cyclone had imposed fresh sanctions on Myanmar to pressure it toward democratic rule , said in a radio interview with CBS that the junta was apparently more interested in power than in its people .
Noting the leaders had moved the capital away from the biggest city Yangon , he said : “ either they are isolated or callous . ”
Fore told reporters in Bangkok she had won permission to fly in two more planes on Tuesday but there was no breakthrough on letting foreign helicopters and boats ferry supplies into the delta .
“ It ’s a good first step , ” she said , adding U.S. aid was increasing to $ 16 million , from $ 3.5 million .
Delivery of the U.S. aid shipment was broadcast on the tightly controlled Myanmar state television .
Keating said the U.S. navy would have three ships in international waters off the coast of Myanmar in 36 to 48 hours .
It also had 4,000 Marines and a “ large number ” of cargo - carrying helicopters on stand - by in Thailand .
“ We ’re limited only by the permission from the authorities in Burma , ” he said at the Thai air base .
WAITING FOR VISAS
“ We think we need to be moving 375 tonnes of food a day down into the affected areas .
We are doing less than 20 percent of that , ” World Food Program spokesman Marcus Prior said in the Thai capital Bangkok .
At the United Nations in New York , Ban delivered his most critical comments so far of the Myanmar authorities ’ response and said : “ We are at a critical point . ”
“ Today is the 11th day since ... Nargis hit Myanmar , ” he told reporters .
“ I want to register my deep concern -- and immense frustration -- at the unacceptably slow response to this grave humanitarian crisis .
Myanmar ’s reclusive military government was accepting aid from the outside world , including the United Nations , but refused to admit foreign experts waiting in Bangkok for visas from the Myanmar Embassy .

The United Nations said its top representative in Myanmar had flown to Naypyidaw , the generals ’ new capital , on Monday to hand over a list of 60 critical U.N. and relief agency staff .
U.N. humanitarian affairs chief John Holmes told reporters in New York the United Nations had disbursed $ 20.3 million from its emergency relief fund to cover costs related to urgent needs , such as food , shelter , sanitation and health .
He said there were still problems with visas though the situation had improved somewhat .
“ It was confirmed that 34 visas for United Nations relief staff from the different agencies will now be granted or are being granted , ” he said .
But U.N. officials said none of its staff in Bangkok had received visas on Monday .
They said foreign staff inside the country were prevented from leaving Yangon .

In its latest assessment of the scale of the disaster , the U.N. humanitarian agency said between 1.2 million and 1.9 million people were struggling to survive and the number of dead could range from 60,000 to 102,000 .
Myanmar state television raised its official toll to 31,938 dead and 29,770 missing on Monday .
Most of the casualties were killed by the 12 - foot ( 3.5 meter ) wall of water that hit the delta , with the cyclone ’s 190 kph ( 120 mph ) winds .
RAIN FORECAST
People throughout the delta were crammed into monasteries , schools and other buildings .
Displaced people flooded into towns that were barely able to cope with the influx .
Lacking food , water and sanitation , they faced diseases such as cholera .
Heavy rain was forecast for the delta this week , which could further hinder the relief effort .
People from Yangon were loading food and water into their vehicles and taking it to villages outside the city in the absence of any organized aid effort .
The cyclone raged through an area that is home to nearly half of the country ’s 53 million people and about 5,000 sq km ( 1,930 sq miles ) of land remained under water .
The cyclone ravaged some of the country ’s main rice - growing areas .
The United Nations has launched an appeal for $ 187 million to support the survivors for at least three months .
The WFP is seeking $ 56 million to buy food for 630,000 people for six months .
France was sending a warship carrying 1,500 metric tons of rice which was expected near Myanmar later this week .
Paris says it wants to distribute the food directly itself , but will not do so without authorization .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Monday Britain was sending a navy ship to the region to help humanitarian operations .
Two researchers from UCLA and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System have developed a design for an automated , wearable artificial kidney , or AWAK , that avoids the complications patients often suffer with traditional dialysis .
The design for the peritoneal - based artificial kidney — which is " bloodless " and reduces or even eliminates protein loss and other dialysis - related problems — is summarized in an article published in the current issue of the journal Clinical and Experimental Nephrology , available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10157-008-0050-9.
UCLA–VA has also signed an exclusive licensing agreement with the Singapore - based company AWAK Technologies Pte. Ltd. to develop a commercial wearable kidney based on the design by Martin Roberts , an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and a dialysis consultant with the VA Healthcare System , and David B.N. Lee , a professor of medicine at the Geffen School and a consultant nephrologist at the VA .
Around 1980 , an artificial kidney machine was built that incorporated many of the principles on which the new technology relies , according to Roberts .
But that machine , while portable , was not wearable .
The new technology would allow patients to go about their regular business while undergoing dialysis .
" What 's really new about it is the patient 's freedom , " Roberts said .
" To me , as the inventor , the most important thing for the patients is their freedom .
The next important thing is that because it 's working all the time instead of intermittently , you can do a much better job of treating the patient .
So we expect the patient to feel better and live longer . "
Kidneys remove metabolic wastes from the body and regulate fluid volume and distribution on a continuous , around - the - clock basis .
With traditional hemodialysis , patients are hooked up to a machine for four hours , three times a week .
Their blood is filtered through the machine to remove toxins and is then pumped back into the body .
What hemodialysis can't do , however , is provide cleansing and fluid balance on a continuous basis ; therefore , toxin levels and fluid volume tend to fluctuate , causing " shocks " to the patient 's system .
The same is true of standard peritoneal - based dialysis .
In addition , hemodialysis uses anticoagulants to prevent the blood circulating outside the body from clotting .
But this , too , can cause complications .
Work on other wearable kidneys has been based on this hemodialysis or hemofiltration model .
The AWAK , on the other hand , would function continuously , as natural kidneys do , eliminating patient " shocks . "
And because it does not involve blood circulation outside the body , it is " bloodless . "
It also regenerates and reuses fluid and protein components in the spent dialysate — the fluid that has abstracted toxins from the patient 's blood and which is discarded in current practice — making it waterless and minimizing or eliminating protein loss .
" Dialysis - on - the - go , made possible by AWAK 's ' wearability ' and automation , frees end - stage renal failure patients from the servitude that is demanded by the current dialytic regimentations , " Roberts and Lee write in the journal article .

The ISO C++ committee met in Sophia Antipolis , France on June 6 - 14 .
You can find the minutes here ( note that these cover only the whole - group sessions , not the breakout technical sessions where we spend most of the week ) .
Here ’s a summary of what we did , with links to the relevant papers to read for more details , and information about upcoming meetings .
Highlights : Complete C++0 x draft coming in September
The biggest goal entering this meeting was to make C++0 x feature - complete and stay on track to publish a complete public draft of C++0 x this September for international review and comment — in ISO - speak , an official Committee Draft or CD .
We are going to achieve that , so the world will know the shape of C++0 x in good detail this fall .
We ’re also now planning to have two rounds of international comment review instead of just one , to give the world a good look at the standard and two opportunities for national bodies to give their comments , the first round starting after our September 2008 meeting and the second round probably a year later .
However , the September 2008 CD is “ it ” , feature - complete C++0 x .
The only changes expected to be made between that CD and the final International Standard are bug fixes and clarifications .
It ’s helpful to think of a CD as a feature - complete beta .
Coming into the June meeting , we already had a nearly - complete C++0 x internal working draft — most features that will be part of C++0 x had already been “ checked in . ”
Only a few were still waiting to become stable enough to vote in , including initializer lists , range - based for loops , and concepts .
Of these , concepts is the long - pole feature for C++0x , which is n’t surprising given that it ’s the biggest new language feature we ’re adding to Standard C++.
A primary goal of the June meeting , therefore , was to make as much progress on concepts as possible , and to see if it would be possible to vote that feature into the C++0 x working draft at this meeting .
We almost did that , thanks to a lot of work not only in France but also at smaller meetings throughout the winter and spring :
For the first time , we ended a meeting with no known issues or controversial points in the concepts standardese wording , and we expect to “ check in ” concepts into the working draft at the next meeting in September , which both cleared the way for us to publish a complete draft then and motivated the plan to do two rounds of public review rather than one , just to make sure the standard got enough “ bake time ” in its complete form .
Next , I ’ll summarize some of the major features voted into the draft at the June meeting .
Initializer lists
C++0 x initializer lists accomplish two main objectives :
Uniformity :
They provide a uniform initialization syntax you can use consistently everywhere , which is especially helpful when you write templates .
Convenience :
They provide a general - purpose way of using the C initializer syntax for all sorts of types , notably containers .
See N2215 for more on the motivation and original design , and N2672 and N2679 for the final standardese .
Example : Initializing aggregates vs. classes
It ’s convenient that we can initialize aggregates like this :
struct Coordinate1 {
int i ;
int j ;
//…
} ; Coordinate1 c1 = { 1 , 2 } ;
but the syntax is slightly different for classes with constructors :
class Coordinate2 {
public :
Coordinate2 ( int i , int j ) ;
// …
} ; Coordinate2 c2 ( 1 , 2 ) ;
In C++0x , you can still do all of the above , but initializer lists give us a regular way to initialize all kinds of types :
Coordinate1 c1 = { 1 , 2 } ;
Coordinate2 c2 = { 1 , 2 } ; // legal in C++0x
Having a uniform initialization syntax is particularly helpful when writing template code , so that the template can easily work with a wide variety of types .
Example : Initializing arrays vs. containers
One place where the lack of uniform initialization has been particularly annoying — at least to me , when I write test harnesses to exercise the code I show in articles and talks — is when initializing a container with some default values .
Do n’t you hate it when you want to create a container initialized to some known values , and if it were an array you can just write :
string a [ ] = { “ xyzzy ” , “ plugh ” , “ abracadabra ” } ;
but if it ’s a container like a vector , you have to default - construct the container and then push every entry onto it individually :
// Initialize by hand today
vector < string > v ;
v.push_back ( “ xyzzy ” ) ;
v.push_back ( “ plugh ” ) ;
v.push_back ( “ abracadabra ” ) ;
or , even more embarrassingly , initialize an array first for convenience and then construct the vector as a copy of the array , using the vector constructor that takes a range as an iterator pair :
// Initialize via an array today
string a [ ] = { “ xyzzy ” , “ plugh ” , “ abracadabra ” } ; // put it into an array first
vector < string > v( a , a+3 ) ; // then construct the vector as a copy
Arrays are weaker than containers in nearly every other way , so it ’s annoying that they get this unique convenience just because of their having been built into the language since the early days of C .
The lack of convenient initialization has been even more irritating with maps :
// Initialize by hand today
map < string , string > phonebook ;
phonebook [ “ Bjarne Stroustrup ( cell ) ” ] = “ +1 ( 212 ) 555-1212 ” ;
phonebook [ “ Tom Petty ( home ) ” ] = “ +1 ( 858 ) 555-9734 ” ;
phonebook [ “ Amy Winehouse ( agent ) ” ] = “ +44 20 74851424 ” ;
In C++0x , we can initialize any container with known values as conveniently as arrays :
// Can use initializer list in C++0x
vector < string > v = { “ xyzzy ” , “ plugh ” , “ abracadabra ” } ;
map < string , string > phonebook =
{ { “ Bjarne Stroustrup ( cell ) ” , “ +1 ( 212 ) 555-1212 ” } ,
{ “ Tom Petty ( home ) ” , “ +1 ( 858 ) 555-9734 ” } ,
{ “ Amy Winehouse ( agent ) ” , “ +44 99 74855424 ” } } ;
As a bonus , a uniform initialization syntax even makes arrays easier to deal with .
For example , the array initializer syntax did n’t support arrays that are dynamically allocated or class members arrays :
// Initialize dynamically allocated array by hand today
int* a = new in t [ 3 ] ;
a [ 0 ] = 1 ;
a [ 1 ] = 2 ;
a [ 2 ] = 99 ;
// Initialize member array by hand today
class X {
int a [ 3 ] ;
public :
X ( ) { a [ 0 ] = 1 ; a [ 1 ] = 2 ; a [ 2 ] = 99 ; }
} ;
In C++0x , the array initialization syntax is uniformly available in these cases too :
// C++0 x int* a = new in t [ 3 ] { 1 , 2 , 99 } ; class X {
int a [ 3 ] ;
public :
X( ) : a { 1 , 2 , 99 } {}
} ;
More concurrency support
Last October , we already voted in a state - of - the - art memory model , atomic operations , and a threading package .
That covered the major things we wanted to see in this standard , but a few more were still in progress .
Here are the major changes we made this time that relate to concurrency .
Thread - local storage ( N2659 ) :
To declare a variable which will be instantiated once for each thread , use the thread_local storage class .
For example :
class MyClass {
…
private :
thread_local X tlsX ;
} ; void SomeFunc ( ) {
thread_local Y tlsY ;
…
} ;
Dynamic initialization and destruction with concurrency ( N2660 ) handles two major cases :
Static and global variables can be concurrently initialized and destroyed if you try to access them on multiple threads before main ( ) begins .
If more than one thread could initialize ( or use ) the variable concurrency , however , it ’s up to you to synchronize access .
Function - local static variables will have their initialization automatically protected ; while one thread is initializing the variable , any other threads that enter the function and reach the variable ’s declaration will wait for the initialization to complete before they continue on .
Therefore you do n’t need to guard initialization races or initialization - use races , and if the variable is immutable once constructed then you do n’t need to do any synchronization at all to use it safely .
If the variable can be written to after construction , you do still need to make sure you synchronize those post- initialization use - use races on the variable .
Thread safety guarantees for the standard library ( N2669 ) :
The upshot is that the answer to questions like “ what do I need to do to use a vector < T > v or a shared_ptr < U> sp thread - safely ? ” is now explicitly “ same as any other object : if you know that an object like v or sp is shared , you must synchronize access to it . ”
Only a very few objects need to guarantee internal synchronization ; the global allocator is one of those , though , and so it gets that stronger guarantee .
The “ other features ” section below also includes a few smaller concurrency - related items .
More STL algorithms ( N2666 )
We now have the following new STL algorithms .
Some of them fill holes ( e.g. , “ why is n’t there a copy_if or a counted version of algorithm X ? ” ) and others provide handy extensions ( e.g. , “ why is n’t there an all_of or any_of ? ” ) .
all_of ( first , last , pred )
returns true iff all elements in the range satisfy pred
returns true iff all elements in the range satisfy pred any_of ( first , last , pred )
returns true iff any element in the range satisfies pred
returns true iff any element in the range satisfies pred copy_if ( first , last result , pred )
the “ why is n’t this in the standard ? ” poster child algorithm
the “ why is n’t this in the standard ? ” poster child algorithm copy_n ( first , n result )
copy for a known number of n elements
copy for a known number of n elements find_if_not ( first , last , pred )
returns an iterator to the first element that does not satisfy pred
returns an iterator to the first element that does not satisfy pred iota ( first , last , value )
for each element in the range , assigns value and increments value “ as if by ++value ”
for each element in the range , assigns value and increments value “ as if by ++value ” is_partitioned ( first , last , pred )
returns true iff the range is already partitioned by pred ; that is , all elements that satisfy pred appear before those that do n’t
returns true iff the range is already partitioned by pred ; that is , all elements that satisfy pred appear before those that do n’t none_of ( first , last , pred )
returns true iff none of the elements in the range satisfies pred
returns true iff none of the elements in the range satisfies pred partition_copy ( first , last , out_true , out_false , pred )
copy the elements that satisfy pred to out_true , the others to out_false
copy the elements that satisfy pred to out_true , the others to out_false partition_point ( first , last , pred )
assuming the range is already partitioned by pred ( see is_partitioned above ) , returns an iterator to the first element that does n’t satisfy pred
assuming the range is already partitioned by pred ( see is_partitioned above ) , returns an iterator to the first element that does n’t satisfy pred uninitialized_copy_n ( first , n , result )
uninitialized_copy for a known number of n elements

Next Meeting
Although we just got back from France , the next meeting of the ISO C++ standards committee is already coming up fast :
The meetings are public , and if you ’re in the area please feel free to drop by .
EU , Bush consider new Iran sanctions KRANJ , Slovenia  President Bush and the European Union on Tuesday threatened tougher financial sanctions against Iran to block it from developing nuclear weapons that could endanger world peace .
Bush , at his eighth — and last — summit with the 27 - nation EU , said the message to Iran is clear if it refuses to halt its nuclear enrichment program : " We 're going to continue to isolate you ; we 'll continue to work on sanctions ; we 'll find new sanctions if need be , if you continue to deny the just demands of a free world . "
The promise of tighter financial sanctions , however , comes as several European nations continue to trade with Iran .
EUROPEAN TOUR : Many EU leaders agree with Bush on Iran nukes Italy is Tehran 's No 1 trading partner in Europe , recently replacing Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pressured firms to reduce their financial ties with Iran .
Earlier this year , a Swiss power company signed a 25 - year contract with Iran to bring Iranian natural gas to Europe .
" European governments want tough sanctions , " says Simon Barrett , a Mideast analyst in London who closely monitors Iran 's activities .
" At the same time , though , you have European industry and business that fear losing out . "
High energy prices are a major factor , and a fear that if companies do n't do business with Iran , then others will , says Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
European leaders also worry about being too dependent on Russia for energy , Clawson says .
Russia supplies 12 % of Europe 's oil and 25 % of its natural gas .
At the EU summit , the leaders said Iran must disclose any nuclear weapons work and allow verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
The agency last month suggested that Iran had made more progress toward a warhead than previously thought and demanded more information .
Bush and the European leaders dealt with other issues , including climate change , rising oil and food prices , the weak U.S. dollar and peace between Israel and the Palestinians .
Bush , however , was most passionate about Iran .
He did n't answer whether the United States or Israel would launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran to keep it from developing a nuclear weapon .
Bush did say , however , that if " you were living in Israel , you 'd be a little nervous " if the leader of a neighboring state " says he wants to destroy you . "
Iran has ignored three sets of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council and continues to enrich uranium .
Iran insists the program is to generate electricity .
Bush said if Iran ends up with a nuclear bomb , " the free world is going to say why did n't we do something about it at the time ? …
Now 's the time for there to be strong diplomacy . "
On the issue of climate change , the EU leaders urged Bush to back a global agreement to reduce carbon emissions .
Bush insists that China and India , not just developed nations , must also be part of any agreement .
Bush also brushed aside the idea that the U.S. government would intervene to strengthen the dollar .
He said he believes in a strong - dollar policy , but would let the world market establish its value .
He vowed to return to Slovenia some day " as a tourist . "
" As you know , I 'm close to retirement , " Bush joked .
After the summit , Bush flew to Germany as part of his week - long farewell trip through Europe .
Enlarge By Jason Reed , Reuters President Bush says the United States and Europe are thinking alike in working to deny Iran a nuclear bomb .
Here , the president is seen with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso , right , and European Union President and Slovenia 's Prime Minister Janez Jansa , center , at Brdo Castle in Kranj , Slovenia , on Tuesday .

Even though this is n’t the prettiest mod , everything is fully functional — including the speaker and microphone .
The tradition of nicknaming US states has made Florida the Sunshine State and Alaska the Last Frontier .
But only one has given itself a second moniker , a move that matches its bold environmental vision .
Welcome to New Mexico , the Land of Enchantment – now also known as the Clean Energy State .
Since giving his state its new nickname four years ago , governor Bill Richardson has helped create at least 37 incentive programmes promoting green power .
From utility - bill discounts to a statewide renewable portfolio standard ( RPS ) for electricity , New Mexico's 2 m residents are given every opportunity to weave clean energy into their daily lives .
" The RPS drives consumption of renewables within the state , " Sarah Cottrell , Richardson 's energy policy adviser , said .
" We have so much potential here for wind and solar that it far exceeds the demand . "
The state 's journey to environmental leadership is even more notable because of the inaction that has persisted at the national level .
Although 25 states have approved their own RPS , a national standard has stalled in the face of resistance from traditional coal - powered utilities and their allies in Congress .
Wind and biomass are popular in New Mexico , but the desert sun that draws millions of tourists here also makes its solar power potential the second largest in America .
So it is that the Clean Energy State 's future just may lie in the south corner of Albuquerque , at the end of a dry road marked by a mile - long sculpture of a snake with jewelled eyes .
The road ends at Mesa del Sol , a 13,000 - acre development area that is poised to become a hotbed of the US solar industry .
Aided by a $ 10 m ( £ 5 m ) investment from the state government , Advent Solar is already producing cutting - edge " back contact " cells at Mesa del Sol .
Advent 's design places electric contacts at the rear of the solar cell panel rather than the front - loaded style common in most panels , maximising the light energy that is trapped for household use .
For now Advent focuses on exporting cells to the booming European solar market .
" It 's good for the trade deficit and good for the environment , " company spokeswoman Misty Benham said .
That could change when Advent gets a new neighbour in Germany 's Schott Solar .
The world No 8 in cell production , Schott plans to invest $ 100 m in its new Albuquerque plant .
" According to both industry analysts and our projections , the market for solar energy will double over the next five years , " Schott chairman Udo Ungeheuer said as he announced the plant opening .
The prospect of two New Mexico - based solar companies vying for a foothold in the growing US market is a compelling one .
" We 're beating them to the punch , " Benham , of Advent , said .
Yet again it all comes down to Washington – and the dream may slip away if Congress does not extend the solar energy tax credit this year .
Both the solar and wind credits are mired in political squabbling .
Analysts warn that Schott and other companies could scale back their US investments without the certainty of a long - term tax benefit .
Still , New Mexico is working hard to earn its new nickname .
Richardson formed the Western Climate Initiative last year with four other governors to focus on sustainability goals because , as Cottrell put it , " the feds are n't acting fast enough " .
And just as Advent looks for a foothold over Schott in the New Mexico solar market , the state has found itself competing with nearby California over the pace of clean energy reforms .
Richardson 's aides have developed a " pretty entertaining rivalry with Governor [ Arnold ] Schwarzenegger 's people " , Cottrell said .
" We believe no one 's done as much as fast as we have . "
Despite the array of energy incentives available to New Mexicans , the state 's achievement may ultimately be measured in what leaves its borders .
The American southwest contains more than 250,000 square miles of land ripe for solar power generation , but the bigger challenge lies in transmitting that energy to the grid .
Barack Obama and John McCain are also working hard to win the southwest in November by emphasising renewable energy .
The presidential rivals visited New Mexico within a week of each other last month , and Obama is heading to Las Vegas today for a town hall meeting to promote his clean - power plans .
With that in mind , New Mexico is taking steps toward the export of clean power , becoming the first US state to form a renewable energy transmission authority ( Reta ) that provides financing for new high - voltage lines and towers .
( Texas , Nevada , and California have similar transmission initiatives . )
Transmission is not cheap - the average 345 - kV power line costs $ 1.5 m per mile to lay , according to the chief of New Mexico 's Reta , former BP executive Lisa Szot .
But it is one area where states can make progress .
" States need to be involved in transmission , " Szot said .
" The federal government is n't involved in permitting and siting [ of new power lines ] .
That even goes down to the county level . "
The process of building transmission infrastructure in New Mexico is a free - market conservative 's dream :
Szot fields ambitious proposals from clean energy firms and offers financing mechanisms , chiefly tax - exempt bonds , to those with the best project ideas .
Making the leap from New Mexico 's homegrown green movement to a thriving solar power export market may be as simple as electing a Democratic president in November .
Obama has put renewables at the top of his agenda , and the companies such as Advent are comfortable putting down roots in the Clean Energy State .
" The fact that [ New Mexico officials ] stood up and fought for us " convinced Advent to choose Mesa del Sol , Benham said .
" They 're very aware of renewables here . "
A former law professor who has spent much of his career as a behind - the - scenes bureaucrat , Mr. Medvedev showed a wide - ranging knowledge of foreign and domestic issues , confidently answering questions for 90 minutes without notes and speaking at length without stumbling .
The president , who is 42 , spoke only in Russian but did not need an interpreter to understand questions posed in English .
Mr. Medvedev provided no glimpses of disagreements with Mr. Putin on policies or strategy , though their stylistic differences were readily apparent .
Whereas Mr. Putin occasionally responds to questions with blunt retorts or salty language , Mr. Medvedev tends to offer demurrals and then to engage in a kind of academic discussion of issues .
As he has many times in recent weeks , Mr. Medvedev championed his proposals to reduce corruption , which he acknowledges is endemic in Russia .
He was then asked whether he believed that corruption could be beaten back , considering that the country ’s political system is dominated by a single party , Mr. Putin ’s United Russia .
“ A system that was built on the idea that one party holds all the truths demonstrated its weakness 20 years ago , ” Mr. Medvedev said .
“ It failed to cope with new challenges and ceased to exist .
That ’s why , to ensure the competitive ability of our country on a global scale , we must make use of political competition , among other things .
But it must be sensible .
This is to say , competition , correctly built . ”
Mr. Medvedev indicated that he would not get involved in the case of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky , the former oil oligarch and Putin opponent convicted of financial crimes and sent to a Siberian prison .
The authorities have recently brought new charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky , while his lawyers have mounted a campaign for his release .
Some political analysts have described Mr. Medvedev as more liberal than Mr. Putin and others in the Kremlin , in part because Mr. Medvedev did not serve in the security services .
( Mr. Putin is a former K.G.B. agent who was head of its successor agency , the F.S.B. )
Mr. Medvedev often says his background as a lawyer plays a crucial role in his worldview , and when he was asked about his reputation , he returned to that theme .
He said that when he was a student , he learned of the importance of the law , and of the right to private property .
He said he also realized that there needed to be a struggle in Russia against what he has termed “ legal nihilism . ”
Imagine for a minute , just a minute , that someone running for president was able to actually tell the truth , the real truth , to the American people about what would be the best 
I mean really the best  energy policy for the long - term economic health and security of our country .
I realize this is a fantasy , but play along with me for a minute .
What would this mythical , totally imaginary , truth - telling candidate say ?
For starters , he or she would explain that there is no short - term fix for gasoline prices .
Prices are what they are as a result of rising global oil demand from India , China and a rapidly growing Middle East on top of our own increasing consumption , a shortage of “ sweet ” crude that is used for the diesel fuel that Europe is highly dependent upon and our own neglect of effective energy policy for 30 years .
Cynical ideas , like the McCain - Clinton summertime gas - tax holiday , would only make the problem worse , and reckless initiatives like the Chrysler - Dodge - Jeep offer to subsidize gasoline for three years for people who buy its gas guzzlers are the moral equivalent of tobacco companies offering discounted cigarettes to teenagers .
I ca n’t say it better than my friend Tim Shriver , the chairman of Special Olympics , did in a Memorial Day essay in The Washington Post : “ So Dodge wants to sell you a car you do n’t really want to buy , that is not fuel - efficient , will further damage our environment , and will further subsidize oil states , some of which are on the other side of the wars we ’re currently fighting .
...
The planet be damned , the troops be forgotten , the economy be ignored : buy a Dodge . ”

In NASA lingo , events that go as expected are " nominal . "
And in space , you really want things to be nominal .
But in April , astronaut Peggy Whitson had a ride home from the International Space Station that was anything but .
Her Soyuz descent module failed to separate properly , forcing it into a ballistic path — a fast , steep entry that caused the craft to miss the landing site by 295 miles .
We asked her what it was like .
Wired : Can you describe the descent ?
Whitson :
We did the predicted deorbit burn .
Then we separated from the other modules .
That 's done with pyros — explosive bolt releases — and you can hear it , because they 're up against the vehicle .
Wired :
When did you know something was wrong ?
Whitson : Right after that .
I looked out my window and saw part of the module 's cover floating about a meter away .
I asked Yuri Malenchenko , the Soyuz commander , " Hey , is that normal ? "
Wired : Nice .
Then what happened ?
Whitson :
We started noticing some unusual motion .
I felt like I was being thrown into my seat , but it 's hard to tell — your sensations after six months of zero gravity are pretty questionable .
Then the automatic system commanded a ballistic entry , and the gs started building up very quickly .
I saw 8.2 gs on the meter .
Wired :
Were you scared ?
Whitson : No . I was too busy to be scared .
I knew what was happening was not strictly nominal , but we train for these scenarios .
Wired : Uh -huh .
You astronauts always say that .
Whitson : Sorry .
I guess it 's a cliche , but it 's true .
Of course , there 's not much you can do in 8 gs .
But that was probably a minute or less , and then it dropped to 4.5 gs and we could breathe again .
Then we felt the big yank of the parachute deploying .
Wired : Again , scary .
Whitson :
Oh , we also had smoke coming from under the control panel , so we shut it off .
That meant we had no altitude data aside from a less reliable wrist gauge and looking out the window .
Wired :
And the actual touchdown ?
Whitson :
We bounced about 10 meters and rolled .
When we stopped , I was on top , hanging in my seat .
Wired :
Which is when you got out of the capsule ?
Whitson :
Well , when Yuri opened the hatch there was a grass fire outside , so we recommended he close the hatch for a little bit .
It was desert grass , so it burned out relatively quickly .
And then we managed to crawl out .
Wired :
Any landing you can crawl away from is a good one , I guess .
Whitson : Obviously it was n't totally nominal .

A core problem with government is that its managers believe that all reality will conform to their wishes if they issue the right orders , pass the right laws , and put the right people in charge .
Reality resists this simple - minded approach ; witness the debacle of the war on terror .
Sadly , the same group that has managed that war is now managing another one : the war on recession .
The tendency of these managers is to fabricate a view of cause and effect that conforms to what they would like to do .
In the war on terror , we were told that the 9 - 11 attacks came about because shadowy bad guys from afar resent our freedom .
If you believe that , the answer is more militarism and killing as a preventative measure .
If , however , you realize that these attacks grew out of a desire for vengeance against American military policies , the implied policy solution looks radically different .
So it is with the economy and the proper policy response to recession .
If you believe that there is no good reason for an economic downturn other than a wave of animal spirits and flagging public confidence , your response is to inject optimism via the printing press .
Surely , nothing makes folks happier — temporarily — than for them to find themselves awash in newly printed bills .
This will lead to internal joy , consumer spending , and thus recovery .
So believes the silly political class .
Consider a different view of cause and effect .
If the recession is a correction to an overly pumped economic boom , matters change .
The recession , then , is not an aberration crying out for correction ; it is itself the correction for the unsustainable economic bubble that preceded it .
It should be welcomed in the same way we welcome a sober day after a drunken evening , or the detoxification of an addict after a period of addiction .
But here again , government begins with a view of cause and effect that conforms to its institutional wishes .
The recession is the problem , and the only problem , and it can be corrected through the usual means : issuing orders , passing laws , and giving more power to the right people .
It gets worse .
A recession contains at least one feature that turns out to be a saving grace for consumers who are hit with economic instability .
In the midst of layoffs , tighter lending standards , and a riskier entrepreneurial environment , at least there are some sectors that have declining prices .
At least in some areas , the purchasing power of money is rising .
This makes life a bit easier .
In times when there is very little good news , this is something to hang on to .
But instead of seeing falling prices as the silver lining in the recessionary cloud , government ( and the media as an echo ) sees them as the cause of all other problems .
So , would n't you know , government sets out to stamp out falling prices on the theory that if this succeeds , the entire economy will rise like a phoenix from the ashes .
This was the view during the Great Depression .
Herbert Hoover 's and then FDR 's economic team was convinced that falling prices represented not a saving grace but a mortal economic sin .
They spent more than ten years trying to make all prices rise .
This , they believed , would cause recovery .
They tried inflating the money supply .
They tried wage and price floors , with vigilante enforcement , and even all - around industrial price planning .
Finally , FDR tried the ultimate sand - in - your - face tactic : he went to war , and sent all those unemployed folks to foreign lands to kill and be killed , or to make - work jobs in the military - industrial complex , the CCC on steroids .
What did we learn from that debacle ?
Let 's make it official : we have learned nothing from our experience during the Great Depression .
Even now , people are under the impression that falling prices cause recessions .
Here is proof from the lead to this New York Times story : " With sinking home values continuing to drag down the economy … "
Sorry , but it just is n't true .
Falling house prices are not good news for homeowners who believed that they had purchased an asset that would forever go up in price .
But they are wonderful news for people who are shopping for homes .
They can buy more for less , and avoid frightening levels of mortgage debt in the process .
In macroeconomic terms , the housing bust is also a welcome event since it was precisely this sector that was wildly ballooned during the boom .
Unsound investments ( or consumption goods masquerading as investments ) must be leveled out before economic recovery can begin .
But it is really true that an economy can survive and thrive with falling prices .
Falling computer prices did n't drag down the economy in the '90s .
Nor did falling clothing prices .
And consider the Gilded Era , the most prosperous until that point in all of human history .
The consumer price index fell from 47 in 1864 to 25 in 1900 — nearly by half .
That 's another way of saying that money became twice as valuable .
And where was the calamity ?
Savings and pay packets zoomed in value .
This period is called the Second Industrial Revolution because of the astounding increases in productivity , population , and technology .
Falling prices and sustainable economic expansion are positively related in all of economic history .
If government and the Fed succeed in propping up home prices or preventing them from falling as much as they might otherwise , what will be the result ?
Homes will continue to be overexpensive and , on the margin , unwarranted purchases .
This will not bring about economic recovery .
This will force American consumers to spend more at precisely the time when they should be saving and getting out of debt .
There are lessons here .
One is never to permit the government to discern the relationship between cause and effect .
Government invariably rules out the possibility that the structure of the public sector itself is to blame for the problem , whether that problem is terrorism or recession .
Another lesson is that we need to shut down the machinery that allows government to enact its plans .
If there continues to be a slice of the population that gets its kicks from issuing orders and trying to make the world conform to them , these people ought to be given a video - game console to play with .
The game can be called Grand Theft Society .
The stakes are too high to permit them to play their games using real wealth and real lives .
Reports are coming in of digital video recording systems refusing to record NBC programs - both on digital cable and over - the - air transmissions .
We 're still investigating whether these involved over - the - air digital TV , which would mean that NBC was the first broadcaster to attempt to revive the abandoned ATSC " broadcast flag " ( as opposed to cable and analog copy control signals like CGMS - A which have been used before ) .
Thanks to the activism of thousands of concerned tech users , hardware and software manufacturers that handle over - the - air digital TV do not need to obey the digital TV broadcast flag .
There is no " broadcast flag " copy control requirement for these tuners , since the courts overturned the FCC 's plans to enforce it in 2005 ; and despite the entertainment industry 's bluster , it does not look like a broadcast flag law will be passed before the digital switch - over next year .
However , hardware and software could voluntarily obey the flag .
Rightsholders are almost certainly lobbying behind the scenes to get tech companies to agree to obey copy controls for over - the - air digital TV .
Software like Vista is already designed to comply with rightsholder restrictions when working with standards like CableCard which contractually require copy protection .
Turning the same restrictions on when a message is received from an over - the - air tuner is just a small coding step away .
At this point no one knows which tech companies have sold out their users in this way .
For understandable reasons , manufacturers keep their compliance details quiet -- which is why customers are so angry when they encounter it .
ATI has previously reported that they will support the broadcast flag , but this news was buried in a driver change log .
Companies that implement the over - the - air digital broadcast flag are under no obligation , contractually or due to FCC regulation , to do so .
They have a choice .
And so do their customers .
Millions of dollars will be spent in the next few months as America switches to digital television .
Prosumers like those at " The Green Button " are often the first to be bitten by TV 's copy restrictions , but they will not be the last .
Perhaps electronics magazines and online reviews should look into exactly how digital TV equipment is dealing with the rightsholders ' demands , and publicize which companies still obey the redundant and user - unfriendly broadcast flag -- and which still listen to their customers .
Could the treatment of psychiatric and mood disorders be as simple as eating more fish ?
Fish oil contains , specifically docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , which are known to have positive cardiovascular outcomes .
Fish oil intake , through diet or supplementation , has noteworthy effects on lowering total cholesterol , lowering LDL ( “ bad ” cholesterol ) , and increasing HDL ( “ good ” cholesterol ) .
In addition to the cardiovascular benefits of fish oil , there may be neurological , psychiatric , and emotional benefits , as well .
Omega - 3 fatty acids are components of the cell membranes of the brain and central nervous system .
These fatty acids promote cellular function , maintain membrane structure , and act as messengers in the nervous system .
DHA is essential for physical brain growth and development and EPA corresponds to the evolution of mood and behaviors .
Consequently , adequate levels of omega - 3 fatty acids are vital to optimal neurological functioning .
Fatty acids are essential to brain growth as early as the pre- and postnatal period , and are particularly important in behavior management , mood development , and sensory functioning in infants .
These fatty acids , available naturally in colostrum and breast milk , are now added to many infant formulas to support brain and visual function .
Western diets are traditionally low in omega - 3 fatty acid consumption .
A review of studies relating to diet and psychological development concludes that this may , in part , contribute to the incidence and prevalence of psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions in today ’s society .
The mechanism has not been clearly deciphered , but many psychiatric illnesses are associated with increased oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory conditions in the central nervous system .
DHA and EPA have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may confer the neurological benefits of fatty acids .
Many studies have reported that depression is associated with low levels of omega - 3 fatty acids , including perinatal and postpartum depression in mothers .
Treatment of these disorders with fatty acid supplementation has elicited positive outcomes and shows promise as a viable treatment option for depressive disorders .
Additionally , DHA and EPA supplementation benefits ADHD , autism , dyslexia , premenstrual syndrome , dysmenorrhea , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , and borderline personality disorder .
Some research has shown a connection between low omega - 3 fatty acid levels and substance abuse patients , as well as domestic violence perpetrators .
A recent study reported that substance abusers showed a strong correlation between low levels of omega - 3 fatty acids and anger and anxiety .
When these substance abusers received fatty acid supplements , their anger and anxiety levels were reduced .
Interestingly , an increase in EPA correlated to decreased anxiety , and increased DHA levels correlated to reduced anger .
In a similar study , substance abusers treated with fatty acid supplements experienced reduced anger up to 3 months after the treatment was stopped .
Omega - 3 fatty acids also decrease the amount of corticotropin - releasing hormone in the central nervous system .
This hormone plays a key role in fear and anxiety , components of violent behavior in perpetrators of domestic violence .
Low levels of omega - 3 fatty acids lead to increased hormones that play a role in violent behavior .
Additionally , omega - 3 fatty acids may have a protective effect in acute and chronic neurological injury and diseases , possibly resulting from the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the fatty acids and their metabolites .
Cognitive impairment and decline are also associated with low levels of DHA and EPA , and mental functioning was maintained in middle - aged patients when adequate levels of fish oils were consumed .
Increased levels of EPA and DHA are also linked to a decreased incidence of dementia , including a decreased risk of Alzheimer ’s disease .
Omega - 3 fatty acid supplementation may prove to be effective treatment for many groups of patients suffering from psychiatric and emotional disorders , as well as neurological injury .
Supplementation offers very few risks or adverse effects , and may be a safe treatment option for children , pregnant women , and patients with treatment - resistant psychiatric and mood disorders .
More research is needed to further clarify the widespread clinical value of fish oil and omega - 3 fatty acids .

What happened 28th June This Day in History on your birthday Find Out For Next 7 Days - June
Today , I discovered a couple of resources on what you should say to police .
One , I found on my own :
It ’s just text , and a reasonably quick read .
The other was a link sent to me via IMs by someone I know from high school :
That second one is a WMV file — a video recording of a lecture by a law professor , with some follow - up by a police officer ( who I ’m pretty sure is one of the professor ’s students , studying to become a lawyer himself ) .
This law professor is good , and worth watching , even if the entire video ( including the cop ) is something like 50 minutes .
“ mcsalmon ” had this to say in reddit discussion :
The video linked to is an hour long and worth every minute spent watching it .
It ’s a brilliant deconstruction of the 5th amendment and it ’s intent and it ’s modern usage .
Highly recommended .
Moral of the story : Do n’t tell the police anything .
First example :
Cop – “ Do you know how fast you were going ? ”
Me – “ I have nothing to say . ”
Second example :
Cop – “ Would you mind answering some questions ? ”
Me – “ I have nothing to say . ”
Third example :
Cop – “ We ’ve been sitting in this interrogation room for ten hours .
I ’m making $ 60 per hour in overtime .
I can sit here for another twenty , at that rate .
Are you sure you do n’t want to say anything ? ”
Me – “ I have nothing to say . ”
If you ’re going to tell a cop anything other than “ I have nothing to say , ” it should be “ . . . without an attorney present . ”
It does n’t matter if you ’re innocent of wrongdoing , will say nothing but the truth ( even by accident ) , and were 1000 miles away from the scene of the crime — saying something can get you convicted .
It does n’t matter if you use the word “ hypothetically ” all the time , either .
It really does n’t matter if something is said to be “ off the record ” ( there ’s no such thing according to the cop in the video ) .
Just do n’t do it .
Remember , Martha Stewart was n’t convicted of wrongdoing — she was convicted of saying something that sounded like a lie in a court of law .
Remember , if you say something and a police officer misremembers it later , it ’s your word against his — and jurors are more likely to believe a cop .
Just do n’t tell them anything .
It ’s a lesson I ’ll take to heart .
Increasing prices , concerns over supplies and suppliers , and environmental worries make the notion of creating your own synthetic gasoline very appealing .
It is scientifically possible to create fuel for gasoline powered engines out of materials like wood pellets or organic trash , but the costs , explosive dangers , and specialty equipment and skills needed put such methods beyond the abilities of most people .
Therefore , making synthetic fuel is likely just a DIY dream — but if you ’re still interested in trying , start by getting a handle on the basics !

This web page has 31,415,929 base 27 digits of pi for you to search .
Normally , we write numbers in base 10 , using ten different digits .
Computers use base 2 , with just the two digits 0 and 1 .
The ancient Babylonians used sixty different digits - they counted in base 60 .
I wanted to let people find their names in pi , but the alphabet has 26 letters .
What 's more , I wanted A to be 1 , B to be 2 , and so forth , so I needed an extra digit 0 , making 27 digits in all .
So I converted the decimal digits of pi to base 27 , stored them on my webserver , and made this page so people could search for their name !
You can read more about how your name can be in pi , or start searching for your name now .
Psst - teachers , check out the teacher 's notes .
So , when you 're ready to find your name in pi .....

Here ’s an idea .
Carbon dioxide removed from smokestack emissions could become a valuable raw material for the production of polycarbonate plastics in eyeglass lenses , car headlamps , DVDs , CDs , and drink bottles .
The processes involved would offer less expensive , safer and greener products , researchers suggested in two separate reports presented at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society .
“ Carbon dioxide is readily available , especially from the smokestack of industries that burn coal and other fossil fuels , ” says chemist Thomas Müller .
“ And it ’s a very cheap starting material .
If we can replace more expensive starting materials with CO2 , then you ’ll have an economic driving force . ”
There ’s already a huge market , and millions of tons of polycarbonates are sold each year .
But what has n’t been factored in is that these hard , tough materials represent what Müller calls “ intriguing sinks ” for exhaust carbon dioxide .
In fact , there ’s no other consumer product with such potential for removing CO2 from the environment .
So , we may be drinking from a CO2 plastic bottle ( well , hopefully not ) and watching movies on waste - CO2 DVDs ( well , preferably streaming ) soon .
“ I would say it ’s a matter of a few years before CO2 - derived polymers are available to the public , ” says Müller .
Good idea : make polycarbonates from waste CO2 .
Better idea : make less pollution and less polycarbonate plastics .

Ingredients
1 kg back or shoulder bacon
60g garlic ( or use some garlic flakes )
Marinade :
4 Tbsp ( approx 150g ) honey
200g sugar
2 Tbsp light soya sauce
1 Tbsp sesame oil
2 Tbsp fish sauce
1/4 tsp salt ( adjust salt according to how salty your bacon is )
1 Tbsp oyster sauce
250 ml water
Method
1. Bruise whole garlics and remove skins and set aside .
2 . Mix all marinade ingredients together and microwave till sugar is melted
3 . Put in the garlic and leave mixture to cool .
4. Marinade bacon in an airtight container in the fridge .
5 . Leave to marinade for at least 2 days before grilling ( bacon should be submerged in the marinade )
6. Barbecue on a low heat until golden .
Note
1 . I bought a reasonably priced ( did n't see the point of buying expensive bacon , as I was going to completely alter its flavour anyway ) 1 kilo pack of shoulder bacon ( it is leaner , have to watch those cholestrol level ) and split it into half .
Marinated one half for 2 days and barbequed it first , then using the same marinate , added half the required sugar and marinated the remaining bacon for the required duration .
2 . The barbecued bacon gets a nice and sticky after being left to sit for a few hours .
Recipe : rusti @kitchencaper
This recipe is based on the style ofloong yoke ( recipe here ) aka bak kwa or ba gua ( as they are popularly called in Singapore ) or barbecued dried meat except it uses bacon instead of pork .
Rusti from kc posted this recipe and it seem an easy way to make a delicious piece of bbq meat that I can also use when making my tomato , onion and bacon loaf .
It will definitely be more flavoursome than the ordinary bacon that I have been using .
It tasted great eaten with a slice of homemade bread or as a snack .

When all is said and done , do you really need a game that lets you create your character using nine different skin tones and twelve varying facial characteristics so he looks like you , or Jean Luc Picard ?
You 'll just spend the whole time staring at the back of his head anyway .
Be honest - do you have any use for an unlockable Time Attack mode , and are you ever going to look at that concept art ?
No .
Gaming should be its own reward .
Rockstar demonstrates this with Table Tennis , which I imagine to have been conceived as a post - hot - coffee - burn fuck you to the rest of the industry by saying , " See ?
We can still make games ten times more innovative and fun than you without using the slightest hint of sex or violence - we just choose not to . "

Not unlike Pong or Odin Sphere , Table Tennis takes a single mode of a simple game and , diving into the details , makes it deep and complex .
At all times you must consider your angle and distance from the table , as well as your opponent 's , where you want to hit the ball , how much power and what type of spin you want to put on it , what type of spin your opponent just used beforehand , and each of your turbo levels .
Atmospherically , the game takes a flat , sterile playing field and ratchets up the intensity better than any deathmatch or guitar showdown .
A rally begins in silence and techno music gradually builds as it slogs on , along with cheers Eventually a trancelike state is implied when a spotlight falls on the table and the room darkens , as the sounds of the ball start to echo in your head .
Winning points such as these are incredibly satisfying .
Losing them makes you want to pull your hair out .
Another amazing feature to pull you into the game is vibration .
The closer your aim and power pushes the ball to going out , the more your controller vibrates .
Like picking a lock in Splinter Cell , the trick is finding just the right amount vibration .
All this gameplay is delivered in typical Rockstar form , with the camera quickly cutting to slow - motion closeups on nail biter shots and the characters coming alive with emotion .
Never to the point of pomposity though , Rockstar allows each piece of flair to be deactivated or skipped , proving once again that style is not a tradeoff versus substance .
Now if only they'd let you do this :
A man accused of deliberately spreading HIV had organised " conversion " parties at which others could be infected with the virus , a court has been told .

He faces more than 30 charges , including deliberately infecting two people with HIV and attempting to infect others .
Before make the post I promised I 'd make I thought I 'd make a digression to point out a connection between Intuitionistic Logic and a recent news story .
Intuitionistic logic is what we get when we take ordinary everyday classical logic and drop the Law of the Excluded Middle ( LEM ) , in other words , we drop the law that says that for any proposition , either it or its negation is true .
This is such an ingrained notion that it 's hard to imagine giving it up .
For example , it seems obvious that either it 's raining or it 's not raining .
But there are good reasons for not taking it for granted in mathematics .
The main issue is that sometimes when we use LEM we find that we can prove the existence of something , but have no way of constructing it .
Mathematics is full of such proofs .
The best known example is probably the proof that an irrational number raised to the power of an irrational number can be rational .
Some mathematicians ( and many computer scientists ) only like constructive proofs , ie .
proofs that actually exhibit the thing whose existence is being proved .
Using intuitionistic logic is a good way to always force this to be true .
So , for example , in classical logic , you might find you have proved " A or B " , but not have a proof of A or a proof of B .
But in intuitionistic logic , if you prove " A or B " , then you must have proved A or you must have proved B.Now ( British ) criminal law is more lax than mathematical logic when it comes to proof .
You only need to prove something beyond reasonable doubt , rather than providing a rigorous derivation from axioms .
( Though admittedly mathematicians rarely do this in practice . )
But criminal law does have one place where it has higher standards of proof than classical logic : you can't necessarily convict someone of " A or B " unless you have a proof of A or a proof of B .
A proof of " A or B " will not do .
It seems that there is enough evidence to show that Kate Moss recently used a controlled substance of class A or class B . Unfortunately , the law requires either a proof that she had been using a class A drug , or a proof that she had been using a class B drug .
A proof that she had been using one or the other will not do .
And hence Kate Moss can not be prosecuted .
In this regard , the law is Intuitionistic .
If you 're going to have a legal system that does n't recognise LEM then you really need to carve up crime - space as a semilattice so you can charge people with the join of two crimes :-)
The Tricastin nuclear site contains a power plant and a treatment facility France 's nuclear safety watchdog has ordered a plant in the country 's south to temporarily close after a uranium leak polluted the local water supply .
The plant 's operator has been told to improve safety procedures at the site .
Waste containing unenriched uranium leaked into two rivers at the Tricastin plant at Bollene , 40 km ( 25 miles ) from the popular tourist city of Avignon .
People in nearby towns have been warned not to drink any water or eat fish from the rivers since Monday 's leak .
Officials have also cautioned people not to swim in the rivers or use their water to irrigate crops .
Late notice Approximately 30 cubic metres of liquid containing unenriched uranium spilled from an overflowing reservoir at the Tricastin facility , which handles liquids contaminated by uranium , into the ground and into the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers .
The site has a nuclear reactor as well as a radioactive treatment plant .
The leak happened late on Monday night , but people in the affected areas were not informed until 1000 GMT on Tuesday .
The French Nuclear Safety Authority ( ASN ) inspected the Tricastin plant on Thursday and found that existing prevention measures were deficient and that its operator , Societe Auxiliaire de Tricastin ( Socatri ) , had been too slow to inform authorities about the leak .
The ASN is to submit a report to the state prosecutor for possible legal action against Socatri .
The company is a subsidiary of the French nuclear giant , Areva .
The safety inspection found that " security steps aimed at preventing any further pollution were not completely satisfactory " , the ASN said .
The inspectors also found " irregularities " at the site 's operations at the time of the leak .
Socatri has been ordered to implement " a reinforced surveillance plan , including analysis of the surrounding rivers and ground water " .
French Ecology Minister Jean - Louis Borloo said on Thursday that there was " no imminent danger " to the local population .
Socatri has said tests of the groundwater , local wells and the rivers show they have not been contaminated .
One anti-nuclear organisation has said it will take legal action against ASN , saying it had delayed sounding the alarm .
France is one of the world 's most nuclear - dependent countries , with 80 % of its electricity coming from nuclear power .

What are these ?
An Oxygen Factory in a Nearby Galaxy
This Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows the debris of a massive star explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud , a small galaxy about 160,000 light years from Earth .
The supernova remnant ( SNR ) shown here , N132D , is the brightest in the Magellanic clouds , and belongs to a rare class of oxygen - rich remnants .
Most of the oxygen that we breathe on Earth is thought to have come from explosions similar to this one .
The colors in this image show low energy X - rays ( red ) , intermediate energy X - rays ( green ) and high energy X - rays ( blue ) .
Substantial amounts of oxygen are detected in this image , particularly in the green regions near the center of the image .
The location of these oxygen - rich areas , detected in the Chandra image , is generally well matched with the oxygen - rich areas detected in Hubble Space Telescope images ( not shown here ) .
However , the expanding , ellipse - shaped shell of oxygen seen in N132D is not seen in either G292.0 +1.8 or Puppis A , two oxygen - rich SNRs in the galaxy with similar ages to N132D ( about 3,000 years , ten times older than Cas A ) .
The origin of this shell is unknown , but it might have been created by a `nickel bubble ' shortly after the supernova explosion , caused by radioactive energy input from nickel that was created by the explosion .
The existence of such bubbles is predicted by theoretical work .
The ultimate goal of these observations is to constrain the mass of the star that exploded and to learn more about how massive stars explode and spread heavy elements like oxygen into surrounding space .

Robots Get Pressure - Sensitive Skin
Organic field - effect transistors have been used to fabricate pressure - sensitive skin for robots , according to an abstract published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week .
Why is this good news ?
Because all of these fancy robots you 've been reading about have wonderful machine vision and even voice recognition , but they do n't have a good sense of touch .
At present , it is not possible to manufacture large area skin with thousands of silicon - based electronic pressure sensors with good mechanical flexibility .
Organic field - effect transistors and rubber pressure sensors are used to create a practical artifical skin .
One sf robot that could demonstrate how pressure - sensitive skin could be used was Rolem the wrestling robot from This Immortal , a classic Roger Zelazny novel .
An exquisite appreciation of force across wide surface areas would be needed to make sure a wrestling robot did not damage its user .

BAGHDAD ( AP )  A U.S. helicopter strike north of Baghdad killed eight people in a vehicle , including at least two children , Iraqi officials said Thursday , insisting all the dead were civilians .
The U.S. military said six were al - Qaeda militants but acknowledged children were killed .
Adding to the confusion , Associated Press Television News footage showed the bodies of three children in blood - drenched clothes — the eldest appearing to be in his early teens — along with the bodies of five men , at the hospital in Beiji , where the dead were taken after Wednesday evening 's strike .
Iraqi and U.S. officials each put the number of slain children at two .
The reason for the discrepancies between the two accounts and the TV footage was not known .
It was the latest incident threatening to alienate Sunni Arabs , who have played a key role in the steep decline in violence over the past year by joining forces with the Americans against al - Qaeda in Iraq .
Beiji , an oil hub 155 miles north of Baghdad , lies in a largely Sunni Arab area .
The strike came as the U.S. was trying to ease Iraqi anger over the shooting of a copy of the Quran by an American sniper , who used Islam 's holy book for target practice .
In Afghanistan on Thursday , a NATO soldier and two demonstrators were killed at a violent protest over the Quran shooting .
Iraq has not seen any street protests over the Quran shooting , which took place earlier this month in a Sunni area west of Baghdad .
But Iraqi leaders have loudly denounced the act , prompting a series of apologies from U.S. military commanders and President Bush .
The U.S. military says the sniper was disciplined and removed from Iraq .
In the attack near Beiji , the military said its forces were targeting members of an al - Qaeda suicide bombing network .
The forces engaged the occupants of a vehicle after they refused to surrender and " exhibited hostile intent . "
It said five suspected " terrorists " were killed along with two children in the vehicle .
A sixth militant was killed in a field next to the road , according to a statement .
Beiji police Col .
Mudhher al - Qaisi , however , said the dead were six civilian farmers and two children who were fleeing in their vehicle from the area after the U.S. forces launched their raids .
He said a U.S. helicopter became suspicious of their vehicle and opened fire on it .
" The residents feel angry now over this act by the American troops .
The victims were unarmed and work as farmers , " al - Qaisi said .
Mohammed al - Shimmari , who lives in the area , said the raid took place when a group of his relatives gathered at the home of his cousin after hearing he would be released soon from U.S. custody .
He said the Americans were holding the cousin on suspicion of insurgent ties .
When U.S. forces launched a raid on the cousin's house , those inside fled .
They included the group of eight in a minibus , which was then struck by the helicopter , said al - Shimmari , who lives near his cousin .
The U.S. military refused to confirm the mode of attack or specify what weapons were used , saying only that its forces " engaged the target vehicle 's occupants . "
U.S. spokesman Col. Jerry O'Hara said the military " sincerely regrets when any innocent civilians are injured , resulting from terrorists locating themselves in and around them .
We take every precaution to protect innocent civilians and engage only hostile threats . "
Iraqi security forces have launched a series of campaigns to impose their control in areas dominated by armed groups , including Sadr City in Baghdad , the southern city of Basra and the northern city of Mosul .
On Tuesday , some 10,000 Iraqi soldiers and police deployed in Sadr City , which for years was the unquestioned bastion of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia .
The deployment was enabled by a truce between al - Sadr and the government .
Although the deployment has been peaceful , the No. 2 U.S. commander in Iraq , Lt. Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III , warned it was fragile .
" We 're hopeful that it will hold .
But we recognize that , like anything , it is fragile and so there are a number of things that could happen , and we have to prepare ourselves for that eventuality , " he told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday .
He said violence had dropped dramatically in Iraq , with only 288 attacks , or an average of 41 per day , reported last week , the lowest number since April 2004 .
In a more dramatic example , he said only 15 attacks targeted U.S. forces on Wednesday , but that the military expects " episodic spikes " in the violence as militants try to regroup .
Militia violence has increased in areas of eastern Baghdad near Sadr City .
Three people were killed in clashes late Wednesday in the Obeida district .
Among them was Iraqi television cameraman Wissam Ali Auda , of Afaq TV , who was apparently caught in the crossfire on his way home , said Tariq Maher , an Afaq correspondent .
The station is affiliated with Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki 's Dawa party .
In a second journalist killing , the bullet - riddled body of Hashim al - Hussein , a correspondent for the Sharq newspaper who was kidnapped Tuesday , was found dumped near the city of Baqouba , north of Baghdad , police and morgue officials said .
Excluding the two deaths reported Thursday , at least 127 journalists and 50 media workers have been killed in Iraq since the war started , according to the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists .

In 1971 , a previously obscure Harvard philosophy professor , John Rawls , published a book that ultimately brought him acclaim as " America 's greatest political philosopher . "
In the book , " A Theory of Justice , " Rawls set forth an account of justice in the form of two principles , ordaining respectively that people 's " equal basic liberties "  such rights as freedom of speech , freedom of conscience , and the right to vote  should be maximized , and that inequalities in social and economic goods other than liberty are acceptable only if they promote the welfare of the " least advantaged " members of society .
( He termed the latter the " difference principle . " )
Three years after the appearance of " Theory , " a departmental colleague of Rawls , Robert Nozick , published a libertarian response , " Anarchy , State , and Utopia , " which argued that nothing more than a " minimal state " devoted to protecting people against crimes like assault , robbery , and fraud could be morally justified .
Nozick 's book was far more concise than Rawls 's " Theory , " and " Anarchy , State , and Utopia " did not go unnoticed :
It won the 1975 National Book Award and was later listed by the Times Literary Supplement as one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century .
" Anarchy " remains a staple of the syllabus in courses on political theory , where it is usually juxtaposed with selections from Rawls to suggest that Rawls 's welfare - state liberalism and Nozick 's libertarianism represent the full spectrum of possibilities for contemporary liberal democracies .
Nonetheless , Nozick 's reputation and influence in the academy  to say nothing of his name recognition in the broader world of law and politics  have never rivaled those of his colleague .
( Though 15 years younger than Rawls , Nozick died in the same year , 2002 , after a long struggle with cancer . )
Doubtless , part of the explanation is that Rawls 's " left- liberalism " ( as he later described his position ) harmonizes far better with the typical orientation of the contemporary professoriat .
In addition , unlike Rawls , Nozick never made the advancement of a particular political doctrine the unifying concern of his academic career .
Rather , his wide - ranging intellect led him to follow " Anarchy " ( his first book ) with other works addressing a considerable variety of philosophical topics , ranging from free will to decision theory to ( in his 1989 book " The Examined Life " ) love , death , faith , and the meaning of life .
More important , however , " Anarchy " never constituted a true alternative to Rawls 's doctrine , since , on every substantive issue except the legitimacy of governmental redistribution of wealth , Nozick and Rawls agreed .
( And even on that issue , in a passage typically ignored by his admirers , Nozick himself hedged . )
Like Rawls 's " Theory , " " Anarchy " opens with a sweeping statement of the primacy of justice  understood , in the latter book , as individual rights , defined as freedoms from external restraint over one 's actions  over all other criteria for assessing political and social institutions .
In other words , Nozick more or less retained Rawls 's first principle ( liberty ) while eliminating the second ( difference ) .
Suggesting that " the fundamental question of political philosophy " is not how government should be organized but " whether there should be any state at all , " Nozick offers an adaptation of John Locke 's doctrine that government is legitimate only to the degree that it affords greater security for life , liberty , and property than would exist in a chaotic , pre-political " state of nature . "
More emphatically than Locke , however , Nozick concludes that the need for security justifies only a minimal , or " night - watchman , " state , since it cannot be demonstrated , he believes , that all rational individuals would find any more extensive government necessary to secure their rights .
In place of Rawls 's " difference principle , " Nozick propounds an " entitlement theory " of justice , according to which individual property holdings are justified only if they derive from just acquisitions or ( voluntary ) transfers .
Remarkably , Nozick never spells out the criteria of just acquisition .
However , instead of " current time - slice " views of distributive justice , like Rawls's , which assess current holdings according to some external standard of equity , Nozick asserts a " historical " standard , which determines the legitimacy of a distribution purely by whether it originated from a just procedure .
Nozick offers a witty and incisive critique of Rawls 's rationale for his difference principle , refuting the implausible claim that merely because members of a society benefit from social cooperation , its less - advantaged members are automatically entitled to a share in the earnings of their more successful peers .
Yet Nozick 's libertarianism , which compares income taxation to forced labor , suffers from a corresponding defect of its own .
Nozick never acknowledges the need for a liberal regime to guarantee some level of social security and educational benefits to all citizens , to the extent its circumstances allow , if only to ensure the continued loyalty of the poor to that regime .
Like Rawls ,
Nozick sought to impose an abstract vision of justice on political life , relegating considerations of feasibility ( i.e. , of conformity with the likely demands of actual human beings ) to be resolved by others , in the spirit of Immanuel Kant 's dictum , " let justice triumph , even if the world perishes by it . "
Ironically , however , Nozick himself ultimately acknowledges that his entitlement theory is insufficient to refute demands for a redistributionist state , since it can never be demonstrated that existing holdings derive from an unbroken series of voluntary transfers :
Does n't every people 's collective title to their land derive from some original act of unjust conquest ?
Hence , surprisingly , he ends up suggesting that something like Rawls 's difference principle is morally required after all , in the name of " rectification , " on the dubious premise that those currently least - well - off have the highest probability of being descended from previous victims of injustice .
This is not the only area of agreement between Nozick and Rawls .
Like Rawls ,
Nozick insists that the justness of a society be assessed only by whether its procedures correspond to his preferred notions of justice , not whether it actually rewards morally worthy ways of life .
Also like Rawls , Nozick ends his book by representing the just society as morally libertarian in the extreme , implicitly denying the legitimacy of laws prohibiting such practices as prostitution and the sale of addictive drugs .
Although he balanced his critique of the flaws he discovered in Rawls 's theory with remarkable homage to its ostensible " beauty , " Nozick was far brighter , and a much better and more thought - provoking writer , than his colleague .
Unfortunately , he shared with Rawls a constricted view of political philosophy as an enterprise devoted to the production of abstract theories , with little or no regard for the grounding of justice in human nature .
Those seeking an alternative to the shallow egalitarianism and moral libertarianism of our time would do far better to return to the thought of America 's greatest statesmen , such as Lincoln and the authors of " The Federalist " ; to the liberal philosophers who guided them , notably Locke and Montesquieu , and ultimately to the greatest classical philosophers , for all of whom political theorizing was inseparable from the quest for a serious empirical understanding of the human condition and the human good .

Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain today called the U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing Guantanamo detainees to challenge their status in civilian courts " one of the worst I 've ever seen . "
" These are not American citizens .
They are enemy combatants , " McCain said during a campaign visit to New Jersey .
" I think this is one of the biggest mistakes that 's been made in terms of our ability to defend our nation in a long , long time . "
He called Thursday 's 5 - 4 ruling " a stunning reversal " of World War II precedents empowering the president , as commander in chief , to deal with enemy combatants .
McCain made his comments while traveling on his campaign bus to a town hall meeting at Burlington County College in Pemberton , where he vowed to compete in New Jersey , a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since 1988 .
McCain used the Guantanamo decision to draw sharp distinctions between himself and the Democratic candidate , Barack Obama , on the types of justices they would appoint to the U.S. Supreme Court .
" Senator Obama applauds this decision , " McCain said .
In a statement Thursday , Obama called the ruling " an important step toward reestablishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law . "
He also called it " a rejection of the Bush Administration 's attempt to create a legal black hole at Guantanamo -- yet another failed policy supported by John McCain . "

Finally we have our second installment of bizarre brain - related disorders .
In our first list we covered such illnesses as Stockholm Syndrome , and Stendhal Syndrome .
This time we are looking at some slightly more physical disorders – many of which are the result of physical damage to the brain or parts of the body .
If you have suffered from any of these illnesses , or know of people who have , it would be great to hear about your experiences .
Most of these are very rare , but a number of them are surprisingly common .
10 Phantom Limb Disorder
A person suffering from this disorder experiences the sensation that a missing limb ( or even organ , such as the appendix ) is still present on the body .
50 – 80 % of people who have had an amputation experience this disorder .
The sufferer will very often feel pain and discomfort in the phantom limb .
Some sufferers can feel their phantom limbs gesticulating while they talk , and others believe that the limb is acting independently of their will .
This disorder is often treated with Virtual Reality therapy ( as pictured above ) .
9 Body Integrity Identity Disorder
Also known as Amputee Identity Disorder , this illness causes a person to wish to have a healthy part of their body amputated .
In some cases , the sufferer has gone so far as to amputate their own limbs .
Some sufferers also have sexual fetishes involving amputees .
Some surgeons have actually amputated a limb for a person suffering this disorder , but it is a highly controversial move and most doctors use similar treatments to those used for phantom limb disorders .
8 Mythomania
Mythomania is a condition involving compulsive lying by a person with no obvious motivation .
The affected person might believe their lies to be truth , and may have to create elaborate myths to reconcile them with other facts .
A “ pathological liar ” is someone who often embellishes his or her stories in a way that he or she believes will impress people .
It may be that a pathological liar is different from a normal liar in that a pathological liar believes the lie he or she is telling to be true at least in public and is “ playing ” the role .
7 Somatoparaphrenia
Somatoparaphrenia is a type of monothematic delusion where one suddenly denies ownership of a limb or an entire side of ones body .
For example , a patient might believe that his own arm would belong to the doctor , or that another patient left it behind .
It can sometimes be treated by vestibular caloric stimulation ( squirting warm water into the patient ’s ear in a specific way ) , although most sufferers will not be aware of this and may request amputation , which is almost always denied as amputating a healthy limb would be a basic violation of the Hippocratic Oath .
In the image above we see a series of drawings made by a sufferer of this disorder .
6 Munchausen Syndrome
Munchausen syndrome is a psychiatric disorder in which those affected fake disease , illness , or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves .
It is in a class of disorders known as factitious disorders which involve “ illnesses ” whose symptoms are either self - induced or falsified by the patient .
It is also sometimes known as hospital addiction syndrome .
A related illness is Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy in which the person feigns the illness in another person – usually going so far to cause them harm to perpetuate the myth in order to gain sympathy for themselves .
5 Alice in Wonderland Syndrome
This may sound familiar to drug users : AIWS or Micropsia is a condition in which a patient ’s sense of time , space and body image are distorted .
People may appear tiny or patients may feel that part of their body shape or size has been altered .
A sufferer may perceive humans , parts of humans , animals , and inanimate objects as substantially smaller than in reality .
Another name for the condition is Lilliput sight or Lilliputian hallucinations .
The image above illustrates the illusion suffered by patients of this disorder .
4 Neglect Syndrome
In Neglect Syndrome , a person loses the ability to give equal attention to both sides of a space .
For example , a patient in a rehabilitation hospital may wake up in the morning and proceeds to shave his face – only to be told later that he has only shaved half of his face .
A person with this disorder , when drawing a person , will often leave off the arm and leg from one side , and when questioned , will state that it looks perfectly fine to them .
When drawing a clock , the sufferer will often draw a circle and stuff all of the numbers in to one side ( as in the image above ) .
Neglect Syndrome is most often caused by damage to one hemisphere of the brain , as in the case of a stroke .
3 Kleptomania
Kleptomania is the disease in which a person has great difficulty resisting the impulse to steal something .
Despite this being a disorder , the US and UK courts do not consider it a defense against stealing .
Kleptomania usually begins in puberty and continues until late adulthood .
It is considered to be a part of the obsessive compulsive range of disorders .
Kleptomaniacs usually steal items of little value , and some will tend to steal the same types of items repeatedly .
2 Foreign Accent Syndrome
Foreign Accent Syndrome is a very rare disorder which usually occurs after some kind of brain injury ( such as a stroke or head injury ) .
When a person suffers from this syndrome they speak their native language with a foreign accent .
There have been 50 recorded cases of this syndrome between 1941 and 2006 .
According to Wikipedia , a well - known case of foreign accent syndrome occurred in Norway in 1941 after a young woman , Astrid L. , suffered a head injury from shrapnel during an air - raid .
After apparently recovering from the injury she was left with what sounded like a strong German accent and was shunned by her fellow Norwegians .
You can read about one case on the BBC .
1 Genital Retraction Syndrome
Genital Retraction Syndrome is a strange disorder in which the sufferer believes that his genitals ( or breasts in the case of women sufferers ) are shrinking , retracting in to the body , or may be removed entirely .
Even more strangely , there have been cases of this occurring amongst many people at the same time ; this is called penis panic .
The phenomenon is often associated with occult beliefs or witchcraft .
Outbreaks of penis panic occurred in China in 1948 , 1955 , 1966 , 1974 and 1984 /85 .
It is worth reading the Wikipedia article on this very bizarre syndrome .

Once more , gloom is descending over Wall Street .
After rallying for a few hopeful months this spring , the stock market is sinking to its lowest level in years .
Cracks are reappearing in the credit markets .
The price of oil is rising from one record to another .
And the analysts who seemed so confident a few weeks ago are predicting another round of steep losses at big financial companies like Citigroup .
On Thursday , the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 358 points , its steepest decline in nearly three weeks .
The blue - chip index closed at 11,453.42 , its lowest since September 2006 .
One longtime member of the Dow industrials , the General Motors Corporation , plunged to its lowest since 1974 .
Downgrades in the financial industry and fear over the deteriorating health of the auto sector were the immediate causes of Thursday ’s sell - off .
But the abrupt reversal in the markets  only five weeks ago the Dow was flying above 13,000  reflects the realization among investors that the troubles plaguing the economy may be worse than initially feared .
While many regarded the Bear Stearns implosion in March as the moment of maximum pessimism in the financial markets , some analysts say bigger problems now lie ahead for the broader economy .
July Fourth is a celebration of outdoor cooking , as well as our nation 's birthday .
It 's time to brush off the barbecue and throw masses of processed meat on the grill .
As we all stand around waiting for the fire to die down so that we can make s'mores , it 's also a time to ponder the notion that the barbecue is a ritual 700,000 years old or more , and it might have something to do with our big brains .
Human ancestors started out eating whatever they could ; berries , bark , fruit and bits of small animals were probably the main fare .
Anthropologists know these early proto- humans had an eclectic , mostly vegetarian , diet 3 million years ago because of the shape and size of their teeth .
These folks had small front teeth and with short canines and giant flat molars , a mouth built for grinding , not for ripping apart hunks of flesh .
Around 2.5 million years ago , meat became a big deal .
Katherine Milton of the University of California , Berkeley , claims that early humans were forced into this dietary change because the forests of Africa were receding and these hominids simply could n't get enough plant matter to stay alive .
In support of this claim , archaeologists have found 2.5 million year old stone tools clearly used to butcher animals for their flesh and other tools used to smash bones for marrow .
For the next few million years , humans apparently stuffed themselves with raw meat .
And then somewhere , somehow , somebody offered it up cooked .
Maybe there was a forest fire and the early humans stumbled across the charred remains of an antelope and took a bite .
Or maybe they lit a fire themselves and while eating a bison dropped a leg into the fire by mistake .
In any case , humans switched to cooked meats at least 700,000 years ago , and they never looked back , except for steak tartare .
But why bother with all that meal preparation ?
It takes time and energy to build a fire , invent the frying pan , and then clean up later .
Personally , I 'd much rather toss my family a raw pork chop or a chicken breast right out of the package than spend all that time with olive oil and rosemary .
But that 's the point — cooked meat simply tastes better , and our ancestors were apparently instant gourmets .
They might also have been selected to go with the cooked over the raw for good evolutionary reasons .
Harvard anthropologist Richard Wrangham speculates that controlled fire and cooked meat were implicated in human brain evolution .
Wrangham claims that humans actually were cooking their prey as far back as 1.6 million years ago , just when our genus was experiencing major brain expansion .
He maintains that cooked meat was still full of protein but easier to digest than raw , and so natural selection might have opted for smaller guts .
All that saved digestive energy , Wrangham says , might have then gone into making bigger brains .
If Wrangham is right , the big human dietary shift was not so much the move to meat , but the move to cooked meat , which made us smarter and more inventive , so that one human could , millions of years later , perhaps on July Fourth , invent barbecue sauce .

Other than setting off explosions and taking strong drink , indulging in nationalist nostalgia is probably the most popular way to celebrate July 4th in the U.S. of A .
It is , we are told , a day to sing national hymns , pledge our allegiance , have a parade , say a few words about the glory of this old Union , and fly the military colors from every available flagpole .
We are told that it is , above all , a day sanctified for celebrating the birth of a new nation .
No it is n’t .
July 4th is not the anniversary of the birth of a new government ; it is the anniversary of the ignominious death of a tyranny .
On July 4th , 1776 , there was no such thing as the United States of America , and the events of that day did nothing to create it .
The regime under which we live today was not proclaimed until almost a decade later , on September 17 , 1787 .
What was proclaimed on July 4th was not the establishment of a new government , but the dissolution of all political allegiance to the old one .
All for the best : in this secessionist republic of one , we see no reason to celebrate the birth and rise of a foreign power ; and in any case a transfer of power from London to Washington , from King George III to President George I , is no more worthy of celebration than any other coup d’etat .
What is worth celebrating is this :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
— That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it ….
[ W ] hen a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
— Declaration of Independence , 4 July 1776
That is , the revolutionary doctrine that we all , each of us , are the equal of every puffed - up prince and President –that as such you , personally , have every right to refuse the arbitrary orders of tyrants –to ignore their sanctimonious claims of sovereignty –to sever all political connections if you want–and to defend yourself from any usurper who would try to rule you without your consent .
There is no man or woman on this earth who has the natural right to rule over you , and you have every right , whenever and wherever you will to do so , to oppose , withdraw , resist , and thus stand aright as a free and sovereign human being .
The logical conclusion of the radical equality proclaimed by the Declaration is not , however , what Jefferson or any of the other quasi - revolutionists thought it was .
It is not home rule , and it is not republican government .
It is not majoritarian democracy or the elective kingship that passes for the Presidency today .
It is not democratic government or limited government ; it is not any kind of government at all .
If you , personally , are equal in rightful authority to your would - be rulers , and so have every right to tell them where they can go promulgate their law ; if you , personally , have every right to refuse their demands and nullify their authority over you , at your discretion ; if you have every right to withdraw your allegiance , and every right to defend yourself if they should come after you ; then the logical conclusion is not popular sovereignty , but individual sovereignty , for each of us , which is to say , anarchy .
So when a self - styled Progressive Patriot like Russ Feingold , arbitrary Senator over the state of Wisconsin , utters something like this , in opposing the efforts of the efforts of the arbitrary Congress over the United States to implement an unapologetically tyrannical regime of government eavesdropping and surveillance :
I teased some of my colleagues and said we can celebrate the Constitution on July 4th and maybe when we come back you ’ll decide not to tear it up .
… We should applaud the political cause , but recognize the reasons given for the counter - historical bunk that they are .
July 4th had nothing to do with begging the existing government to abide by the promises supposedly made in its own Constitution , or with trying to get the powers that be to exercise their better natures .
The throne of the Constitution , or of the Law , or of the Majority , is no more dignified or sacred than the old thrones of the Czars and Sultans .
Let ’s not bow and scrape before them .
William Lloyd Garrison , for one , knew what this Revolutionary anniversary was all about , and 154 years ago today , in Framingham , Massachusetts , he showed how you ought to celebrate the Constitution on July 4th :
The rally began with a prayer and a hymn .
Then Garrison launched into one of the most controversial performances of his career .
To -day , we are called to celebrate the seventy - eighth anniversary of American Independence .
In what spirit ?
he asked , with what purpose ? to what end ?
The Declaration of Independence had declared that all men are created equal …
It is not a declaration of equality of property , bodily strength or beauty , intellectually or moral development , industrial or inventive powers , but equality of RIGHTS – not of one race , but of all races .
— Massachussets Historical Society , July 2005
We have proved recreant to our own faith , false to our own standard , treacherous to the trust committed to our hands ; so that , instead of helping to extend the blessings of freedom , we have mightily served the cause of tyranny throughout the world .
Garrison then spoke about the prospects for the success of the revolutionary spirit within the nation , prospects he regarded as dismal because of the insatiable greed , boundless rapacity , and profligate disregard of justice prevalent at the time .
He concluded his speech by asserting , Such is our condition , such are our prospects , as a people , on the 4th of July , 1854 !
Setting aside his manuscript , he told the assembly that he should now proceed to perform an action which would be the testimony of his own soul to all present , of the estimation in which he held the pro-slavery laws and deeds of the nation … — from Thoreau : Lecture 43 , 4 July , 1854 Producing a copy of the Fugitive Slave Law , he set fire to it , and it burst to ashes .
Using an old and well - known phrase , he said , And let all the people say , Amen ; and a unanimous cheer and shout of Amen burst from the vast audience .
In like manner , Mr. Garrison burned the decision of Edward G. Loring in the case of Anthony Burns , and the late charge of Judge Benjamin R. Curtis to the United States Grand Jury in reference to the treasonable assault upon the Court House for the rescue of the fugitive –the multitude ratifying the fiery immolation with shouts of applause .
Then holding up the U.S. Constitution , he branded it as the source and parent of all the other atrocities , – a covenant with death , and an agreement with hell , –and consumed it to ashes on the spot , exclaiming , So perish all compromises with tyranny !
And let all the people say , Amen !
A tremendous shout of Amen !
went up to heaven in ratification of the deed , mingled with a few hisses and wrathful exclamations from some who were evidently in a rowdyish state of mind , but who were at once cowed by the popular feeling .
– from The Liberator , 7 July 1854 ( boldface added )
Today is not a day for nationalist bromides ; least of all is it a day for government or its laws or its foot - soldiers .
It ’s a day for radicals and revolutionaries .
A day to proclaim independence , and a day to remember that the American Revolution , if it was worth anything , is far from over .
Here is how Frederick Douglass , a refugee from Southern slavery who became one of the United States ’ most celebrated orators , put it back in July of 1852 :
Fellow - citizens , pardon me , allow me to ask , why am I called upon to speak here to - day ?
What have I , or those I represent , to do with your national independence ?
Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice , embodied in that Declaration of Independence , extended to us ?
and am I , therefore , called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar , and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us ?
… Fellow - citizens ; above your national , tumultous joy , I hear the mournful wail of millions !
whose chains , heavy and grievous yesterday , are , to - day , rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them .
If I do forget , if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day , may my right hand forget her cunning , and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth !
To forget them , to pass lightly over their wrongs , and to chime in with the popular theme , would be treason most scandalous and shocking , and would make me a reproach before God and the world .
My subject , then fellow - citizens , is AMERICAN SLAVERY .
I shall see , this day , and its popular characteristics , from the slave ’s point of view .
Standing , there , identified with the American bondman , making his wrongs mine , I do not hesitate to declare , with all my soul , that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July !
Whether we turn to the declarations of the past , or to the professions of the present , the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting .
America is false to the past , false to the present , and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future .
Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion , I will , in the name of humanity which is outraged , in the name of liberty which is fettered , in the name of the constitution and the Bible , which are disregarded and trampled upon , dare to call in question and to denounce , with all the emphasis I can command , everything that serves to perpetuate slavery –the great sin and shame of America !
I will not equivocate ; I will not excuse ; I will use the severest language I can command ; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man , whose judgement is not blinded by prejudice , or who is not at heart a slaveholder , shall not confess to be right and just .
But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say , it is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind .
Would you argue more , and denounce less , would you persuade more , and rebuke less , your cause would be much more likely to succeed .
But , I submit , where all is plain there is nothing to be argued .
What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue ?
On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light ?
Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man ?
That point is conceded already .
Nobody doubts it .
The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government .
They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave .
There are seventy - two crimes in the State of Virginia , which , if committed by a black man , ( no matter how ignorant he be ) , subject him to the punishment of death ; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment .
What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral , intellectual and responsible being ?
The manhood of the slave is conceded .
It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding , under severe fines and penalties , the teaching of the slave to read or to write .
When you can point to any such laws , in reference to the beasts of the field , then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave .
When the dogs in your streets , when the fowls of the air , when the cattle on your hills , when the fish of the sea , and the reptiles that crawl , shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute , there will I argue with you that the slave is a man !
For the present , it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race .
Is it not astonishing that , while we are ploughing , planting and reaping , using all kinds of mechanical tools , erecting houses , constructing bridges , building ships , working in metals of brass , iron , copper , silver and gold ; that , while we are reading , writing and cyphering , acting as clerks , merchants and secretaries , having among us lawyers , doctors , ministers , poets , authors , editors , orators and teachers ; that , while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men , digging gold in California , capturing the whale in the Pacific , feeding sheep and cattle on the hill - side , living , moving , acting , thinking , planning , living in families as husbands , wives and children , and , above all , confessing and worshipping the Christian ’s God , and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave , we are called upon to prove that we are men !
Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty ?
that he is the rightful owner of his own body ?
You have already declared it .
Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery ?
Is that a question for Republicans ?
Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation , as a matter beset with great difficulty , involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice , hard to be understood ?
How should I look to - day , in the presence of Americans , dividing , and subdividing a discourse , to show that men have a natural right to freedom ?
speaking of it relatively , and positively , negatively , and affirmatively .
To do so , would be to make myself ridiculous , and lo offer an insult to your understanding .
There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven , that does not know that slavery is wrong for him .
What , am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes , to rob them of their liberty , to work them without wages , to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men , to beat them with sticks , to flay their flesh with the lash , to load their limbs with irons , to hunt them with dogs , to sell them at auction , to sunder their families , to knock out their teeth , to burn their flesh , to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters ?
Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood , and stained with pollution , is wrong ?
No !
I will not .
I have better employments for my time and strength , than such arguments would imply .
What , then , remains to be argued ?
Is it that slavery is not divine ; that God did not establish it ; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken ?
There is blasphemy in the thought .
That which is inhuman , can not be divine !
Who can reason on such a proposition ?
They that can , may ; I cannot .
The time for such argument is past .
At a time like this , scorching irony , not convincing argument , is needed .
O! had I the ability , and could I reach the nation ’s ear , I would , to - day , pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule , blasting reproach , withering sarcasm , and stern rebuke .
For it is not light that is needed , but fire ; it is not the gentle shower , but thunder .
We need the storm , the whirlwind , and the earthquake .
The feeling of the nation must be quickened ; the conscience of the nation must be roused ; the propriety of the nation must be startled ; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed ; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced .
What , to the American slave , is your 4th of July ?
I answer : a day that reveals to him , more than all other days in the year , the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim .
To him , your celebration is a sham ; your boasted liberty , an unholy license ; your national greatness , swelling vanity ; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless ; your denunciations of tyrants , brass fronted impudence ; your shouts of liberty and equality , hollow mockery ; your prayers and hymns , your sermons and thanksgivings , with all your religious parade , and solemnity , are , to him , mere bombast , fraud , deception , impiety , and hypocrisy–a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages .
There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices , more shocking and bloody , than are the people of these United States , at this very hour .
— Frederick Douglass ( 1852 ) : What to the Slave is the Fourth of July ?
And let the people say , Amen .
Happy Revolution Day .
Let ’s shut off the Lee Greenwood , and take down that damned flag .
It ’s time to celebrate the day under a new banner .
One which reads :
All power to the people !
And :
No truce with Kings !
And :
Anarchy is the radical notion that other people are not your property .

You go ahead and enjoy that peanut butter cookie .

You want a cookie ?
Just go ahead and ask .
There you go .
While you enjoy that cookie -- what kind is that ?
peanut butter ? -- think about this :
How'd you get that cookie ?
You asked for it .
You communicated a desire for a delicious peanut butter cookie by simply choosing the words and stringing them together in a coherent sentence by placing the words in the correct order : " May I have a cookie ? "
Had you added a " please , " all the better , but you could 've gotten the idea across by saying " cookie " or even by just pointing at the cookie jar .
But you have n't always been able to do this .
When you were a baby , it was much harder to express yourself .
You had limited means of communication -- screaming at the top of your lungs whenever you were unhappy and cooing when you were content .
Over time , you developed into a person who is perfectly capable of asking for a cookie , whether you use words or gestures .
Speech and the ability to gesture can be lost , however , through conditions like paralysis .
But communication tends to live on , despite overwhelming odds .
Suffering complete paralysis after a stroke , Jean - Dominique Bauby could still move his eyes .
He used them to communicate to the entire world , even writing a book , " The Diving Bell and the Butterfly . "
Bauby used a special program to select each letter of the memoir by blinking when his eyes settled on the letter he needed [ source : NPR ] .

Communication is important throughout the animal kingdom , too .
Take meerkats , for example .
Like a lot of other mammals , meerkats use three methods of communication .
There 's nonverbal communication ( or body language ) , sounds and scents .
You probably would n't know exactly what point a meerkat were trying to get across if it approached you , limbs flailing wildly , chattering and emitting a terrible smell .
But you 'd probably figure out that the gestures were meant to intimidate you .
Just imagine a human being performing the same nonverbal cues .
We can learn other languages , and it turns out that we ( specifically , biologists ) can translate " meerkatese . "

Cheney ties Iraq , al - Qaeda again after fielding question from his own official biographer
Vice President Dick Cheney , in a press conference during a surprise visit to Iraq , again stated that it was " pretty clear " there was a link between Iraq and al - Qaeda before Sep. 11 .
Reminded of the release last week of an exhaustive Pentagon report which concluded that there were no ties between Saddam Hussein and the terror network , Cheney answered , " Well , it says no operational link .
But there was , as I recall from looking at it , extensive links with Egyptian Islamic Jihad .
Egyptian Islamic Jihad was the organization headed by Zawahiri , and he merged EIJ with al - Qaeda when he became the deputy director of al - Qaeda , Osama bin Laden 's number two .
" Now , was that a link between Iraq and al - Qaeda ? "
Cheney asked rhetorically .
" Seems to me pretty clear that there was . "
When someone else asked him to reiterate his specific claim , Cheney replied , " You heard what I said .
I was very precise . "
The person who first prompted Cheney at the press conference about the link was Stephen Hayes , according to the White House 's own transcript .
Hayes , a conservative columnist and , coincidentally , the official biographer of Cheney , wrote a book entitled ' The Connection : How al Qaeda 's Collaboration with Saddam Hussein Has Endangered America ' that made the same argument as the vice president 's about a purported link between Saddam and al - Qaeda .
Additionally , Hayes concluded in a November 2003 article for the conservative Weekly Standard that " there can no longer be any serious argument about whether Saddam Hussein 's Iraq worked with Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda to plot against Americans . "
Last week , after the release of the Pentagon report , Hayes wrote another piece for the Standard which insisted that the report actually underscored Cheney 's case rather than undermined it .
As the watchdog site Media Matters notes , Cheney has previously referenced the writing of Hayes as supporting evidence for his Iraq - Qaeda claim , and Hayes has been accused of being a longtime defender of the White House 's Iraq policies .
In an August 2007 appearance on HBO's ' Real Time with Bill Maher , ' a disgusted Timothy Robbins demanded to Hayes personally that he apologize for promoting Iraq propaganda on behalf of the Bush administration .
As for Cheney , his Baghdad visit , which was accompanied by a series of bombings around the still - dangerous area , marks the fifth anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq , a conflict which has claimed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives and nearly 4,000 US troops at a financial cost of nearly half a trillion dollars .
KABUL — The war in Afghanistan reached a wrenching milestone this summer :
For the second month in a row , U.S. and coalition troop deaths in the country surpassed casualties in Iraq .
This is driven in large part , U.S. officials point out , by simple cause and effect .
Marines flowed into southern Afghanistan earlier this year to rout firmly entrenched Taliban fighters , prompting a spike in combat in territory where NATO forces previously did n't have the manpower to send troops .
" We 're doing something we have n't done in seven years , which is go after the Taliban where they 're living , " says a U.S. official .
But amid a well - coordinated assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai and large - scale bombings last week in the capitals of both Afghanistan and Pakistan , U.S. forces are keenly aware that they are facing an increasingly complex enemy here — what U.S. military officials now call a syndicate — composed not only of Taliban fighters but also powerful warlords who were once on the payroll of the Central Intelligence Agency .
" You could almost describe the insurgency as having two branches , " says a senior U.S. military official here .
" It 's the Taliban in the south and a ' rainbow coalition ' in the east . "
Indeed , along with a smattering of Afghan tribal groups , Pakistani extremists , and drug kingpins , two of the most dangerous players are violent Afghan Islamists named Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani , according to U.S. officials .
In recent weeks , Hekmatyar has called upon Pakistani militants to attack U.S. targets , while the Haqqani network is blamed for three large vehicle bombings , along with the attempted assassination of Karzai in April .
Ironically , these two warlords — currently at the top of America 's list of most wanted men in Afghanistan — were once among America 's most valued allies .
In the 1980s , the CIA funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and ammunition to help them battle the Soviet Army during its occupation of Afghanistan .
Hekmatyar , then widely considered by Washington to be a reliable anti-Soviet rebel , was even flown to the United States by the CIA in 1985 .
" He was the most radical of the radicals , " recalls former Rep. Charlie Wilson , immortalized in the recent film Charlie Wilson 's War for his role in directing U.S. military aid to anti-Soviet Afghan warlords .
" He did n't hate us as much as he hated the Soviets , " he adds , " but he sure did n't like us much . "
In his early years , the warlord distinguished himself by throwing acid in the faces of unveiled women .
Today , a senior defense official says Hekmatyar is " as vicious as they come . "
In 2002 , the CIA shot a Hellfire missile from an unmanned drone in an effort to kill him .
U.S. officials had an even higher opinion of Haqqani , who was considered the most effective rebel warlord .
" I adored Haqqani .
When I was in Afghanistan , Haqqani was the guy who made sure I would get out , " says Wilson .
" He was a marvelous leader and very beloved in his territory . "
Haqqani was also one of the leading advocates of the so - called Arab Afghans , deftly organizing Arab volunteer fighters who came to wage jihad against the Soviet Union and helping to protect future al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
Today , U.S. military officials are not certain that Haqqani is alive , though he was featured in an undated video that recently surfaced .
" Either way , the Haqqani we 're fighting now is the son " — 34 - year - old Sirajuddin Haqqani — says the senior U.S. military official .
" He gets a lot of benefit from his father 's prestige . "
Today , the Haqqani network is driving the recent rise in violence in eastern Afghanistan , according to U.S. military officials .
Haqqani " is definitely the strongest " enemy in the border provinces of Paktia , Paktika , and Khost , known among military officials as p2 k .
The senior U.S. military official notes that Haqqani is increasingly moving to more - asymmetric means of attack to avoid straight - on shootouts with better - armed U.S. forces , a general tactical guidance that came from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar last year .
To that end , U.S. military officials estimate that they have seen a 10 percent rise in use of roadside bombs , which now account for one third of the attacks against coalition forces in the country .
At the highest levels , Hekmatyar and the Haqqani network cooperate and find sanctuary in Pakistan , where the country 's political turmoil and suspension of operations in the lawless tribal areas have facilitated increased attacks in Afghanistan .
Of the two warlords , Hekmatyar , by U.S. military estimates , " has a wider geographic coverage " and greater political credibility .
A recent press release issued by Hekmatyar 's spokesman thanked the Pakistani " mujahideen " for their support in the Afghan war against American and other " occupation forces . "
It noted , however , that the efforts allow the international community to blame Pakistan for meddling in Afghan affairs and requested that fighters restrict their activities for now to " U.S. installations and interests within Pakistan . "
A former politician , Hekmatyar founded the Hizb - e - Islami Gulbuddin ( known as hig ) , an offshoot of which remains a popular party in the Afghan parliament .
" There 's blue — or ' good ' — hig and red — or ' bad ' — hig , " says the senior U.S. military official .
" About half of his group sides with the government ; the more recalcitrant are still joining the insurgency . "
But though the Hekmatyar and Haqqani networks have loose alliances and similar goals , each has its own turf .
" They are swimming in the same stream , but they are not unified .
There is no Ho Chi Minh , " says the U.S. military official .
" They have the same broad generic approaches , and it works .
The bottom line is that if your only mission is to wreak havoc in Afghanistan , you do n't have to be coordinated — and what they 're doing is plenty good enough to stir up problems in this country . "
In the course of conducting these operations , insurgents have benefited greatly from the shortage of U.S. and allied troops here , say U.S. officials .
Earlier this month , Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters that he is " deeply troubled " by the increasing violence in Afghanistan but emphasized that troop levels in Iraq precluded a further increase in forces .
" We need more troops there , " he said in Washington .
" But I do n't have the troops I can reach for . "
There are signs , however , that the Pentagon 's priorities are shifting as conditions improve in Iraq .
The Defense Department last week moved an aircraft carrier from Iraq war duty in the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea , shortening the distance that strike planes must fly to provide air support in Afghanistan .
And the Pentagon recently announced that it is extending by one month the seven - month deployment of 2,200 of the 3,200 marines sent to Afghanistan in March .
Still , U.S. officials are in widespread agreement that there are n't enough forces in the country .
There are currently 32,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan backed by some 25,000 allied troops under NATO command , in total roughly 37 percent of force levels in Iraq .
" There should be another 20,000 marines " in Afghanistan , says the U.S. official .
" We 're advancing , but we 're doing it with troop levels that are unacceptably low . "
Mullen , too , has raised questions about the consequences of what he calls an " economy of force " campaign .
" What we 're going through right now is an ability to , in almost every single case , win from the combat standpoint , " said Mullen .
He added , however , that " we do n't have enough troops there to hold .
And that is key , clearly , to the future of being able to succeed in Afghanistan . "

I ’ve received a few e-mails from young ( er ) writers in the past couple of months , many of them trying very hard to figure things out and looking for words of advice and encouragement .
Because I ’m totally unqualified and ill - equipped to deliver them such words , I ’m reading The Master : Rainer Maria Rilke and his Letters To A Young Poet .
Rilke was twenty - seven — still a young artist with his best work ahead of him — when he got a letter from a nineteen - year - old military school student named Franz Kappus .
Kappus sent Rilke some poems and asked him for advice about becoming a writer .
Rilke got lots of letters from aspiring artists , but Kappus ’s touched him : Rilke had spent the worst five years of his young life forced by his parents into the same military school .
And so o began a ten - letter correspondence lasting from 1902 –1908 .
The letters are n’t really letters , they ’re diaries .
Rilke saw himself in Kappus , and so they ’re written from Rilke to Rilke — both to his past and his present .
They begin with a description of Rilke ’s current setting ( various cities across Europe ) and continue into the subject of how to live and how to create .
Each is a map of where he ’s been and where he needs to go .
There ’s so much to take away from the ten letters , but here ’s a short - list of questions a young writer might ask , with Rilke ’s responses .
Is my stuff any good ?
Am I good enough to really make it as writer ?
[ You ’re asking the wrong questions ! ]
There is only one thing you should do .
Go into yourself .
Find out the reason that commands you to write ; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart ; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write .
This most of all : ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night : must I write ?
Dig into yourself for a deep answer .
And if this answer rings out in assent , if you meet this solemn question with a strong , simple “ I must , ” then build your life in accordance with this necessity … .
… But after this descent into yourself and into your solitude , perhaps you will have to renounce becoming a poet ( if , as I have said , one feels one could live without writing , then one should n’t write at all ) .
Nevertheless , even then , this self - searching that I as of you will not have been for nothing .
Your life will still find its own paths from there , and that they may be good , rich , and wide is what I wish for you , more than I can say .
What should I write about ?
Write about what your everyday life offers you ; describe your sorrows and desires , the thoughts that pass through your mind and your belief in some kind of beauty – describe all these with heartfelt , silent , humble sincerity and , when you express yourself , use the Things around you , the images from your dreams , and the objects that you remember .
If your everyday life seems poor , do n’t blame it ; blame yourself ; admit to yourself that you are not enough of a poet to call forth its riches ; because for the creator there is not poverty and no poor , indifferent place .
And even if you found yourself in some prison , whose walls let in none of the world ’s sounds – would n’t you still have your childhood , that jewel beyond all price , that treasure house of memories ?
Can you send me some freebies ?
… as to my own books , I wish I could send you any of them that might give you pleasure .
But I am very poor , and my books , as soon as they are published , no longer belong to me .
I ca n’t even afford them myself – and , as I would so often like to , give them to those who would be kind to them .
What about chicks ?
For one human being to love another human being : that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us , the ultimate task , the final test and proof , the work for which all other work is merely preparation .
That is why young people , who are beginners in everything , are not yet capable of love : it is something they must learn .
Okay , I must write — but how am I supposed to feed myself ?
[…. ]
That ’s a subject Rilke does n’t really touch on .
For a good 20th century update , I ’d point to Hugh MacLeod ’s “ How To Be Creative . ”
If you have n’t yet read Letters To A Young Poet , I highly recommend doing so .

“ Nothing is certain but death and taxes ” – so goes the old saying , and it is , indeed true ( unless you are lucky enough to live in a tax haven ! )
This list deals with the first bit – death .
When we die , most of us end up in a coffin or casket .
For the average person this is a fairly uneventful wooden box with handles – but not for everyone .
Here are ten bizarre coffins for those who like to , well , “ die ” on the wild side !
10 A Perfect Eggsecution
“ Go to work on an egg ” used to be an old marketing slogan in the United Kingdom .
However , going to the afterlife in an egg may be seen by some as taking it too far .
Personally , I am with Woody Allen on this one – it ’s not that I do n’t like death , I just do n’t want to be there when it happens .
Even more so if my relatives had planned to do a Faberge on me .
Eggsactly !
9 If You ’re Not Chicken …
So , what did come first , the chicken or the egg ?
In this case , the chicken .
Slightly strange coffins have been all the rage for an age in Ghana , and this is a prime example of their style .
Perhaps too much white meat is bad for you after all , and you know what they say : the first symptom of heart disease can be quite irritating – sudden death .
8 Stop Wining !
Nothing goes better with a little lightly grilled chicken breast than a glass of fragrant chardonnay .
Whomever this coffin was designed for obviously had a love of the tipple , and was probably popular in life as they were in death .
Or so it is hoped , and let us hope that lots of people said a great many lovely things about them at their funeral .
It ’s just sad that they will have missed it by a few days .
7 High as a Kite
Perhaps the coffin was designed for a person that liked kite flying .
Perhaps it said something about their intake of certain illegal substances .
Who can say ?
At least this person lived in hope that after their demise they would be uplifted , as it were .
I would expect this to be the coffin of an agnostic , who perhaps ordered this so that he who may or may not exist could lend a helping hand if he only , you know , kinda existed .
6 The UFC
Of course , if the wind is off on the day of your funeral , you may not get the particular levitation necessary to reach the clouds .
So , why not choose a UFC – Unidentified Flying Coffin .
I personally do n’t believe in UFOs , but I really should , considering where I was brought up .
This aside , a lot of people believe that death is terrifying because it is just so damn ordinary .
At least this person wanted to go out in an extraordinary way !
5 Jaws of Death
Oh , the shark has pretty teeth dear , and he shows them , pearly white .
Or so goes the old song , even though this shark looks as if it did n’t keep his dental insurance up to date .
So , who would get buried in this ?
A fisherman ?
A mafia godfather ?
Churchill once said that he was ready to meet his maker .
He just wondered if his maker was ready to meet him .
Ditto the great creator if ( s ) he comes across this chap before he pops out of his coffin !
4 Not One For the Vampires
When some people decide that there is no use living if they have to be good , they invariably die young .
This coffin perhaps indicates that the person was good at something at least , in a Billy Elliott kind of way .
This reminds me of a joke .
Do you know what ballet is adored by squirrels the world over ?
Why , The Nutcracker of course !
Now , what was that joke , I seem to have forgotten .
Angelina Jolie certainly wo n’t be buried in this one .
She once said that when she saw other little girls longing to be ballet dancers , she wanted to be a vampire .
3 One For the Vampires ?
Well , one thing you can say about vampires is that death becomes them .
I can imagine Lestat taking a fancy to this little number , then becoming bored with it and possibly going for something quite different again .
This looks like a small coffin , though .
Perhaps it was made for a vampire child who had n’t been taught not to run with wooden stakes .
One more thing : if Dracula ca n’t see his own reflection in the mirror , why is it that his hair is always so immaculate ?
2 Pine Away Pineapple
This is another one from those whacky Ghanaians .
One can only hope that the person who ordered this coffin just grew them for a living .
Or perhaps his relatives bought it posthumously as an ironic au revoir to him and his proclivities .
Or perhaps , as Sheridan once said , he ( or she ) was the very pineapple of politeness .
Whatever that means .
1 Rock And Roll Lives !
Well , Maybe Not .
One can only hope that it is the base of this guitar - shaped coffin in which the intended is supposed to lie , and not the whole thing .
Whether by accident or by nature , this person would have to have been giraffe - man in order to make a proper fit .
Decca records , when they refused to sign the Beatles , said that they did n’t like the sound of the nascent super group and that the guitar was on its way out .
To be replaced by what exactly ?
The stylophone ?
Perhaps Rolf Harris can have one made in that particular shape when he climbs his very own stairway to heaven !

WASHINGTON – Barack Obama ‘s recent rightward lurch on key issues is causing a revolt among left - wing bloggers and activists , who had been his earliest and most ardent supporters .
“ Obama ’s not just moving to the center for the general [ election ] , he ’s practically denouncing and rejecting every progressive voice in the country , ” fumes Danner Kline , who blogs in Alabama for his Web site , 9Numbers.com .
Over the past several weeks , Obama has shifted from his liberal positions on gun rights , capital punishment and terrorist surveillance .
And he walked away from his pledge to work within the confines of public campaign financing .
In addition , liberals lament , Obama took swipes this week at MoveOn.org and retired Gen. Wesley Clark for their fierce partisan attacks .
Just yesterday , Obama pledged support for expanding President Bush ’s church - based federal assistance program , which is opposed by so many on the left .
When he first attended an Obama event a year ago , Kline said he was “ awed ” by an inspirational speaker who would n’t back down from his principles .
But then came Obama ’s rotations .
“ I have been staunchly in support of Obama until the past few weeks , ” Kline told The Post .
While it ’s still hard for him to imagine voting against Obama in November , Kline is shelving his plans to volunteer for his campaign .
“ The way I ’m feeling now , that ’s not going to happen , ” Kline said .
Kline ’s discontent is being echoed across the very same liberal blogosphere that launched Obama from obscurity more than a year ago .
So much so that thousands of dissatisfied supporters have created a group on his Web site to protest his latest position on terrorist surveillance legislation , known as FISA .
Obama ’s waffling on the issue is so incendiary among his supporters that some 7,000 have joined , according to one of the group ’s organizers , making it the fourth - largest group on Obama ’s Web site .
Blogger Greg Sargent , at TalkingPoints Memo , said what is so “ dispiriting ” for liberals about the vacillation on FISA is that Obama ’s campaign is based on the premise that Democrats can go toe - to - toe with Republicans on national security issues .
But on this fight , Sargent said , Obama “ abandoned that premise . ”
Blogger Matt Stoller has gone from early Obama cheerleader to scorching critic in recent weeks , writing about the “ corroded corruption at the heart of moving to the center . ”

The speaker of the US House of Representatives yesterday called on the international community to condemn China for its crushing of protests in Tibet , saying the crisis was a challenge to the " conscience of the world " .
Nancy Pelosi , who leads the Democratic party in Congress , was the first foreign politician to meet the Dalai Lama since the bloody unrest spread across the roof of the world .
Her appearance alongside the Tibetan spiritual leader at his home in the north Indian town of Dharamshala was condemned by Beijing , which accused her of meddling in China 's internal affairs .
Pelosi's visit and strong language are the most serious breach in a western consensus that China 's economic and strategic strength renders impossible any protest beyond verbal expressions of unease .
She did not call for an Olympic boycott , which the Dalai Lama has also opposed , but appeared to open the door to one if China maintained its crackdown in Tibet .
She said the " world is watching " events there , and called for an international investigation into the violence , and access to the region for journalists and international human rights monitors .
Pelosi said it was incumbent on " freedom - loving people throughout the world " to speak out against China 's " oppression " .
If they did not , " we have lost all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world " .
There is no appetite among governments for an Olympic boycott .
All have too much to lose by alienating the burgeoning superpower .
But the news and images filtering through the razor wire around Tibet are making many western capitals uneasy , particularly those that promised to build foreign policies on human rights .
Ceremony boycott
The situation would have to worsen dramatically for there to be serious contemplation of a boycott .
Activist groups are focusing instead on a demand for world leaders to stay away from the games ' opening ceremony in Beijing , and on that front they could claim to have opened some cracks in the Olympic wall .
The White House insists that George Bush will not reconsider his plans to attend .
But Bush 's insistence that his presence at the games would be purely out of sporting enthusiasm and entirely apolitical is coming under increasing fire in the US , particularly in view of the 1980 US boycott of the Moscow Olympics , led by Bush 's political idol , Ronald Reagan .
Yesterday , John McCain drew attention to Bush 's caution on the subject , saying that Tibet was " one of the first things I would talk about if I were president of the United States today " .
" The people there are being subjected to mistreatment that is not acceptable with the conduct of a world power , which China is , " McCain said .
Even before Tibet exploded there was some momentum in the US behind an Olympic boycott , driven by groups seeking to punish Beijing for its links to the Sudanese government , alleged to be behind counter - insurgency atrocities in Darfur .
The film director Steven Spielberg had already declared he would resign as artistic director to the opening ceremony for that reason .
Pelosi 's stand is likely to add to that momentum and put it at the centre of the presidential election contest in which Democratic and Republican candidates are likely to find themselves under pressure from their own supporters .
In Europe Bernard Kouchner , France 's foreign minister and a former human rights campaigner , became the first prominent official to break ranks when he described a proposal by the group Reporters Without Borders for an opening ceremony boycott as " an interesting proposal " that could be debated by EU foreign ministers when they meet next week in Slovenia .
The British were horrified , and an official in London suggested that Kouchner was " talking from the hip " .
Gordon Brown and the foreign secretary , David Miliband , have invested time and air mileage in cultivating China , and the prospect of a retaliatory boycott against the London Olympic games in 2012 is on British minds .
Whether it was after an irritated call from the Elysée Palace or not , the French foreign minister said in later interviews , that a boycott of the opening ceremony , " though not a bad idea " , was unrealistic and the government was not in favour .
He admitted that France 's economic interests in China " complicated things " and cautioned against making threats that clearly would not be executed .
Bernard - Henri Lévy , veteran of the French left , in the Spanish centre - right paper El Mundo , called for a boycott of the games to " save sport , honour and many lives " .
Of Chinese attacks on Tibetan dissidents , he wrote : " In front of this cynicism I think that there is still time to make use of tough language . "
He added : " Will Beijing never cede ?
Will a boycott never work ?
We will never know unless we try . "
Protest rally
In Italy the outgoing centre - left government and the rightwing alliance led by Sylvio Berlusconi , expected to win in next month 's vote , both oppose a boycott , but the pressures beneath them are building .
Several dozen members of parliament joined a crowd of up to 300 in a central Rome square on Wednesday under a banner proclaiming : " We are all Tibetans . "
At least three ministers in the outgoing government attended the rally , at which several speakers supported a boycott .
In Germany , there are signs of a public groundswell for some sort of protest .
German TV is running a poll on the issue , and so far a majority supports staying away .
Bild newspaper yesterday quoted the foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier , warning China that its response to the crisis may jeopardise the Olympics .
" You ca n't just host glamorous events for television while things are going topsy - turvy in your own backyard , " he said in an interview for today 's edition .
" The host has to allow thousands of journalists into the country .
You wo n't be able to sweep anything under the carpet .
" The German federal government is saying to the Chinese government : be transparent .
We want to know exactly what is going on in Tibet . "
The federal government of the chancellor , Angela Merkel , is committed to holding a common line with the rest of Europe but Merkel has said Germany should find means to keep up pressure on Beijing .
That pressure will be stepped up in May when the Dalai Lama makes his second visit to Berlin in less than a year .
The most concerted push for a boycott has come from the east , where memories of communist rule are still fresh .
In Poland members of parliament this week sent a protest note to Beijing calling for the release of all political prisoners from Lhasa , warning China that it was breaking the Olympic charter and saying it was not too late for a boycott .
That 's what I kept saying , until I started reading some of the Discworld novels .
Throughout highschool I never enjoyed all the reading assignments the teacher gave me .
1984 , Shakespeare , To Kill A Mockingbird , I never got any enjoyment out of books .
The only books I enjoyed were the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice , you know , Interview with a Vampire and so on .
Then one day , Kendall came with these Terry Pratchett books .
Terry who ?
I started reading the first one " Reaper Man " , and finished it in 24 hours .
That 's a 300 + page novel in 24 hours including sleeping at night .
I got the next one from him , and kept going until he ran out .
Now Kendall 's in America , just told me he has tons more that he 'll be bringing back here .
The good thing about these books is that it does n't really matter in what order you read them .
Most characters come back in other stories , and you get to know and like them .
The plots are done really well , there is n't ever really a bad guy , the protagonist in one book may be the antagonist in another book , or just for another character .
Also , there are n't really chapters , just page breaks , which happen more frequently that regular chapters , so you can stop reading when you 've finished taking a dump , wipe , move to the next location , and keep going ( do n't need to sit around to read till the end of the chapter ) .
So if you believe that you 're not a book - reading person , give the Discword books a chance .
You 'll love them !
Also have a look at :
And after one of the suggestions from the comments :

Almost half of all bandwidth in North America is made up of P2P traffic , according to Sandvine .
The company , which develops deep packet inspection equipment to monitor broadband usage , says that P2P traffic is up about three percent from a year ago , going from 41 percent to almost 44 percent .
P2P ate up an even larger chunk of upstream traffic , pushing regular old web traffic further down the list .
The report , which Sandvine plans to post on its website today and is recounted at Multichannel News , examines trends in broadband use over time .
The company surveyed a number of unnamed " leading service providers " by monitoring traffic at the subscriber level and it concluded that P2P traffic took up a fair amount more bandwidth than web traffic ( 27.3 percent ) and streaming media ( 14.8 percent ) .
Somewhat surprisingly , VoIP only made up 0.2 percent of traffic .
When narrowing the results down to just upstream traffic , P2P managed to dominate even further .
Sandvine claims P2P constituted three - quarters of all upstream traffic , followed at a very distant second by tunneling into private networks ( just under 10 percent ) and web traffic ( 9.1 percent ) .
If true , then P2P traffic does indeed use a significant amount of resources when compared to other Internet services .
And it 's not too surprising , either — most of what is transferred over P2P is relatively large in terms of file size ( music , movies , TV shows , Linux distros ) .
When compared to relatively low - bandwidth items like images and HTML pages , the results make perfect sense .
Still , we should note that Sandvine has an interest in showing that P2P traffic is clogging the tubes .
The company sells gear to ISPs that , among other things , helps to throttle Internet traffic based on the needs of its customers .
Sandvine was the largely - rumored equipment supplier that enabled Comcast 's controversial decision to filter BitTorrent traffic without actually telling any of its users .
Sandvine CEO
Dave Caputo recently defended network traffic filtering in an interview , calling the concept of net neutrality " laughable . "
He insisted that all the company wants to do is " improving the quality of the experience of the Internet and trying to make the world a better place . "
But Sandvine 's data is actually conservative when compared to the data provided by ipoque .
The German deep packet inspection gear maker claims that P2P is responsible for as much as 90 percent of all Internet traffic and 95 percent of nocturnal traffic .
Ellacoya Networks disagrees , saying that HTTP traffic has passed P2P traffic with the help of streaming media ( remember , though , that Sandvine breaks out streaming media into its own category ) .
Either way , the data may provide more ammunition for companies that favor traffic shaping on their networks .
By Fidel Castro Ruz
May 25 , 2008 --
It would be dishonest of me to remain silent after hearing the speech Barack Obama delivered on the afternoon of May 23 , 2008 , at the Cuban American National Foundation , created by Ronald Reagan .
I listened to his speech , as I did [ John ] McCain 's and Bush's .
I feel no resentment towards Obama , for he is not responsible for the crimes perpetrated against Cuba and humanity .
Were I to defend him , I would do his adversaries an enormous favour .
I have therefore no reservations about criticising him and about expressing my points of view on his words frankly .
What were Obama 's statements ?
`` Throughout my entire life , there has been injustice and repression in Cuba .
Never , in my lifetime , have the people of Cuba known freedom .
Never , in the lives of two generations of Cubans , have the people of Cuba known democracy ...
This is the terrible and tragic status quo that we have known for half a century –- of elections that are anything but free or fair ...
I wo n't stand for this injustice , you wo n't stand for this injustice , and together we will stand up for freedom in Cuba ' ' , he told the annexationists , adding : `` It 's time to let Cuban American money make their families less dependent upon the Castro regime ...
I will maintain the embargo . ''
The content of these declarations by this strong candidate for the US presidency spares me the work of having to explain the reason for this reflection .
José Hernandez , one of the Cuban American National Foundation directors who Obama praised in his speech , was none other than the owner of the 50 - calibre automatic rifle , equipped with telescopic and infrared sights , which was confiscated , by chance , along with other deadly weapons while being transported by sea to Venezuela , where the foundation had planned to assassinate the writer of these lines at an international meeting held in Margarita , in the Venezuelan state of Nueva Esparta .
Pepe Hernández ' group wanted to renegotiate a former pact with Clinton , betrayed by Mas Canosa 's clan , who secured Bush 's electoral victory in 2000 through fraud , because the latter had promised to assassinate Castro , something they all happily embraced .
These are the kinds of political tricks inherent to the United States ' decadent and contradictory system .
Presidential candidate Obama 's speech may be formulated as follows : hunger for the nation , remittances as charitable hand outs and visits to Cuba as propaganda for consumerism and the unsustainable way of life behind it .
Global crises
How does he plan to address the extremely serious problem of the global food crisis ?
The world 's grains must be distributed among human beings .
Fish , [ the supplies of which ] become smaller every year and more scarce in the seas that have been over - exploited by the large trawlers which no international organisation could get in the way of .
Producing meat from gas and oil is no easy feat .
Even Obama overestimates technology 's potential in the fight against climate change , though he is more conscious of the risks and the limited margin of time than Bush .
He could seek the advice of [ former US vice - president Al ]
Gore , who is also a Democrat and is no longer a candidate , as he is aware of the accelerated pace at which global warming is advancing .
His close political rival Bill Clinton , who is not running for the presidency , an expert on extra-territorial laws like the Helms - Burton and Torricelli Acts , can advise him on an issue like the blockade , which he promised to lift and never did .
What did he say in his speech in Miami , this man who is doubtless , from the social and human points of view , the most progressive candidate to the US presidency ?
``For two hundred years '' , he said , ``the United States has made it clear that we wo n't stand for foreign intervention in our hemisphere .
But every day , all across the Americas , there is a different kind of struggle -- not against foreign armies , but against the deadly threat of hunger and thirst , disease and despair .
That is not a future that we have to accept -- not for the child in Port au Prince or the family in the highlands of Peru .
We can do better .
We must do better ...
We cannot ignore suffering to our south , nor stand for the globalisation of the empty stomach . ''
A magnificent description of imperialist globalisation : the globalisation of empty stomachs !
We ought to thank him for it .
But , 200 years ago , Simon Bolivar fought for Latin American unity and , more than 100 years ago , Jose Martí gave his life in the struggle against the annexation of Cuba by the United States .
What is the difference between what [ US President James ] Monroe [ who in 1823 ] proclaimed [ the Americas were the USA 's domain ] and what Obama proclaims and resuscitates in his speech two centuries later ?

``I will reinstate a Special Envoy for the Americas in my White House who will work with my full support .
But we 'll also expand the Foreign Service , and open more consulates in the neglected regions of the Americas .
We 'll expand the Peace Corps , and ask more young Americans to go abroad to deepen the trust and the ties among our people '' , he said near the end , adding : ``Together , we can choose the future over the past . ''
A beautiful phrase , for it attests to the idea , or at least the fear , that history makes figures what they are and not [ the other ] way around .
Today , the United States has nothing of the spirit behind the Philadelphia declaration of principles formulated by the 13 colonies that rebelled against English colonialism .
Today , they are a gigantic empire undreamed of by the country 's founders at the time .
Nothing , however , was to change for the natives and the slaves .
The former were exterminated as the nation expanded ; the latter continued to be auctioned at the marketplace —- men , women and children -— for nearly a century , despite the fact that ``all men are born free and equal '' , as the Declaration of Independence affirms .
The world 's objective conditions favoured the development of that system .
US blockade
In his speech , Obama portrays the Cuban Revolution as anti-democratic and lacking in respect for freedom and human rights .
It is the exact same argument which , almost without exception , US administrations have used again and again to justify their crimes against our country .
The blockade , in and of itself , is an act of genocide .
I do n't want to see US children inculcated with those shameful values .
An armed revolution in our country might not have been needed without the military interventions , the Platt Amendment [ which in 1901 made Cuba a virtual colony of the US ] and the economic colonialism it visited upon Cuba .
The revolution was the result of imperial domination .
We can not be accused of having imposed it upon the country .
The true changes could have and ought to have been brought about in the United States .
Its own workers , more than a century ago , voiced the demand for an eight - hour work shift , which stemmed from the development of productive forces .
The first thing the leaders of the Cuban Revolution learned from Martí was to believe in and act on behalf of an organisation founded for the purposes of bringing about a revolution .
We were always bound by previous forms of power and , following the institutionalisation of this organisation , we were elected by more than 90 per cent of voters , as has become customary in Cuba , a process which does not in the least resemble the ridiculous levels of electoral participation which , many a time , as in the case of the United States , stay short of 50 per cent of the voters .
No small and blockaded country like ours would have been able to hold its ground for so long on the basis of ambition , vanity , deceit or the abuse of power , the kind of power its neighbour has .
To state otherwise is an insult to the intelligence of our heroic people .
Delicate questions for Obama
I am not questioning Obama 's great intelligence , his debating skills or his work ethic .
He is a talented orator and is ahead of his rivals in the electoral race .
I feel sympathy for his wife and little girls , who accompany him and give him encouragement every Tuesday .
It is indeed a touching human spectacle .
Nevertheless , I am obliged to raise a number of delicate questions .
I do not expect answers ; I wish only to raise them for the record .
1 . Is it right for the president of the United States to order the assassination of any one person in the world , whatever the pretext may be ?
2 . Is it ethical for the president of the United States to order the torture of other human beings ?
3 . Should state terrorism be used by a country as powerful as the United States as an instrument to bring about peace on the planet ?
4 . Is the Cuban Adjustment Act [ which grants permanent residence in the US to Cubans who flee Cuba ] , applied as punishment on only one country , Cuba , in order to destabilise it , good and honourable , even when it costs innocent children and mothers their lives ?
If it is good , why is this right not automatically granted to Haitians , Dominicans and other peoples of the Caribbean , and why is n't the same Act applied to Mexicans and people from Central and South America , who die like flies against the Mexican border wall or in the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific ?
5 . Can the United States do without immigrants , who grow vegetables , fruits , almonds and other delicacies for US citizens ?
Who would sweep their streets , work as servants in their homes or do the worst and lowest - paid jobs ?
6 . Are crackdowns on illegal residents fair , even as they affect children born in the United States ?
7 . Are the brain drain and the continuous theft of the best scientific and intellectual minds in poor countries moral and justifiable ?
8 . You state , as I pointed out at the beginning of this reflection , that your country had long ago warned European powers that it would not tolerate any intervention in the hemisphere , reiterating that this right be respected while demanding the right to intervene anywhere in the world with the aid of hundreds of military bases and naval , air and ground forces distributed across the planet .
I ask :
Is that the way in which the United States expresses its respect for freedom , democracy and human rights ?
9 . Is it fair to stage pre-emptive attacks on 60 or more ``dark corners '' of the world , as Bush calls them , whatever the pretext may be ?
10 .
Is it honourable and sound to invest [ trillions ] of dollars in the military industrial complex , to produce weapons that can destroy life on Earth several times over ?
Before judging our country , you should know that Cuba , with its education , health , sports , culture and science programs , implemented not only in its own territory but also in other poor countries around the world , and the blood that has been shed in acts of solidarity towards other peoples , in spite of the economic and financial blockade and the aggression of your powerful country , is proof that much can be done with very little .
Not even our closest ally , the Soviet Union , was able to achieve what we have .
The only form of cooperation the United States can offer other nations consists in the sending of military professionals to those countries .
It can not offer anything else , for it lacks a sufficient number of people willing to sacrifice themselves for others and offer substantial aid to a country in need ( though Cuba has known and relied on the cooperation of excellent US doctors ) .
They are not to blame for this , for US society does not inculcate such values in them on a massive scale .
We have never subordinated cooperation with other countries to ideological requirements .
We offered the United States our help when hurricane Katrina lashed the city of New Orleans .
Our internationalist medical brigade bears the glorious name of Henry Reeve , a young man , born in the United States , who fought and died for Cuba 's sovereignty in our first war of independence .
Our revolution can mobilise tens of thousands of doctors and health technicians .
It can mobilise an equally vast number of teachers and citizens , who are willing to travel to any corner of the world to fulfill any noble purpose , not to usurp people 's rights or take possession of raw materials .
The good will and determination of the people constitute limitless resources that cannot be kept and would not fit in a bank 's vault .
They cannot spring from the hypocritical politics of an empire .
Disagreeing with Christopher Hitchens — who is , after all , a pugilist above all things — is a simple reality of reading the man ’s work , and often a main benefit of it ; few critics can get the blood boiling while still commanding the reader ’s admiration for the writerly craft behind his screeds .
His atheism , for instance , seems generally agreed upon by many members of my generation , but his criticism often comes off as intolerance for all things religious , which has n’t yet become fashionable .
Regardless of one ’s affinity for his opinions , the most redeeming of Hitchens ’ qualities are all on the page , in the wit with which he writes .
His is a polemical style in the distinctly English mode — at once acerbic and decorous , his humor always winking rather than screaming .
Where else in mainstream American media will we read a comment on Paris Hilton that includes , “ I , too , have watched Hilton undergoing the sexual act [ … ]
At no point did her facial expression match even the simulacrum of lovemaking . ”
It comes as no surprise when he repeatedly stresses the greatness of Orwell , Wodehouse , and Waugh in his book criticism .
I ’ve been a devoted reader of Christopher Hitchens ’ journalism for years now , whether his longer pieces in Vanity Fair , book reviews for The Atlantic Monthly or The New York Times Book Review , or his Slate column “ Fighting Words . ”
I ’ve read his essay collection Love , Poverty , and War and kept close tabs on the avalanche of press and interviews that greeted the publication of his atheist diatribe God is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything .
I ’ll even admit to emailing Hitchens , who lives in nearby Washington , D.C. , to see if he would meet me for a drink and discuss the writing life , a request that as of yet has inspired no response , and understandably so .
Hitchens ’ appeal — particularly to the class of young - white - male would - be intellectuals and journalists to which I can’t help but claim membership — is the sheer volume and force of his opinions , as well as the persona they advertise .
To write as floridly as Hitchens is impressive enough ; to do it for multiple outlets and with his astounding prolificacy borders on superhuman .
And the gall of the man seems designed to impress the members of my tribe : the way he willfully claims expertise on English and American history , Proust , Joyce , Islamic law , Christian theology , gastronomical mores , the Clintons , Bob Dylan , and the Hilton heiress ; his friendships with Salman Rushdie , Ian McEwan , and the Amises Martin and Kingsley ( he even claims to have slept with Martin ’s sister in the 70s ) ; his tales of personal meetings with Saul Bellow and Jorge Luis Borges ; his public squabbles with Norman Mailer , The Nation , and Conrad Black .
Hitchens is the kind of prodigious intellect - and character - on - display that appeals to the group I described above .
He nourishes the insecure part of our brains that is impressed by a man of such certainty and superiority because it gives us false hope for ourselves .
That he does it all while drinking a bottle of Johnnie Walker a day and smoking , by his own estimate , 15,000 cigarettes a year , is almost too romantic to be believed .
So perhaps it ’s me who ’s changed .
Maybe ( hopefully ? ) it ’s me who ’s matured to where I can appreciate Hitchens for what he actually is : a very talented writer , a very smart man , and a loathsomely self - absorbed journalist .
But I ca n’t give myself all the credit , since Hitchens himself has been upping the ante for his own self - importance standards for years now , most egregiously in a recent Vanity Fair piece called “ Believe Me , It ’s Torture . ”
At the behest of VF editor Graydon Carter , and with a political twist on his earlier Vanity Fair piece about his experience at a spa , the writer was voluntarily waterboarded to settle , once and for all , whether this controversial interrogation technique constitutes torture .
The answer ’s in the article title .
Here ,
Hitchens gets to combine all of his preferred topics : politics , moral certitude , linguistic overstatement , and himself .
He even gets in the customary Orwell reference for good measure , likening the experience to 1984 ’s climactic torture scene .
Additionally , he indulges his inner Graham Greene : “ [ T ] hree layers of enveloping towel were added .
In this pregnant darkness , head downward , I waited for a while until I abruptly felt a slow cascade of water going up my nose .
Determined to resist if only for the honor of my ancestors who had so often been in peril on the sea , I held my breath for a while and then had to exhale . ”
The spa piece , self - mythologizing as it may have been , was what it was .
Capitalizing on Hitchens ’ newfound post - God is Not Great public recognition , the editors of Vanity Fair played up his boozy character and had him pump out a puff piece good for some easy publicity .
“ Torture , ” however , utilizes the same kind of Plimptonesque stunt journalism conceit in service of Hitchens ’ typical moral superiority .
“ I apply the Abraham Lincoln test for moral casuistry , ” he writes .
“ ‘ If slavery is not wrong , nothing is wrong . ’
Well , then , if waterboarding does not constitute torture , then there is no such thing as torture . ”
Case closed , folks .
Setting aside the silly , questionable belief that a person has to undergo something in order to denounce it as immoral ( unless , that is , you ’re looking for more easy publicity ) , why would anyone think that this experiment comes close to reenacting actual waterboarding as experienced by prisoners of war ?
But fear not ;
Hitchens has the false modesty to allay you :
It goes without saying that I knew I could stop the process at any time , and that when it was all over I would be released into happy daylight rather than returned to a darkened cell .
But it ’s been well said that cowards die many times before their deaths , and it was difficult for me to completely forget the clause in the contract of indemnification that I had signed [… ] there would be safeguards provided " during the waterboarding process , however , these measures may fail and even if they work properly they may not prevent Hitchens from experiencing serious injury or death . "
For all his claims to have settled the “ torture / not torture ” debate , however , a host of other journalistic questions are raised by the article , never to be answered at all since doing so would be to confront the man ’s monolithic ego .
If “ it goes without saying ” ( and it does ) that Hitchens ’ experience in no way mirrors that of actual detainees , why bother with the pomp and circumstance of his being blindfolded and disoriented , other than the photo op it offers ?
( Vanity Fair 's website also has video of the event , bookended by further Hitchens pontification , in case the article ’s 2700 words are n’t enough for you . )
Why , if Hitchens were truly so horrified for his life , would he undergo the drowning process a second time just to try and best the purported two - minute holdout of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ?
“ No Hitchens is going to do worse than that , ” he rationalizes .
But as in any recent Hitchens piece , the biggest question raised is :
How come , since the guy alludes to such pressing intellectual issues , the main focus is steadfastly on himself ?
This goes beyond the use of the first - person pronoun , although he ’s overly generous there , as always .
Rather , why all the asides about his upbringing ( “ I do have a fear of drowning that comes from a bad childhood moment on the Isle of Wight ” ) , the slight medical conditions used only the heighten the perceived danger ( “ If I do n’t have at least two pillows I wake up with acid reflux and mild sleep apnea , so even a merely supine position makes me uneasy ” ) , or the inappropriate attempts at gallows humor ( “ [ An expert ] told me that he ’d heard of someone ’s being compelled to confess that he was a hermaphrodite .
I later had an awful twinge while wondering if I myself could have been ‘ dunked ’ this far ” ) ?
It ’s confusing that Hitchens seems so intent on being his own literary character because he ’s otherwise usually content to pass the intellectual buck in his articles .
In his dismayed account of Saddam Hussein ’s botched execution , for instance , he makes the fairly obvious point that the event was an atrocity and a shame to America ’s mission in Iraq , and then provides a helpful link to a similar and far superior 1945 essay by Orwell called “ Revenge is Sour . ”
And in a Vanity Fair piece from November , he tells the story of a young man who went to and died in Iraq partly because of Hitchens ’ own endorsement of the war .
The essay is almost unavoidably a heartbreaking one , but here of all places , Hitchens lets his thoughts on his own accountability go unsaid and instead lays on the honorific Shakespeare excerpts .
This is apparently the Hitchens way — make loud , forceful claims about current events , then pull a book from the shelf to let an older , more creative writer do the heavy lifting .
In the waterboarding essay , Hitchens says ( shockingly ) that the procedure is awful and certainly constitutes torture , then offers a series of block quotes from two noted pro- and anti-waterboarding writers .
Thus the article is all about Hitchens in every way but the meaningful one .
“ Believe Me , It ’s Torture ” adds nothing to the public conception of what waterboarding is .
Instead , we now know only about Christopher Hitchens ’ personal experience with the physical realities of the event and his concurrent moral judgment .
And what exactly is Hitchens now authorized to say about the physical experience that he would n’t have gleaned from merely reading an essay by an actual detainee ?
Not much , other than that it ’s so excruciating , even he of the prodigious intellect and imbibing abilities was brought to his knees — although not , mind you , to the point of admitting he was a hermaphrodite , because it ’ll take more than near - death for a man this self - aggrandizing to admit he ’s not well hung .
It ’d be presumptuous to implore Hitchens to tone down his act , as well as ignorant .
Not only is self - righteousness a standard part of his work , it ’s what he ’s selling .
Rather , I ’m merely sad to see such a talented writer resign himself to being a public spectacle , even a brand name .
The sorriest thing about “ Believe Me , It ’s Torture ” is how not unique it is .
Of course Hitchens would agree to such a promotional stunt , and of course he would simultaneously puff out his chest and espouse faux humility in his writing about it .
Love him or hate him , Hitchens was at one point a genuine Renaissance intellect and an intrepid journalist , and while he remains those things , he ’s apparently impressed enough with himself to overshadow them both .
Vanity fair indeed .
Men of exceptional ambition or ability , it is often said , are more highly sexed than others , though perhaps it is just that their sex lives are more closely examined than those of others .
Can there really be a man living , after all , who would relish the idea that every detail of his sex life , past and present , would be revealed to the public and those whom he loves ?
But if , as Henry Kissinger once said , power is the most powerful aphrodisiac , former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer ’s extracurricular sexual activities seem pathetic and furtive , almost adolescent , rather than deeply wicked .
Resorting to prostitutes is sex without the trouble , uncertainty or potential humiliation attendant on attempted seduction .
In other words , it ’s a crude shortcut preferred by those who are uncertain of their allures unaided by financial inducements .
It is pornography elevated -- or descending -- to the level of practice .
We in Britain are certainly familiar with political scandals of a sexual nature .
In 1994 , for instance , a Tory member of Parliament , the brother of a clergyman , was found hanged dressed only in women ’s underwear .
This is the kind of thing that we expect of our politicians in Britain .
It used to be that scandals involving the Labor Party mainly concerned financial irregularities and those involving the Conservative Party were predominantly sexual .
Labor politicians , being socialists who detested the rich , were avid for money , however ill - gotten .
Conservatives , being moralists who lamented the passing of the old order of personal restraint , were deeply attracted to sexual vice .
Now that the two parties are virtually indistinguishable , from a policy perspective , they are each financially corrupt and sexually incontinent .
I suppose a Hegelian would call this a dialectical synthesis that overcame contradictions .

While he was home secretary from 2001 to 2004 , David Blunkett , a blind Labor politician , was discovered not only to have had an affair with , but an illegitimate child by , the U.S. - born publisher of the famous conservative anti-Labor magazine the Spectator .
From the public reaction , at least as expressed in the media , one might have supposed that Britain was peopled by a mixture of anchorites in the Syrian desert , subsisting on honey and locusts , and vestal virgins -- who would commit suicide rather than indulge in sexual intercourse -- rather than a country in which 42 % of births are out of wedlock , and in which sexual promiscuity is now the rule rather than the exception .
Outrage , nevertheless , was unconfined .
A public that demanded , as a matter of inalienable right , complete sexual freedom for itself demanded Victorian levels of propriety from its political leaders .
Blunkett resigned in late 2004 .
The fact that sexual scandal has spread to the Labor Party does not mean that we have given up on the expectation that the Conservative Party will titillate us .
It just means that the bar of public notice has been raised a few notches .
We demand the equivalent of the Fosbury Flop of sexual perversion ( if one is permitted to use that term at all in these days of universal tolerance ) .
Thus , a Conservative member of Parliament was found dead in the course of his practice of autoerotic asphyxia -- hanging yourself to achieve heightened sexual excitement brought about by decreasing oxygen to the brain , while looking at erotic pictures or having erotic fantasies .
An article describing 117 such cases was recently published by the British Journal of Psychiatry .
It is generally agreed that they order these things better in France .
The French are more mature about sex , though they are terrible hypocrites about money .
I remember having lunch with a French author who was writing a comparative study of serial killers in France and Anglo - Saxonia .
English speakers , it seems , murder serially for sex , or rather some version of it , and the French murder for money or even for furniture ( one has only to remember Landru and Dr. Petiot ) .
Which is better or morally preferable ?
Well , to be honest , Je ne sais pas .
The French expect their politicians to have colorful , though discreet , sex lives .
No one found it at all shocking that Francois Mitterrand maintained two households , complete with an illegitimate daughter , throughout his presidency .
More significant , perhaps , was that no one either found his past Petainism , or his then - current protection of high - level Petainists , shocking .
French and Anglo - Saxon forms of hypocrisy are very different .

What the French find objectionable in the antics of their current president , Nicolas Sarkozy , is not their moral impropriety but their vulgarity .
No sooner was he divorced ( for the second time ) than he was seen cavorting on an Egyptian beach with his glamorous new love , Carla Bruni , with whom he exchanged very expensive presents .
The fact that Bruni , now his third wife , is very rich does not mollify the French in the slightest .
Sarkozy has behaved not like a mature man but like an adolescent .
The 15 - year - old daughter of a French friend explained what was wrong with him .
Someone in a crowd refused to shake Sarkozy ’s hand and called him a fool .
He replied in kind , insulting him .
By contrast , when someone in a similar situation had shouted “ Fool ! ” at Jacques Chirac when he was president , Chirac shook his hand and said , “ And me , I ’m Chirac . ”
Now that , according to the 15 - year - old , was class , and everything may be forgiven such a man , including , no doubt , sexual peccadilloes .
Of course , Spitzer ’s downfall is particularly delightful to the generality of mankind because of his almost terminal self - righteousness .
It is the gulf between what he has preached and what he has practiced that so appeals to the rest of us , who know our feet are of clay .
Spitzer is the Jim Bakker of public prosecution .
I wish I could say that I felt sorry for Spitzer , but I do n’t .
His statement that “ I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself ” makes him sound like the disgraced member of a politburo indulging in self - criticism before being sent into exile in Siberia or Kazakhstan .
On the other hand , I do n’t want to be too hard on him , just in case someone investigates me one day .
The fact is that I too have failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself .
これは恐ろしく重要な指摘だと思う。
negimiso : 最近の毎日新聞の件も、あとテニミュ跡部役が降板の件もそうだけど、たぶんネットで「炎上」的なことが起きるときのモチベーションって、「ただネットで文句たれるだけ」の自分たちの声がたくさん集まることによって、世の中を動かすかもしれない、ってプチ万能感が与えられることにあるのかと思う。
negimiso : ネットで家から適当にかいた自分たちの言葉一つで、「現実が動く」ってことは、たぶん体験してみると中毒になるんじゃないか。そういう仮説の元でニコニコ大会議のことを思い返すと、その「万能感」を露骨な形でネットから参加してる参加者に与えていた。と思う。
なぜ重要だと思ったかっつうと、いじめの社会理論
の中で、いじめに至る大きな要因として「全能感のもてあそび」が指摘されておるのだよ。
とは言ってもこの本はまだ注文したばっかで未着なんだがな。amazonさん早よ届けておくれ。そんなわけで仕方が無いので、いじめの社会関係論
の方から私が読み取ったことを概説しませう。
「 自分が何であるかに関わらない無条件的な自己肯定感」があると、人間は苦しい環境でも生きていける
そういう自己肯定感を十分持っていない人が「迫害・拘束・無力・欠如・苦痛・屈辱・不幸・不運・ちぐはぐな環境」などの状況に置かれると、「何をしていてもリアリティがずれた感覚に苦しみ、慢性的で漠然としたイラダチ・ムカツキ・空虚感をかかえる」ことになる。
そのような自己肯定感欠如状態では、無理やりでもそれを充足させよういう心理的反応が起きる
全能感は一時的にそれを充足させてくれるかのような錯覚をもたらす
実際のところ、全能感は自己肯定感と似て非なるものであり、どんなに全能感を積み重ねても、本当に必要な自己肯定感は得られない
そうやって、癒されることのない渇きを抱え、全能感を求め続けることになる
本当にこの解釈でいいかどうか正直自信が無い。てのも、リンク先の文章って、すんげーわかりづらいのよ。読んでみればわかるけど。本の方はいくぶん分かり易いと聞いてるので、届いたらじっくり読んでじっくり考えてまた書いてみます。
The BBC has obtained footage of Palestinians being attacked close to a Jewish settlement in the West Bank by a group of masked men wielding baseball bats .
The footage was shot on a camera that was provided by an Israeli human rights group to enable Palestinians to get proof of attacks .

Les petites îles Aland , au milieu de la mer Baltique , vont - elles bloquer le traité de Lisbonne ?
La rumeur court le nord de l'Europe .
L'archipel finlandais , doté d'une large autonomie , serait prêt , dit - on , à ne pas ratifier le traité .
Et pourquoi donc ?
Pour faire entendre sa voix à Bruxelles et conserver son snus , un tabac à sucer interdit dans l'Union européenne .
Le snus reste autorisé dans la Suède voisine et se vend en quantité sur les ferries battant pavillon " alandais " .
" Le traité de Lisbonne est un peu l'otage dans cette affaire , mais c'est la dernière chance pour nous de peser sur la Finlande afin de faire respecter nos intérêts " , lance Harry Jansson , ancien rédacteur en chef d'un quotidien local devenu député d'un parti indépendantiste qui a lancé une pétition pour faire changer Bruxelles sur la question du snus .
A Helsinki , on balaye d'autorité cette éventualité .
" Légalement , Aland ne peut pas stopper le traité de Lisbonne , affirme Peggy Heikkinen , conseillère du ministre finlandais des affaires européennes .
Le comité constitutionnel du Parlement a clairement déclaré que la Finlande peut ratifier le traité de Lisbonne , quelle que soit la position d'Aland .
Mais bien sûr , le jour où celui- ci entrera en vigueur , Aland , qui a sa propre législation dans certains secteurs , sera dans une situation légale incertaine si elle ne l'a pas ratifié . "
Aland , 6 500 îles , 26 000 habitants , un parlement régional , un gouvernement doté d'une large autonomie qui a la main sur l'éducation , la police , la santé et autres .
Les insulaires sont dotés d'une identité à toute épreuve qui veut que le finnois n'y soit même pas langue officielle .
Sur les îles Aland , on parle suédois .
Son bien - être est ancré dans une tradition tout aussi forte , celle des paysans - marins qui pour survivre sur ces îles revêches maniaient la rame et la bêche .
Certains ont commencé à construire des bateaux de plus en plus gros au point de devenir d'authentiques armateurs .
Ce sont eux qui ont donné naissance à des compagnies comme Viking Line ou Eckerö Linjen qui représentent aujourd ' hui un tiers de l'économie de ces îles , et dont les imposants ferries transportent depuis des décennies des centaines de milliers de passagers .
Ces traversées bien arrosées et bon marché sont très populaires car les navires alandais bénéficient , à l'instar des îles Aland , d'une dérogation qui les laisse à l'écart de la zone fiscale de l'UE et leur permet de pratiquer les ventes hors taxes .
" Le snus est une source de revenus importante pour les armateurs , raconte Boris Ekman , vice - PDG de Viking Line .
Viking
Line a un chiffre d'affaires de 440 millions d'euros dont le snus représente 6 ou 7 millions , la moitié étant du bénéfice net .
Quand notre bénéfice total est de 30 millions d'euros , le snus en constitue une part de 10 % , ce qui est beaucoup . "
De nombreux retraités font le voyage dans la journée uniquement pour profiter de ces prix .
" Je viens faire le plein avant le week - end " , raconte Lennart Holmgren , un Stockholmois , à bord du ferry d'Eckerö Linjen .
Il fait le trajet une fois par mois .
Un bus l'a emmené de Stockholm à 8 heures jusqu 'au port de Grisslehamn d'où le ferry a mis deux heures pour rejoindre Eckerö , sur les îles Aland .
Après un court débarquement à terre , le ferry a fait demi-tour vers Grisslehamn où un autre bus l'a ramené à Stockholm .
" Avec ma carte de retraité , le voyage aller - retour bus et ferry m'a coûté 60 couronnes ( 6,5 euros ) " , précise Lennart Holmgren .
Tout à fait rentable , quand on a le temps , car l'alcool fort et le snus sont moitié moins chers qu'en Suède .
Mais dans la boutique hors taxe du ferry , plusieurs Suédois jurent en découvrant les vitrines réfrigérées de snus : " Armoire de snus fermée .
La vente de snus n'est autorisée que dans les eaux territoriales suédoises . "
Une autre affichette précise que la vente ne se fait que durant le voyage en direction de la Suède .
Réflexion d'un Alandais : " Est-ce que les fonctionnaires de Bruxelles n'ont vraiment rien de plus important à s'occuper que de venir mettre le nez dans nos traditions ? "
Un Suédois , qui tente de convaincre son interlocuteur du crime que représenterait une interdiction totale du snus , lance : " C'est comme si on interdisait le vin en France .
Ce serait la révolution , non ?
Et bien pareil en Suède . "
L'explication est bancale car les Suédois , par tempérament , ne vont pas brûler des pneus devant les préfectures et le snus ne fait pas vivre autant de gens que le vin .
Mais les Suédois aiment cette patte brunâtre dont ils se tapissent les gencives .
Ils sont aussi nombreux à " snuser " qu'à fumer .
Beaucoup de " snuseurs " ne sont pas dupes des explications angéliques du fabricant suédois Swedish Match qui tente depuis des années de convaincre la Commission européenne des bienfaits du snus par rapport à la cigarette .
Le cœur est soumis à un effort permanent , les plus assidus ont un trou dans la gencive .
Or la Commission européenne a fini par réagir car la Finlande ne respectait pas la directive tabac qui interdit le snus .
Le ton est passé à la menace et en janvier , les autorités de l'archipel ont fini par plier .
" Nous avons dû accepter que la vente de snus soit interdite sur nos bateaux " , concède Viveka Eriksson , premier ministre du gouvernement autonome d'Aland .
Certains armateurs , comme Viking Line , avaient déjà des bateaux battant pavillon suédois et peuvent donc continuer à vendre leur snus .
D'autres ont aussitôt réagi .
" Auparavant , il était écrit que la vente de snus était autorisée sur nos bateaux dans les eaux suédoises .
Désormais , cela n'existe plus dans les textes , raconte Björn Blomqvist , PDG d'Eckerö Linjen dont les ferries battent pavillon alando - finlandais .
Maintenant , nous devons deviner .
On continue à vendre , mais seulement en direction de la Suède , afin de ne pas contribuer à répandre ce dangereux tabac dans l'UE .
Mais on ne considère pas cette situation comme sûre .
Donc nous sommes en train de passer sous pavillon suédois . "
Conséquence pour la fragile économie alandaise : plusieurs communes vont perdre des revenus fiscaux non négligeables puisque des centaines de marins peuvent être désormais amenés à payer leurs impôts en Suède .
Un dilemme pour ces petites îles .
" Ce que nous voulons , explique Viveka Eriksson , c'est que la Finlande nous laisse une place de député européen , que nous puissions nous défendre nous - mêmes auprès de la Cour européenne de justice et que nous puissions aussi nous faire entendre auprès du Conseil européen des ministres . "
Autant de demandes écartées par la Finlande .
" Quitter l'UE pourrait ê tre une alternative si ces questions d'influence ne trouvent pas de réponse " , prévient Harry Jansson , le député indépendantiste .
Rebelles , les îles Aland ?
Au Musée de la marine de Mariehamn , on se targue de posséder l'un des deux seuls authentiques drapeaux de pirate au monde .
Celui - ci a été acheté voici longtemps par un marin alandais dans un souk d'Afrique du Nord .
" Mais il n'y a jamais eu de pirates ici , assure la conservatrice .
En revanche des contrebandiers , ça , oui ! "

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The economy may weaken further this year , an economist with the Conference Board said Monday on a report that a key gauge of the economy dipped slightly in June .
The index of leading economic indicators , which attempts to forecast turning points in the economy , declined 0.1 % in June .
The result for May was revised to a decline of 0.2 % , compared with a prior estimate of a 0.1 % gain .
Read related commentary .
" The domestic economy is showing no sign of strength , " said Ken Goldstein , labor economist at the Conference Board .
" The deep financial crisis , a prolonged , intense slump in housing , high gasoline and food prices , weak consumer confidence and a weak dollar are all combining to produce unrelenting downward pressure on economic activity . "
Four of the 10 leading indicators that make up the leading index rose in June , with the largest positive contribution from building permits .
The largest negative contribution came from the real money supply .
Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics , noted that June 's results were " saved from a much larger drop " due to a change in building permit rules for multifamily units in New York City that pushed up total starts .
" The data highlight the weakness of the economy in most areas , " Shepherdson wrote .
The coincident index , which measures the current economy , rose 0.1 % in June .
In May , the index declined 0.1 % .
The four indicators in the coincident index are the same ones used by the National Bureau of Economic Research to judge whether the economy is in a recession .
Industrial production was the largest positive contribution to the index , while employment continued to decline , according to the Conference Board .
On Sunday , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said current economic difficulties will take months to pass but added that turmoil in the banking sector is under control .
" This is a tough time , " Paulson said in an interview on CBS 's Face the Nation .
" We 're going to be in a period of slow growth for a while . "

Page by page , a good book can rewire your brain
The pile is waiting .
The pile is getting higher .
The pile looks impressive , probably is n't , still feels slightly overwhelming , vaguely threatening , even as it sighs , waits , drums its fingers on the inside of my skull , promising all manner of wonder and insight and syntactical bliss if I 'd just , please , maybe right now , even for just an hour or three , pay it some serious , focused attention .
Please ?
It 's a bit of a problem .
More than that , it 's a moral , ethical , personal issue , a deep indignity of the soul .
See , I love books .
Admire and appreciate and adore .
Was a lit major at Berkeley , still love to read , still like to consider myself a big consumer of books and deep thinker about bookish issues and ideas .
And yet , if I 'm painfully honest , I have to admit it : I barely read books anymore .
Not nearly the way I used to , anyway .
Not for a long , long time .
And chances are , if you 're at all drawn to the new media vortex , neither do you .
Books in danger
It 's become a social conundrum , a cultural sore spot , a morose sign of the times .
The question has been posed by agents and writers and a confused , hyperconsolidating publishing industry :
What happened to all the readers ?
What happened to the culture of books ?
And the hint of fatalism , just underneath :
If few truly read anymore , what of the state of the American mind ?
How much more dumbing down can we possibly stand ?
Oh sure , books still sell , product is moving like crazy , but by and large it 's truckloads of self - help and how - to flooding over a precious handful of sure - hit novelists , topped off with the grand cherry that is Oprah , single - handedly keeping the tepid , melodramatic coming - of - age family saga alive .
In between , 18 zillion copies of " Eat , Pray , Love . "
But overall , the message is bleak : Fewer writers of real talent are being discovered , fewer publishers are willing to take any sort of risk , and serious , literary - minded reading , that glorious pastime , that fine personal art , the immersive and transportive and beautiful intellectual fertilizer , appears to be giving way to the more addictive but far less nourishing hellbeast of new media and the Net .
It 's an easy beast to blame .
I skimmed through Nicholas Carr 's fascinating and depressing piece in the July / August Atlantic Monthly ( " Is Google Making Us Stupid ? " ) , which talks up , among other things , the downfall of deep reading , of spending uninterrupted hours immersed in a literary tome or even a long essay , a victim to modern media 's vicious short attention span .
Carr 's upshot :
The Net might actually be rewiring our brains , changing the way we read because it 's changing the way we think , forcibly adapting us to tolerate only bite - size summations and simplified blips at the expense of deeper thought , of the ability to parse ideas , to sink in for a long , committed intellectual journey .
Proof ?
That 's easy : Just try to sit down with that dense copy of W.G. Sebald or Murakami after spending any portion of your week online , and watch as your Net - addled brain becomes almost instantly anxious and frustrated , eager after just a couple of thousand words to jump away , ogle pictures , watch dumb teens humiliate themselves on YouTube , buy some shoes .
If TV numbs you out , encourages a passive , flaccid state of intellectual disengagement , the Net does the opposite , slamming so many tiny shots of pseudo - meaning and media and nothingness into your brain over the course of a few hours , it 's like getting stung by a swarm of bees .
It seems all dour and dreary and unfortunate , because not a week goes by that you do n't hear about some gloomy book fair or publishing industry merger or the death of a venerated independent bookstore that just could n't compete not only with Amazon but also with a generation trained to read nothing more challenging or lengthy than grammatically mangled e-mails or snarky text messages or snide 300 - word pop culture takedowns on Gawker .
Ah , but I do believe all is not lost .
There is lingering hope .
I am moderately sure a brain thusly amped on the wicked energy drink of the Web can , through honest time spent , through forcibly yanking the Ethernet cable out of your cerebral cortex , be re-rewired , untrained , readdicted to the deeper juice .
In fact , it is n't that difficult , really .
We just like to think it is .
I can personally attest .
About a year ago the most astounding thing happened :
The hard drive on my MacBook suffered a rare and painful meltdown when I was away on vacation .
I was , much to my initial horror , to be e-mail / Net - free for over a week .
What was I missing ?
Who was e-mailing ?
What about all the blogs and the news and the Significant Global Happenings ?
Time slows down
Mercifully , the yoga kicked in and I quickly shrugged , sighed , noted the incredible opportunity , the gods trying to tell me to unplug .
I hit the bookstore and bought three thick , sticky literary novels the way a misguided vegan buys some grass - fed steaks for the first time , and devoured them whole .
As I did so , an amazing thing happened .
Time slowed down .
The brain quickly returned to its normal breathing .
The mental seizures and the near - constant desire to click away and leap to something different faded and soon vanished .
And books suddenly moved from the bottom of the intellectual priority list straight back to their original , top - tier state of grace .
I vowed to never let them drop so low again .
Even though , right now , they have .
Even though , right now , even as I add to the glorious pile of must - reads on my desk , I realize I 've been sucked back into Net - time again , back to the world of instant feedback and clickable everything , as the pile grows heavy and scornful and lonely .
Ah but here again , an opportunity .
For it is here that I remember the most wonderfully humbling lesson of all .
When I finally got my precious MacBook back , when all e-mail was restored and all Net access was regranted and I was able to dive back into the digital maelstrom , it finally hit me : I 'd missed exactly nothing .
The world was exactly the same .
The beautiful churn continued , same as it ever was , with or without me .
Is n't that fantastic ?
Someone should write a book about it .

Using new scientific techniques , scientists have unlocked the cascade of molecular events that lead to Alzheimer ’s disease .
The scientific findings , recently published in Nature Medicine , suggest a potential new target for the development of drug therapies to fight the irreversible and degenerative disease which affects some 29.8 million people worldwide .
The total worldwide societal cost of dementia was estimated at somewhere in the region of US $ 315.4 billion in 2005 .
Alzheimer 's disease is marked by the build - up of plaques consisting of beta - amyloid protein fragments , as well as abnormal tangles of tau protein found inside brain cells .
Early in the disease , Alzheimer 's pathology is first observed in the hippocampus , the part of the brain important to memory , and gradually spreads to the cerebral cortex , the outer layer of the brain .
The team of Irish and international researchers have identified that the accumulation of a particular protein ( called amyloid ß- protein - Aß ) in the brain initiates Alzheimer ’s disease and that it directly alters the structure and function of brain cells .
The findings place a significant emphasis on the development of new therapeutic strategies targeted at the reduction of the formation of Aß as opposed to the reduction of the plaque burden associated with the disease .
“ Alzheimer ’s disease is a major personal and societal tragedy , ” says Professor Ciaran Regan from the UCD School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science , University College Dublin , one of the co-authors of the report .
“ The disease progression is torturously long and debilitating , extorting a huge emotional and economic cost . ”
“ The onset of the disease is insidious with the earliest symptoms often manifested as subtle and intermittent deficits of episodic memory , ” explains Professor Dominic Walsh , associate Professor of Pharmacology at the UCD Conway Institute , University College Dublin , another co-author of the report .
“ Our findings support the growing theory that Alzheimers ’s disease memory deficits may result from loss of dendritic spines and that this process is mediated by amyloid ß–protein ( Aß ) oligomers , not monomer or plaque Aß as previously considered . ”
The research is supported by the Wellcome Trust , Science Foundation Ireland and the US National Institutes of Health .
The co-authors in teams which contributed to the study include Ganesh Shankar , Shaomin Li , Tapan Mehta , Nina Shepardson , Cynthia Lemere , Bernardo Sabatini and Dennis Selkoe from Harvard Medical School ; Michael Rowan from Trinity College Dublin ; Michael Farrell and Francesca Brett from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland ; and Amaya Garcia - Munoz and Imelda Smith from University College Dublin .
You may have heard about the impressive and flashy new moving skyscraper set to be erected in Dubai .
However , did you know that one man is single - handedly rebuilding his own stone henge ( without modern machinery ) or that entire Egyptian temples ( originally carved out of mountainsides ) have been relocated ?
Here are twelve fantastic feats of ingenuity and structural engineering that range from pragmatic to artistic , from seemingly impossible moving buildings to incredibly creative building moving projects .
( images via : Wikipedia )
In one of the most amazing building moving feats in history the twin temples of Abu Simbel , carved out of an Egyptian mountainside , were moved to avoid flooding from the construction of a nearby dam along the Nile river .
Shown above is a model showing the former and current locations , the former being hundreds of feet underwater and the latter placed in new artificial hillsides .
The structures had to be carefully cut out piece by piece , labeled and individually reassembled at their new locations .

The Peter Green House at Brown University appears at first glance to be a rickety candidate for a building moving project .
The first video above video shows in fast - motion the process of slowly slide the building to its new location a few hundred feet away .
Timing was critical for lifting this structure so no unequal stresses were introduced to the building which could have resulted in catastrophic structural failures .

Built in the middle of the 1800s the Floating Church of the Redeemer was built in Bordertown , NJ and was towed to a busy dock in Philadelphia .
The Churchman ’s Missionary Association for Seamen was apparently interested in catering to sailors in a quite direct fashion .
The building was eventually rolled onto land where it survived for a few years before succumbing to a Christmas morning fire .

The London Bridge has an impressive history dating back two thousand years to roman times .
It was destroyed and rebuilt dozens of times in wood and stone and it was one such stone bridge that was eventually disassembled and moved , piece by piece , all the way to the United States .
The version in Arizona is not a complete replica but it is clad with the original stone and those stones fetched a handsome 2.5 million dollars .

The Belle Tout lighthouse survived near the edge of a cliff for over 150 years shining light visible for 20 miles .
A few years back 20 of the 30 feet of cliff protecting the lighthouse suddenly crumbled , leaving only a few meters between the structure and its destruction on the rocks far below .
Unwilling to give up on the building , its owner chose to move it instead and after five months of construction and structural preparation managed a miraculous slide of this 125 - ton structure 17 meters to save it
The four videos above show ( respectively ) the move of the Newton - Wellesly Hospital – a 900 ton brick building – the he simultaneous moves of three wooden structures at Harvard University , and the move of a residence along a canal and the transport of the Schubert Theater .
The slower - moving videos have been sped up to show the progress of these incredible building moving projects .
> This man is truly a genius .
A simple builder by trade he has turned his talents to recreating the entire structure of Stone Henge – all by himself .
How is that possible ?
He has used a series of simple tricks and elementary home - made wooden machines that anyone could build to do two critical tasks : ( 1 ) move large objects ( including entire buildings ) leveraging with only his own muscle power and ( 2 ) tilt up objects using simple weights and pulley systems and , again , only his own strength .
What does this prove ?
That if the original builders of Stone Henge used elementary technology an incredibly small crew could have built it .

Turning the Place Over is a strange art project in which part of a building was essentially cut out and made to rotate through a series of positions including its original one – a literal deconstruction / reconstruction process to make postmodernists proud .
The giant rotator used is a powerful device used in the nuclear industry and the resulting effect is a smooth ( though entirely disturbing ) view into the building that shifts slowly as the opening twists , morphs and eclipses again in a never - ending sequence .

Perhaps the most talked about ‘ moving building ’ of all time is the first moving skyscraper set to be built in Dubai .
Eighty stories of towers are set to rotate around a central axis facilitated by wind - powered turbines on each floor .
There is talk of building these in other major cities around the world but Dubai looks to be the first projected to have one finished – they are aiming for completion in 2010 .

Check out these firemen as they relatively effortlessly lift a car into the air .
This is probably about the largest scale at which such a feat would work but it is nonetheless a highly impressive way to defy gravity .

Many analysts have found this reserve growth behavior both curious and ultimately very important .
I know that Khebab and Rembrandt have spent much time on TOD tracking this behavior as it plays an important role in how the peak will play out .
Furthermore , I believe that the practice of " back - dating " discoveries based on reserve growth updates has muddied the waters and stalled progress in the basic understanding of the fundamental growth process .
Unless we have a good model for the reserve growth dynamics we have to resort to using the heuristics supplied by USGS geologists , including theequation that Khebab has successfully used in the past .
I find nothing wrong with using a heuristic and Khebab has really kick - started the " un-back - dating " approach with some excellent results .
Still , a heuristic lacks some of the predictive power and room for insight that a fundamental model can provide .
The USGS crew have an interesting take on the reserve growth issue .
In turns , the geologists working there have labeled fossil fuel ( both oil and NG ) reserve growth an " enigma " and a " puzzle " I have to admit that it has puzzled me for a while , but then again most of us here do n't work at the USGS for 40 - hours a week .
This post runs though a stochastic analysis that essentially explains how reserve growth can happen .
One of the technical issues that the USGS have struggled with respect to their reserve growth analysis involves the use of " censored data " .
This essentially says that you should take special care of extrapolating data backwards considering you have only a truncated time - series data set of recent vintage .
The " sweet spot " for good data basically does n't exist , with very few values for old data and also very few values for the latest data .
Working with such a limited data set , they massaged it the best they could and adequately normalized the fractional yearly growth , but they basically punted after this point and came up with only a heuristic to " explain " the trend .
Pragmatically , I 've decided to sweep the censoring problems under the rug , since in the long term , complaining about the possibility of statistical shortcomings still wo n't explain most of the trend , which rises steeply enough to make the cornucopians hopeful for great prospects ahead ( listen to any right - wing radio program today for examples of this kind of unbridled optimism ) .
Yet we still have left a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigmaThe actual problem with the half - baked reserve growth analysis has become obscured by the trickiness with using censored data .
Wrapped inside , it really stems from a lack of a good value for the initial discovery estimate .
Stating it bluntly , pick this number incorrectly and you can get numbers all over the map , with the possibility for some hugely absurd values .
To provide a path forward in unwrapping the riddle , I used the generalized Dispersive Discovery Model .
In terms of modeling reserve growth , the dispersion generates a tail for accumulating further discoveries after the initial estimate occurs .
For constant average growth , the model looks like this :
For the purposes of this analysis , I convert it to a reserve growth valueand setto make the math easier to handle later on : Note that at time t=0 , the discovered amount starts at zero and then the accumulation reaches some value proportional to L -- what one should consider as the characteristic depth or volume of the reservoir .
It takes time =T for most of the search to reach this point .
The basic premise of reserve growth and what USGS geologists such as Attanasi & Rootand Vermaframe their arguments on , has to do with the reserve growth considered as a .
They see numbers that reach a value of nearly 10 x after 90 years and claim ( perhaps implicitly ) that this has some real physical significance , almost offering up hope for still - to - come huge reserve benefits .
Figure 1 exaggerates the claim for effect , as I want to make you aware that a finite asymptote certainly exists , but it gets obscured by the data trends commonly reported .
The contrived swindle of the USGS explanation has to do with exactlythe original estimate becomes available .
Conceivably you can make estimates that occur very early in the lifespan of a reservoir , and you will get very low estimates for estimated discovery size .
To take it to one extreme , you might find the initial estimate to fill a .
Now , if that estimate grows at all , you can get huge apparent reserve growth factors , some fraction approaching infinite in fact .
In contrast , you can wait a couple of years and then report the data .
The later years ' growth factor will proportionately account for much less of an increase .
Now if you consider that in other parts of the world , countries report reserves less conservatively then the USA , then the reserve growth factors can vary even more wildly .
I used USA oil data from an Attanasi & Root paperwhich you can find a dump of here .
Initially , I plotted the data as a fractional yearly growth curve , basically reproducing the trend that A&R report :
The key insight to understand the growth factor in terms of the DD model has to do with averaging the initial discovery point over a relatively small window of time starting from .
This effectively samples the infinite values of growth against other finite values .
The use of the sampling / integration window brings down the potentially infinite ( or at least very large ) growth factor to something more realistic .
The math on this derives easily into an analytic form , and we end up with this function , whereindicates the time integration window :
The term on the right of the main divisor assures that the averagestarts at 1 for time .
Alternatively we can setto some arbitrary value and skip the integration , which assumes that all initial discovery estimates start at .
This results in the conceptually simpler :
The latter equation obviously starts at 1 and reaches an asymptotic value of .
Both the values ofanddescribe the ultimate asymptote , but the non-zeroserves to avoid generating a singularity at the origin .
Forand , the figure to the right shows the negligible differences between using an integration window versus assuming a delta shift in the first estimate .
The two curves essentially sit very close to one another .
So what do these numbers mean ?
Essentially , means that the first discovery estimate on occursyears after they first made the discovery .
This makes intuitive sense because if we make the estimate too early , we end up with the equivalent of a thimble - full of oil .
For , this means that it takes about 25 years for the majority ( i.e. the fast part ) of the dispersive search to take place .
The rest of the long tail results from the slower dispersion .
The curve does eventually reach the asymptote for a cumulative growth factor of In terms of a spreadsheet , you can turn the CGF formula into a discrete generating function , with the yearly estimates based on the growth factor of the preceding year .
I plotted the curve directly against the A&R data in Figure 3 and Figure 4 .
After the hairs on the back of my neck settled down , I realized that this simple formula has some nice understandable properties .
It essentially generates growth factors based solely on the maximum entropy dispersion in the underlying model .
In other words , the " enigmatic " reserve growth has turned from a puzzle into a mathematical result resulting solely from simple stochastic effects .
Plotting the same data against an Attanasi & Root chart in Figure 5 , it lays cleanly on top of it , showing discrepancies only on some very old outlier data .
A&R went through the rationale of discounting the outliers , but I consider all the data valuable , Interestingly , with the limited data available , the reserve growth looks like it will continue on and eventually reach infinite values , but this becomes a mathematical impossibility if we integrate out the " thimble " - sized initial estimates .
As a bottom - line , if we continue to make poor initial estimates for discoveries , we will continue to pay the price for acting surprised at the " huge " reserve growth we have .
In other words , the USGS has pawned off a contrivance on us by making us believe that their trend lines went beyond mere empiricism .
If you look back at the previous " model " that the USGS 's Verma postulatedbased on the " modified Arrington " approach , you will realize that the trend line comes about purely from heuristic considerations .
Their equation shows a fractional order power - law growth : To top it off , this heuristic shows !
Do you suppose that the USGS geologists figured out that by reserving judgment on the possibility of an asymptote , that they could pawn off a fast one on the public , and defer the reality for years to come ?
You have to ask yourself how these professionals get away with publishing stuff based on hacking and punting , that really has such a simple statistical and mathematical underlying foundation .
I really find nothing complicated about the mathematics ( even though it has taken me some time to arrive at my current state of understanding ) .
I call this combination of using simple models and using straightforward calculus and probabilities a form of -- just something you do to understand the physical foundation for the data we observe .
Referring again to the literature , you find hints that support the dispersive effects of accumulated reservoir estimates ( note that they use the term dispersion ) .
I claim that this new dispersive discovery reserve growth model has the potential for filling in the back - dated discovery curves and providing better estimates of future production levels .
I would recommend starting with the USA data and using Khebab 's approach for regenerating a profile of un - back - dated discoveries and then applying the Oil Shock Model to estimate extrapolated production levels .
It may take some time to sort out the mess , but we likely have all the pieces necessary to formulate a complete model - based projection .
The actual enigma of reserve growth I think has to do with the cluelessness of the USGS and the secrecy and inscrutability of the oil industry .
You would think they would have figured out the reserve growth puzzle long ago .
I guess they thought that deferring the reality would surely provide us with infinite hope .
A fraction of the population thinks that oil production remains a simple matter of turning the spigot clockwise to get more oil , and reserve growth a non-issue .
And that raising the current reserve inventory becomes a conservative decision made entirely under the control of humans .
Overestimating the size of a reservoir has significant financial advantages .
You can attract huge initial investment capital if you exaggerate a claim .
But this can also attract charlatans .
So I agree with the SEC 's decision to put the stops on that practice , with big fines for fraudulent claims .
And thus the oil companies tried to make their reserve estimates as high as they could without overdoing it .
But they still had no good ideas on how best to characterize their estimates ( not smart ? who knows ? ) .
Some people suggest that the industry just makes " conservative " decisions .
Yet , I do n't think that ambiguously - framed " conservative " decisions matches with well with what you can accomplish with a good reserve growth model .
I would describe the industry 's approach not " conservative " but " non-predictive " and " safe " .
I can point to lots of other engineering areas where through the routine process of characterization one can make equally conservative estimates , but they do an excellent job of predicting the asymptotic behavior with safety margins for any errors or noise that creeps in .
As an example Andy Grove was the first to characterize silicon dioxide growth by evaluating simple models and thus began Intel .
Getting oxide thickness correct could follow a process where someone checks the thickness every two minutes like they were watching a loaf of bread rise , but the technology and modeling has gone way beyond that now in Silicon Valley and China .
Not so with the oil industry however ; to the untrained eye it looks like they use the primitive trick of plunging a thermometer into the turkey roasting in the oven .
This is safe but , jeez , how primitive !
Bottom line , I believe the current industry estimates for reserve growth remain just as safe and non-predictive as a turkey thermometer , but that the underlying reality ( having to do with the dispersion of searches through the volume of a reservoir ) can vastly improve our educated guesses .
This makes it potentially predictive if the industry had the balls to use a good validated model .
The simple model I use for reserve growth is complementary to what Andy Grove did in the 60's .
Unfortunately , I also do n't think that petroleum engineers have any control over marketing decisions .
It 's possible that oil industry engineers knew about the characterization outlined here all along but were superceded by management 's decisions .
They used it in their own internal books and presented a " safe " facade for the outside world .
Unfortunately , we turned the clock to a new century , and some nobodies on TOD have finally figured out the obvious that had stared at them and the USGS in the face for years .

( CNN ) --
The agency that regulates Mississippi 's casinos got pillows , stoves , dinnerware and other items meant for Hurricane Katrina victims , according to state records obtained by CNN .
Rep. Bennie Thompson says he 'll hold a hearing into how supplies for Katrina victims were diverted .
The Mississippi Gaming Commission was among 11 state agencies that received the household items from the state 's surplus agency .
A breakdown of what each agency received shows the commission took a coffee maker , a case of pillows , wash kits , two dual - burner stoves , plates and utensils , two cases of hand sanitizers and 20 five - gallon containers .
Larry Gregory , executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission , could not be reached for comment .
But an aide , Becky Clark , said the agency is keeping the items " in case of another hurricane . "
The Mississippi Department of Corrections also got 20 coffee makers , 15 tents , four cases of pillows , five cases of men's underwear and other supplies .
A CNN investigation revealed in June that for two years after Hurricane Katrina , the Federal Emergency Management Agency stored 121 truckloads of household items that were purchased or donated for Katrina victims .
FEMA eventually declared the items surplus , saying it was too expensive to keep warehousing them , and then offered them to federal agencies and states .
Sixteen states , including storm - ravaged Mississippi , took the items .
However , CNN discovered that those items were given to the 11 state agencies , schools , cities and fire departments rather than being distributed to residents trying to rebuild their homes .
Leaders of nonprofit groups helping Katrina victims were astounded when CNN showed them photos of the FEMA supplies .
All said they were unaware that such supplies were available .
In response to the CNN stories , the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said he will hold a hearing on the matter .
Rep. Bennie Thompson , D - Mississippi , says he plans to ask FEMA officials why the supplies were stored for two years .

HAMBURG , Germany  Naples ’ garbage  the plastic Ferrarelle water bottles , the soggy copies of Internazionale magazine , the decomposing kitchen compost  has ended up here , waiting to be dumped into an incinerator on the outskirts of this tidy German city .
For months , mountains of rotting trash have grown in the streets of southern Italy because the region has run out of places to put it .
So for the time being  11 weeks , actually  a 56 - car train will arrive in Hamburg every day after a 44 - hour journey , each bearing 700 tons of Neapolitan refuse .
“ We are doing this because we were asked to provide emergency aid , but we will do it only for a few months , not years , ” said Martin Mineur , the director of two of Hamburg ’s incinerators , as a steady stream of trucks carrying garbage from the train station roared by .
“ This is not a long - term solution .
Italy will have to solve Italy ’s problem . ”
But Italy ’s problem has echoes in all of Europe , where Naples looks increasingly like a foul - smelling version of an untenable past , and Hamburg its future .
Despite population growth , Hamburg produces less garbage today than it did almost a decade ago .
What it does generate is either recycled or removed to high - tech , low - polluting incinerators .
Taliban use swords to slit the throats of Afghan ' traitors ' in public executions before thousands
In a shocking display of hardline violence , Taliban militants in northwest Pakistan publicly slit the throats of two Afghans today after they were accused of spying for US forces suspected of launching a missile strike in May .
The two men , one of them a former Taliban fighter , were brought blindfolded before a crowd of several thousand people near the village of Damadola in the Bajaur region on the Afghan border before they were executed .
' Spies ' : Pakistani Taliban get ready to execute the two Afghans - one a former Taliban fighter - accused of spying for the US
" They were spies .
Whoever spies for the Americans will meet the same fate , " Qari Zia - ur - Rehman , a Taliban leader in the area , told the crowd before another man slit the throats of the two with a sword .
The crowd shouted : " Allahu Akbar " ( God is Greatest ) when the Taliban held up the severed heads of the victims who Rehman said were from the eastern Afghan province of Kunar .
Bajaur is one of Pakistan 's seven border regions dominated by ethnic Pashtun tribes and a hotbed of support for the Taliban and al Qaeda .
The two condemned men are surrounded by armed militants - one steadily filming the event on a video camera
After the killings , shooting broke out in the crowd but it was not clear why .
Two people were killed and seven wounded .
Rehman said the two Afghans had spied for U.S. forces who the militants believed were responsible for a missile strike on a house in Damadola in May in which 18 people , including foreign militants , were killed .
Two missiles were apparently fired by U.S. drones and a government official said at the time the strike had apparently targeted a mid-level , Arab al Qaeda member , who had been killed .
Islamist militants have killed scores of people in the tribal belt on the Afghan border on suspicion of spying for U.S. forces in Afghanistan but public executions have been rare .

On the first day , God created the dog and said :
‘ Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in
or walks past .
For this , I will give you a life span of twenty years . ’
The dog said : ‘ That ’s a long time to be barking .
How about only ten
years and I ’ll give you back the other ten ? ’
So God agreed .
On the second day , God created the monkey and said :
‘ Entertain people , do tricks , and make them laugh .
For this , I ’ll give
you a twenty - year life span . ’
The monkey said : ‘ Monkey tricks for twenty years ?
That ’s a pretty long time to perform .
How about I give you back ten like
the Dog did ?’
And God agreed .
On the third day , God created the cow and said :
‘ You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer
under the sun , have calves and give milk to support the farmer ’s
family .
For this , I will give you a life span of sixty years . ’
The cow said : ‘ That ’s kind of a tough life you want me to live for
sixty years .
How about twenty and I ’ll give back the other forty ? ’
And God agreed again .
On the fourth day , God created man and said :
‘ Eat , sleep , play , marry and enjoy your life .
For this , I ’ll give you
twenty years . ’
But man said : ‘ Only twenty years ?
Could you possibly give me my
twenty , the forty the cow gave back , the ten the monkey gave back , and
the ten the dog gave back ; that makes eighty , okay ? ’
‘ Okay , ’ said God , ‘ You asked for it . ’
So that is why for our first twenty years we eat , sleep , play and enjoy

For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our

By using tumor - targeting nanoparticles filled with chemotherapy drugs , scientists kept kidney and pancreas cancers from spreading through the bodies of mice .
In an experiment described today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers led by University of California , San Diego pathologist David Cheresh designed nanoparticles that selectively attached to a protein found on the surface of blood vessels that supply tumors with nutrients and oxygen .
The particles were loaded with doxorubicin , an effective but highly toxic anti-cancer drug with side effects ranging from white cell destruction to fatal heart disease .
By targeting blood vessel cells , the researchers needed just one - fifteenth the amount used in a traditional , system - flooding dose .
" To use an analogy from warfare , we did n't have as much collateral damage , " said Cheresh .
Such findings are n't unique in the fast - growing field of cancer nanotech , but the researchers found something new :
Although their nanoparticles did n't affect the original tumor , they did stop the cancers from spreading through the mice .
That process is known as metastasis – a word synonymous , for anyone who has experience with cancer , with doom .
" Patients often do n't die from primary tumors , which you can recognize and detect and develop a therapy for , " said Cheresh .
" They die from metastatic disease – when , for example , a breast cancer spreads to the liver , the lymph nodes , the brain .
Those patients could theoretically be treated with this type of therapy , with the hope that it would prolong the progression of the disease , that the metastatic lesions would slow . "
Cheresh said that newly forming tumors , still too small to be detected , depend on a fresh supply of blood .
With doxorubicin rendering them unable to form blood vessels , the tumors did n't grow .
Cheresh added that doxorubicin , which has already been approved for human use , is merely one example of what could be achieved through the nanotherapeutic use of other , highly toxic drugs .
In addition to treatment , nanoparticles can also be used for the early detection of cancer .
" Those trials have begun or are in the process of being finalized , " he said .
" The day is n't too far off . "

As was pointed out by Daniel Webb in a comment to my previous post , under Linux you have to use FUSE to use ZFS .
He just replied before I had a chance to get the next post in this series out . :-)
We 've been using ZFS under Open Solaris for the last year or two in our hosting business for backup servers .
It has some really compelling features ( beyond what I mentioned in my last post ) when used for backups .
While it has worked well , it has n't been entirely trouble - free .
For a home backup / storage server I wanted to use ZFS but I absolutely have to keep the data encrypted .
ZFS under OpenSolaris does n't currently support on disc encryption , though they are working on it .
Linux has very mature disc encryption support , it 's in the stock kernels and many installers support it now .
That plus me being very familiar with Linux prompted me to look at ZFS under Linux again .
Read on for my user report .
I 've built and tested ZFS on FUSE previously and it was working .
I was planning on doing some serious use , and had several options ( including running Linux + Crypto on the base machine , exporting the block devices via iSCSI , and running OpenSolaris on another machine or virtual ) .
Because of this , I decided to start my research by looking at the mailing lists .
ZFS on FUSE has n't gotten a real release in quite a long time , around 15 months at the time of this writing .
However , on the mailing list I saw a healthy amount of discussion and regular fixes being applied to it .
So for my current set of tests I started with the latest code from version control .
My test system was running on a system with CentOS 5 and 10 hard 250 GB hard drives .
Because of CentOS I was running an older kernel and FUSE , but things worked relatively well .
I had some problems initially because one of my hard drives was having problems – something I knew because of RAID issues that caused trashing of my file - system resulting in this system becoming available for use in testing ZFS . :-)
I tracked down that bad drive ( over a year out of warranty ) , and things got better but I still ran into a couple of situations where the system would lock up while I was running multiple backups .
My theory on this was that with only 2GB of RAM I was just thrashing the system while running rsyncs .
ZFS under FUSE is known to use a lot of memory in the first place , and rsync version 2 stores a full file list in memory .
So I upgraded the test system to 3GB of RAM , and at that point I did n't have any problems .
I also installed rsync version 3 , which can do incremental file lists , which saved a ton of memory .
However , my performance was pretty limited .
This had nothing to do with ZFS under FUSE .
A Celeron 3GHz just does n't have the huevos for keeping up with 10 encryption processes plus the ZFS checksumming , etc …
I finally decided that I was happy enough with my testing that I was ready to bite the bullet and start trying to deploy the final system .
I upgraded the system to 14 500GB drives and a quad core 2.4GHz Core 2 CPU , but with only 2GB of RAM currently .
I left a 250 GB drive in place for the system disc ( previously I just saved 4GB on every drive and used the first two drives as a mirror for the system ) .
On this I installed Ubuntu 8.04 ( a LTS release similar to CentOS , but with more recent software since it was released only a few months ago .
I built the latest development checkout of ZFS for FUSE and set up the 14 500 GB drives as a raidz2 ( redundant storage with two parity drives ) on top of the encrypted partitions .
I then copied over the “ zfs send ” copies of the file - systems I had created on my test system , around 400 GB of data .
These are low - level copies of the file - system snapshots , containing the backups I 've been making of a bunch of our laptops .
I loaded the dumps back into their respective ZFS mount - points with no problems , which I was happy about .
These backups took weeks to complete , because they were coming over slim upload pipes and further rate - limited so that they would n't impact other use of our networks while backups were running .
I next copied 2.2TB of data over from my storage server .
This took a couple of days , but copied over with no problems at all .
I found my old storage server had only a 100 mbps network adapter in it .
I took it down to add a gigabit adapter , and then realized I had no more free PCI slots ( because of several being used for 4 - port SATA adapters ) .
Which was probably just as well , the 3.2GHz Celeron in the sending computer could only handle around 30 MB / sec with all the crypto going on …
At this point I have around 3TB on the system , so I started a “ scrub ” – the ZFS equivalent of a RAID verify .
I 've done a few of them with no problems .
It 's running over 240 MB / sec during the verify , which is perfectly reasonable .
The OpenSolaris machines running native ZFS are seeing around 100MB / sec to 200MB / sec with no crypto , but those are 12 250 GB drives or 8 500 GB drives .
The only real gotcha is that on OpenSolaris you can access the snapshots via “ / pool/fsname/.zfs/snapshotname ” .
Under Linux you do n't have access to the “ .zfs ” hidden name .
So to access a snapshot you have to clone it .
This is a very workable solution , but I had to spend a bit of time hunting around before I figured out what the story was .
So far I 've had absolutely no issues with it .
It 's been running great .
I 've only been using ZFS under Linux seriously for about the last month , but so far things are looking really good .
Am I considering switching our OpenSolaris systems to Linux ?
Absolutely .
Part of that is that we are much more familiar with Linux than OpenSolaris .
Another part is that the hardware support under OpenSolaris is much more limited than under Linux .
It was fairly painful to find SATA cards that were supported under OpenSolaris .
One final parting note , and this is true of ZFS under both platforms …
The “ zfs scrub ” restarts whenever you create or delete a snapshot .
The scrub is an important part of ensuring your data is happy and healthy , but if the time required to do the scrub is larger than the frequency with which you create snapshots , your scrub will never finish .
With ZFS you can do neat things like create a snapshot , run a “ zfs send ” to replicate the data to another machine , then destroy the previous snapshot and repeat .
However , if you do this frequently ( say , via cron every minute ) , it 's going to seriously mess with the scrub .

As developers we live in an interesting profession .
To put it in more scientific terms our industry is an anomaly , a singularity , if you will .
Our industry is certainly fast paced , in fact , with the exception of maybe the biotech industry we probably move faster than any other .
Our industry though , arguably , has a much broader effect on the other industries that it is involved with .
Our industry is somewhat of a meta- industry , being an integral part of almost every industry that exists today .
Very few companies that operate today do n’t need developers .
If they are too small to hire developers , then they probably have contracted work out to consulting firms that have created , or integrated , software for them .
Banks need developers , retail store chains need developers , waste management companies need developers , the postal service needs developers , everyone needs developers .
And this has created a huge demand for developers , which is good for you and for me .
We enjoy high wages , good working conditions , and the flexibility of working almost anywhere in the world .
Our product is virtual , yet real , and can be created and distributed anywhere in the world in seconds .
This allows us to work far from where our products are consumed and , because of software that our own industry has created , this is often enabled by extremely simple means .
And yet , our industry is like the wild west .
We have very few established best practices , and we often have even less rigor in our processes .
Some companies write software as if they were building a glass castle , while others write software as if they are shoveling dirt onto a pile .
All of this has created an industry that is like no other .
No other industry is as exciting , or as risky .
No other industry succeeds like we do , and no other industry fails as spectacularly as we do .
No other industry produces companies that so quickly rise to stardom , or just as quickly implode on themselves .
All of this makes our industry the most dynamic and exciting industry around , and one that I would n’t trade for any other .
But many of these factors have led to a huge problem that we are all currently facing .
The huge demand for developers , coupled with the relative youth of our industry , has created hordes of developers who simply do n’t understand what they are doing .
They do not understand how computers work , or how a compiler works .
They use dictionaries and stacks all the time , but they do n’t understand that these are classic data structures , and not something that Microsoft just made up .
And the problem is n’t that they do n’t know these things , it is that they do n’t want to know these things .
People need to start understanding that just being smart does not make you a good developer .
Being smart certainly does not hurt , but in order to be a good developer you have to be smart and want to learn .
You can be a successful developer without wanting to learn , but you cannot be a good developer without wanting to learn .
I feel as if I am a relatively smart person , yet if I walked into an architecture firm and told them that I wanted a job , and that I was qualified because I had used AutoCAD a few times , then they would laugh at me .
In the programming industry right now , this kind of thing seems to happen regularly .
I am quite often regaled with stories of developers and products that people have worked with in the past where someone did something so inconceivable that one wonders how anyone could ever think such a thing was a good idea .
In fact , entire sites have been devoted to this very topic .
People ’s resumes are so loaded up with fluff that reading it you would have thought that they had singularly solved world hunger and walked on water while working as a Programmer Analyst at their last job .
And the reason that people can get away with this sort of thing is that in order to question experience , you have to be experienced .
I do n’t consider myself very experienced , but in the past I have had to look over resumes that I could n’t believe had landed people jobs in the past .
And the hourly rates that these people wanted were , well , outrageous .
I do n’t know how you can sit in someone ’s office and ask for 45 dollars an hour but not be able to explain the difference between an interface and an abstract class .
( No , I ’m not saying 45 dollars an hour is outrageous , what I am saying is that 15 dollars an hour is outrageous when you ca n’t explain to me the difference between “ private ” and “ protected ” access modifiers . )
I think the problem is that most developers have no incentive to do better .
If someone can do as little as possible , make a good income , and still have a stable job then they clearly do n’t have any external forces to push them toward bettering themselves .
Some people need external forces , but our industry is operating in a time when these forces are not very strong .
So right now we have to rely on developers to have an internal drive to explore and learn , and this is something that I am starting to feel cannot be taught or learned .
Another problem is that most employers do n’t push their employees to learn , and do n’t provide any learning time on the job .
Now , most employers will probably think it is ridiculous to provide an employee with time on the job for learning , but I think it is ridiculous not to .
In an industry where being more efficient is the name of the game , do n’t you want employees to more thoroughly know products before they start constructing solutions that your business will rely on ?
How many times have you seen an application built with some cool new technology that was really neat and powerful , yet the application was built in some amazingly obscene way that negated the power of the tool ?
I would bet that you ’ve seen it more than once .
Anyone who has worked with asp.net has probably seen the developers who put huge blocks of code in the html as if they were developing in asp.classic .
Now , all of this may be coming off as if I consider myself to be a godly programmer among mere mortals , but I sincerely hope that this is n’t the case .
Just for the record though , I do not consider myself to be an amazing developer .
I am not a genius , and I would probably flunk an interview somewhere like Google if I got one .
I do n’t remember the exact difference between a binary and binomial heap ( I do now that I just looked it up ) .
I remember Dijkstra ’s and Prim ’s algorithms , and that they had to do with finding shortest paths and minimum spanning trees , but I could n’t begin to implement them without looking it up .
What I do know is that I have never had to use any of this in my job ( although it would be awesome if I had to , because it would probably be a challenge ) , and I also know is that I would never fault someone for not knowing these things .
But I would fault them for not wanting to know these things .
I would have to say that the knowledge which has been the most important to me are general application design skills .
Or , “ application architecture ” skills if we want to sound really important .
But I learned very little about application architecture in college .
Everything I know about good application design I have learned from reading Fowler , McConnell , Martin , Hunt , Thomas , Evans , Nilsson , Glass , etc … I have also learned huge amounts from reading many many people ’s blogs and from several people that I have worked with .
All of the algorithms and data structures would be worthless if I did n’t know how to integrate them into a larger project .
And I feel that without this external drive for me to perfect my craft , I would be a pretty lousy programmer .
Although , I might actually be a lousy programmer , assuming Dunning and Kruger are correct .
What I hope that you take away from this is that not every programmer needs to be a crazy mathematical genius who knows every algorithm and data structure known to man ( although I think Steve Yegge would argue differently ) .
A good programmer does n’t even need to be an incredible genius .
What a good programmer needs is the knowledge that they do n’t know everything there is to know , and that they need to be constantly searching for a better way .
GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - A newly - released document suggests Osama bin Laden ’s former driver may have been subjected to 50 days of sleep deprivation at the Guantanamo prison camp in Cuba , the prisoner ’s defense lawyers said on Monday .
Items given to detainees at Camp Delta are shown in a cell at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba September 4 , 2007 .

Lawyers for Salim Hamdan , a Yemeni in his late 30s , previously alleged Hamdan was beaten and abused .
But they said sleep deprivation for 50 days , if proved , would be among the worst abuse he suffered at the hands of his American captors .
They also said the records indicated Hamdan and other prisoners at the remote detention camp in southeastern Cuba were visited by someone called “ Alfred Hitchcock , ” apparently after the British master of psychological thriller films who died in 1980 .
Hamdan is charged with conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists .
Prosecutors argue he was a willing participant in al Qaeda while his lawyers say he was a member of a motor pool and drove bin Laden because he needed the $ 200 monthly salary .
Hamdan , wearing a traditional headdress and a white gown under a Western - style blazer , attended the first day of a week of hearings on legal motions before the war court .
His trial , scheduled to start in a week , would be the first at the tribunals .
He faces life in prison if convicted .
Hamdan ’s lawyers said they discovered the document among 600 pages of “ confinement ” evidence handed over to the defense team on Saturday , 9 days before trial .
It said Hamdan was put into “ Operation Sandman ” between June 11 and July 30 , 2003 .
Operation Sandman has been described in press reports as a program devised by behavioral scientists where an inmate ’s sleep is systematically interrupted .
“ My view personally is that sleep deprivation of that nature extending for 50 days would constitute torture , ” said Joseph McMillan , one of Hamdan ’s civilian lawyers .
Documents released last week indicated that Canadian prisoner Omar Khadr was deprived of uninterrupted sleep at Guantanamo before an interview by a Canadian investigator .
Last month a defense lawyer urged a Guantanamo judge to help restore America ’s reputation by dropping attempted murder charges against Afghan prisoner Mohammed Jawad because he was subjected to 14 consecutive days of sleep deprivation .
Hamdan ’s lawyers have asked the war court to throw out his out - of - court statements due to coercion .
Their motions allege Hamdan was beaten in Afghanistan and subjected to “ more sophisticated ” abuse at Guantanamo including sexual humiliation , isolation , intimidation and deception .
WHO WAS ALFRED HITCHCOCK ?
Defense lawyers said they were curious about the meaning of entries in the documents that “ Alfred Hitchcock ” had visited Hamdan and other prisoners .
“ Who Alfred Hitchcock is I have no idea , ” said Navy Lt. Cmdr Brian Mizer , a defense lawyer .
“ It ’s obviously a code name for something . ”
Mike Berrigan , deputy chief defense counsel for the tribunals , called the last - minute submission of the documents “ outrageous ” and said it was another example of the unfairness of the tribunals .
“ It ’s no way to do business and it puts a lie , to the world , that these are full and fair proceedings , ” he said .
Military officials had no immediate comment .
The defense said it would seek sanctions as a result of the last - minute handover of papers due last December .
Earlier in the hearings , Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , the military judge , said accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and some of his co-defendants may have relevant evidence to offer as defense witnesses for Hamdan .
The defense intends to call eight prisoners , including Mohammed and three other alleged September 11 plotters , Walid bin Attash , Ramzi Binalshibh and Mustafa al Hawsawi .
They say Mohammed and bin Attash have evidence to exonerate Hamdan .

Power Plant Efficiency Has n’t Improved Since 1957
June 26th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Editor ’s Note : Today we are happy to bring to you a guest post from Sean Casten , CEO and President of Recycled Energy Development .
Americans have a habit of framing our scientific history as a series of Great Inventors , from Eli Whitney to Thomas Edison to Afrika Bambaataa .
The history books say each was prodded by Adam Smith ’s invisible hand to come up with the great technological advances that have made our country a home of innovation .
There ’s a problem with this mythology : sometimes there ’s no invisible hand .
Sometimes short - sighted government regulations give preference to bad technologies over good ones — stifling innovation and blinding us to our own ability to make progress .
Nowhere is this mythology more evident than in our energy system , the most heavily regulated and subsidized industry in the country .
A host of bad regulations have made this system grossly inefficient , contributing both to global warming and to high power costs .
The US today converts fossil fuel into electricity at 33 % efficiency , throwing away two - thirds of every unit of fuel we burn in cooling towers and smoke stacks .
That ’s the same conversion efficiency we had last year .
That ’s the same efficiency we had in 1980 .
In fact , you have to go all the way back to 1957 to find a year when the electric sector wasted more energy than they do today .
During the same period , we ’ve seen automobile fuel economy skyrocket ( especially on a horsepower - adjusted basis ) .
We ’ve seen massive increases in the efficiency of our electric appliances .
We ’ve even seen boring old steam boiler efficiency increases with modern controls , recuperators and preheaters .
And yet the efficiency of electricity generation is stagnant .
It ’s not stagnant because we ’ve hit any fundamental limit .
Indeed , studies by the US Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency have identified a whopping 200,000 MW of potential ( that ’s 20 % of the peak power demand of the US ) for proven technologies that either recover waste energy from industrials and / or cogenerate heat and electricity from a single fuel source .
The worst of these technologies is twice as fuel efficient as the current electric grid .
Fully deploying that potential would not only cut CO 2 emissions by 20 % — about the same as if we took every passenger car off the road — but would also cut our energy costs , simply by burning less fuel .
And those are just the technologies we ’ve taken the time to quantify .
So what ’s holding these technologies back ?
Nothing more than our regulatory paradigm .
A couple of examples :
Our century - old electric regulatory model pays utilities a return on their capital investment , but compels them to pass along all operating costs to consumers at zero mark - up .
This creates a great incentive to build capital - intensive boondoggles .
It completely isolates electric utilities from the economic principles that drive “ normal ” businesses , wherein capital and operating cost reductions are a route to greater profits .
This has conspired to make our electric sector openly hostile to efficient power generation .
It explains why their efficiency has n’t moved since 1957 , and why that sector now accounts for 42 % of US CO 2 emissions .
The Clean Air Act mandates end - of - pipe pollution control technologies that universally impose additional parasitic loads on industrials and power plants to run baghouses , catalyst beds , electro-static precipitators and any number of other technologies .
All these parasitic mandates have the perverse consequence that our environmental policy mandates reduction in criteria pollution and mandates increases in CO 2 emissions .
Worse , a facility that has the temerity to improve the energy efficiency of their process will almost certainly trigger New Source Review , under which they will have to come into compliance with new , more stringent permits than the one they currently operate under .
These two features of the Clean Air Act conspire to make many industrials openly fearful many otherwise sensible steps to lower their greenhouse - gas signature ( and lower their operating expense . )
None of this is to suggest that we should not continue to pursue technological revolutions , of course .
But if those technologies bring about cheaper , cleaner , more efficient energy , they will find themselves blocked by precisely the same regulations that are keeping existing technologies out of the market .
Technology is important — but regulatory reform to remove our barriers to energy efficiency is the critical path .

Steampunk modifications keep creeping up left and right with PC ’s , guitars , accessories and so many more items .
This Victorian Era looking Steampunk Mouse is just remarkable or should i say … Steampunktastic !
Not only is it a good looking product , but a major one which most of the world ’s population uses , so no one can deny the beauty and odd but remaining practicality .
Actually , this is the first time we have written about a steampunk mod unless you consider the artistic wooden PC also as Steampunk art .
I truly believe this is a masterpiece , or more like a Victorian Art Mouse masterpiece .
Take a look at the pictures and just try to deny the treasure at hand .
All hail the Victorian Mouse Steampunk Mod !

May 29 , 2008  -- Retired U.S. government official and security expert Richard Clarke gives a critical review of the nation 's security practices in his latest book , " Your Government Failed You : Breaking the Cycle of National Security Disasters . "
Clarke claims the government has proven itself incapable of handling the majority of America 's crucial national security issues , citing the 2001 terrorist attacks , the war in Iraq and the government 's botched Hurricane Katrina response .
In his book , Clarke argues the problems are n't temporary , but rather indicative of a systematic problem .
He looks at why failures have occurred and offers strategies for how the U.S. can succeed against terrorists .
Read an excerpt of this book below .
9/11 CHANGED EVERYTHING ?
When I said " Your government failed you " to the families of the victims of 9/11 , it seemed to me that I was merely stating the obvious :
The government had failed the American people .
And I had .
Three thousand people had been murdered in a morning , not on a battlefield , not in their battleships as had happened at Pearl Harbor , but in their offices .
They had been killed by a terrorist group that had promised to attack us , and which we had been unable to stop .
The CIA had been unable to assassinate its leadership .
It had also been unable to tell anyone when the terrorists had shown up in this country , even though it knew they were here .
The national leadership had been unwilling to focus on the threat for months , although repeatedly warned to do so .
And I had been unable to get either the bureaucracy or the new national leadership to act toward the terrorist network before the big attack in the way they would want to respond after thousands of Americans had been murdered .
The American people had a right to know what the failures were that led to 9/11 and why they occurred .
I tried to tell that story as I saw it , stretching over more than two decades , in Against All Enemies , a book I wrote two years after the attack .
Then the 9/11 Commission was forced into existence by the victims ' families .
Its report and staff studies looked at what had happened from a number of perspectives and uncovered new information .
Since then several authors and analysts have added further detail .
On that horrific day in September , while trying to make the machinery of government work in the minutes and hours after the attack , I suppressed my anger at al Qaeda , at the U.S. government , at myself .
There was an urgent job to be done that day .
But in one brief moment of catching my breath , I was consoled by my colleague Roger Cressey , who noted that now , finally , all of our plans to destroy al Qaeda and its network of organizations would be implemented .
The nation would deal seriously and competently with the problem .
I assumed he was right and got back to work .
It turned out he was wrong .
Incredibly , after 9/11 our government failed us even more , much more .
" 9/11 changed everything . "
That was the remark we heard over and over again in the years that followed .
It was only partially true .
9/11 did not change the Constitution , although some have acted as if it did .
Nor did the government 's response to the attacks make us more secure .
Though a great deal of activity has taken place , al Qaeda the organization and al Qaeda the movement still threaten the United States .
We still have significant vulnerabilities at home .
And abroad , we have far fewer friends and far more enemies than on 9/12 .
By the second anniversary of the attack on America , the United States had invaded and occupied two Islamic nations , created an Orwellian - sounding new bureaucracy , launched a spending spree of unprecedented proportions , and was systematically shredding international law and our own Constitution .
Despite our frenzy , or in many cases because of it , the problem we sought to address , violent Islamist extremism , was getting worse .
Much of what our government did after 9/11 , at home and abroad , departed from our values and identity as a nation .
It was also massively counterproductive .
Our government failed us before and after 9/11 , and it continues to do so today .
Indeed , as this book unfolds you will see how I believe that we have been failing at important national security missions for a long time .
Sometimes , as perhaps proved by the end of the Cold War , we succeed despite ourselves , like a student who makes it by even with some failing grades and incompletes .
But the failures are piling high and we are not correcting them ; in some cases we are making them worse .
And there are new challenges that , like al Qaeda before 9/11 , we know are coming and are not addressing sufficiently or successfully .
Though al Qaeda still exists and is growing stronger , there are new risks in cyberspace and from climate change .
What is wrong that we cannot become sufficiently motivated and agreed as a nation to address known threats before they become disasters ?
Why do we accept costly chronic problems whose cumulative effects are far greater than those of the well - known disasters ?
The conduct of sustained , large - scale , complex operations , such as Iraq
The collection and analysis of national security information by the " intelligence community "
Dealing with violent Islamist extremism , or " the global war on terrorism "
Domestic security risk management , or " homeland security "
Global climate change and national energy policy including the security effects
The migration of control systems and records into the unsafe environment of networked systems , or " cyberspace security "
This book is , as was Against All Enemies , a personal story , one told by reference to my experiences as I remember them and to the many personalities I have encountered along the way as a Pentagon analyst , a State Department manager , a White House national security official , and now as a private citizen .
In the weeks before we invaded Iraq , I left government after thirty years in national security under five Republican and two Democratic presidents .
I have since been teaching , writing , and traveling about the country and around the world consulting on security issues .
My time in government and since provides me with a special perspective and , no doubt , distinct prejudices .
One of those prejudices , which you will soon detect , is that I think that on issues of national security our government can and must work well .
Before we begin this analysis of the systemic problems of U.S. national security management , perhaps I should reveal how that belief was shaped and formed .
As a child in the 1950s , I was aware from my parents that government had ended the Great Depression that they had struggled through and in doing so had built infrastructure across the nation .
Government had mobilized the entire country , including my parents , to create and arm a military that had simultaneously liberated a captive Europe from Nazi rule and pushed back imperial Japan from its occupation of most of Asia and the Pacific .
My father spent four years in the Army Air Corps in the Pacific , while my mother gave up an executive assistant job in the private sector to make artillery in the Watertown Arsenal .
Along the way to wartime victory , government had organized the colossal effort that was the Manhattan Project and had given birth to the nuclear age .
In my own lifetime , government had sent the World War II veterans to school , financed their new homes , and linked the country with interstate highways .
It had created an entirely new human endeavor , space flight , had laced the skies with satellites , placed humans on the moon , and sent probes to the planets .
As an eight - year - old watching the Echo satellite move through the night sky and later following in detail the manned space flight missions , I was thrilled at what thousands of skilled and hardworking Americans , including my older cousins , were doing together , " to go to the moon and do the other things … not because they are easy , but because they are hard . "
On that bitterly cold day when John F. Kennedy was sworn in , he appealed to us to " ask what you can do for your country . "
I was an impressionable ten - year - old who believed that government service was a high calling .
The public school I was to attend a few months later led Kennedy 's inaugural parade that day , its band tramping down Pennsylvania Avenue in the snow .
When I did enroll in Boston Latin School later that year , the headmaster pointed to the names of alumni carved on the frieze above the auditorium : John Hancock , Paul Revere , Samuel Adams , Benjamin Franklin , and on through the years to more recent graduates such as President Kennedy 's father , Joseph Kennedy .
He told us that we followed in that tradition , to serve the nation .
For six formative years in that school , the lesson was repeated that public service was both demanding and a duty .
My last semester at the Latin School , the Tet Offensive made many in my graduating class think that our government was somehow getting something wrong in Vietnam , but we did not know yet how wrong .
We had seen the civil rights movement as a way in which government could do the right thing , undo the wrongs of the past .
Then , weeks after Tet , Martin Luther King , Jr. , was killed and every major American city went up in flames .
Our hopes dimmed that America would soon judge people " not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character . "
At the hour that my class walked onstage to graduate several weeks later , Robert Kennedy succumbed to wounds from an assassin 's gun .
It was a bad year : Tet , Martin , Bobby .
Our optimism was turning to anger .
As America 's experience in Vietnam devolved into debacle and tragedy , my generation saw as none had before that the great resources of the U.S. government could be mismanaged with horrific effect .
Good government was not self - executing .
Badly run , our government did not just fail , it was a highly lethal weapon capable of spawning disaster on an immense scale , ruining the lives of millions .
But as I marched in the streets of Washington to protest that war , my desire to serve in government did not diminish , it grew .
With the conceit and arrogance of youth , I thought that if those of us who had learned from the mistakes of Vietnam joined the government , we could prevent similar follies in the future .
How much more effective could we be on the inside helping to shape decisions than on the streets protesting after they were made ?
I went to work in the Pentagon in the latter days of Richard Nixon 's presidency .
There was no better place to see how government functioned .
I saw how teams of analysts pored over data , trying to make complex decisions about budgets and weapons system procurements .
Other analysts sifted through mountains of intelligence , trying to assess the threats to our nation and its forces .
And there were real threats .
Although it may now seem like a quaint and distant time , the Cold War brought real peril .
The government of the Soviet Union worked hard to undermine the United States and our allies .
Nuclear weapons flew through the air every day , only hours from their targets .
Within days of my assignment to the Pentagon 's Middle East Task Force in 1973 , the Soviet Union began moving nuclear weapons and troops in reaction to the ongoing Arab - Israeli War .
Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger ordered American forces worldwide to go on full alert .
Tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were ready to be used .
I asked a Pentagon colleague what we would do if nuclear war began .
The young Army major laughingly suggested that we go to Ground Zero , which was what the Pentagon staff called the courtyard hamburger stand , and look up to watch the missiles coming in .
( Years later I would work again with that major when he was a four - star general .
And later , a hijacked aircraft would turn part of the Pentagon a few feet away from the hamburger stand into a real Ground Zero . )
For much of the following twenty years , I worked on the Cold War , which , despite its seeming unimportance now , was a struggle far greater than what we face today .
Many years after that struggle was over , on the day Ronald Reagan died , I was driving into Berlin on the autobahn .
When I heard on the radio that he had passed , I changed my destination from the hotel to the Brandenburger Tor , where Reagan had famously said " Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall . "
( A few years after that speech , the young people of Berlin tore it down — with their hands . )
Getting there just before midnight , I saw young couples walking together , apparently oblivious that a few years before this had been no - man 's land , where once American and Soviet tanks had pointed their cannon at one another , where East Germans had been gunned down running for freedom .
Ronald Reagan and eight other American presidents , supported by tens of millions of American citizens , had prevailed .
Our conduct of the Cold War was certainly imperfect and the Soviets may have lost that struggle more than we won it .
Nonetheless , the U.S. government did both prevent nuclear war and contribute to the collapse of the opposing Communist alliance .
Doing so was complicated , expensive , and challenging .
It required a sustained , multifaceted , and coordinated effort , equal in scale to what government did in World War II .
You can see the results today , not only there in Berlin on Unter den Linden , but also on every street in America .
Nuclear missiles did not fall .
Communism did not take away our freedoms .
The American government had worked .
In the post–Cold War world , my government career gave me additional windows onto instances of government succeeding .
George H. W. Bush created an improbable diplomatic and military coalition of more than sixty nations that liberated Kuwait and reestablished an international security system .
When Bill Clinton was in office , the U.S. government–created internet burst forth , creating cyberspace and forever changing the nature of society .
His Vice President , Al Gore , sliced through bureaucracies , " reinventing government " and bringing better service with less cost and fewer government employees .
The United States spends more than a trillion dollars a year on national security , running up a national debt that could , combined with health care and retirement costs , burden the next generation and stifle economic growth in this country .
For that amount of money — indeed , for less — the American people should get far better results .
Moreover , the culture of mediocrity that is asserting itself in our national security apparatus increases the likelihood of further calamitous failures , with the personal pain and suffering that will mean for Americans and others .
I am not inherently a pessimist ; quite the opposite .
I know government has worked in these areas in the past , and I believe it can again , if we can identify what has gone wrong in each area and across the board and if we can devise initiatives and programs to overcome the entropy and decay that has set in .
This book contains my contribution to thinking about those remedial initiatives and programs .
I hope it will stimulate further contributions and debate , as well as increasing the basic recognition that there is a systemic problem in how America conducts national security .
For if we continue to operate as we do now , many more government officials will sit before investigatory panels .
Many more will have to say to victims and their loved ones , " Your government failed you . "
Aérophile´s balloon turns different colors depending on the air pollution levels , as registered by the air quality organization Airparif .
People in Paris wo n't have to look far to see the city 's air pollution levels .
A giant tethered helium balloon will display real - time reports of atmospheric pollution using an innovative lighting system , which can be seen from more than 20 km ( 12.4 miles ) away .
A company called Aérophile announced its recent launch of the gas balloon , known as the AERO30NG Aérophile 5500 model , which is located in the Parc Andre Citroën in Paris .
Aérophile manufactures tethered gas balloons as tourist and cultural attractions for places including Disney Village in Paris and the Great Park Balloon in Irvine , California .
The newest balloon , which is filled with 6,000 cubic meters of helium , will serve as both an eco-diagnostic public awareness tool as well as a tourist attraction .
Around the city , air pollution data will be collected by several sensors set up by Airparif , an organization that measures air quality in France .
Based on this data , the Aérophile balloon will display two measurements : ambient air quality and air pollution produced by auto emissions , which is measured at major traffic junctions .
The balloon 's color signifies the ambient air quality using three projectors that are located in the middle of the balloon .
For example , red signifies highly polluted air , orange for polluted , yellow for moderate , light green for clean , and green for very clean .
To display traffic pollution , a high - powered rotating laser at the base sweeps across the lower half of the balloon .
Both pollution displays will be visible day and night .
Also , Airparif will be recording the data on its Web site , along with that of 30 other European cities .
As a tourist attraction , the balloon will provide non-polluting rides for up to 30 passengers at a time .
The balloon is tethered to the ground with a movable cable controlled by a hydroelectric winch - an environmentally friendly design based on the Archimedes principle .
As Aérophile describes on its Web site , " Flight aboard a tethered gas balloon AERO30NG is a unique experience full of sensations for the passengers .
Silent and without vibration , the gondola is open to the air , allowing passengers to experience the sensation of being on a flying balcony 150 m in the sky .
A 360° panorama unfolds before them , and in a single gaze they can take in the whole landscape . "

LAST month , your columnist raved about the new generation of lean , clean diesel cars arriving belatedly in America ( “ Diesel 's second coming ” , April 4th 2008 ) , but wondered where they might find their fuel .
With oil pushing $ 120 a barrel , the diesel 's fuel - sipping charms — it delivers about 30 % more miles per gallon ( MPG ) than regular petrol — have created a shortage of diesel fuel around the world .
Soaring prices followed the shortage .
Over the past year , the average price of diesel in America has risen by 117 % — twice as fast as petrol .
It is now 20 % more expensive ( 60 - 70 cents more per gallon ) than regular gas .
Rising prices like these could easily negate diesel 's MPG advantage .
AFP
From sweet beginnings
Half of all new cars bought in Europe are diesels ; Europeans have pretty well hogged the supply of diesel fuel — from oil refineries as well as from renewable crops .
In fact , much of the biodiesel produced in the United States from soybeans and corn ( and subsidised by American taxpayers to the tune of $ 1 a gallon ) winds up in Europe , where it benefits from still further subsidies .
That 's great for farmers in the Midwest , but offers little consolation to motorists across America .
Now comes news that another major source of diesel — South - East Asia , where it 's refined from palm oil — is drying up .
Refiners throughout the region are closing biodiesel plants and canceling new ones .
Most are being priced out of the business by the soaring cost of palm oil , which has been rising even faster than crude .
With China and India getting richer , growers find they can make more money nowadays from selling palm oil for cooking rather than fuel .
Malaysia , which has enough refinery capacity to produce more than 1 m metric tons of biodiesel , turned out only 80,000 tons last year .
It 's not as though conventional oil refiners can add more diesel capacity in a hurry .
For one thing , the catalytic crackers used by refiners in America are optimised to produce as much petrol as possible — typically about 50 % of every barrel of oil , with diesel accounting for little more than 15 % .
In Europe , hydrocrackers that produce 25 % petrol and 25 % diesel are more common .
But adapting American refineries to produce more diesel will take years — Marathon Oil is one of the few expanding its diesel capacity .
In the meantime , the motor industry is pinning its hopes on biodiesel .
But growing crops for fuel instead of food is becoming politically difficult in many parts of the world .
Besides , biodiesel 's contribution using traditional crops will be modest at most .
It 's a matter of scale .
Europe has over 10 m metric tons and America around 4 m metric tons of biodiesel capacity .
Compare that with the 490 m metric tons of diesel that Europe and America consumed between them last year .
To meet just America 's one - third share would require all the arable land in the country ( some 470 m acres ) be planted with soybeans for biodiesel .
Few countries have anything like enough arable land to feed themselves and grow biofuels at the same time .
There has to be a better way .
One answer could be synthetic biology — a set of tools for building novel functions into biological systems to solve engineering problems .
To engineer a hydrocarbon like diesel , start with a fermentable sugar or starch in the usual way .
In terms of energy produced per acre of land , sugarcane is a better bet than sugar beets , corn or soybeans .
Next , forget about distillation .
It may be an old and honourable way of making alcohol , but it 's appallingly wasteful in energy terms .
Just heating the fermented broth ready for distilling into ethanol consumes around 40 % of the energy in the alcohol produced .
Instead , take a common bacterium like E. coli , which lives in the gut , or a yeast - like fungus such as Saccharomyces , which easily turns sugar into copious quantities of alcohol .
Scour the world for suitable enzymes that speed up the whole process and deliver the molecular features being sought .
Finally , tweak the enzymes to make them do their jobs better , and stitch their genes into the microbe being used as a fermentation factory .
Ten years ago such an endeavour would have been unimaginable .
But thanks to the development of cheap and fast DNA sequencing and synthesis tools , such microbial engineering is becoming routine .
Amyris Biotechnologies , a company in Emeryville , California , that spun out of the University of California at Berkeley several years ago , has pioneered a way of custom designing microbes to produce a whole range of specialised hydrocarbons — including molecules that are exact replicas of artemisinin , an anti-malarial drug , as well as fuels like petrol , diesel and aviation spirit .
The key to Amyris 's success has been a class of hydrocarbons called isoprenoids ( by - products , like synthetic rubber , that result from cracking naphtha or oil ) .
Like alcohols , isoprenoids are also found widely in plants and animals , and are actually the most common hydrocarbons produced in the human body .
Enzymes that can manipulate them are therefore fairly common .
That makes tailoring bugs to synthesise specific hydrocarbons a whole lot easier .
Unlike the biofuel produced by distilling witches brews of soybeans or corn , Amyris 's hydrocarbons are engineered to have precisely the same molecular structure as their oil - based equivalents — and are hence one - for - one replacements for fuels on the forecourt today .
As such , engines notice no difference when running on them , save for the synthetic diesel 's greater consistency and its 80 % reduction in emissions compared with petroleum diesel .
Last week , Amyris announced a deal with Crystalsev , one of Brazil 's largest ethanol distributors , to create a renewable diesel made from sugarcane .
In Brazil , where sugarcane grows like a weed , ethanol plants typically produce around nine kilowatt - hours of energy for every ton of cane crushed .
The Amyris process promises to raise that figure 20 - fold .
The aim is to have a demonstration plant up and running in Brazil by 2010 , with large - scale commercial production starting a year or two later .
Itching to replace his family 's gas guzzler with one of the new generation of super - sippers , your correspondent is finally feeling more confident that there will be enough diesel fuel to go around .
Teenager shot dead by friend in freak pigeon hunting accident
A competitive teenager caused his own death when he jumped in front of his best friend 's gun during a pigeon shoot , an inquest heard yesterday .
Alex Bailey , 18 , ran in front of Charles Page 's gun after the latter called ' my bird ' during the shoot at a barley field in Southease , East Sussex last July .
Six foot 4 Bailey , who had been drinking , died instantly when a pellet entered his head .
Tragic : Alex Bailey , 18 , caused his own death when he leaped in front of his friend 's gun
Bailey , Page and a third friend Carl Hammond were laying in the wait to kill birds in a wooden hide prior to the tragedy .
When Page spotted a bird he called it as his own , but Bailey muscled in on the shot and replied : ' No , bull , ' before stepping straight into the line of fire .
Bailey fell onto Hammond 's lap and the two boys called for help , but it was already too late .
Distraught : Charles Page , pictured at Eastbourne Coroners Court yesterday , accidentally shot Alex Bailey after his friend jumped in front of his gun
Speaking at the inquest at Eastbourne Coroners Court on Tuesday , Hammond said : ' We thought he was joking , then we asked him if he was alright .
' When police arrived Charles said : " I 'm going to prison !
I 've killed my best mate , how can I live with that ?
It should be me dead instead of him . " '
The inquest heard that a post mortem examination showed Bailey was one - and - half times the drink driving limit - but Page and Hammond said they had n't been drinking and did n't think Alex was acting drunk .
Bailey 's accountant dad , Andrew Bailey , 50 , told the inquest : ' He was a practical lad , very strong - willed but very caring .
He was a bit of a gentle giant . '
Mr Bailey said his son never showed off with his guns and believed he was very sensible and careful with firearms .
He had held a gun licence for a year .
Hammond , 18 , and Page , both from Ringmer , said Bailey had a competitive and cocky nature .
Hammond said : " He was always trying to prove himself better than anyone else . "
The trio were decoy shooting - using plastic birds to lure pigeons into their line of fire - on the day of the tragedy .
Hammond said the usual practice was that one person would call a shot , by saying ' My bird ! ' others would stand aside while the shot was taken , then it would be someone else 's go .
Shooting expert Richard Whitely told the inquest
Page should never have been standing behind his two mates , and anyone on a shoot must stand level with other people using guns .
He described the death as a tragic accident .
Around 5 pm on the day in question , the threesome , who had been shooting for less than 30 minutes agreed Hammond would shoot first , then Bailey followed by Page .
But when it was Page 's turn Bailey apparently ignored shooting protocol .
Page was aiming approximately 20 yards in the air at a bird and pulled the trigger before realising his best mate was at the wrong end of the barrel .
Coroner Alan Craze returned a verdict of misadventure , at Eastbourne Coroners Court .
He said : ' This afternoon has made it abundantly clear that there is no question of any criminal negligence in this death .
He did n't intentionally put himself in the line of fire .
' From Charles Page 's point of view this was an accident , but from Alex Bailey 's point of view I must give a verdict of misadventure . '
Speaking about shooting safety , he added : ' They must follow very very strict rules which are clearly understood beforehand and are adhered to by everyone .
' Alcohol and guns do not mix .
I do n't need to say anything more than that .
' This was a most tragic and distressing case , especially for Mr and Mrs Bailey . '
Outside the hearing , Bailey 's father refused to comment .
His son , who lived with his parents in Kingston , East Sussex , was planning to carry on studying business at college in September .
Reckless :
The coroner found Alex Bailey , who had had a gun licence for a year , had been drinking
“ Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal . ” – Henry Ford
By Leo Babauta
One of the biggest challenges in meeting any goal , whether it be related to productivity , waking early , changing a habit , exercising , or just becoming happier , is finding the motivation to stick with it .
If you can stick with a goal for long enough , you ’ll almost always get there eventually .
It just takes patience , and motivation .
Motivation is the key , but it ’s not always easy , day in and day out , to find that motivation .
What follows is a guide to motivation using what I ’ve learned over the last few years in a series of successful accomplishments , goals and habit changes .
I ’ve had many failures , but also many successes , and I ’ve learned a lot from all of them .
Motivation has been a particularly important topic of exploration for me .
What Motivation Can Achieve
What have I accomplished using these motivation methods ?
Too much to mention , just in the last 3 years : running two marathons , learning to become an early riser , losing 40 pounds , completing a triathlon , becoming vegetarian , becoming more productive , starting a successful blog , writing a book , becoming organized , simplifying my life , quitting my day job , tripling my income , eliminating my debt , and much more .
That ’s not intended to sound like bragging , but to show you what can be accomplished ( just to start ) if you find the right motivation .
How Does Motivation Work ?
Before we get into specific methods , it ’s useful to examine what motivation is , what it does , and how it works .
Motivation is what drives you toward a goal , what keeps you going when things get tough , the reason you get up early to exercise or work late to finish a project .
There are all kinds of motivations , of course , from positive to negative .
Having a boss threaten to fire you is motivation — you ’ll likely work harder to complete a project with that kind of pressure .
But I find that positive motivation works better — if it ’s something you really want to do , you ’ll do a much better job than to avoid something you do n’t want ( such as being fired ) .
So motivation , in its best form , is a way for you to want to do something .
There may be times , for example , when you do n’t feel like getting up early , and in those times you may seriously just want to sleep in ( not that there ’s anything wrong with that ) .
But if you have a reason to want to get up early , something you really really want to do , you ’ll jump up out of bed with excitement .
The best motivation , then , is a way for you to really want something , to get excited about it , to be passionate about it .
Remember that , as there are many other types of motivation ( especially negative ) , but in my experience , this is the kind that works the best .
There is only so long that you can go trying to motivate yourself to do something you do n’t like to do , something you do n’t want to do .
But if you find ways to really want to do something , you can sustain your effort for much , much longer .
8 Ways to Motivate Yourself From the Beginning
I ’ve found that it ’s important to start out with the right motivation , because a good start can build momentum that you can sustain for a long time .
If you start out right , you have a much better chance of succeeding .
Here are some tips for starting out :
Start small .
I ’ve said this before , but that ’s because it ’s one of the most important tips in motivating yourself toward a goal .
Do n’t start out big !
Start out with a ridiculously easy goal , and then grow from there .
If you want to exercise , for example , you may be thinking that you have to do these intense workouts 5 days a week .
No — instead , do small , tiny , baby steps .
Just do 2 minutes of exercise .
I know , that sounds wimpy .
But it works .
Commit to 2 minutes of exercise for one week .
You may want to do more , but just stick to 2 minutes .
It ’s so easy , you ca n’t fail .
Do it at the same time , every day .
Just some crunches , 2 pushups , and some jogging in place .
Once you ’ve done 2 minutes a day for a week , increase it to 5 , and stick with that for a week .
In a month , you ’ll be doing 15 - 20 .
Want to wake up early ?
Do n’t think about waking at 5 a.m.
Instead , think about waking 10 minutes earlier for a week .
That ’s all .
Once you ’ve done that , wake 10 minutes earlier than that .
Baby steps .
One goal .
Too many people start with too many goals at once , and try to do too much .
And it saps energy and motivation .
It ’s probably the most common mistake that people make .
You cannot maintain energy and focus ( the two most important things in accomplishing a goal ) if you are trying to do two or more goals at once .
It ’s not possible — I ’ve tried it many times .
You have to choose one goal , for now , and focus on it completely .
I know , that ’s hard .
Still , I speak from experience .
You can always do your other goals when you ’ve accomplished your One Goal .
Examine your motivation .
Know your reasons .
Give them some thought … and write them down .
If you have loved ones , and you are doing it for them , that is more powerful than just doing it for self - interest .
Doing it for yourself is good too , but you should do it for something that you REALLY REALLY want to happen , for really good reasons .
Really , really want it .
This is essentially the same as the above tip , but I want to emphasize it : it ’s not enough to think it would be cool to achieve something .
It has to be something you ’re passionate about , something you ’re super excited about , something you want deeply .
Make sure that your goal meets these criteria , or you wo n’t stick with it for long .
Commit publicly .
None of us likes to look bad in front of others .
We will go the extra mile to do something we ’ve said publicly .
For example , when I wanted to run my first marathon , I started writing a column about it in my local daily newspaper .
The entire island of Guam ( pop. 160 K ) knew about my goal .
I could n’t back down , and even though my motivation came and went , I stuck with it and completed it .
Now , you do n’t have to commit to your goal in your daily newspaper , but you can do it with friends and family and co-workers , and you can do it on your blog if you have one .
And hold yourself accountable — do n’t just commit once , but commit to giving progress updates to everyone every week or so .
Get excited .
Well , it starts with inspiration from others ( see above ) , but you have to take that excitement and build on it .
For me , I ’ve learned that by talking to my wife about it , and to others , and reading as much about it as possible , and visualizing what it would be like to be successful ( seeing the benefits of the goal in my head ) , I get excited about a goal .
Once I ’ve done that , it ’s just a matter of carrying that energy forward and keeping it going .
Build anticipation .
This will sound hard , and many people will skip this tip .
But it really works .
It helped me quit smoking after many failed attempts .
If you find inspiration and want to do a goal , do n’t start right away .
Many of us will get excited and want to start today .
That ’s a mistake .
Set a date in the future — a week or two , or even a month — and make that your Start Date .
Mark it on the calendar .
Get excited about that date .
Make it the most important date in your life .
In the meantime , start writing out a plan .
And do some of the steps below .
Because by delaying your start , you are building anticipation , and increasing your focus and energy for your goal .
Print it out , post it up .
Print out your goal in big words .
Make your goal just a few words long , like a mantra ( ” Exercise 15 mins .
Daily ” ) , and post it up on your wall or refrigerator .
Post it at home and work .
Put it on your computer desktop .
You want to have big reminders about your goal , to keep your focus and keep your excitement going .
A picture of your goal ( like a model with sexy abs , for example ) also helps .
20 Ways to Sustain Motivation When You ’re Struggling
The second half of motivation is to keep yourself going when you do n’t feel the same excitement as you did in the beginning .
Perhaps something new has come into your life and your old goal is n’t as much of a priority anymore .
Perhaps you skipped a day or two and now you ca n’t get back into it .
Perhaps you screwed up and got discouraged .
If you can get yourself excited again , and keep going , you ’ll get there eventually .
But if you give up , you wo n’t .
It ’s your choice — accomplish the goal , or quit .
Here ’s how you can stop from quitting , and get to your goal :
Hold yourself back .
When I start with a new exercise program , or any new goal really , I am rarin ’ to go .
I am full of excitement , and my enthusiasm knows no boundaries .
Nor does my sense of self - limitation .
I think I can do anything .
It ’s not long before I learn that I do have limitations , and my enthusiasm begins to wane .
Well , a great motivator that I ’ve learned is that when you have so much energy at the beginning of a program , and want to go all out — HOLD BACK .
Do n’t let yourself do everything you want to do .
Only let yourself do 50 - 75 percent of what you want to do .
And plan out a course of action where you slowly increase over time .
For example , if I want to go running , I might think I can run 3 miles at first .
But instead of letting myself do that , I start by only running a mile .
When I ’m doing that mile , I ’ll be telling myself that I can do more !
But I do n’t let myself .
After that workout , I ’ll be looking forward to the next workout , when I ’ll let myself do 1.5 miles .
I keep that energy reined in , harness it , so that I can ride it even further .
Just start .
There are some days when you do n’t feel like heading out the door for a run , or figuring out your budget , or whatever it is you ’re supposed to do that day for your goal .
Well , instead of thinking about how hard it is , and how long it will take , tell yourself that you just have to start .
I have a rule that I just have to put on my running shoes and close the door behind me .
After that , it all flows naturally .
It ’s when you ’re sitting in your house , thinking about running and feeling tired , that it seems hard .
Once you start , it is never as hard as you thought it would be .
This tip works for me every time .
Stay accountable .
If you committed yourself publicly , through an online forum , on a blog , in email , or in person … stay accountable to that group of people .
Commit to report back to them daily , or something like that , and stick to it !
That accountability will help you to want to do well , because you do n’t want to report that you ’ve failed .
Squash negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones .
This is one of the most important motivation skills , and I suggest you practice it daily .
It ’s important to start monitoring your thoughts , and to recognize negative self - talk .
Just spend a few days becoming aware of every negative thought .
Then , after a few days , try squashing those negative thoughts like a bug , and then replacing them with a corresponding positive thought .
Squash , “ This is too hard ! ” and replace it with , “ I can do this !
If that wimp Leo can do it , so can I ! ”
It sounds corny , but it works .
Really .
Think about the benefits .
Thinking about how hard something is is a big problem for most people .
Waking early sounds so hard !
Just thinking about it makes you tired .
But instead of thinking about how hard something is , think about what you will get out of it .
For example , instead of thinking about how hard it is to wake early , focus on how good you ’ll feel when you ’re done , and how your day will be so much better .
The benefits of something will help energize you .
Get excited again !
Think about why you lost your excitement … then think about why you were excited in the first place .
Can you get that back ?
What made you want to do the goal ?
What made you passionate about it ?
Try to build that up again , refocus yourself , get energized .
Read about it .
When I lose motivation , I just read a book or blog about my goal .
It inspires me and reinvigorates me .
For some reason , reading helps motivate and focus you on whatever you ’re reading about .
So read about your goal every day , if you can , especially when you ’re not feeling motivated .
Find like - minded friends .
Staying motivated on your own is tough .
But if you find someone with similar goals ( running , dieting , finances , etc. ) , see if they ’d like to partner with you .
Or partner with your spouse , sibling or best friend on whatever goals they ’re trying to achieve .
You do n’t have to be going after the same goals — as long as you are both pushing and encouraging each other to succeed .
Other good options are groups in your area ( I ’m part of a running club , for example ) or online forums where you can find people to talk to about your goals .
Read inspiring stories .
Inspiration , for me , comes from others who have achieved what I want to achieve , or who are currently doing it .
I read other blogs , books , magazines .
I Google my goal , and read success stories .
Zen Habits is just one place for inspiration , not only from me but from many readers who have achieved amazing things .
I love , love , love reading success stories too .
Build on your successes .
Every little step along the way is a success — celebrate the fact that you even started !
And then did it for two days !
Celebrate every little milestone .
Then take that successful feeling and build on it , with another baby step .
Add 2 - 3 minutes to your exercise routine , for example .
With each step ( and each step should last about a week ) , you will feel even more successful .
Make each step really , really small , and you wo n’t fail .
After a couple of months , your tiny steps will add up to a lot of progress and a lot of success .
Just get through the low points .
Motivation is not a constant thing that is always there for you .
It comes and goes , and comes and goes again , like the tide .
But realize that while it may go away , it does n’t do so permanently .
It will come back .
Just stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back .
In the meantime , read about your goal , ask for help , and do some of the other things listed here until your motivation comes back .
Get help .
It ’s hard to accomplish something alone .
When I decided to run my marathon , I had the help of friends and family , and I had a great running community on Guam who encouraged me at 5 K races and did long runs with me .
When I decided to quit smoking , I joined an online forum and that helped tremendously .
And of course , my wife Eva helped every step of the way .
I could n’t have done these goals without her , or without the others who supported me .
Find your support network , either in the real world or online , or both .
Chart your progress .
This can be as simple as marking an X on your calendar , or creating a simple spreadsheet , or logging your goal using online software .
But it can be vastly rewarding to look back on your progress and to see how far you ’ve come , and it can help you to keep going — you do n’t want to have too many days without an X !
Now , you will have some bad marks on your chart .
That ’s OK .
Do n’t let a few bad marks stop you from continuing .
Strive instead to get the good marks next time .
Reward yourself often .
For every little step along the way , celebrate your success , and give yourself a reward .
It helps to write down appropriate rewards for each step , so that you can look forward to those rewards .
By appropriate , I mean 1 ) it ’s proportionate to the size of the goal ( do n’t reward going on a 1 - mile run with a luxury cruise in the Bahamas ) ; and 2 ) it does n’t ruin your goal — if you are trying to lose weight , do n’t reward a day of healthy eating with a dessert binge .
It ’s self - defeating .
Go for mini - goals .
Sometimes large or longer - term goals can be overwhelming .
After a couple weeks , we may lose motivation , because we still have several months or a year or more left to accomplish the goal .
It ’s hard to maintain motivation for a single goal for such a long time .
Solution : have smaller goals along the way .
Get a coach or take a class .
These will motivate you to at least show up , and to take action .
It can be applied to any goal .
This might be one of the more expensive ways of motivating yourself , but it works .
And if you do some research , you might find some cheap classes in your area , or you might know a friend who will provide coaching or counseling for free .
Never skip two days in a row .
This rule takes into account our natural tendency to miss days now and then .
We are not perfect .
So , you missed one day … now the second day is upon you and you are feeling lazy … tell yourself NO !
You will not miss two days in a row !
Use visualization .
Visualize your successful outcome in great detail .
Close your eyes , and think about exactly how your successful outcome will look , will feel , will smell and taste and sound like .
Where are you when you become successful ?
How do you look ?
What are you wearing ?
Form as clear a mental picture as possible .
Now here ’s the next key : do it every day .
For at least a few minutes each day .
This is the only way to keep that motivation going over a long period of time .
Be aware of your urges to quit , and overcome them .
We all have urges to stop , but they are mostly unconscious .
One of the most powerful things you can do is to start being more conscious of those urges .
A good exercise is to go through the day with a little piece of paper and put a tally mark for each time you get an urge .
It simply makes you aware of the urges .
Then have a plan for when those urges hit , and plan for it beforehand , and write down your plan , because once those urges hit , you will not feel like coming up with a plan .
Find pleasure again .
No one can stick to something for long if they find it unpleasant , and are only rewarded after months of toil .
There has to be fun , pleasure , joy in it , every day , or you wo n’t want to do it .
Find those pleasurable things — the beauty of a morning run , for example , or the satisfaction in reporting to people that you finished another step along the way , or the deliciousness of a healthy meal .
Regarding the iPhone Keyboard
Coming from the aptly - named BlackBerry enthusiast site CrackBerry , I was intrigued by this list of “ Top 10 Reasons the iPhone Is No BlackBerry ” .
Never having used a BlackBerry , I do n’t know as much about them as I ’d like — I ’m generally wary of spouting off regarding things I ’ve never used .
But this list is weak sauce .
A few items are reasonable — e.g. , video recording , 1 VOIP for Wi -Fi , and GPS — but they ’re also exactly the sort of things the iPhone seems likely to support in the not - so - distant future .
( VOIP for Wi-Fi seems like a sure thing once the iPhone App Store hits the street . )
Other items on the list are just sad — # 10 is that the iPhone is harder to use one - handed and therefore not usable while driving a car .
And # 1 , bafflingly , is “ The iPhone Third - Party Apps Debacle ” :
Sure the iPhone SDK has been released , and there might be some great apps in the works , but in my opinion , that ’s too little , too late , as they say .
Methinks Al Sacco , the author of this CrackBerry list , is deeply misinformed regarding the imminent iPhone apps market , but we ’ll know the answer for certain in a few short weeks , so there ’s no use spilling pixels over it here .
The item on the list that interests me is # 2 , regarding the iPhone ’s lack of a physical keyboard — clearly a fundamental difference between the two platforms , and a subject of debate ever since the iPhone was unveiled .
One thing worth noting is that there does n’t seem to be any measurable demand at all from current iPhone owners for a physical keyboard on future iPhone hardware .
My own opinion is simply that the iPhone keyboard works a lot better than I expected it to .
But , never having owned a phone or PDA with a BlackBerry - style QWERTY keyboard , I ’m in no position to compare .
This , to me , is the question :
What do iPhone owners who do have experience using phones with physical keyboards think ?
So I asked just that on Twitter , generating two threads of replies : here and here .
I encourage you to read them yourself .
The general consensus :
It really does take a week or so to get the hang of the iPhone keyboard , and about a month to get good at it .
Most admit the iPhone ’s keyboard is n’t quite as good as a physical one , but once used to it , it ’s good enough to be happy .
A few claim to type faster on the iPhone .
A handful , like Dori Smith and Alex King , admit to still using both regularly , and those people tend to like the iPhone keyboard the least .
( I suspect the only way for someone accustomed to a BlackBerry - style keyboard to get used to the iPhone keyboard is to switch full - time .
The necessary muscle memory is too different . )
In short , even iPhone users who previously owned phones with physical keyboards seem happy .
But here ’s the rub : if it takes a week of use to get the hang of the iPhone keyboard and a month to get good at it , how does Apple convince a current BlackBerry / Treo / Sidekick / BlackJack / whatever owner who is particularly skeptical about the keyboard ?
A few minutes pecking away on a demo unit in an Apple Store are likely to yield disappointing results .
E.g. , Laura Lemay , who responded thusly :
Do you want actual iPhone switchers , or people like me who really want to like the keyboard but do n’t and therefore wo n’t switch ?
That ’s not to say that everyone who wo n’t switch because of the iPhone ’s keyboard would , if they did switch , grow to like it .
The point is that some who would will never know because they wo n’t buy an iPhone in the first place because they do n’t think that they would .
“ It takes a couple of weeks to get used to it ” means you ’ve got to take it on faith .
In the grand scheme of things , the pocket of iPhone resistance comprising people currently using physical - keyboard phones is not that big a deal .
Apple is looking at the iPhone market as iPod - sized : 100 million phones in the next five years or so .
The grand total of existing smartphone users pales in comparison .
Even if there ’s not a single already - using - a - smartphone user left who is going to switch to an iPhone , it would n’t prevent the iPhone from being a mass market success .
Most iPhone users — and especially most future iPhone users — are coming from regular mobile phones with numeric keypads .
And no one can argue that typing on the iPhone does n’t beat the pants off gimmicks like T9 .
But , in the near term , I do think Apple covets BlackBerry switchers in particular .
Everything about the enterprise features that Apple has announced for the upcoming iPhone 2.0 software seems catered to appeal to BlackBerry users .
The keyboard is perhaps the single biggest advantage RIM has with these customers .
I do not think Apple is going to release an iPhone with a physical keyboard ( “ iPhone Enterprise ” ? ) , but if they did , it ’d be one of those Steve Jobs “ a year ago he said these things were crap and now he ’s telling us this one ’s awesome just because it ’s from Apple ” moves that drive some people — bless their hearts — spittle - flying - out - of - their - mouths crazy .

The Marvel universe is set to implode Friday , with a slew of crossover cameos and throwback references in The Incredible Hulk .
[ Spoilers ahead ]
Not only will Robert Downey Jr. reprise his role as billionaire Tony Stark with a lengthy cameo in the film , but further whetting the * Avengers * appetite is an appearance by Captain America .
And it 's likely to be more substantial than the measly millisecond glimpse of a shield ( barely ) seen in Iron Man .
In a recent interview with G4's Attack of the Show , Incredible Hulk director Louis Leterrier hinted at the superhero 's cameo , saying :
" As a filmmaker and as a fan , I like to go see movies and watch them several times ... and every time I see it , discover little things in the background .
Did you know that in Iron Man , Captain
America 's shield can be found somewhere ?
Well in Hulk you might see
Captain America himself ! "
And as an extra head nod to the franchise , Lou Ferrigno , who starred as the mean green machine in the ' 70s television show , voicesthe growlings and occasional " Hulk smash ! " in the upcoming movie – a bit ironic , since Hulk rarely spoke in the televised series .
Nonetheless , it 's this type of acknowledgment to the comic 's lore that 'll get Hulk fans into theaters to see the film , myself included , despite the foreboding reluctance of Ed Norton ( who plays Dr. Bruce Banner ) to promote the movie .

Attribute to The Libertarian Enterprise
Yesterday , I was re-reading " Preparing the Battlefield , " by Seymour M. Hersh who writes for the New Yorker magazine .
His article gives extensive details about Bush and Cheney activities in support of Iranian opposition groups .
Mr. Hersh notes , " The Administration may have been willing to rely on dissident organizations in Iran even when there was reason to believe that the groups had operated against American interests in the past .
The use of Baluchi elements , for example , is problematic , Robert Baer , a former CIA clandestine officer who worked for nearly two decades in South Asia and the Middle East , told me .
" ' The Baluchis are Sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in Tehran , but you can also describe them as Al Qaeda , ' Baer told me .
' These are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers in this case , it 's Shiite Iranians .
The irony is that we 're once again working with Sunni fundamentalists , just as we did in Afghanistan in the nineteen - eighties . '
Ramzi Yousef , who was convicted for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center , and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who is considered one of the leading planners of the September 11th attacks , are Baluchi Sunni fundamentalists . "
Another group the Bush and Cheney team have found to support in Iran is the Iranian People 's Resistance Movement .
" This is a vicious Salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the Taliban and Pakistani extremists .
They are suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture , " according to Vali Nasr who teaches international politics at Tufts University , and is quoted by Hersh .
Hersh continues , " The CIA and Special Operations communities also have long - standing ties to ... the Mujahideen - e - Khalq , known in the West as the MEK .... The MEK has been on the State Department 's terrorist list for more than a decade , yet in recent years the group has received arms and intelligence , directly or indirectly , from the United States .
Some of the newly authorized covert funds , the Pentagon consultant told me , may well end up in MEK coffers . "
Talk about irony , the analysts at Global Security say that MEK was allied with the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq and chiefly funded by Saddam .
http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/mek.htm
That same article identifies the MEK as one of the groups that took part in the 1979 hostage crisis .
Yes , the Bush - Cheney government is so determined to start a war with Iran that they are funding a group that was involved in seizing the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and holding Americans as hostages for 444 days .
Is n't that treason ?
Yes , that is treason .
The constitution defines treason as , " Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them , or in adhering to their Enemies , giving them Aid and Comfort .
No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act , or on Confession in open Court . "
If the group that was among those who took Americans hostage in 1979 , was allied with the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003 , and is on the terrorist watch list of the State Department is not among the enemies of the United States , who is ?
Mind you , there has not been a declaration of war in this country since 8 December 1941 , presumably because the government likes to confuse the issue of who might be enemies .
Unless you count the war on drugs and the war on terror , that is .
In both cases , the Bush and Cheney government has been levying war against the United States and the American people .
The constitution gives the government no power to prohibit alcohol , marijuana , or any other substance , ever since Prohibition was repealed .
Yet the war on drugs imprisons millions of Americans , denies them post conviction liberties such as voting or gun possession , and makes war on Americans in our city streets .
The same is true of the war on terror , which is prosecuted not against foreigners in other countries , but against Americans , here , in our airports , in our cities , through domestic espionage operations , and in many other ways .
If you are going to take the side of George Bush and Dick Cheney in this controversy , you are saying that the American people are the enemies of the United States , and the people who took hostages in the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979 are not .
If you side with Bush and Cheney in this matter of their treason , you are saying that the allies of Saddam Hussein in the recent war are not enemies of the United States , but Americans who fly on commercial airlines are .
The Bush and Cheney regime is levying war against the American people .
The Bush and Cheney " covert " operations in Iran are giving military and financial aid and comfort to the enemies of the United Statesenemies the Bush / Cheney administration itself has identified .
Their own state department says these guys are terrorists , and they say the country is in a war on terror .
It is long past time for impeachment hearings .
It is long past time for the Democratic party controlled Congress to stand up for freedom and against the brutality , torture , and treason of the Bush and Cheney government .
Given that the Republicans and Democrats have all sold their souls to the devil , I suggest you vote for one of the many libertarians endorsed by the Boston Tea Party this year .
As Ron Paul has noted , in his recent book , it is time for a revolution .
John McCain ’s presidential campaign manager , Rick Davis , has lobbied for the mortgage giants .
Fannie , Freddie spent $ 200 M to buy influence
If you want to know how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have survived scandal and crisis , consider this :
Over the past decade , they have spent nearly $ 200 million on lobbying and campaign contributions .
But the political tentacles of the mortgage giants extend far beyond their checkbooks .
Advertisement
The two government - chartered companies run a highly sophisticated lobbying operation , with deep - pocketed lobbyists in Washington and scores of local Fannie - and Freddie - sponsored homeowner groups ready to pressure lawmakers back home .
They ’ve stacked their payrolls with top Washington power brokers of all political stripes , including Republican John McCain ’s presidential campaign manager , Rick Davis ; Democrat Barack Obama ’s original vice presidential vetter , Jim Johnson ; and scores of others now working for the two rivals for the White House .
Fannie and Freddie ’s aggressive political maneuvering has helped stave off increased regulation and preserve special benefits such as exemption from state and local income taxes and the ability to borrow at low rates .
When their stock prices took a dive last week , their government allies extended another helping hand with a plan for the Treasury Department , the Federal Reserve and , possibly , Congress to shore up the companies .
The housing crisis is sure to linger into the next administration , when the mortgage companies will inevitably be well - represented — no matter who ’s in the White House .
Fannie and Freddie ’s political contacts exist deep in the two presidential campaigns .
At least 20 McCain fundraisers have lobbied on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , netting at least $ 12.3 million in fees over the past nine years .
Political insiders Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. , picked by McCain to vet his vice presidential nominees , and Jim Johnson , picked by Obama to perform the same function , once worked for the mortgage giants .
And for years , Rick Davis served as president of an advocacy group led by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that defended the two companies against increased regulation .
So far this election cycle , Freddie Mac ’s political action committee and employees have contributed $ 555,567 to Senate and House candidates , and Fannie Mae ’s PAC and employees have given more than $ 1.1 million , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
In total , the two companies have spent $ 170 million on lobbying over the past decade , according to the Center , although they have scaled back in recent years .
Last year , they paid $ 14.1 million in lobbying fees , a significant decrease from a high of more than $ 26 million in 2004 .
The connections of both campaigns to the well - entrenched mortgage companies highlight the difficulties the candidates face in selling voters on an outsider message .
McCain ’s campaign denied that its political connections have affected his view on the issue .
“ I have written every word that has to do with Fannie and Freddie in this campaign , and I do n’t know who the people are that are linked to the companies , ” said McCain ’s economic adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin .
“ Sen . McCain has favored GSE reform in the past and continues to favor GSE reform , ” Holtz - Eakin said .
“ That ’s unchanged . ”
McCain has called the government ’s weekend intervention in the struggling companies “ correct , ” saying he hoped that the action would “ preserve the ability of Americans to obtain loans in order to buy a home and be able to afford mortgage payments they ’re having to make . ”
A spokesman for the Obama campaign declined to comment , noting only that former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson stepped down from his campaign post in June .
His resignation came in the wake of charges that he collected more then $ 7 million in home loans at special , below - average rates .
On Sunday , Obama shied away from commenting on the specific proposals , but cautioned regulators to give top priority to the interests of homeowners .
“ That should be our No. 1 priority , not just shareholders , investors or CEOs of companies , ” he said .
Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee almost half of the country ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgage debt .
Over the past few months , their shares of the housing market have grown as private companies curtailed their mortgage lending in the wake of massive subprime - related losses .
Critics have long argued that both Fannie and Freddie operated with too small a capital cushion to adequately offset financial risk .
But the mortgage giants have consistently beaten back congressional efforts to increase oversight , even after a major accounting scandal in 2003 resulted in a $ 400 million fine for Fannie .
Fannie ’s government relations operations dramatically expanded in the mid-1990s , when then - CEO Johnson recruited Washington A - listers Robert Zoellick , who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations ; Lawrence M. Small , former secretary of the Smithsonian Institution ; and William M. Daley , commerce secretary in the Clinton administration .
Johnson spearheaded an aggressive campaign to create a local grass - roots network of company advocates .
Under his leadership , Fannie opened more than 50 partnership offices in cities and rural communities .
At the same time , the Fannie Mae Foundation , a private nonprofit financed by the mortgage giant , contributed generously to local charities , arts institutions and housing organizations , giving Fannie influence in lawmakers ’ home districts .
Both Fannie and Freddie made large and visible commitments to low and moderate - income housing , quieting criticism from advocacy groups .
With the companies in trouble , their political ties are under new scrutiny .
Johnson headed Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998 , leaving with a $ 21 million payout .
Even after he left , Fannie continued to pay him an annual fee of at least $ 300,000 a year for consulting services and a $ 71,000 monthly pension , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
From 2001 to 2005 , Fannie also paid for Johnson ’s support staff , communications services and provided him a car and driver .
McCain tapped Culvahouse , the former Reagan administration official , to head his search for a running mate .
Currently a partner at O’Melveny & Myers , Culvahouse lobbied on behalf of Fannie Mae in 1999 , 2003 and 2004 , according to Senate records .
The campaign connections to the two mortgage companies go far beyond vice presidential vetters .
McCain campaign manager Davis headed the Homeownership Alliance , a lobbying association that included Fannie , Freddie , nonprofit groups , real estate agents , homebuilders and consumer advocates .
The group ’s stated goal was to increase affordable housing .
But it also worked to oppose congressional efforts to tighten controls on Fannie and Freddie .
In July 2003 , Davis wrote to the American Banker , taking issue with an opinion piece by Leslie Paige of Citizens Against Government Waste , arguing that Fannie and Freddie should operate with greater transparency .
“ Several of Ms. Paige ’s assertions bear correction , ” Davis wrote , defending Fannie and Freddie on behalf of the group .
“ The GSEs are subject to an innovative and stringent risk - based capital stress test — the toughest in the financial services industry . ”
Other McCain aides with ties to the two companies include economic adviser Aquiles Suarez , who worked as Fannie ’s director of government and industry relations ; congressional liaison John Green , who lobbied for Fannie from 2004 to 2007 ; and finance co-chairman Frederic V. Malek , a former Freddie board member .
Jamie S. Gorelick , deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration and a chief policy adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton , is rumored to be a possible attorney general in an Obama administration .
She was vice chairman of Fannie Mae and sat on its board of directors .
A free concert at New York ’s River 2 River Festival on July 4 saw headliners Sonic Youth unleash an intense performance ,
which Thurston Moore kicked off by charging the photographers in front ofthe stage with his guitar .
Moore sent them stumbling , his guitar cord wrapped around several ofthem like a giant , feedback - generating lasso ( more on this below ) .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Why was Moore so angry with those photographers ?
An article I readlast week but , frustratingly , ca n’t seem to find today may have hadsomething to do with it .
That article included Sonic
Youth on a list of bands that shouldcall it quits , citing Kim Gordon ’s age as a factor .
I really wish I
could find it in order to point out how misguided the article was , butmaybe it ’s better not to send people there anyway ,
because it was obviously designed to draw attention by making preposterous claims .
Moore ’s comments convinced me that he was upset with thepress / photographers in the front section because of that article ’stwisted logic .
He introduced Kim Gordon by saying , " I do n’t wanna …
Kim Gordon , the most beautiful woman in ( inaudible ) . "
Then , in betweenencores , he said , " This song ’s for all the old people .
Old as gold . "
As ludicrous as that article was , fans might have ample reason to keep Thurston Moore angry ,
considering how he played on Friday : as if his band depended on it .
The band kept the rainclouds mostly at baythroughout their late afternoon set using some of their most powerful material ( standouts included " Bull in the Heather " and " Silver Rocket , " streamable below ) , made even stronger by Moore ’s stormy mood .
The below photo gallery shows how the afternoon played out ( opening band : The Feelies ) , including oneblurry shot taken shortly before Moore stepped on our photographer ’sfoot during the fracas :
Bull in the Heather – Sonic Youth
The crowd bats around beach balls in anticipation .
Lee Ranaldo would soon give one of these a pretty solid boot from the front of the stage :

Kim rocked a snake print dress , Thurston a red guitar , white shirt , and blue jeans for this Fourth of July show .
If it was n’t already clear from my description above , Sonic Youth was on fire :
A man on a mission :
The calm before the storm :
Things start to go haywire … much jostling as Moore draws near the photographers :
It ’s on :
With a group of photographers ensnared in a big loop of guitar cable , Moore rocks out and grinds his guitar against the edge of the stage .
According to our photographer , the photographers all had " giant smiles on their faces " as this was going on , and nobody seemed to have been injured or anything like that .
However , Moore did step on our photographer ’s foot , and her hands were still shaking from the encounter fifteen minutes later :
Moore gets a helping hand back onto the stage :

No harm , no foul ; Lee Ranaldo , Mark Ibold and Thurston Moore crack up following Moore ’s foray into the audience :

You 've been the only neighbor in my building to actually look me in the eye and say " hello " since I moved here two years ago .
Thank you .
When my laundry is done and you need to use the machine , instead of wadding it up and dumping it on the laundry room table I know it 's you that folds my little black panties and places them neatly back in my basket .
Thank you .
You live next door to me and I 've learned to live with your tacky plaster fish molds that sit next to your door on top of the fire alarm , probably causing a fire hazard .
It 's ok that you have awful taste .
You 're sixty years old , and you do n't wear a bra which might be why your breasts and belt are on the same parallel , but hey , you smell like my grandma so I like you regardless .
Also , is your hair naturally maroon ?
It matches your blush splendidly .
Tammy
Faye would be jealous .
Now recently I 've noticed a man that made my high school geometry teacher look like Don Juan parking behind your car in our lot .
He terrifies me and tucks his t shirts into his khaki pants that are hiked way too high up on his twinkie loving gut .
The image of you two in the same room haunts me , but please ... Please ... For the love of Sweet Baby Jesus ... STOP fucking him when I 'm home too !!
We are dealing with paper thin walls here !
I hear every little breathy " Oh yes " and your t shirt tucking friend sounds like he 's playing football instead of making love .
Do you like that grunt he makes when he comes ?
Maybe I 'm wrong , maybe you just really like to watch him pass gall stones because that 's what it sounds like he 's doing .
Gross .
Stop. Please .
Amen for getting some at your age , but honestly , I 'm gone every evening from 5:30 to midnight .
Can you do it then ?
Sincerely , Your Neighbor
This is Private First Class LaVena Johnson of Missouri .
An honors student who nonetheless did n't quite know what she wanted to do with her life , she enlisted in the Army right out of high school in 2003 and was sent to Iraq , where she died .
When the Army returned her mutilated body to her grieving parents as a suicide , her dad , Dr. John Johnson , said to himself and the Army coroner , " Somebody murdered my daughter and you picked the wrong person to fuck with . "
Fucking right .
When LaVena 's father finally brought himself to look at his daughter 's corpse in 2005 , sent home from Iraq with a report that she 'd committed suicide by shooting herself in the left side of her head with an M - 16 - which , by the way , is not a handgun but a relatively long rifle , he thought there was something wrong .
Private LaVena Johnson 's nose was broken , teeth were loose , one eye was concave and there were abrasions over her body .
The supposed M - 16 hole to the head was far too small for the revolver - sized exit wound , and was on the wrong side of her skull for a right - handed woman to have pulled the trigger .
Her genital area showed evidence of acid , perhaps used to destroy DNA evidence .
She had white military gloves glued to her burned hands .

Since then , the Army has continued to insist that the LaVena committed suicide by pointing her rifle with her non-dominant hand at the side of her head and set herself on fire , all after she beat herself up and poured acid on her genitals ( since their was no apparent investigation into whatever happened there ) .
Oh , and there was a trail of blood leading away from the tent where her body was found .
Her father has been trying for nearly 3 years to get someone - including Congress - to investigate the death of his daughter , which he feels was a cover - up or conspiracy in the manner of Pat Tillman .
Of course , he 's trying to get people to pay attention to his African - American daughter 's " suicide " and not the friendly - fire death of a white male NFL player , which is probably part of the problem .
Lara Battles , spokesperson for the House Armed Services Committee , told KMOV , " At this time the House Armed Services Committee is looking into Private Johnson 's case , but no decisions have been made for a formal investigation . "

Wondering who to contact to get that formal investigation started ?
The website dedicated to getting LaVena 's case investigated has some ideas .

Senator Barack Obama added three superdelegates to his total today , a boost that comes after he saw just a trickle of delegates go to his side in recent days .
Despite Mr. Obama ’s triumphant speech in Iowa and the buzz about the vice presidential search , the Senator had not initially capitalized on his performance in Tuesday ’s primaries , which gave him a majority of pledged delegates .
( He received only two superdelegates on Wednesday and none on Thursday ) .
But the wave seems to be building again today , as Mr. Obama picks up three additional superdelegates – and one is a switch from Mrs. Clinton .
Representative Dennis Cardoza of California cited Mrs. Clinton ’s signature campaign issue in justifying his change of sides .
From his statement :
I am deeply concerned about the contentious primary campaign and controversy surrounding the seating of delegates from Florida and Michigan – two states Democrats need to win in November .
I will not support changing the rules in the fourth quarter of this contest through some convoluted DNC rules committee process .
Yet , we must find a resolution to seat the Michigan and Florida delegates so these states ’ voters are represented at the Convention .
I believe we need to avoid this potentially divisive situation by uniting behind one nominee and bringing the party together immediately .
Therefore , I have made the decision to support Senator Obama at the Democratic Convention in my role as a super delegate .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign also announced the backing of Representative Jim Costa , also of California , and of Jenny Greenleaf , a Democratic National Committeewoman from Oregon .
( CNN ) -- The New York Times has rejected an essay that Sen. John McCain wrote defending his Iraq war policy .
Sen . John McCain wrote an op -ed for The New York Times , but the paper said it could not publish it as written .
The piece was in response to an op - ed from Sen.
Barack Obama that was published in the paper last week .
In an e-mail to the McCain campaign , Opinion Page Editor David Shipley said he could not accept the piece as written , but would be " pleased , though , to look at another draft . "
" Let me suggest an approach , " he wrote Friday .
" The Obama piece worked for me because it offered new information ( it appeared before his speech ) ; while Senator Obama discussed Senator McCain , he also went into detail about his own plans .
It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama 's piece . "
Read McCain 's rejected piece
In a statement released Monday , The New York Times said it is " standard procedure on our Op - Ed page , and that of other newspapers , to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission . "
" We look forward to publishing Senator McCain 's views in our paper just as we have in the past .
We have published at least seven Op - Ed pieces by Senator McCain since 1996 .
The New York Times endorsed Senator McCain as the Republican candidate in the presidential primaries .
We take his views very seriously , " the statement said .
McCain 's rejected op - ed was a lengthy critique of Obama 's positions on Iraq policy , particularly his view of the surge .
" Senator Obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history , " wrote McCain , criticizing Obama 's call for an early withdrawal timeline .
" I find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the Bush administration by waving the ' Mission Accomplished ' banner prematurely . "
Watch why the piece was rejected »
Obama 's July 14 essay had taken shots at McCain for not further encouraging the Iraqi government to take control of the country .
" Instead of seizing the moment and encouraging Iraqis to step up , the Bush administration and Senator McCain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of Iraq 's sovereign government , " Obama wrote in his op -ed .
" They call any timetable for the removal of American troops ' surrender , ' even though we would be turning Iraq over to a sovereign Iraqi government . "
Read Obama 's essay
Shipley , who was President Bill Clinton 's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997 , had advised the McCain campaign that " the article would have to articulate , in concrete terms , how Senator McCain defines victory in Iraq .
" It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels , timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate .
And it would need to describe the senator 's Afghanistan strategy , spelling out how it meshes with his Iraq plan . "
He added that he hoped the parties could " find a way to bring this to a happy resolution . "
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Monday the Arizona senator 's position will not change based on the " demands of the New York Times . "
" John McCain believes that victory in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground , not arbitrary timetables , " he said .
" Unlike Barack Obama , that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the New York Times . "
The newspaper endorsed McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in January , shortly before the New York primary .
In February , after it became clear McCain would be his party 's presumptive nominee , the paper published a thinly sourced report that McCain once had a close relationship with a female lobbyist .
McCain said he was disappointed in the New York Times piece .
The paper said that it stood by its reporting and that " the story speaks for itself . "
McCain 's campaign sent out fundraising appeals based on the article .
The article " is particularly disgusting -- an un-sourced hit - and - run smear campaign designed to distract from the issues at stake in this election , " McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , wrote in a e-mail to supporters .
" We need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against the New York Times by making an immediate contribution today , " the e-mail said in text that linked to an online contribution form on the McCain campaign 's Web site .

TEHRAN -- A man wrapped in a shawl stood at the door .
“ This is Jesus , ” said another man .
Jesus sat and peeled an orange as his companion , Nader Talebzadeh , began to speak , precisely , so as not to be misunderstood on a matter so sensitive .
The Iranian director ’s new film is based on the Islamic version of the life of Jesus , depicting the man Christians believe to be the messiah and son of God as a tormented Judean prophet foretelling the coming of Muhammad , the founder of the Muslim faith .
One might imagine such a tale may not screen well in the red states of America .
The film , nearly 10 years in the making , draws on the Koran and the putative Gospel of Barnabas , considered by many Western scholars a medieval fable .
The premise of “ Jesus , the Spirit of God ” is that Jesus was compassionate and performed miracles , but was not crucified or resurrected from the dead .
The message implies that Christianity , a faith of 2 billion people and the core of much Western philosophy , is based on a falsehood .
“ I pray for Christians .
They ’ve been misled .
They will realize one day the true story , ” said Talebzadeh , whose film has been screened at international film festivals and is being marketed for wider release .
“ People might use this film as a strategy to further demonize Iran , ” he said .
“ They may succeed .
But I hope once you see that the focus of the film is sacred , it will overwhelm .
No one would have imagined that an Iranian would make a film to glorify Jesus . ”
Not to mention an Iranian who supports President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and believes 9/11 was partly a U.S. government conspiracy .
“ Someone masterminded something , ” he said .
“ And this is the cause for a lot of evil America is doing in this part of the world . ”
There is another irony .
The actor who plays Jesus , Ahmad Soleimani - Nia , once was a soldier in the Iranian army and later a welder for Iran ’s Atomic Energy Agency , which the Bush administration accuses of pursuing nuclear weapons .
Such footnotes do n’t seem odd when talking with Talebzadeh , who has kept Nia in Jesus character -- flowing hair , beard , mystic pose -- for seven years because he never knows when he might shoot new sequences for the film .
“ Jesus , the Spirit of God ” comes out of Iran at a time of hostile rhetoric between Washington and Tehran and a divide between Islam and the West that has produced jihad websites , DVDs on the apocalypse , editorial cartoons lampooning Muhammad and a recent Osama bin Laden tape condemning Pope Benedict XVI for a “ new crusade ” against Islam .
Religion has long been at the heart of tensions between East and West , but it is being swept into a wider cultural war played out on the Internet , film and satellite TV in which icons and sacred texts have been attacked and manipulated .
A new Dutch film by a right - wing politician , who compares the Koran to Adolf Hitler ’s “ Mein Kampf , ” depicts Islam as a violent faith .
In response , a Saudi blogger posted a video suggesting that the Bible could be read as a document for war .
Talebzadeh knows that his Jesus walks on volatile terrain ; one wonders , given the tenor of the times , how many fatwas would be issued if a Western director made a film suggesting that Muhammad , whose depiction is forbidden under Islamic tradition , was someone other than the prophet .
“ There is so much wrong with this man ’s understanding of Jesus and Christianity , ” wrote an incensed Christian blogger , referring to Talebzadeh in a conversation about the film that is unfolding in cyberspace .
“ It ’s another piece of Satanic propaganda intended to accomplish no meaningful purpose in this world . ”
The rough , choppily edited $ 5 - million film , condensed from a 1,000 - minute - long series that will soon air on Iranian TV , reveres Jesus as a blessed prophet speaking parables and moving through soft light and angelic chants amid a ruckus of zealots and conspiring Pharisees .
The narrative and dialogue are attributed to Islamic teachings and Jesus ’ disciple Barnabas , whose gospel the director said was hidden by church authorities so as not to undermine the established Christian faith .
Scholars believe that the gospel , not included in the canon of the early Catholic Church , was written by others centuries later and ascribed to Barnabas .
It overlaps with the stories of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John , but it does not present Jesus as the son of God.
Barnabas ’ tale resonates with Muslims who believe that it supports the Koran ’s teaching that Jesus , though born of a virgin , was not divine , but one of the last great prophets .
Talebzadeh ’s film shows Jesus ascending to heaven before Roman soldiers come for him ; Judas , the disciple who betrays him , is transformed into the likeness of Jesus and crucified .
According to Islamic traditions , Jesus is alive and will return to defeat evil .
“ Barnabas is a missing link the world is not ready to accept .
It ’s a piece of literature we should look into , ” said Talebzadeh , a man with a graying beard who sat in his office the other day before a bowl of fruit .
Draped in a shawl and legs crossed as if in meditation , Nia -as - Jesus lingered behind Talebzadeh looking very much like a 1970s rock star .
He was quiet , serene , a former welder with a thespian calling drifting between the Koran and the New Testament .
He had never acted before , but his light skin and angular features mixed with Middle East repose conjured an aura of Western aesthetics and Eastern spirituality .
“ I ’ve never been able to resolve why I am so drawn to Jesus , ” said Nia , a Muslim born in the western mountains of Iran near Iraqi Kurdistan .
“ It goes back to when I was a boy of 7 or 8 .
I saw a painting of Leonardo da Vinci ’s ‘ Last Supper ’ and I identified with Jesus .
He has always been with me .
In my neighborhood , with my long hair and beard , I am known as Jesus . ”
Talebzadeh grew up in Iran under the reign of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi .
In 1970 , he moved to the United States , where he says he studied at American University in Washington , D.C. , and Columbia University in New York .
He witnessed a convulsive American decade of antiwar protests over Vietnam and the resignation of Richard Nixon .
For much of that time , Iran was a U.S. ally .
That changed in 1979 , when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini led an Islamic revolution that toppled the shah and resulted in 52 Americans being held hostage for 444 days .
“ I returned to Iran feeling there was a huge misunderstanding in the West about my country , ” he said .
“ Iran was being demonized . ”
Talebzadeh directed a number of documentaries on themes such as the Bosnian conflict and the Iran - Iraq war .
In 1999 , he began filming “ Jesus , the Spirit of God , ” which grew out of a passion that began decades earlier when he attended a school in Tehran with Christians and continued over his fascination with the purported writings of Barnabas .
“ If there ’s one thing in my life I wanted to do , this film is it , ” said the director , whose Jesus movie won an interfaith dialogue award at the 2007 Religion Today Film Festival in Italy .
“ I did n’t say Jesus was n’t crucified , God did .
It ’s in the Koran . . . .
The film is made with faith .
I tried to do it as beautifully as I could . ”
He added that he hoped his 35 - millimeter film would start a conversation between religions :
“ In the 21st century , the arts and the media have to create an area for more cordial discussions between faiths at a time when information is moving in the blink of an eye .
. . .
We should be joining people together , not giving distortion and misunderstanding .
We have to say , ‘ Have you looked at this door to know the truth about Jesus ? ’ ”
Some Americans have peeked through Talebzadeh ’s door .
He showed the movie to four audiences in the United States , and it was recently screened at the Philadelphia Film Festival .
He said many people were open - minded and intrigued by the historical and religious questions it raised .
“ The truth has a whole , different vibration to it , ” he said .
“ If you enhance it with artistry , you can create a discussion . ”
Not according to the website of the Worldwide Church of God in Fairfield , Calif . : “ Attempts by the Iranians or anyone else who try to deny that Jesus Christ is the true messiah will ultimately fail .
The Holy Bible confirms the death , burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ of Nazareth in numerous ways , and no amount of filmmaking or lecturing or rhetoric to the contrary can defeat that fact . ”
Nia - as - Jesus finished his orange .
Talebzadeh , whose office was warm in the afternoon sun , kept talking about the film , about divinity , about how to capture truth .
He turned in his chair toward Jesus , and was still , after all these years , amazed at the likeness , the highlighted hair , eyes of fervor .
He joked that he had been searching for his lead character for a long time when his assistant director spotted Nia on the street one day and said , “ I found your Jesus . ”
Nia - as - Jesus liked this story , happenstance leading , as he sees it , to destiny .

Mortgage lending hit a new record low in May , the Bank says
The number of new mortgages being approved for house purchase in Britain has dropped heavily for another month .
The Bank of England said 42,000 home loans were approved in May , a 28 % fall compared with the previous month and 64 % down on a year ago .
This is the lowest since the Bank began reporting the figures in 1993 and lower than many analysts ' predictions .
Mortgage lending has slumped owing to the credit crunch with institutions reducing their willingness to lend .
The number of home loans approved have now fallen for 13 consecutive months , the Bank 's figures show .
Housing market Philip Shaw , chief economist at analysts Investec , described the figures as " terrible " .
The implications of this is that the market is going to remain pretty weak for some time with a significant downward movement in house prices
Ed Stansfield
Capital Economics
" It is really symptomatic of what is going on the housing market .
The real danger is there is a knock - on effect to consumer activity , " he said .
Recent figures from the British Bankers ' Association ( BBA ) on the number of new mortgage approvals to home buyers also showed a big drop , by 20 % in May compared with April .
It blamed tighter lending criteria and a squeeze on household finances for the drop .
BBA members account for about two - thirds of total UK mortgage lending .
The Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have warned that property sales this year would fall by between 35 % and 40 % .
The Land Registry revealed last week that the number of house sales slumped by 50 % in March compared with the same month in 2007 .
' Change in attitude '
The Bank of England figures also showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals for homeowners who were remortgaging .
House price figures for June will be revealed in the next few days
That figure fell to 90,000 in May , down from 100,000 the previous month and below the monthly average over the previous six months of 104,000 .
Mortgage lending as a whole showed its weakest rise for seven years at £ 4.1 bn - some £ 3 bn down on the average for the previous six months .
The general figures were weaker than many economists had predicted .
" They are clear evidence in the change in attitude among mortgage lenders and home buyers , " said Ed Stansfield , of Capital Economics .
" People no longer want to borrow and those that do want to borrow are not being allowed to by the lenders .
" The implications of this is that the market is going to remain pretty weak for some time with a significant downward movement in house prices .
We are off the scale .
We have never been anywhere near as low as this in activity levels and mortgage approvals . "
Major lenders will reveal their house price figures for June in the next few days .
The UK 's biggest mortgage lender , the Halifax , recently suggested that UK house prices would drop by 9 % this year , a more severe fall than its previous forecast .
' Looking to save ' Bernard Clarke , of the Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) , said he expected mortgage funding to be more easily available in the next six months , but house prices would continue to fall .
" We think that house prices by the end of this year will be around 7 % lower than they were at the end of 2007 and clearly the shortage of mortgage funding is affecting demand in the house purchase market , " he said .
Meanwhile , new figures released by the Building Societies Association ( BSA ) show that lending in that sector also fell sharply in May .
Net lending by building societies in May was £ 125 m compared with £ 1.2bn in May 2007 .
Adrian Coles , director general of the BSA , said the lending figures reflected the " depressed state of the housing market " .
But he added that people are looking to save with building societies , with saving at £ 853 m in May , up from £ 608 m during the same month a year ago and the highest figure for May since 2002 .

In “ Can e-Publishing Overcome Copyright Concerns ? , ” David Pogue of the New York Times talks about why he does n’t make electronic versions of his books available , supporting his position as ebook naysayer with a blog post by an author whose voluntary payment experiment for the digital release of an outdated book was a dismal failure .
Apparently , Pogue has twice sent PDF versions of a book to someone claiming to be blind and each time , he said , the book was all over the “ piracy sites ” within 48 hours .
In a subsequent post , Pogue relayed and responded to reader comments , which spanned the gamut of opinions .
I normally appreciate what Pogue has to say in his print and email columns due to the way his technology sensibilities have been honed by years of being a Mac user .
But in this situation , and I say this with all respect due to a fellow author with whom I ’ve written a book , I disagree with him pretty much completely .
I ’m not just spouting off like some of the people commenting on his blog posts – my point of view comes as the result of selling over 150,000 ebooks with virtually no copies being shared widely .
( Ironically , despite Pogue saying that he does n’t make electronic versions of his Missing Manuals available , a quick scan of O’Reilly Media ’s
Web site showed that 5 of his 24 books are in fact for sale in PDF format .
When I asked him about this , he admitted that he knew that “ iPhone : The Missing Manual ” had been released in PDF to get it to market faster last year .
Three of the others were older books , and he was surprised to learn that “ Windows XP Home Edition : The Missing Manual , Second Edition ” was available in PDF .
This lack of awareness is understandable : the royalty statements for a print - book author as prolific as Pogue are undoubtedly voluminous and may be nearly incomprehensible . )
Sourcing Copies — Implicit in Pogue ’s claim that his kind - hearted gesture twice resulted in copies of his ebooks being shared widely is the belief that had he not provided those PDFs to the scammers ( we ’ll assume they were scammers , and not people who legitimately needed an electronic copy for use with screen - reading software ) , no copies would have been shared , there being no other way to get them .
This sounds like the flawed reasoning that the music industry used for so long to block online sales of digital music – they wanted to keep music restricted to the physical medium of the CD , ignoring the fact that there was already a commonly used path for music to move online : by being ripped from CD into MP3 .
It ’s much harder to scan a physical book into PDF format , but there are other ways for a print book to move into a digital format .
O’Reilly Media , which publishes the Missing Manual series that Pogue started , is a partner in Safari Books Online , a joint venture with Pearson that gives subscribers access to a large selection of books .
Books can be read only online , but because most are converted to an XML format for use within Safari Books Online , people have apparently figured out how to extract the content and turn it into other formats , most notably Microsoft Compiled HTML Help ( known as CHM format ; readers exist for a variety of platforms ) .
Plus , O’Reilly sells PDF versions of some Missing Manuals , including those I mentioned previously that Pogue wrote .
( Full disclosure : Both O’Reilly and Peachpit Press , which is owned by Pearson , are distributors of our Take Control ebooks , and our ebooks are also available in Safari Books Online . )
A search of common BitTorrent sites turned up a large collection of Missing Manuals in CHM format ready for the downloading , and searching the Gnutella network via Acquisition also found “ Dreamweaver CS3 : The Missing Manual ” in PDF format .
So clearly , although plenty of Missing Manuals are available illegally , those copies stem from Safari Books Online or from O’Reilly , not from anything Pogue may have done , or from someone buying the print book and scanning it .
( That sort of thing happened with the last few Harry Potter books , but we computer authors flatter ourselves that anyone would care enough about our writing to go to the significant effort of scanning our books in order to share them . )
Legal Sales Prevent Illegal Copies —
If you did want to prevent illegal sales , what ’s the best way to go about it ?
Far from preventing people from sharing copies on the peer - to - peer networks , Pogue ’s decision to restrict electronic distribution may have had the opposite effect .
Supply and demand are inextricably linked , and if there ’s no supply for the demand Pogue freely acknowledges , it ’s easy to see how someone could feel relatively little guilt in downloading or sharing an illicitly acquired copy .
I ’m not justifying such behavior , but the harder you make it for someone to buy an easily replicated digital commodity , the more likely they are to share that commodity as a way of making things easier for others .
Look at the parallels in the music industry .
Apple made legitimate purchases of music both easy and inexpensive via the iTunes Store , and anyone who was on the fence about whether it was acceptable to share music suddenly had a viable alternative .
Providing a legitimate purchase path for electronic versions not only generates revenue , but also reduces illicit copying .
Closer to home , consider our experience with Take Control .
We ’ve been publishing ebooks for more than four years , and as I said , we ’ve sold over 150,000 copies in that time , with virtually no wide scale copying .
We try hard to price our ebooks reasonably , and we ’ve put a lot of effort into making the purchase process simple .
Because it ’s easy to buy our ebooks legitimately , there ’s not much incentive to share purchased copies or to download copies rather than buy them .
Of course , we do more to discourage copying .
I believe that displaying the price prominently on the first page of every one of our ebooks triggers anti-shoplifting experiences for most people .
If you see a pile of items without prices in a store ( as is true of most digital files , including books in Safari Books Online ) , you might assume they ’re samples or marketing freebies .
But if there ’s a price sign on the pile , or each item has been clearly marked with a price , there ’s no question that you ca n’t take one and walk out without paying .
Also , because we tend to cover timely and perishable topics , we often release updates to our ebooks , thus rendering obsolete previous versions .
Those updates are often free , and for more major updates , we usually offer existing owners a discount .
To judge from our reader email , people appreciate these gestures .
Other techniques we employ include free samples of all of our ebooks , a discount offer that readers can share with interested friends or colleagues , a plainly written request that readers treat the ebooks as they would print books ( occasional lending of books is a time - honored tradition ) , and an up - front statement that we do n’t use any copy prevention or DRM technologies .
We also take small pains to make sure our Check for Updates links work only for purchasers , and utilize basic security measures to prevent copies from being downloaded illegitimately from our Web site .
How do I know we ’re not being taken to the electronic cleaners ?
I have automated Google searches that look for copies of the ebooks that may be available for public download .
I have found our ebooks available for download on a handful of occasions ; each time it was someone who had put the file on a server without realizing it was open to the public or who was transferring the book from work to home and had forgotten to take it down .
I periodically search the file sharing services too , but it ’s exceedingly rare to find any of our ebooks there , and those I have seen were wildly out of date .
In short , far from the foregone conclusion that publishing an electronic book will result in rampant copying , our years of experience show just the opposite .
What ’s the Difference ?
When I was corresponding with Pogue about his blog post , he zeroed in on the key question :
Why are his books being shared illicitly whereas ours are not ?
Certainly , some of it has to do with us providing an easy , inexpensive way for interested readers to purchase the electronic versions they want , and all the little things we do to discourage rampant copying undoubtedly help as well .
But O’Reilly also sells many of their print books in PDF form , so the difference is n’t just availability .
Possibilities that occur to me include :
I think having the ebook as our primary format may discourage people from copying , since doing so would clearly impact our core business .
People inclined to share digital files may not see their actions as significantly detrimental to traditional publishers like O’Reilly who make the bulk of their revenue from print sales .
I suspect we get an advantage because we ’re a tiny operation and we try to maintain personal connections with our readers .
We read and respond to as much of our email as we can , as do our authors , which I believe reduces the desire of readers to do anything that might conceivably harm us .
The fact that we and our authors are known as real people with mortgages and looming college costs may defuse the disdain some people feel toward companies ( ignoring the fact that companies are made up of real people too ) .
Our small size and relative obscurity may mean both that we have fewer customers who would be likely to share our ebooks , and fewer people who would think to look for our ebooks on the file sharing services .
By publishing DRM - free ebooks , acknowledging that it ’s OK to lend one of our ebooks to a friend or colleague , and providing free and discounted updates , I believe we come down squarely on the side of the reader , reducing the number of people who would feel inclined to distribute our books for free .
However , this is more of a contrast with publishers other than O’Reilly , whose PDFs are also DRM - free .
The fact that subscriptions to Safari Books Online are often institutional may increase the likelihood that people will share books from that service .
My suspicion is that people spending their own money are less likely to upload an ebook to a file sharing site .
This is born out anecdotally by the large number of Missing Manuals I found in CHM format that were extracted from Safari Books Online , in contrast with the single title I found in PDF format .
Try iTunes Instead of Voluntary Payments —
Pogue segues from his personal story to the experience of author Steven Poole , who gave away copies of a 7 - year - old book about “ the aesthetics of videogames – what they share with cinema , the history of painting , or literature ; and what makes them different , in terms of form , psychology and semiotics . ”
In November 2007 , Poole released the book as a DRM - free PDF under a Creative Commons license , and included a PayPal button with the text “ If you like the book , you can leave a tip via PayPal . ”
Although the book was downloaded nearly 32,000 times , fewer than 20 people paid anything , and a few tipped Poole only a cent .
Poole seems neither surprised nor particularly dismayed about his specific results ( it was an old book about past technology , after all ) , but correctly concludes that , despite the much - discussed Radiohead experiment , voluntary payments do n’t constitute a viable business model .
We dabbled with voluntary payments a while back with what we called PayBITS , and came to the same conclusion – it ’s fine for an author to ask for a voluntary payment every so often , but it works best for very well - known creators , and only infrequently even then .
TidBITS contributing editor Glenn Fleishman had a brush with this sort of model when he distributed a DRM - free copy of “ Real World Adobe GoLive 6 ” after the useful life span of that book had passed .
He did n’t ask for any contribution originally , but due to a hosting error , he nearly faced a $ 15,000 bill for the many thousands of downloads .
The bill was narrowly averted ( a threshold was n’t crossed for bandwidth usage ) , but a simple general appeal – since he was n’t tracking individual downloaders – brought in $ 2,000 , which , with donors ’ permission , he gave to Project Gutenberg .
( See “ Publish ( Electronically ) and Perish ? “ , 2003 - 03 - 24 , for the whole story . )
What I do n’t quite understand is why Pogue chose to quote Poole ’s description of the failure of his voluntary payment experiment without also acknowledging that Poole touches on the obvious solution :
A reasonable outcome , perhaps , would be something like an iTunes for books , where people choose to buy ( DRM - free or at least DRM - lite ) copies because it 's still easier for most folk than hunting down a torrent .
Precisely !
Although I have n’t seen reports from individual artists about how much they ’re making from the iTunes Store , the fact that the iTunes Store is , as of April 2008 , the largest music retailer in the United States , probably means that it ’s generating real revenue for artists as a collective whole .
All this reminds me of my call for Apple to enhance the text - reading capabilities of the iPhone and iPod , perhaps even with an iPod reader that would feature a larger screen ( see “ Open Letter to Steve Jobs : In Support of an iPod reader , ” 2008-03-05 ) .
Core to that idea was the suggestion that the iTunes Store sell ebooks ; I ’d bet that Apple would become the largest ebook retailer in the world nearly instantly .
In fact , Amazon pairs their ebook reader , the Kindle , with just such an ebook store .
Even though the Kindle ’s interface and hardware design could stand improvement , its frictionless approach to buying books is one of the few online experiences akin to the iTunes Store .
( See Tonya ’s take on the Kindle in “ First Kindly Impressions about My Kindle , ” 2008-03 - 27 . )
For those who might be wondering , we are looking closely at the Kindle , but we ’re hoping Amazon will add more formatting options soon , because converting the Take Control series to Kindle format would require a lot of work to pare down our rich formatting to the Kindle ’s feeble display capabilities .
( Amazon has revealed almost nothing about the Kindle ’s adoption rate .
Jeff Bezos said recently at the Wall Street Journal ’s D : All Things Digital conference that the Kindle ’s ebook sales represent 6 percent of all Amazon sales for the 125,000 titles that are available for the Kindle .
Unfortunately , that statistic is less than useless , because although many mainstream print best sellers are available for the Kindle , there are also Kindle - only titles that would pull up the average .
Plus , Bezos never clarified whether that number is unit sales or dollars .
Personally , I suspect that if the Kindle had started a raging fire of demand , Amazon would be trumpeting that news widely .
Their near - complete silence causes me to think it ’s more of a fizzle . )
Marketing via Copying ?
One last point .
Pogue ’s assumption is that copying is a bad thing – that a copy is equivalent to a lost sale .
Although any publisher would prefer a sale to a not - sale , I think this assumption oversimplifies the situation .
I see three possible scenarios :
Anne is looking for documentation on Mac OS X , and to avoid purchasing “ Mac OS X Leopard : The Missing Manual , ” she downloads an illicit copy of the book via BitTorrent .
Bart has a question about how Spaces works , and in the process of trying to find an answer , downloads an illicit copy of “ Mac OS X Leopard : The Missing Manual . ”
Whether or not the book contains the answer is irrelevant , because Bart was n’t going to buy any book – he just wanted an answer to his question .
Cassie , like Anne , is looking for documentation about Leopard , stumbles on an illicit copy of “ Mac OS X Leopard : The Missing Manual , ” downloads it , and reads the first few chapters .
Impressed , she pops over to Amazon to order a print copy and returns to reading the illicit version until her print copy arrives .
In this first scenario with Anne , Pogue and O’Reilly lose a likely opportunity to make money , but they do n’t lose any actual money .
In fact , they may gain a future sale to Anne through increased familiarity ( for the sake of argument , we ’ll assume that Anne ’s opinion of the book was positive ) .
With Bart , in the second scenario , there ’s no revenue gained nor opportunity lost , although a future sale to Bart is again more likely than it would be had he not seen the book online .
But in our third scenario with Cassie , where the downloaded version causes a print sale , not only do Pogue and O’Reilly earn money from the sale , they do so without having to pay anything to introduce Cassie to the book .
The cost of customer acquisition is nil ( or rather , it ’s shared by others ) .
That ’s a double win .
My guess , and this is pure speculation , is that the people downloading illicit copies of ebooks fall onto a classic bell curve , with the bulk of the population being like Bart and relatively few people acting like either Anne or Cassie .
Clearly , authors and publishers have to earn money at some point , so if everyone downloaded everything for free like Anne , the publishing industry would disintegrate .
In managing Take Control , though , I ’ve learned that the greatest challenge to increasing sales is reaching a larger audience – customer acquisition rears its ugly head .
I ’d far rather acquire a customer like Cassie for free than spend marketing money to attract someone new .
That does n’t mean I ’m comfortable just giving our ebooks away , since we do n’t have a print - based model to promote , as do the Baen Free Library and science - fiction author Cory Doctorow .
( Doctorow ’s broadly licensed works , which can be downloaded for free , translated , performed , and adapted , seem to have contributed to his robust print sales . )
To be fair , both Baen and Doctorow are publishing fiction , which differs somewhat from technical reference works of the like that we and Pogue publish .
But I am sanguine about what would happen if some of our ebooks were to be shared widely .
I do n’t believe it would hurt sales because if we ( and Google ) are doing our jobs right , it will always be easier to find and purchase our legitimate copies than to hunt down some out - of - date illicit version .
Would such copying help sales in a noticeable fashion ?
If I ’m right about the bell curve , that ’s also unlikely , unless such a shared book also somehow became associated with a fast - spreading Internet meme .
But any exposure is better than none , at least for the vast majority of authors .
As O’Reilly Media publisher Tim O’Reilly has said , “ Obscurity is a far greater threat to authors and creative artists than piracy . ”
To tie this back to the music world , encouraging copying may not work for well - known artists with multiple distribution channels , but for the vast majority of unknown musicians , that Internet meme lottery ticket is a way better bet than a spot on American Idol .
In the end , I find myself on the opposite end of the spectrum from David Pogue .
I ’ve proved over four years that ebook piracy is not a fact of Internet nature , and I ’d argue that it ’s something that all authors could both control and profit from .
The trick , as always , is to watch how the recording industry behaves and do the opposite .

Syria may already boast some of the world 's best food , but now it can also claim the world 's largest restaurant .
The 6,014 - seat Damascus Gate has taken the accolade from a Bangkok eatery serving a mere 5,000 diners .
The crucial test for Guinness World Record officials is all the tables are properly catered for , and they likened the Syrian kitchen to a " mini- factory " .
One item not on the menu is a pint of the famous black Irish brew , however .
The restaurant does not serve alcohol .
Located in a Damascus suburb , the family - owned restaurant called Bawabet Dimashq in Arabic , was opened more than three years ago .
At the time , the owner 's son and now general manager Muhannad Samman was studying in London .
He thought of contacting the Guinness people about the $ 40 m project and the process of verification began from there .
Production line
During the busy summer months up to 1,800 staff are employed in the 54,000 sq-m dining area and 2,500 sq-m kitchen .
The open air area complete with waterfalls , fountains and replicas of archaeological ruins for the summer , and there are separate themed sections for Chinese and Indian cuisine .
" The secret of feeding so many people is to divide up the restaurant into smaller sections and every person in the restaurant has their own task to fulfil , " Mr Samman told the BBC .
The kitchen is a like a production line , he says , where one chef can prepare 25 - 30 helpings of popular dishes , such as hummus , in one minute - that 's one bowl every two seconds .
And there is absolutely no compromise on the standard of food or service Mr Samman insists .
" In this part of the world , all people care about is their stomachs , so the food has to be the best . "

White Convicts As Likely to Be Hired As Blacks Without Criminal Records
Anyone claiming that racism is no longer alive and well in the United States , in addition to considering the race - driven circumstances surrounding the Jena 6 , or statistics demonstrating that prosecutors are far more likely to seek the death penalty when the victim is white than when the victim is black ( particularly if the defendant is black ) , or studies demonstrating that blacks receive harsher sentences than whites for equivalent drug crimes , or the fact that even though more whites per capita smoke marihuana than blacks , blacks are arrested and prosecuted at a far higher rate , should read a recent study by Princeton University examining employment discrimination titled “ Discrimination in Low Wage Labor Markets . ”
In the largest and most comprehensive project of its kind to date , 13 young male applicants , presenting the same qualifications and experience , split into teams and went on nearly 3,500 entry - level job interviews with private companies in supposedly left - leaning , " progressive " , multicultural New York City , jobs ranging from restaurants to manufacturing to financial services .
After recording which applicants were invited back for interviews or were offered jobs , two sociology professors looked at the hiring practices of 1,500 prospective private employers , focusing specifically on discrimination against young male minorities and ex-offenders .
Some of the study 's findings are depressingly familiar .
For instance , young white high school graduates were twice as likely to receive positive responses from New York employers as equally qualified black job seekers .
It also reaffirmed not only that former prisoners are at a distinct disadvantage in the job market , but also that , again , black ex-prisoners are in a much worse position : positive responses from employers towards white applicants with a criminal record dipped 35 percent , while for black applicants similarly situated it plummeted 57 percent .
However , the study revealed that our society 's racism extends even deeper : black applicants with no criminal record were no more likely to get a job than white applicants with criminal records just released from prison !
In other words , while whites with criminal records received low rates of positive responses , such response rates were equally low for blacks without a criminal background .
Further exposing the overt racism at play was the study 's finding that minority employers were more accepting of minority applicants and job applicants with prison records .
So , even when a white employer knows that the white applicant she is interviewing is a convict and the black applicant has never been in trouble with the law , she is as likely to hire the white applicant as the black applicant .
Given how wary our society is of ex-offenders , and how difficult it is for ex-offenders to obtain gainful employment , this finding reveals the depth and breadth of racism in the job market .
Imagine what the results would be if the researchers tested the inverse ?!?
We would be hard - pressed to find a single employer as likely to hire a black person with a criminal record as a white person without one , and the differences between rates of positive ressponses would stretch across the Sahara .
The study reaffirms the dire situation for black ex-offenders .
Blacks comprise a disproportionate number of the 2.3 million people behind bars , and thus are disproportionately affected by laws barring people with criminal records from certain employment and educational opportunities .
Even when applying for jobs they are legally qualified for , black ex-convicts face dual discrimination on account of being black and having a criminal record .
Amazingly , the study found no evidence that an applicant 's educational credentials countered the stigma of incarceration , suggesting that once the " criminal record " stigma attaches , it may never relinquish its grip .
But what the Princeton study shows is that blacks who have never stepped foot inside a prison face not only unequal competition from whites without rap sheets and comparable competition from similarly situated blacks , but they can also be squeezed out of the job market by whites exiting penitentiaries .
A level playing field it is not .
As for ex-prisoners , with thousands leaving prison every day , our country should expand reentry programs for prisoners ( both inside and outside of prison ) , ease employment restrictions for people with criminal records , repeal laws disenfranchising prisoners and ex-offenders , ensure that ex-offenders can easily correct mistakes on their rap sheets , and , most importantly , move away from nationwide policies of mass incarceration , frantic prison - building , arrest - happy policing , and fighting a costly , ineffective , and inhumane war on drugs , all of which contribute mightily to our bursting - at - the - seams prison population .
But even then , our country faces an even tougher task , one that we have failed miserably at for hundreds of years , and one that cannot be accomplished merely by repealing a statute or rewriting a policy : getting rid of discrimination against people of color .
And for anyone who thinks racism is no longer an issue in America , think again .

While many new iPhone 3G owners have griped that the device 's occasionally yellowish hue is evidence of a defect , Apple has now gone on record to say that the tint is a deliberate choice to improve overall usability .
The company 's Senior Director of Product Marketing , Bob Borchers , tells Engadget that the shift from the blue - biased LCD of the original iPhone is n't an accident and produces more accurate colors most of the time , registers deeper blacks , and makes the resulting image appear crisper .
The original screen was too cold and slightly murkier , Borchers adds .
In AppleInsider 's experience , the new panel should also help improve visibility outdoors , where contrast and overall brightness are both important factors .
A " heartless " accountant who helped his wife smuggle a 14 - year - old girl into Britain and subjected her to years of slavery , was jailed for 18 months yesterday .
Samuel Quainoo and his wife Ernestina , a teacher , who was given a suspended sentence , denied the girl schooling and did not allow her to make friends .
They forced her to wear hand - me - downs , apart from once buying her T - shirts with " my other name is bitch " printed on them .
The couple pretended the girl was their own child , but forced her to cook , clean and do the washing for their real child while they were at work , London 's Isleworth Crown Court was told .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
She was never paid and later told police and social workers she was so desperate that she had thought about committing suicide .
When confronted by police , Quainoo , who has a previous conviction for false accounting , claimed the child had cursed them with a " voodoo " spell .
Quainoo , 59 , and his wife , 37 , of West Drayton , pleaded guilty to one count of child trafficking but claimed the girl was properly looked after and " treated like a daughter " .
Judge Jonathan Lowen said he had no doubt they were lying .
It was " clear that girl 's entry was carefully planned " with false birth and baptism certificates being used to persuade British high commission officials in Ghana to grant her a visa , he said .
Dismissing Mrs Quainoo's claim of unstinting love and care for the girl as " inconsistent " with the facts , he accepted the teenager 's account of being a " servant or slave " during her two - year ordeal .
" You were both a teacher and a graduate and of a different socio- economic plateau , " he told the couple during sentencing .
" Your exploitation of her was heartless and sustained . "
“ The punch line is that you do n’t have to lose your job to get pinched in a recession , ” said Jared Bernstein , senior economist at the labor - oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
“ Understandably we focus on layoffs and job losses , but most people keep their jobs in a recession .
People who held their jobs are losing ground both in terms of hours and hourly wages . ”
The number of people on non-farm payrolls was lower in April than six months earlier .
Over the last half - century , every time employment has dipped in such fashion , the economy has proved to be either in a recession or just emerging from one .
A private research organization , the National Bureau of Economic Research , determines whether a downturn qualifies as a recession , which it defines as a “ significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months . ”
Several economists predicted the organization would eventually conclude that the nation entered a recession late last year or early this year , though the Commerce Department has reported overall economic activity has remained slightly positive .
“ It ’s kind of tough when you ’ve got to tell your family that a lot of things are going to change and the things we ’re used to are basically going to stop , ” said Howard Dempsey , a worker at a Freightliner truck factory in Cleveland , N.C. , who recently learned that he would lose his job next month , along with 1,500 other people  nearly half the work force .
“ It ’s hard to understand how all this happened so fast , when one day we ’re building 200 trucks a day and the next day we ’re down to 100 , ” he said .
Mr. Dempsey has worked at the plant for almost a decade and is paid $ 22.30 an hour , plus health insurance and other benefits .
Those wages allowed him to buy a house , and plan for college for his two teenage daughters , both well - accustomed to shopping as a pastime .
We ’ve covered the Pizza Vending machine here at Coolest - Gadgets before , and I thinks its safe to say that we agreed , if the pizza was any good at all , it could be a hit .
Well , I guess people liked the concept , ( and the pizza too ) as the Let ’s Pizza vending machines are about to take on the USA !
Expecting an obviously frozen pie , I was shocked to learn that Let ’s Pizza acually vends an authentic Italian pie from SCRATCH in all of about two and a half minutes , complete with the necessary pizza cutter and napkins .
The Machines , created by Italian Claudio Torghel , were first made in Europe around 3 three years ago and they have been working their way West , ever since .
For under 6 bucks , the vending machine spits out ( probably could have come up with better terminology there ) a 10.5 inch steaming hot pizza pie with a choice of plain , pepperoni , ham or bacon , with or without tomato .
The dough is actually made fresh from flour and water , and each pizza is assembled per order .
Special infrared ovens allow for quick , crisp pizza faster than you can say Mama Mia !
These futuristic vending machines can actually hold enough ingredients to make around 200 pies and they are even Internet connected , in order to let operators control their inventory and although each pizza will set you back almost 700 calories , I can say I ’m already getting some change together .
For more info , or to actually see the machines making some mouth watering pizza , please visit smart4retail.com .
Hey , does anybody make an automated wine dispenser to go with this ?
Has anyone already tried vending machine pizza ?
Buon Appetito !
Nearly as many say their standard of living has gotten worse as say it is better
PRINCETON , NJ -- Forty - three percent of Americans say their standard of living is worse now than it was five years ago , nearly matching the percentage ( 45 % ) who say their standard of living has gotten better during that time .
These results are based on a May 30 - June 1 USA Today / Gallup poll .
In the same poll , Gallup for the first time found a majority of Americans saying their personal finances are worse now than a year ago .
Lower - income Americans , those aged 50 and older , and those without college educations are among the subgroups who are most likely to believe their standard of living has deteriorated during the past five years .
Politics apparently color one 's views on this matter , as a majority of Democrats and liberals , compared with fewer than half of Republicans and conservatives , report a diminished standard of living even as a Republican occupies the White House .
Typically , Americans are optimistic about how things will be in the future , and that applies in this case .
When asked to project five years into the future , 62 % say they expect their standard of living to be better ; only 25 % think it will be worse .
There is little variation on future expectations by demographic subgroup .
One notable exception concerns age .
Senior citizens , many of whom live on fixed incomes in retirement , are not optimistic about the future , with just 35 % expecting an improved standard of living and 39 % a worse one .
In addition to comparing their own standard of living to the recent past and near future , the poll asked Americans to compare where they are now to where their parents were at the same age , and where their children will be .
Sixty - three percent of Americans report that their current standard of living is better than their parents ' at the same age , including 38 % who say theirs is much better than their parents ' .
Only 18 % say their standard of living is worse than that of their parents .
Americans are not quite as optimistic that their children will have a better quality of life than they do -- 45 % expect their children 's standard of living to be better than theirs is , 20 % say it will be the same , and 28 % believe it will be worse .
Younger adults are among the most optimistic about their children 's economic situations , with 60 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds expecting their children to have a better standard of living than they do at the same age .
That compares with just 38 % of those aged 50 and older expecting a more comfortable financial situation for their children .
Implications
The problems in the economy are taking their toll on American consumers , with about as many now reporting a diminished standard of living as an improved one .
Nevertheless , by and large , Americans still expect things to improve over the next five years .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,012 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 30 - June 1 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Lately , I ’ve been using dictionaries as a dispatching mechanism .
It seems especially elegant when I face some fairly elaborate switching logic .
For example , instead of :
if a == 1 and b == 1 :
log ( " everything worked ! " )
commit ( )
elif a == 1 and b == 0 :
log ( " a good , b bad " )
report_that_b_failed ( )
else :
log ( " a failed " )
report_that_a_failed ( )
Do this :
d = {
( 1 , 1 ) : commit ,
( 1 , 0 ) : report_that_b_failed ,
( 0 , 0 ) : report_that_a_failed
}
k = ( a , b )
f = d[k ]
f ()
This approach is also really useful when you face the need to change logic based on runtime values .
You can imagine that d might be built after parsing an XML file .

Are you a Web 1.0 duhveloper in a rut ?
Is rich web codery passing you by in Internet time ?
Do you nibble on the ASCII Alphabetti Spaghetti of server - side processing , while younger , feck - ( careful ) and talent - less colleagues slurp the UTF - Eightti Vermicelli of client - side coquetry ?
You do ?
I knew it .
But do n't let it get you down .
I 'm here specially to turn you into an instant Web me - 2.0 coder , with this condensed , self - paced course .
Set your Javascript to on , let your plugins float freely in the TCP / IP stream , and away we go .
Know your version number
The first , most basic , skill : be able to distinguish the different versions of the web .
Web versions , 1.0 to 2.0 Version Characteristics Web 1.0 Programming model equivalent to that of a slightly up - market 3270 terminal .
Forms are filled in with the sequence : tab tab tab tab tab tab bonk .
Web 1.00001
The beginning of the rich web experience : the first ever , primitive Javascript code fragment is written .
It generates an unwanted popup , and snaffles your credit card details .
Web 1.1
No visible difference from Web 1.0 , apart from IE showing the text ' Javascript error ' in its status bar .
Web 1.2 Standard buttons are upgraded with smart 3D - looking GIFs .
These react to mouseover events by bobbing up and down politely over their drop shadows .
Remember when we were excited by this sort of scriptery ?
( None of your CSS cleverness then . )
It seems so quaint now .
It makes me want to cry , thinking about the good old days of ugly web pages loading slowly .
Web 1.3
When you get to the home page of a V1.2 site with FireFox , it displays badly .
When you go to a V1.3 website such as www.fdms.com with FireFox , it tells you to eff off and get IE .
( These traditionalists in fact would seem to prefer it if you used IE4 . )
The age of ' you are n't good enough for our website ' has begun , reaching full fruition at Web 1.5 , see below .
Web 1.4 Basic client - side validation added .
Forms are filled in with the sequence : tab tab tab tab tab
What do you mean ' invalid post code ' you bloody thing ?
The dread phrase ' next generation of 3d smileys ' is encountered for the very first time .
Web 1.5
Home page preceded by Flash animation designed by the man who thought ( wrongly ) he should have been asked to do the title sequence for the next Bond movie .
In practice , this means the user stares at an animated ' Please wait ' sign for half a minute , then goes somewhere else .
Web 1.6
Date fields come with a little popup calendar to help you enter a valid date .
Because of the differences in the box model as implemented by IE4 , the Ok button is position beyond the edge of calendar 's window , and it is impossible to use it to enter a date .
Web 1.7
The presence of extra code interferes with the standard function of browser controls .
Clicking the back button , instead of taking you back to the previous phase on the corporate workflow site so that you could point out the bug to your team leader , abruptly dumps you on the money - shot page of the gentleman 's entertainment website that Porno Pete from accounts was showing you earlier on .
You say .
Web 1.8
Web pages at this level cannot be made to run on Windows Server 2003 , no matter how many ' trusted zones ' you add them to , nor how much you attempt to override Internet Explorer 's Enhanced Security Configuration .
Web 1.9
You stumble upon Desktop Tower Defense one lunchtime , and are surprised when you look up from the screen with tired , gummy eyes to notice that it has suddenly become tomorrow .
But at least you have got your world ranking up to 912,417 .
Web 2.0
At last !
You can get a fully fledged mail client in your browser .
Now , wherever you are in the world , whatever time of day , without the need for your own PC , you are no more than a few minutes away from a screen that reads " Oops , something has gone wrong ; we 're sorry , try again in a few minutes " .
Evolution of the programming model
The programming model , especially the handling of the user interface , has come a long way since the outbreak of the web .
Although it goes against going against my established practice , let me draw you some pictures .
What is a high - performance data structure ?
To answer that question , we 're used to applying normal considerations like Big - Oh complexity , and memory overhead , locality , and traversal order .
All of those apply to both sequential and concurrent software .
But in concurrent code , we need to consider two additional things to help us pick a data structure that is also sufficiently concurrency - friendly :
In parallel code , your performance needs likely include the ability to allow multiple threads to use the data at the same time .
If this is ( or may become ) a high - contention data structure , does it allow for concurrent readers and / or writers in different parts of the data structure at the same time ?
If the answer is , " No , " then you may be designing an inherent bottleneck into your system and be just asking for lock convoys as threads wait , only one being able to use the data structure at a time .
On parallel hardware , you may also care about minimizing the cost of memory synchronization .
When one thread updates one part of the data structure , how much memory needs to be moved to make the change visible to another thread ?
If the answer is , " More than just the part that has ostensibly changed , " then again you 're asking for a potential performance penalty , this time due to cache sloshing as more data has to move from the core that performed the update to the core that is reading the result .
It turns out that both of these answers are directly influenced by whether the data structure allows truly localized updates .
If making what appears to be a small change in one part of the data structure actually ends up reading or writing other parts of the structure , then we lose locality ; those other parts need to be locked , too , and all of the memory that has changed needs to be synchronized .
To illustrate , let 's consider two common data structures : linked lists and balanced trees .
Okay , so the last time I tried using Air Canada ’s paperless mobile check - in I got a message that my Nokia S60 handset , the world ’s most popular mobile OS running on the world ’s bestselling handset , was n’t supported .
This time I actually got an SMS from AC , actually two — one with a helpful reminder of my flight number and departure time and the other with a link to the 2D barcode you see above .
You should have seen the look of abject terror on the counter agent ’s face when I giddily showed her this at the airport .
She made a feeble attempt to scan it with a reader she had then promptly asked me for my passport and printed up the usual paper boarding document .
Maybe I ’ll have a better experience in Tokyo in a couple of weeks …
Remember when the " baby Internet " was all you could access on your mobile phone ?
That was n't all that long ago , although mobile technology has come a long way in just a few short years .
As Apple CEO Steve Jobs has reminded us on more than one occasion , people do n't want the " baby Internet " — they want the real deal on their mobile devices .
Microsoft apparently agrees , as the company announced today that it plans to roll out a " desktop - grade " web browser for Windows Mobile devices later this year .
The announcement came during CITA Wireless 2008 , where Microsoft said that phone manufacturers would have access to the new browser by the third quarter of 2008 .
This would make the first phones with the improved IE preinstalled available to consumers by the end of the year .
The browser will keep the Internet Explorer Mobile moniker , according to Microsoft , and will be able to take advantage of technologies like H.264 , Silverlight , and Flash ( ice burn , iPhone users ) .
Still , the news comes at a time when the nine - month - old iPhone continues to gain browser share over Windows Mobile on the web .
According to data from Net Applications , the iPhone accounted for 0.15 percent of all browsers on the web in March of this year , while Windows CE / Mobile only made up 0.06 percent ( StatCounter says that mobile Safari accounts for 0.23 percent of all browser traffic ) .
Google also recently said that , according to its own data , searches by iPhone users were 50 times more numerous than any other mobile handset .
Although the numbers can vary greatly between stat services , one thing is clear : the public has spoken about its desire to surf the " real Internet " on their smartphones .
In addition to Internet Explorer Mobile , Microsoft also announced the long - expected update to Windows Mobile .
Version 6.1 adds a number of new features to the operating system , such as the ability to copy and paste text on a device without a touchscreen ( something that some iPhone users still wish they had ) , a threaded view of text messages , the ability to play and pause music from the home screen , and Exchange server autodiscovery , to name a few .
The relatively minor update preps Windows Mobile fans for version 7.0 , which some believe will deliver even more competition to the iPhone and RIM's BlackBerry .
Windows Mobile 7.0 is rumored to be on the horizon for some time in 2009 , but Microsoft has not officially announced a release date .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congressional auditors urged the Air Force to reopen bidding for a new fleet of aerial tankers Wednesday , finding the service made " significant errors " in awarding the $ 35 billion contract to Northrop Grumman .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) opinion is a major victory for aerospace giant Boeing , which protested the February decision to award one of the largest contracts in U.S. military history to its rival .
The Air Force said it is reviewing the decision , which was welcomed not only by Boeing , but also by several members of Congress with Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) plants in their states .
" What we have been saying for a number of weeks - that this competition has brought forth a wrong decision - has been validated by the GAO in a very , very strong way , and that is good news for American workers , " said Sen.
Patty Murray , D - Wash .
Sue Payton , the assistant Air Force secretary for acquisitions , said the service would decide what to do " as soon as possible . "
" The Air Force will do everything we can to rapidly move forward so America receives this urgently needed capability , " Payton said in a written statement .
" The Air Force will select the best value tanker for our nation 's defense , while being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar . "
And in another written statement , Boeing Vice President Mark McGraw said , " We look forward to working with the Air Force on next steps in this critical procurement for our warfighters . "
The decision to award the tanker contract to Northrop Grumman ( NOC , Fortune 500 ) , which plans to use an airframe from European manufacturer Airbus , surprised many defense industry observers .
The Air Force wants to replace 179 tankers under the program , which could expand to nearly 500 aircraft and more than $ 100 billion .
" We respect the GAO 's work in analyzing the Air Force 's tanker acquisition process , " Northrop Grumman spokesman Randy Belote said .
" We continue to believe that Northrop Grumman offered the most modern and capable tanker for our men and women in uniform .
We will review the GAO findings before commenting further . "
Boeing 's proposed design was based on its 767 commercial airliner .
Northrop and its partner , the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company ( EADS ) - parent company of Boeing archrival Airbus - offered a model based on the larger Airbus A330 , variants of which are already used by Australia 's air force .
Air Force officials said in February that they chose Northrop because it " clearly provided the best value to the government . "
But the GAO found the service " made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition , " wrote Michael R. Golden , the GAO 's managing associate general counsel for procurement law .
Air Force left no choice
Sen. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash . , said the ruling leaves the Air Force " absolutely no other choice " than to take new bids for the tanker contract - and that Congress will be watching " to make sure that the Air Force actually does their job . "
To sweeten the deal , EADS announced it would put its tanker assembly plant in Mobile , Ala. , where it planned to hire nearly 2,000 workers .
Boeing builds planes in the state of Washington and has major plants in several other states , including Missouri and Kansas .
" Thanks be to God and the GAO on this one , " said Sen . Sam Brownback , R - Kan .
" This is a huge victory for us . "
Rep. Todd Tiahrt , R - Kan. , held up a sign that read " vindicated " during a news conference by Boeing 's supporters .
And Rep. Norm Dicks , D - Wash . , said the tankers are " critical to our defense technology " and should be American - made .
" If the Air Force does n't get it right , I am going to reserve all my options as a member of the Appropriations Committee to offer amendments and do anything I can to stop this thing from going forward , " Dicks said .
Northrop says its tanker project will employ nearly 50,000 people in 49 states , and most of the planes ' electronics and controls will be American - made .
The GAO found the Air Force did not judge the competing bids according to its own published standards .
It also concluded that Air Force officials held " misleading and unequal discussions with Boeing " by failing to tell the company that it had changed its assessment of a key objective , even as they continued talks with Northrop Grumman about the same part of the proposal .
And , after the protest , the Air Force acknowledged that it had misjudged the expected construction and lifetime operating costs of the competing designs , the GAO announced .
The Air Force has been trying to replace its tanker fleet since 2001 .
Some of its current KC - 135 models , built on Boeing 707 airframes , are nearly 50 years old , and the average age of the fleet is more than 24 years .
By comparison , the average age of a U.S. commercial airline fleet is just over nine years , according to Air Force officials .
Those plans have already been delayed by a corruption scandal stemming from the Air Force 's earlier plans for a lease - purchase deal for 767 tankers that would have cost more than buying the aircraft outright .
Critics said that amounted to a taxpayer bailout for the then - slumping 767 program , and Congress - led by Arizona Sen .
John McCain , now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee - blocked the deal in 2004 .
CNN Pentagon Producer Mike Mount contributed to this report .
Christopher Hitchens , who is unabashedly pro-war , and who has ( in the past now ) drawn a distinction between “ extreme interrogation ” techniques and “ outright torture ” , agreed to be waterboarded to show that it was not torture .
In a turnaround that was hardly a surprise , Hitchens now says that waterboarding is definitely torture .
This is despite the fact that he was allowed to stop the process at any time by giving a signal ( which he did ) .
You may have read by now the official lie about this treatment , which is that it “ simulates ” the feeling of drowning .
This is not the case .
You feel that you are drowning because you are drowning — or , rather , being drowned , albeit slowly and under controlled conditions and at the mercy ( or otherwise ) of those who are applying the pressure .
The “ board ” is the instrument , not the method .
You are not being boarded .
You are being watered .
This was very rapidly brought home to me when , on top of the hood , which still admitted a few flashes of random and worrying strobe light to my vision , three layers of enveloping towel were added .
In this pregnant darkness , head downward , I waited for a while until I abruptly felt a slow cascade of water going up my nose .
Determined to resist if only for the honor of my navy ancestors who had so often been in peril on the sea , I held my breath for a while and then had to exhale and — as you might expect — inhale in turn .
The inhalation brought the damp cloths tight against my nostrils , as if a huge , wet paw had been suddenly and annihilatingly clamped over my face .
Unable to determine whether I was breathing in or out , and flooded more with sheer panic than with mere water , I triggered the pre-arranged signal and felt the unbelievable relief of being pulled upright and having the soaking and stifling layers pulled off me .
I find I do n’t want to tell you how little time I lasted .
… If waterboarding does not constitute torture , then there is no such thing as torture .
But the aid amounts to about one - tenth of what is needed , along with a major logistical operation , the spokesman , Paul Risley , said .

The focus for the military junta was on the referendum for a Constitution that is intended to perpetuate military rule .
Residents said the vote followed a campaign of coercion mixed with propaganda .
The military appeared to be diverting some resources from cyclone victims to the voting , which was held in all but the hardest hit areas .
A resident of Yangon , the main city , said by telephone that refugees who had sought shelter in schoolhouses had been evicted so they could be used as polling places .
She said refugees had also been evicted from other buildings .
In Datgyigone , a village 35 miles north of Yangon , a precinct captain burst into laughter when asked if he thought most people would vote for the Constitution .
“ Everyone will vote yes , ” he said .
“ Of course yes .
Hundred percent . ”
But he said that most voters had no idea what they were voting for , and that neither he nor most people he knew had actually read the proposed Constitution .
“ The government says vote , so we vote , ” he said with a shrug .
He spoke openly , but , fearing government retribution , asked that his name not be used .
' Heretic ' :
The first openly gay bishop is pilloried in the pulpit by a long - haired heckler
The world 's first openly gay Anglican bishop was heckled last night as he gave a sermon at a church in London .
The Right Reverend Gene Robinson , the American churchman whose appointment as Bishop of New Hampshire triggered a devastating split among Anglican leaders , was branded a ' heretic ' by the lone protester .
Bishop Robinson began his sermon by expressing his sadness that the Anglican Communion was tearing itself apart .
Gene Robinson at the start of yesterday 's service
The long - haired heckler repeatedly jabbed his finger and shouted ' repent , repent , repent ' .
He said the bishop ' preached the Gospel but departed from it ' and claimed it was he who was behind the schism .
The bishop had to halt his sermon as a slow hand - clap by members of the congregation began in response to the heckling .
Tirade :
The heckler rants at the Rt Rev Gene Robinson
The hymn Thine Be The Glory was sung as the protester was escorted from St Mary 's Church in Putney , South - West London .
When Bishop Robinson resumed speaking , he asked those present to ' pray for that man ' .
Health Minister Ben Bradshaw was among those hearing the speech .
Speaking after the service he said that it was an excellent and inspirational sermon , adding that the bishop had handled the outburst very well .
Mr Bradshaw , who is openly gay , said : ' He is a very brave man speaking the truth . '
Earlier Bishop Robinson had described the Archbishop of Canterbury 's position in the Church as ' almost untenable ' .
He said that Dr Rowan Williams now faces condemnation whichever way he turns .
However , he insisted he had great sympathy with the embattled Archbishop and pledged to support his efforts to keep the warring sister churches of the Church of England together in the 400 - yearold Anglican network .
Dr Williams has banned the controversial bishop from the gathering of Anglican primates from across the world that is due to begin in Canterbury this week .
The ban is an attempt to ease tension at the Lambeth Conference , which is torn with dissension between conservatives and liberals over gay rights .
Bishop Robinson yesterday made a plea for the acceptance of homosexuality in the Church from the fringes of the conference .
He said sexuality was ' important but not essential ' and that churchmen should instead turn their attention to the troubles of the wider world such as knife crime and poverty .
' While young men are knifing each other on the streets of London and there are a billion people living on less than a dollar a day , the fact that the Anglicans argue over two men who want to make a family together makes the Church look irrelevant , ' he said .
He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday morning that Dr Williams 'is in an almost untenable position .
No matter what he does he will make someone mad and sometimes everybody mad ' .
Later he toned down his language and told the Daily Mail : ' Dr Williams is in an almost impossible position .
I believe with every fibre of my being that he is doing everything he can to hold the Anglican Communion together .
I not only respect him but join him in that effort . '
Bishop Robinson appealed for compromise from the alliance of British and American conservative and evangelical clergy with African and Third World prelates that has already begun organising an alternative organisation to support traditionalist views on sexuality .
' Things seem intractable but nothing is impossible , ' he said .
' We are arguing over things that are important but not essential . '
Dr Williams is mired in trouble at home over women bishops .
Last week the General Synod was divided into hostile factions by the arguments over women .
The Lambeth Conference is already facing boycotts by conservative bishops from the Anglican world - including senior figures such as the Bishop of Rochester Dr Michael Nazir - Ali .
Conservatives refuse to accept the appointment of Bishop Robinson - who is in a 20 - year relationship with a male partner - by the diocese of New Hampshire in 2003 .
They say it breached Anglican rules and amounted to an attempt to bludgeon Anglicans into accepting liberal demands for gay rights .
They have publicly distanced themselves from the leadership of Dr Williams .
At the same time , Anglican liberals who support the gay rights agenda believe the Archbishop is doing too little to swing the argument in their direction .
Read It Here First : Half of Wall St. Profits Are Gone ( So Far )
Last year , we looked at the issue of risk adjusted gains for the S&P500 , and most especially for the Financial sector .
At the time , Financials were the largest sector in the S&P500 , and had what were described as legitimate , sustainable , normalized risk - based earnings .
Since then , we have learned that their earnings were anything but .
And , they are no longer the largest S&P500 sector , having been supplanted Technology in Q2 2008 .
Societe Generale 's Jame Montier notes that , even with the loss of leadership , financials remain an exceptionally large component of the market itself .
As the chart below shows , today 's 17 % of market cap may be well off the high of nearly 25 % but remains a long way above the levels before this bubble started :

US Financials as a Percentage of Market Cap

Note the correction in Financials in 1987 , 2000 and then again in 2007 - 08 .
The gains in these big run ups appear particularly vulnerable -- much more so than the rest of the market .
These are likely a function of the 35X leverage employed .
Note also that a good part of the rise over recent decades has been fueled on assumptions about risk that turned out to be incorrect .
The NYT discusses this :
" Only a year ago , Wall Street reveled in an era of superlatives : record deals , record profit , record pay .
But a mere 12 months later , nearly half of the profits that major banks reaped during that age of riches have vanished .
The numbers are staggering .
Between early 2004 and mid-2007 , a period of unprecedented wealth on Wall Street , seven of the nation ’s largest financial companies earned a combined $ 254 billion in profits .
But since last July , those same banks — Bank of America , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — have written down the value of the assets they hold by $ 107.2 billion , gutting their earnings and share prices .
Worldwide , the reckoning totals $ 380 billion , much of which reflects a plunge in the value of tricky mortgage investments . "
The write - downs are ongoing , and if we are to believe what the Philly Banking Index -- now making multi- year lows -- is implying :
We are not nearly through this .
That chart above also reflects the US moving from an industrial economy to a services based one .
The underlying question is how much mean reversion will happen as deleveraging occurs and risk management returns to normalized levels .

I 'm glad that no one is depending on ROI on their stock holdings for retirement income .
That would be terrible .
Posted by : Marcus Aurelius | Jun 17 , 2008 7:49:58 AM
Two weeks ago , Huffington Post reminded Americans that John McCain by his own admission does n't know how to use a computer .
Now , McCain campaign aide Mark Soohoo reassured voters that " John McCain is aware of the Internet " and " You do n’t actually have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country . "
No doubt , as with so much that for his public policy pronouncements , John McCain did n't let his ignorance get in the way of speaking out .
As it turns out , back in April the self - described computer " illiterate " proclaimed eBay was the answer to poverty and recession in the United States .
Earlier this year , the Politico 's Mike Allen ( video here ) asked the GOP presidential contenders whether they used a PC or Mac .
In his response , McCain revealed that when it comes to high tech devices large ( like private jets ) or small ( like personal computers ) , he is dependent on his beer heiress wife :
" Neither .
I 'm an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance I can get . "
But just because John McCain does n't know how to connect to eBay does n't mean he does n't have connections to eBay .
As it turns out , former eBay CEO Meg Whitman is not only a senior adviser to John McCain , but plays ventriloquist with him when it comes to the economy .
During his now - forgotten " Forgotten Places " tour two months ago , McCain told an audience in Inez , Kentucky , " You have a right to expect us to show as much concern for helping you create more and better choices to make for yourselves as we show any other community in America . "
And one of those better choices , according to John McCain , is to become a seller on the auction site , eBay :
" Today , for example , 1.3 million people in the world make a living off eBay , most of those are in the United State of America . "
Ebay 's Whitman could n't have put it better herself .
In fact , she put it almost exactly the same on way on CBS 60 Minutes in March .
As she told Lesley Stahl :
" We have about - around the world , about 1.3 million people make most , if not all , of their living selling on eBay . "
That John McCain , who more than once admitted his limited knowledge of the economy , would parrot one of his most senior campaign aides is unsurprising .
But that he would cite eBay as the way forward for a community where 37 % live in poverty and 40 % of the wage income comes from mining seems remarkably callous , even by McCain 's standards .
No doubt , tens of thousands off people make a good living as eBay sellers .
As eBay 's Whitman told CBS '
Stahl , " people can supplement their income from several thousand dollars a month to ... I think our top seller on eBay grosses $ 20 million . "
But for a country slipping into recession and facing the loss of thousands of good paying manufacturing jobs in a rapidly globalizing economy , a high - speed Internet connection and an eBay virtual storefront is hardly a substitute .
As American workers confront increasing insecurity due to competition in China , India and elsewhere , John McCain apparently believes they should follow in the footsteps of Whitman 's legions who earn their living selling " high tech electronic equipment , maybe it 's audio equipment , maybe it 's Barbie dolls , maybe it 's collectibles , or a certain niche of collectibles , of coins , of china . "
Instead building products and offering services for the world , McCain 's Americans should just sell stuff to each other .
And when all else fails for distressed homeowners , McCain 's Americans should just join the rapidly growing ranks of those :
" Doing what is necessary -- working a second job , skipping a vacation , and managing their budgets -- to make their payments on time . "
Of course , John McCain is n't speaking from personal experience when it comes to either computers or financial hardship .
( As it turns out , one of McCain 's 8 homes - the one with " remote control window coverings " - is now up for sale . )
Knowing even less than Ted Stevens ( " series of tubes " ) or George W. Bush ( who " clicks around " on " the Google " ) , John McCain nonetheless offered the Internet as the answer for Americans struggling to make ends meet .
What will it take persuade Canadians that if they do not act soon to reverse the course of their nation , there will be nothing left to save ?
I am talking , of course , about so - called " deep integration " and its official expression , the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The SPP , moving inexorably on many fronts , is nothing less than a blueprint for the gradual dismantling of one of the most successful nations of the twentieth century , and its piecemeal distribution to the decaying empire to the south .
Yet there seems to be , even amongst those who have heard of it and believe it is a threat , a surreal acceptance of it .
It 's like a meteor hurtling towards us : there 's nothing we can do so we might as well go shopping while we can .
What this country needs is a little outrage -- stirred by something from the package of outrages , treasonous policies and breathtaking giveaways of our country that make up the plan to append Canada to the U.S.
What will it be ?
The militarization of the country and an industrial policy of selling arms to the world ?
A foreign policy determined almost exclusively by the interests of big business , from peddling asbestos , to opposing bio- diversity , to forcing Europeans to accept GMO food ?
The mimicking of a paranoid United States and the adoption of its crusade against the Muslim world ?
Each worthy of a good dollop of outrage .
But some believe that unless you get to people where it actually has an impact on their daily lives , sustained outrage of the kind that influences elections , is too much to expect .
I have never been convinced by this theory but accepting it for the sake of argument , perhaps the sell - out of our energy to the U.S. under NAFTA 's energy provisions would fill the bill .
Betrayed from above
No other policy , either standing alone or as part of a larger scheme , demonstrates the extent to which the economic and political elite of this country has betrayed us .
Even in the age of corporate globalization in which the transnational corporation has become the dominant institution of our time , there is simply no other example of such duplicitous behaviour on the part of a national leadership .
No other country in the world has or would consider voluntarily signing a treaty that guaranteed the other party an ever - increasing proportion of its energy resource .
The perverse beauty of what is tediously called the " proportionality clause " of NAFTA is that it ’s virtually guaranteed to get worse .
It would have been bad enough if we had agreed to sell half of our energy production to the U.S.
But the NAFTA deal says we cannot ever decrease the actual proportion of gas and oil we sell to the U.S.
So , each time the proportion of our oil and gas exports to the U.S. increases ( virtually every year ) , we are presented with the new floor .
And we no longer even maintain a strategic reserve -- a 20 - year supply that is ensured before any oil is exported .
There is no limit to this madness .
Right now we export two thirds of our oil and 60 per cent of our gas to the U.S. Under NAFTA this means we can never reduce that proportion , even if our actual production dropped by half and we began freezing in the dark .
In NAFTA there is no ceiling on what we can sell , just a floor .
And each year that passes , the floor looks more like a ceiling .
What makes it even worse , of course , is the new determination of the US to secure dependable supplies of oil and gas -- and that means Canadian supplies .
Harper 's radicals
While the U.S. is preoccupied with its national interest and a secure energy supply , the federal government under both the Liberals and the Radicals ( Harper 's party is anything but conservative ) trades our natural energy security for America 's insecurity .
We now import 49 percent of the oil we use , almost half of it from the same insecure sources from which the U.S. is trying to wean itself .
Almost all of Eastern Canada is dependent on foreign oil .
The catastrophe of global climate change is upon us .
Even if we started to seriously address it tomorrow it would take a generation to even begin to create a post - carbon economy .
With secure supplies of oil and gas and careful government regulation of how quickly they are depleted , and who gets to purchase them , Canada 's future as an environmentally and economically sustainable country would be virtually guaranteed .
But our Quisling elites , for all the talk of being an energy super power and the need to be internationally competitive , has been eagerly selling off our energy heritage for twenty years while the rest of us whistle in the dark .
Time is running out
A recent study by the Parkland Institute of Alberta and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ( CCPA ) examined the NAFTA proportionality provisions to see if there was any policy flexibility at all in this bizarre agreement .
The conclusion of " Over a Barrel : Exiting from NAFTA 's Proportionality Clause " is a resounding No .
The study looked at three policy areas that are increasingly critical to Canada 's future : conservation and the environment , using natural gas increasingly for value - added industries and substituting Canadian oil for the foreign oil we now import .
The co-authors , Gord Laxer and John Dillon , conclude that we can do none of these things without violating NAFTA and triggering American use of the proportionality clause .
The only possible solution involves either the abrogation of NAFTA or the renegotiation of the energy provisions , with the aim of taking back control .
This stunning situation begs the question :
At what point does a nation cease to be viable ?
While there is a legitimate debate about the role energy security plays in the answer , there is no debate about the role of the economic and political elite .
In a market economy , once that elite has abandoned its commitment to the nation , it is just a matter of time .
And time , like our oil and gas , is running out .

Tyee stories :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Schapelle Corby is living every traveler ’s worst nightmare -- convicted in 2005 of smuggling marijuana into Indonesia , the 30 - year - old Australian is serving a 20 - year sentence in a cramped prison .
Prisoner Schapelle Leigh Corby from Queensland , Australia , who is currently serving a 20 - year sentence in Bali for drug smuggling , makes a phone call in Kerobokan prison in the resort island of Bali February 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Stringer
Now a film debuting on cable television HBO on Monday goes behind the scenes at the dramatic trial that gripped Australia , initially strained ties between the neighboring countries and left people asking : “ Did she really do it ? ”
“ Australians became so besotted with the case , ” said Janine Hosking , who made the documentary “ Ganja Queen . ”
“ She does n’t look like how we would imagine a drug trafficker to look ; she looks like the girl next door . ”
“ People will speculate forever on this case , ” Hosking told Reuters .
She began filming shortly before the trial began -- after Corby had already spent five months behind bars in a country that imposes the death penalty on drug traffickers .
“ Ganja Queen ” shows footage shot by Corby with a camera she smuggled into her small jail cell , secret interviews with her during visits to the jail , and shots of her family and defense team , including discussions about whether to try and use bribery to secure her release .
Indonesia regularly ranks among the world ’s most corrupt countries , a problem its government is trying to overcome .
“ Bribery is probably relevant for very low - profile cases that you can make the thing go away , but with Schapelle ’s there was so much scrutiny that the case became very transparent because there was media absolutely everywhere , ” Hosking said .
“ The media thing has worked against her although it has made her a star , ” she said .
The verdict and sentencing in the case was broadcast live in Australia and Indonesia .
Corby had traveled to Bali with her brother and friends in 2004 for a two - week holiday to visit her sister Mercedes .
Fringed with idyllic beaches and catering to all types with luxury resorts as well as cheap hostels for young backpackers and surfers , the island is a favorite holiday destination for thousands of Australians .
She checked her bags in Brisbane , then flew to Sydney and on to Bali , where she collected her luggage .
When asked by a customs officer to open her bodyboard bag , she did , revealing a plastic bag containing 4.1 kilograms ( 9 pounds ) of marijuana .
LEGAL DILEMMA
Within hours of her arrest , video footage and photos of Corby and the bag of drugs were circulating in Indonesian media , who dubbed her the “ Ganja Queen . ”
Ganja is a common Indonesian term for marijuana .
Corby says she did not know the drugs were there , but Hosking said that rather than the onus being on the prosecution to prove Corby was guilty , under Indonesian law , she was required to show who was responsible to prove her innocence .
“ That seemed to be an absolute impossibility for Schapelle to prove , ” Hosking said .
“ Everyone ’s hearts went out to her regardless of whether they thought she was innocent or guilty -- this helpless victim at the center of this legal system . ”
“ It is a harrowing story and I think it really shows in a very close up and personal way just how awful it can be if you are caught up in a different legal system ... and to be under the scrutiny of the media spotlight , ” she said .
Corby ’s defense claimed the drugs were planted in her unlocked bag by corrupt Australian airport baggage handlers as part of a smuggling ring gone wrong .
But the Australian media also raised questions about whether family members were involved , a suggestion they have denied .
In 2005 , Australian newspaper polls showed 90 percent of Australians believed Corby was innocent .
A Sky Australia television poll found 36 percent of people thought her sentence was too harsh and 56 percent labeled it an injustice .
“ When you get to know Schapelle ( in the film ) , it ’s gripping and I do n’t think it matters where she comes from -- whether she ’s an Australian , or an American or British or whatever , ” Hosking said .
“ It could ( happen to anyone ) . ”
Corby ’s final appeal was rejected in March , sending her into a depression that saw her admitted to hospital last week .
While Australia and Indonesia are negotiating a prisoner swap deal for Corby , she has said she does not want to return home to serve her sentence .

The oldest aquarium fish in the world celebrates 75 years at the Shedd
No one is quite sure how old Granddad is -- just that he 's been in Chicago for 75 years .
That makes the Australian lungfish the longest - living fish at any aquarium in the world .
We 've been peeking through the glass at him since the year Franklin Delano Roosevelt became president .
That makes Granddad , an Australian lungfish who has lived at Chicago 's John G. Shedd Aquarium for 75 years , the longest - living fish in any aquarium in the world .
" He was here when Model Ts were pulling up to the Shedd , " said Roger Germann , Shedd 's director of public relations .
" Granddad bridges so many generation gaps . "
At 4 feet long and 25 pounds , Granddad is the color of a faded brown blanket , with charcoal age spots dotting his back .
He was named by a Shedd volunteer years ago , and has gone on to become one of the aquarium 's most popular residents .
" Hey !
See the one with the spots -- he 's been here since 1933 ! " a Shedd visitor shouts to a companion , while dumping half of his popcorn bag on the floor in excitement .
" I love Granddad -- he 's so cool , " coos a teenaged girl , pressing her nose to the tank .
Lounging at the bottom of the 6,000 - gallon tank he shares with four other much - younger Australian lungfish , a few turtles and some smaller fish , Granddad is the picture of tranquility .
Playful turtles dart around him .
One stops to nibble his tail .
Granddad 's cloudy eyes occasionally turn to gaze out at the endless parade of humans on the other side of the glass -- just as he 's been doing for three - quarters of a century .
Granddad made his journey , via steamship and train , from Sydney , Australia , to Chicago for the 1933 Chicago World 's Fair .
At the time , scientists estimated that he was at least 5 years old and was fully mature .
George Parsons , director of fishes at the Shedd Aquarium , says that would make Granddad 80 now -- perhaps even 85 .
Scientists have no idea how long a lungfish can live , he said .
" Granddad is very comfortable , " Germann said .
" He gets the best care possible -- the water temperature is just right , the food is just right . "
Granddad is fed three to four times a week with a variety of seafood , including smelt , small frozen fish and shrimp , Parsons said .
He also likes to tear into heads of romaine lettuce that caretakers occasionally plunk into his tank .
But the old lungfish 's favorite treat by far are sweet potatoes -- served raw and chopped .
" He eats really well , and looks like he is enjoying life , " Parsons said .
It is not Granddad 's age that makes him so sedentary , Parsons said .
Australian lungfish are not known to be active at any age .
They lie in wait , camouflaging themselves and hoping to snap up anything that might be swimming nearby , Parsons said .
" They look like a big log , " he chuckled .
Australian lungfish have primitive lungs in addition to their gills , and they can breathe in oxygen , Parsons said .
Granddad comes to the tank 's surface to get air about every 25 minutes .
The rest of the time , he usually relaxes on the tank floor .
" He 's like your Uncle Fred who just likes to sit in his chair , " Parsons said .
The Shedd Aquarium is planning a party for visitors to celebrate Granddad 's 75th anniversary later this year .
No official date has been set , Germann said , adding that the party will be for those of all ages to celebrate the life of one long - lived , well - loved fish .
" I like to think of grandparents who may come down to the Shedd today to see Granddad with their grandchildren , " Germann said .
" They can look at Granddad and say , ' He was here when I was your age . ' "
Changing times
The world has changed enormously in the 75 years that Granddad has spent at the John G. Shedd Aquarium .
Here are a few events that have taken place while he has been in his tank .
• The Great Depression took its toll during the 1930s .
Movies provided escapism during that time , including 1939 's " Gone with the Wind . "
• In December 1941 , the U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor was bombed , plunging the nation into World War II .
• The Cold War raged through the '50s .
On a lighter note , Elvis Presley swiveled his hips and become the king of rock ' n ' roll .
• The '60s saw much change and sadness with the Vietnam War and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy , Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King .
In 1969 , Neil Armstrong walked on the moon .
• Watergate and the resignation of Richard Nixon rocked the nation in the 1970s .
America celebrated its 200th birthday in 1976 .
• Britain's Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 .
The 1980s saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War .
• The '90s are remembered for , among other things , the first Persian Gulf War , the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the rise of the Internet .
In Chicago , Michael Jordan led the Bulls to six championships .
• Americans ushered in 2000 worried about Y2 K , yet only minor issues surfaced .
The U.S. was shaken to its core on Sept. 11 , 2001 , when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
( Those usages people keep telling you are wrong but which are actually standard in English . )
Split infinitives
For the hyper-critical , “ to boldly go where no man has gone before ” should be “ to go boldly .
. . . ”
It is good to be aware that inserting one or more words between “ to ” and a verb is not strictly speaking an error , and is often more expressive and graceful than moving the intervening words elsewhere ; but so many people are offended by split infinitives that it is better to avoid them except when the alternatives sound strained and awkward .
Ending a sentence with a preposition
A fine example of an artificial “ rule ” which ignores standard usage .
The famous witticism usually attributed to Winston Churchill makes the point well : “ This is the sort of English up with which I will not put . ”
If you think you know the originalversion of this saying , click here .
Beginning a sentence with a conjunction
It offends those who wish to confine English usage in a logical straitjacket that writers often begin sentences with “ and ” or “ but . ”
True , one should be aware that many such sentences would be improved by becoming clauses in compound sentences , but there are many effective and traditional uses for beginning sentences thus .
One example is the reply to a previous assertion in a dialogue : “ But , my dear Watson , the criminal obviously wore expensive boots or he would not have taken such pains to scrape them clean . ”
Make it a rule to consider whether your conjunction would repose more naturally within the previous sentence or would lose in useful emphasis by being demoted from its position at the head of a new sentence .
Using “ between ” for only two , “ among ” for more
The “ - tween ” in “ between ” is clearly linked to the number two , but , as the Oxford English Dictionary notes , “ In all senses , between has , from its earliest appearance , been extended to more than two . ”
We ’re talking about Anglo - Saxon here — early .
Pedants have labored to enforce “ among ” when there are three or more objects under discussion , but largely in vain .
Very few speakers naturally say , “ A treaty has been negotiated among Britain , France , and Germany . ”
Over vs. more than .
Some people claim that “ over ” can not be used to signify “ more than , ” as in “ Over a thousand baton - twirlers marched in the parade . ”
“ Over , ” they insist , always refers to something physically higher : say , the blimp hovering over the parade route .
This absurd distinction ignores the role metaphor plays in language .
If I write 1 on the blackboard and 10 beside it , 10 is still the “ higher ” number .
“ Over ” has been used in the sense of “ more than ” for over a thousand years .
Gender vs. sex
Feminists eager to remove references to sexuality from discussions of females and males not involving mating or reproduction revived an older meaning of “ gender , ” which had come to refer in modern times chiefly to language , as a synonym for “ sex ” in phrases such as “ Our goal is to achieve gender equality . ”
Americans , always nervous about sex , eagerly embraced this usage , which is now standard .
In some scholarly fields , “ sex ” is now used to label biologically determined aspects of maleness and femaleness ( reproduction , etc. ) while “ gender ” refers to their socially determined aspects ( behavior , attitudes , etc. ) , but in ordinary speech this distinction is not always maintained .
It is disingenuous to pretend that people who use “ gender ” in the new senses are making an error , just as it is disingenuous to maintain that “ Ms. ” means “ manuscript ” ( that ’s “ MS ” ) .
Nevertheless , I must admit I was startled to discover that the tag on my new trousers describes not only their size and color , but their “ gender . ”
Using “ who ” for people , “ that ” for animals and inanimate objects
In fact there are many instances in which the most conservative usage is to refer to a person using “ that ” : “ All the politicians that were at the party later denied even knowing the host ” is actually somewhat more traditional than the more popular “ politicians who . ”
An aversion to “ that ” referring to human beings as somehow diminishing their humanity may be praiseworthily sensitive , but it cannot claim the authority of tradition .
In some sentences , “ that ” is clearly preferable to “ who ” : “ She is the only person I know of that prefers whipped cream on her granola . ”
In the following example , to exchange “ that ” for “ who ” would be absurd : “ Who was it that said , ‘ A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle ’ ? ” *
* Commonly attributed to Gloria Steinem , but she attributes it to Irina Dunn .
“ Since ” can not mean “ because . ”
“ Since ” need not always refer to time .
Since the 14th century , when it was often spelled “ syn , ” it has also meant “ seeing that ” or “ because . ”
Hopefully
This word has meant “ it is to be hoped ” for a very long time , and those who insist it can only mean “ in a hopeful fashion ” display more hopefulness than realism .
Momentarily
“ The plane will be landing momentarily ” says the flight attendant , and the grumpy grammarian in seat 36 B thinks to himself , “ So we ’re going to touch down for just a moment ? ”
Everyone else thinks , “ Just a moment now before we land . ”
Back in the 1920s when this use of “ momentarily ” was first spreading on both sides of the Atlantic , one might have been accused of misusing the word , but by now it ’s listed without comment as one of the standard definitions in most dictionaries .
Lend vs. loan
“ Loan me your hat ” was just as correct everywhere as “ lend me your ears ” until the British made “ lend ” the preferred verb , relegating “ loan ” to the thing being lent .
However , as in so many cases , Americans kept the older pattern , which in its turn has influenced modern British usage so that those insisting that “ loan ” can only be a noun are in the minority .
Near miss
It is futile to protest that “ near miss ” should be “ near collision . ”
This expression is a condensed version of something like “ a miss that came very near to being a collision ” and is similar to “ narrow escape . ”
Everyone knows what is meant by it and almost everyone uses it .
It should be noted that the expression can also be used in the sense of almost succeeding in striking a desired target : “ His Cointreau soufflé was a near miss . ”
“ None ” singular vs. plural
Some people insist that since “ none ” is derived from “ no one ” it should always be singular : “ none of us is having dessert . ”
However , in standard usage , the word is most often treated as a plural .
“ None of us are having dessert ” will do just fine .
Scan vs. skim
Those who insist that “ scan ” can never be a synonym of “ skim ” have lost the battle .
It is true that the word originally meant “ to scrutinize , ” but it has now evolved into one of those unfortunate words with two opposite meanings : to examine closely ( now rare ) and to glance at quickly ( much more common ) .
It would be difficult to say which of these two meanings is more prominent in the computer - related usage , to “ scan a document . ”
That said , it ’s more appropriate to use “ scan ” to label a search for specific information in a text , and “ skim ” to label a hasty reading aimed at getting the general gist of a text .
Off of
For most Americans , the natural thing to say is “ Climb down off of [ pronounced “ offa ” ] that horse , Tex , with your hands in the air ” ; but many UK authorities urge that the “ of ” should be omitted as redundant .
Where British English reigns you may want to omit the “ of ” as superfluous , but common usage in the US has rendered “ off of ” so standard as to generally pass unnoticed , though some American authorities also discourage it in formal writing .
But if “ onto ” makes sense , so does “ off of . ”
However , “ off of ” meaning “ from ” in phrases like “ borrow five dollars off of Clarice ” is definitely nonstandard .
Till vs. ’ til .
Since it looks like an abbreviation for “ until , ” some people argue that this word should always be spelled “ ’til ” ( though not all insist on the apostrophe ) .
However , “ till ” has regularly occurred as a spelling of this word for over 800 years and it ’s actually older than “ until . ”
It is perfectly good English .
Teenage vs. teenaged .
Some people object that the word should be “ teenaged , ” but unlike the still nonstandard “ ice tea , ” “ scramble eggs , ” and “ stain glass , ” “ teenage ” is almost universally accepted now .
Do n’t use “ reference ” to mean “ cite . ”
Nouns are often turned into verbs in English , and “ reference ” in the sense “ to provide references or citations ” has become so widespread that it ’s generally acceptable , though some teachers and editors still object .
Feeling bad
“ I feel bad ” is standard English , as in “ This t- shirt smells bad ” ( not “ badly ” ) .
“ I feel badly ” is an incorrect hyper - correction by people who think they know better than the masses .
People who are happy can correctly say they feel good , but if they say they feel well , we know they mean to say they ’re healthy .
Unquote vs. endquote
Some people get upset at the common pattern by which speakers frame a quotation by saying “ quote . . . unquote , ” insisting that the latter word should logically be “ endquote ” ; but illogical as it may be , “ unquote ” has been used in this way for about a century , and “ endquote ” is nonstandard .
Persuade vs. convince
Some people like to distinguish between these two words by insisting that you persuade people until you have convinced them , but “ persuade ” as a synonym for “ convince ” goes back at least to the 16th century .
It can mean both to attempt to convince and to succeed .
It is no longer common to say things like “ I am persuaded that you are an illiterate fool , ” but even this usage is not in itself wrong .
Normalcy vs. normality
The word “ normalcy ” had been around for more than half a century when President Warren G. Harding was assailed in the newspapers for having used it in a 1921 speech .
Some folks are still upset , but in the US “ normalcy ” is a perfectly normal — if uncommon — synonym for “ normality . ”
Aggravate vs. irritate
Some people claim that “ aggravate ” can only mean “ make worse ” and should not be used to mean “ irritate , ” but the latter has been a valid use of the word for four centuries , and “ aggravation ” means almost exclusively “ irritation . ”
You should n’t pronounce the “ e ” in “ not my forte . ”
Some people insist that it ’s an error to pronounce the word “ forte ” in the expression “ not my forte ” as if French - derived “ forte ” were the same as the Italian musical term for “ loud ” : “ for -tay . ”
But the original French expression is pas mon fort , which not only has no “ e ” on the end to pronounce — it has a silent “ t ” as well .
It ’s too bad that when we imported this phrase we mangled it so badly , but it ’s too late to do anything about it now .
If you go around saying what sounds like “ that ’s not my fort , ” people wo n’t understand what you mean .
However , those who use the phrase to mean “ not to my taste ” ( “ Wagnerian opera is not my forte ” ) are definitely mistaken .
Your forte is what you ’re good at , not just stuff you like .
“ Preventive ” is the adjective , “ preventative ” the noun .
I must say I like the sound of this distinction , but in fact the two are interchangeable as both nouns and adjective , though many prefer “ preventive ” as being shorter and simpler .
“ Preventative ” used as an adjective dates back to the 17th century , as does “ preventive ” as a noun .
People should say a book is titled such - and - such rather than entitled .
No less a writer than Chaucer is cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as having used “ entitled ” in this sense , the very first meaning of the word listed by the OED .
It may be a touch pretentious , but it ’s not wrong .
People are healthy ; vegetables are healthful .
Logic and tradition are on the side of those who make this distinction , but I ’m afraid phrases like “ part of a healthy breakfast ” have become so widespread that they are rarely perceived as erroneous except by the hyper-correct .
On a related though slightly different subject , it is interesting to note that in English adjectives connected to sensations in the perceiver of an object or event are often transferred to the object or event itself .
In the 19th century it was not uncommon to refer , for instance , to a “ grateful shower of rain , ” and we still say “ a gloomy landscape , ” “ a cheerful sight ” and “ a happy coincidence . ”
Dinner is done ; people are finished .
I pronounce this an antiquated distinction rarely observed in modern speech .
Nobody really supposes the speaker is saying he or she has been roasted to a turn .
In older usage people said , “ I have done ” to indicate they had completed an action .
“ I am done ” is not really so very different .
Crops are raised ; children are reared .
Old - fashioned writers insist that you raise crops and rear children , but in modern American English children are usually “ raised . ”
“ You ’ve got mail ” should be “ you have mail . ”
The “ have ” contracted in phrases like this is merely an auxiliary verb , not an expression of possession .
It is not a redundancy .
Compare : “ You ’ve sent the mail . ”
It ’s “ cut the muster , ” not “ cut the mustard . ”
This etymology seems plausible at first .
Its proponents often trace it to the American Civil War .
We do have the analogous expression “ to pass muster , ” which probably first suggested this alternative ; but although the origins of “ cut the mustard ” are somewhat obscure , the latter is definitely the form used in all sorts of writing throughout the twentieth century .
Common sense would suggest that a person cutting a muster is not someone being selected as fit , but someone eliminating the unfit .
It ’s “ carrot on a stick , ” not “ carrot or stick . ”
Authoritative dictionaries agree , the original expression refers to offering to reward a stubborn mule or donkey with a carrot or threatening to beat it with a stick and not to a carrot being dangled from a stick .
This and other popular etymologies fit under the heading aptly called by the English “ too clever by half . ”
“ Spitting image ” should be “ spit and image . ”
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the earlier form was “ spitten image , ” which may indeed have evolved from “ spit and image . ”
It ’s a crude figure of speech : someone else is enough like you to have been spat out by you , made of the very stuff of your body .
In the early 20th century the spelling and pronunciation gradually shifted to the less logical “ spitting image , ” which is now standard .
It ’s too late to go back .
There is no historical basis for the claim sometimes made that the original expression was “ spirit and image . ”
“ Lion ’s share ” means all of something , not the larger part of something .
Even though the original meaning of this phrase reflected the idea that the lion can take whatever he wants — typically all of the slaughtered game , leaving nothing for anyone else — in modern usage the meaning has shifted to “ the largest share . ”
This makes great sense if you consider the way hyenas and vultures swarm over the leftovers from a typical lion ’s kill .
“ Connoisseur ” should be spelled “ connaisseur . ”
When we borrowed this word from the French in the 18th century , it was spelled “ connoisseur . ”
Is it our fault the French later decided to shift the spelling of many OI words to the more phonetically accurate AI ?
Of those Francophone purists who insist we should follow their example I say , let ’em eat bifteck .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A lawsuit filed by a Wisconsin couple against their mortgage lender could have major implications for banks should a U.S. appeals court agree that borrowers can cancel their loans en masse when their lenders violate a federal lending disclosure law .
A foreclosed home is seen in Stockton , California in this May 13 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Robert Galbraith / Files
The case began like hundreds of others filed since the U.S. housing boom spawned a rise in sales of adjustable rate loans .
Susan and Bryan Andrews of Cedarburg , Wisconsin , claimed that lender Chevy Chase Bank FSB CCX_pc.N had hidden the true terms of what they believed was a good deal on a low - interest loan .
In their 2005 lawsuit , the couple said the loan ’s interest rate had more than doubled by their second monthly payment from the 1.95 percent rate they thought was locked in for five years .
The interest rate rose well above the 5.75 percent fixed - rate loan they had refinanced to pay their children ’s college tuition .
The Andrews filed the case seeking class action status ; and in early 2007 , U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman ruled that the bank had violated the Truth in Lending Act , or TILA , and that thousands of other Chevy Chase borrowers could join them as plaintiffs .
The judge transformed the case from a run-of - the - mill class action to a potential nightmare for the U.S. banking industry by also finding that the borrowers could force the bank to cancel , or rescind , their loans .
That decision was stayed pending an appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which is expected to rule any day .
The idea of canceling tainted loans to stem a tide of foreclosures has caught hold in other quarters ; a lawsuit filed last week by the Illinois attorney general asks a court to rescind or reform Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N mortgages originated under " unfair or deceptive practices . "
‘ MASSIVE CLASS SUITS ’
The mortgage banking industry already faces pressure from state and federal regulators , who have accused banks of lowering underwriting standards and forcing some borrowers , through fraud , into costly adjustable loans that the banks later bundled and sold as high - interest investment vehicles .
The loans have caused serious instability in the financial sector , as mortgage interest rates adjusted upward and borrowers began defaulting at a significant rate starting in 2007 , drawing lawsuits from investors and homeowners .
Federal appeals courts disagree over whether class - wide rescission under the Truth in Lending Act is available , said attorney Christine Scheuneman , whose firm represented Chevy Chase at the district court .
“ If class treatment is found to be available for rescission ... , given the current crisis not predicted in 2005 , the result all over the country could be massive class suits , ” said Scheuneman , a partner at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP .
The Truth in Lending Act , a 1968 federal law designed to protect consumers against lending fraud by requiring clear disclosure of loan terms and costs , lets consumers seek rescission , or termination , of a loan and the return of all interest and fees when a lender is found in violation .
Should the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agree with Judge Adelman , banking industry associations predict “ confusion and market disruption ” as banks curtail lending further .
“ Class certification of rescission claims would saddle the mortgage lending industry and secondary market with billions of dollars of class action exposure for supposed violations of TILA that do not give rise to any actual damages , ” the financial services associations wrote in an amicus brief .
But the Andrews ’ attorney , Kevin Demet , said lenders want to scare the judiciary into banning class action rescissions because they were unable to convince Congress to do so in the 1990s .
“ If ( banks ) get relief ( from the appeals court ) , it ’s activist judges trying to give them what they could not get legislatively , ” said Demet , of Demet & Demet of Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
Consumer advocates said the banks would have “ no more or no less ” liability for the tainted mortgages if the court found in favor of the Andrews plaintiffs .
But an adverse ruling for borrowers would cut off an important remedy .
Borrowers would “ lose the opportunity to use rescission to save their homes from foreclosure or to rescind their mortgages and refinance into affordable ones , ” the Center for Responsible Lending , the National Consumer Law Center , Public Citizen and AARP Foundation Litigation wrote in an amicus brief filed in the case .
Both sides said the case will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court .

Two songs on this post by two different artists .
Both are very melodic songs that have been out for awhile and people hipped me to this weekend .
First up is some Lil ' Wayne , who I have n't cared much for in the past , but have been coming to around here lately .
This song is so far out there it 's ridiculous .
He had to be completely out of his mind when he wrote it .
You would pretty much have had to of been there to know where he is coming from .
Next up is a track from Talib Kweli off of his Eardrum album .
It 's produced by Kanye and I think is one of his finest beats .
Some really jazzy stuff mixed with his signature sampling .

Mr Obama 's team said several Berlin sites were considered for a speech A leading German politician is the latest to criticise a tentative plan by Barack Obama to speak at Berlin 's historic Brandenburg Gate .
Erwin Huber , the leader of one of the main governing parties , said the Democratic White House hopeful had played no part in German reunification .
Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier said it was " a bit odd " that Mr Obama should speak at the Cold War landmark .
Mr Obama is to visit Europe and the Middle East in late July .
His campaign team said the Brandenburg Gate was one of several locations they had inquired about as the venue for a speech .
Political row " Obama did n't do anything for German unification , " Mr Huber said .
" That 's not a criticism , but as a result there is no reason to grant him such a privilege , " he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper .
Mr Huber is the head of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , the sister party to Mrs Merkel 's conservative Christian Democratic Union .
The leader of the CSU traditionally plays a prominent role on the national political scene in Germany .
Mr Obama 's suggestion has created a political row in Germany .
Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , of the centre - left Social Democrats , has welcomed the idea of Mr Obama speaking at the gate .
Mr Steinmeier and Mrs Merkel are likely to face each other in an election next year .
The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of Germany 's division and reunification Berlin city officials have also said they would be delighted if Mr Obama spoke at the Brandenburg Gate .
They would have the ultimate say over whether to grant him permission .
Mrs Merkel said earlier in the week that she would not like to see the historical landmark used for " electioneering " .
But a spokesman for the chancellor said " we are confident that we will reach a mutual and good solution which does justice to the interests of all involved " .
Her office , meanwhile , has denied media reports that the White House put pressure on German officials to reject the speech plan .
The Brandenburg Gate became a symbol of Germany 's division - and later reunification - when it was cut off by the Berlin Wall that East Germany 's Communist leaders built in the 1960s .
It was the backdrop for a famous speech by former US President Ronald Reagan in 1987 , when he called on the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall .
Several other US presidents , including John F Kennedy and Bill Clinton , have delivered major speeches in Berlin .

When Japan 's last oriental white stork died in 1971 it was thought that the birds had disappeared forever .
The wetlands where the stork nested had been irrigated , and development damaged its habitat .
But in a remarkable success story , the storks are thriving again after a reintroduction programme .
After more than three decades of extinction , the first captive storks were released into the wild in 2005 .
By 2007 the first chick had hatched , and this year a further nine chicks arrived .
Yoshito Ohsako , who heads the breeding programme at Toyooka , said : " We were so happy when we found the nests .
It 's not so long since we started , and this is real progress ; a lot of people did n't even think we 'd succeed at all . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Japan was forced to do the unthinkable : it had to go back in time .
Aggressive development had driven the birds to extinction , so the only option left was to attempt to return the ecosystem to its pre-1971 state .
The Hyogo district – once the birds ' heartland – bore the scars of heavy industrialisation and modern farming .
Land that was not polluted or developed was used for farming , so the paddyfields which had once supplied plentiful food for fish , frogs and snakes dried up and became contaminated with pesticides .
To make this landscape hospitable again has meant going back to more traditional irrigation systems that allow rivers and ditches to flow into paddyfields .
This creates pools of shallow stagnant water that encourage the ecosystem that the birds can feed on .
Cutting pesticides and using more traditional cultivation methods has also helped make the wetlands less toxic .
Some electricity cables have been put underground to stop the birds flying into them .
Professor Ohsako said : " The connections between the paddyfields and the streams and ditches disappeared .
In our project we reinstated the aquatic connection to create ' fish ways ' , that channelled fish to shallow water . "
The total number of oriental white storks in the world is believed to be as low as 2,500 , with most in China , Korea and Russia .
The renaissance of the birds comes as biodiversity takes centre stage in global politics .
Biodiversity will be high on the agenda today when environment ministers gather for pre-G8 summit talks in Kobe .
Yuri Onodera , of Friends of the Earth Japan , said that while such reintroduction schemes were laudable , Japan lacked commitment to biodiversity on a global scale .
" Japan may be putting energy into conserving its own domestic landscapes , but its commitment internationally is failing , " said Mr Onodera .
" It has been a strong opponent of a binding commitment to global biodiversity ; its domestic commitment has little impact while they are lagging behind on international commitment . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The price of retail gasoline would fall by half , to around $ 2 a gallon , within 30 days of passage of a law to limit speculation in energy markets , four energy analysts told Congress on Monday .
Testifying to a House Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee , Michael Masters of Masters Capital Management said the price of crude oil would drop closer to its marginal cost of around $ 65 to $ 75 a barrel , about half the current $ 135 .
Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. , Edward Krapels of Energy Security Analysis and Roger Diwan of PFC Energy agreed with Masters ' assessment at the hearing .
Other witnesses say speculators are n't a major factor in oil prices , however .
Across the military , the precise dimensions of the problem are elusive , especially since the different branches largely keep their own statistics .
Many studies do not distinguish between service members who have seen battle and those who have not .
What is more , behavior becomes far harder to track when service members leave the military .
Even so , a variety of surveys , as well as anecdotal evidence and rising alarm in many military communities , indicate growing substance abuse among recent combat veterans .
Of particular concern are members of the National Guard and reserves , as well as recently discharged service members , who can lose their bearings outside the camaraderie and structure of the military .
In the Army , which has the bulk of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Pentagon ’s most recent survey of health - related behavior , conducted in 2005 but released last year , found that for the first time in more than 20 years , roughly a quarter of soldiers surveyed considered themselves regular heavy drinkers — defined as having five or more drinks at least once a week .
The report called the increase — to 24.5 percent in 2005 , from 17.2 percent in 1998 — “ an issue of concern . ”
Perhaps the best monitor of recent combat veterans ’ mental health is the Pentagon ’s postdeployment survey .
Reflecting concern about heavy drinking , the latest report , published last November , introduced a question about drinking habits .
Of the 88,235 soldiers surveyed in 2005 and 2006 , three to six months after returning from war , 12 percent of active - duty troops and 15 percent of reservists acknowledged having problems with alcohol .
While drug use decreased substantially after 1980 , when the military cracked down , it has increased slightly in the Army and the Marines since 2002 , the behavioral survey said .
Experts say that , in some cases , troubled combat veterans are more prone to use drugs after leaving the military .
In general , studies find that drinking is more prevalent in the military than in the civilian population ; the behavioral survey reported that heavy drinking among 18 - to 25 - year - old men in the Army and the Marines was almost twice as common as among their civilian counterparts .
Heavy drinking or drug use frequently figures in what law enforcement officials and commanders at military bases across the country say is a rising number of crimes and other examples of misconduct involving soldiers , marines and recent veterans .
A new study has good news for coffee drinkers : Regular coffee drinking ( up to 6 cups per day ) is not associated with increased deaths in either men or women .
In fact , both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption is associated with a somewhat smaller rate of death from heart disease .
" Coffee consumption has been linked to various beneficial and detrimental health effects , but data on its relation with death were lacking , " says Esther Lopez - Garcia , PhD , the study 's lead author .
" Coffee consumption was not associated with a higher risk of mortality in middle - aged men and women .
The possibility of a modest benefit of coffee consumption on heart disease , cancer , and other causes of death needs to be further investigated . "
Women consuming two to three cups of caffeinated coffee per day had a 25 percent lower risk of death from heart disease during the follow - up period ( which lasted from 1980 to 2004 and involved 84,214 women ) as compared with non-consumers , and an 18 percent lower risk of death caused by something other than cancer or heart disease as compared with non-consumers during follow - up .
For men , this level of consumption was associated with neither a higher nor a lower risk of death during the follow - up period ( which lasted from 1986 to 2004 and involved 41,736 men ) .
The researchers analyzed data of 84,214 women who had participated in the Nurses ' Health Study and 41,736 men who had participated in the Health Professionals Follow - up Study .
To be in the current study , participants had to have been free of cancer and heart disease at the start of those larger studies .
The study participants completed questionnaires every two to four years that included questions about how frequently they drank coffee , other diet habits , smoking , and health conditions .
The researchers then compared the frequency of death from any cause , death due to heart disease , and death due to cancer among people with different coffee - drinking habits .
Among women , 2,368 deaths were due to heart disease , 5,011 were due to cancer , and 3,716 were due to another cause .
Among men , 2,049 deaths were due to heart disease , 2,491 were due to cancer , and 2,348 were due to another cause .
While accounting for other risk factors , such as body size , smoking , diet , and specific diseases , the researchers found that people who drank more coffee were less likely to die during the follow - up period .
This was mainly because of lower risk for heart disease deaths among coffee drinkers .
The researchers found no association between coffee drinking and cancer deaths .
These relationships did not seem to be related to caffeine because people who drank decaffeinated coffee also had lower death rates than people who did not drink coffee .
The editors of Annals of Internal Medicine caution that the design of the study does not make it certain that coffee decreases the chances of dying sooner than expected .
Something else about coffee drinkers might be protecting them .
And some measurement error in the assessment of coffee consumption is inevitable because estimated consumption came from self - reports .
This study was supported by National Institutes of Health research grants .
The steep decline in maths exams began in 1990 , the report says School mathematics exams in England have become easier , shallower and less demanding , according to a think tank .
Analysis of public maths exam papers taken by 16 - year - olds between 1951 and 2006 shows standards have declined markedly , the report for Reform argues .
This means more pupils have left school ill - prepared for the workplace and a generation of mathematicians has been lost to the nation 's economy , it adds .
The government insists maths exam standards are very closely monitored .
In today 's Britain it is acceptable to say that you can't do maths
Elizabeth Truss
Reform
The Reform report assesses how maths exam papers changed over time in terms of their content , difficulty , style and pass standard .
It concludes that between 1951 , when O - levels were introduced , and 1970 , standards remained constant with a strong focus on algebra , arithmetic and geometry .
A simplification trend began in the 1980s with an attempt to show mathematics in context , but the syllabus remained comparable to that of earlier years .

But there was a steep decline in standards from 1990 onwards , once GCSEs were introduced , it says .
The content became broader and shallower , with a more restricted and less demanding syllabus , it claims .
And the difficulty and demand of questions weakened along with their style , it claims , with candidates being required to follow a series of steps rather than work their own way through .
Calculators were also allowed in some papers and formulae sheets were included in papers .
Added to that , the percentage mark required for a grade C fell to about 20 % in the higher tier GCSE in 2000 and 2006 .
' Geek to chic '
The report claims that the apparent rise in attainment over the 1990s and 2000s is " highly misleading " .
It is a top government priority to encourage more mathematicians in the future
Jim Knight
Schools Minister " Exams have changed from being a staging - post to further study to being a series of ' tick - boxes ' , " it adds .
This has led to mathematics at university being compromised and able - students being neglected , and has cost the economy billions of pounds in lost mathematicians .
Deputy director of Reform and a co-author of the report Elizabeth Truss said : " In today 's Britain it is acceptable to say that you can't do maths , whereas people would be ashamed to admit they could n't read .
" We need a cultural revolution to transform maths from geek to chic . "
Schools Minister Jim Knight said standards were carefully monitored by an independent watchdog to make sure they remained world - class and were an appropriate preparation for study or work .
Economy
He added that more students were taking maths and further maths at A and AS - level .
" Ucas figures show the number of people who took up places on full time maths degrees has gone up by 9.3 % on last year .
" That is good news , but we agree maths is of vital importance to the economy and it is a top government priority to encourage more mathematicians in the future .
" In addition , we have launched a campaign to encourage more young people to consider careers in maths and science , " he said .
Shadow children 's secretary Michael Gove said the report underlined the importance of mathematics in driving economic growth .
Its stress on the need to nurture the mathematics economy was timely and important , he said .
" India and China are producing four million graduates every year .
The single largest area of graduate growth is mathematics , science and engineering .
" A third of graduates in China are engineers - here it 's just 8 % .
Between 1994 and 2004 , more than 30 % of the physics departments in Britain disappeared . "
Liberal Democrat schools spokesman David Laws said : " This is a damning critique of maths education in this country .
" Our education system is too often failing to get the basics right , which risks damaging the national economy . "

MICHAEL ASHCROFT is a powerful man .
A former treasurer of the Conservative Party , he is now its deputy - chairman .
He is also a very wealthy man — the 65th richest in Britain , according to a rough - and - ready ranking by the Sunday Times .
Through one of his companies , he has given over £ 3 m ( $ 6 m , at today 's rates ) to the Tories in the past five years in cash and kind ( including free flights for the leadership and opinion - poll research ) .
Before the last general election , Lord Ashcroft lent the Tories another £ 3.6 m .
As well as being powerful and rich , Lord Ashcroft is elusive : he is the right - wing pimpernel of British politics , whose name is uttered with awe and terror by Labour MPs .
The mystery partly emanates from Lord Ashcroft 's association with Belize : he spent part of his youth in what was then still British Honduras , subsequently returning to Belize to base some of his business activities there .
Belize is the smallest country on the American mainland , and one of the poorest in the Caribbean ( “ if the world had any ends , ” Aldous Huxley wrote of it , this “ would certainly be one of them ” ) .
If Lord Ashcroft is an influential man in Britain , in Belize he is a colossus .
His holding companies control , among other things , the country 's biggest bank , Belize Bank .
A strange tale involving that bank and Hugo Chávez , Venezuela 's left - wing president , now risks embarrassing the Tory deputy - chairman .
At issue — and now under dispute in assorted ongoing court cases — is a $ 10 m transfer from Venezuela to the government of Belize that has , in effect , ended up in the coffers of Belize Bank .
The bank argues that the money it received constitutes repayment of a government - guaranteed debt ; the current government says Belize Bank had no right to hang on to it and is suing to get it .
The story revolves around a private hospital established by a company called Universal Health Services ( UHS ) , with early financial backing from the government of the day and from Belize Bank .
The UHS hospital is today a surprisingly modest building in a suburb of Belize City .
According to the Ministry of Finance , the firm borrowed money from Belize Bank in 1998 and then from various arms of the government , incurring debts that were transferred between government agencies as they rapidly mounted .
It is unclear why the agencies and Belize Bank continued to lend relatively large sums over an extended period to such an unpromising enterprise , which was never able to meet its repayment obligations .
By December 2004 , says the Ministry of Finance , UHS owed Belize Bank Bz$ 29 m ( $ 14.5 m , or £ 7.7 m ) .
The prime minister of Belize , Said Musa , agreed to guarantee repayment of all UHS 's obligations to Belize Bank ( assuming a guarantee previously issued by Belize 's Development Finance Corporation ) .
The guarantee was signed by Mr Musa and by Francis Fonseca , the attorney - general .
As court papers show , the guarantee was not disclosed publicly and the cabinet was not informed of it .
Further funds were advanced and UHS 's debts continued to mount , to more than Bz$ 33 m by March 2007 , according to court submissions .
A new agreement was reached on March 23rd 2007 in the form of a settlement deed and a loan note signed by Mr Musa and representatives of Belize Bank in the presence of Mr Fonseca .
In it the government promised to repay UHS 's existing obligations to the bank , beginning on April 23rd , and the former open - ended guarantee was discharged .
Any disputes were to be resolved through arbitration in London .
An additional loan facility for Bz$ 12 m was agreed on March 29th .
The GDP of Belize is only $ 1.2 billion ; many of its 300,000 inhabitants live in poverty .
Illiteracy , shanty housing , gang crime and ill health are all sadly common ( the annual budget of its health ministry is less than $ 40 m ) .
So you might think that there would be restraints on the government 's ability to agree to what , in Belizean terms , was an enormous guarantee .
In fact , there were : under section 7 of the Finance and Audit ( Reform ) Act of 2005 , the government required the approval of the National Assembly .
It was not secured .
By this time , the existence of the original guarantee had become known .
The Association of Concerned Belizeans , a pressure group , and others filed suit to prevent the government from paying Belize Bank .
Their lawyer , Lois Young Barrow , the ex-wife of the man who is Belize 's prime minister today , argued that , according to the constitution , the 2004 guarantee should have been taken to cabinet .
When the 2007 deal was revealed , she argued that it violated the 2005 finance act .
Belize Bank , joined to the action as an interested party , tried and failed to quash it on procedural grounds .
It maintained that whatever the status of the 2007 agreement , it was still entitled to its money .
The government 's solicitor - general undertook not to make any payments until the court case was concluded .
As payments from the government were not forthcoming , Belize Bank invoked the arbitration clause in the 2007 loan agreement and opened proceedings in London .
The tribunal held that there was a dispute over which it had jurisdiction but got no further .
By then , according to the party ruling Belize at the time , the unpaid debt totalled some Bz$ 45 m .
As these legal twists and turns were pursued , general elections were nearing in Belize .
The sitting prime minister , Mr Musa , was not favoured to win : he needed money to woo voters .
As subsequent events were to show , Belize Bank was unlikely to be repaid after he left office .
So the government looked for other solutions .
What friends are for
The first was to ask for a hand - out from rich and friendly countries .
Taiwan agreed to help the government of Belize ( one of the few countries with which the Taiwanese have formal diplomatic relations ) .
On September 12th the Taiwanese paid a ( US ) $ 6 m cheque into an account held with Belize Bank in the Turks and Caicos islands , and on October 20th another cheque for $ 4 m was deposited .
Oil -rich Venezuela also obliged .
On December 28th the central bank of Belize received $ 10 m from Venezuela , wired via the Federal Reserve Bank in New York .
In January Venezuela 's generous gift , for housing and a sport stadium , was disclosed to a grateful nation ; a general election was announced and cash frantically dished out to eager voters .
Unbeknownst to the public , however , another $ 10 m pursued a more winding path from Venezuela to Belize .
As court papers show , the funds were transferred on December 28th by the Banco de Desarollo Económico y Social ( BANDES ) , Venezuela 's development bank , to Belize Bank 's account with its correspondent bank in London , Bank of America .
The transfer contained ( in Spanish ) the instructions “ Single disbursement [ to ] GOB ( ie , the government of Belize ) [ for ] construction and repair of housing ” .
On January 24th the money joined the Taiwanese funds in the Turks and Caicos islands .
While this aid was being wrung from public donors , a private - sector buyer for UHS was also sought .
Dr Muthugounder Venugopal was the man eventually fixed upon .
He and his associates ran the Loma Luz hospital in Belize — and he reportedly raised Bz$ 5 m in the form of a loan from Belize Bank .
A bewildering array of trusts and companies and a joint venture variously registered in the British Virgin Islands , Turks and Caicos , and St Kitts and Nevis was used to convey much of the money thus assembled to Belize Bank .
On January 30th Belize Healthcare Partners , owned by a joint venture essentially between Dr Venugopal 's Venny Group and a new Belize Healthcare Charitable Trust , paid Belize Bank Bz$ 39 m — almost the combined total of Taiwan 's grants and the secret transfer from Venezuela — to buy UHS 's assets , and a further Bz$ 6 m to other creditors and suppliers .
This secret Venezuelan transfer was not made public — until Mr Musa , despite the hand - out , lost the election on February 7th : he is now threatened by a host of corruption allegations , including some involving dodgy loans by development agencies .
The day after he was swept from power , the new rulers of Belize were , they say , asked by Venezuela for an accounting of its $ 20 m gift .
The central bank of Belize demanded that Belize Bank hand over the Venezuelans ' second $ 10 m and display its authorisation for not coughing up the Taiwanese funds .
In its report on the matter sent to Belize Bank on March 31st it charges the bank with various irregularities .
For its part Belize Bank has challenged in court the central bank 's directives .
The government of Belize , under its new prime minister , Dean Barrow , wants good relations with Belize 's largest commercial bank and with Lord Ashcroft .
But it also wants what it sees as its money back .
On April 10th the government sued the bank for the return of the Venezuelan $ 10 m .
( Referring to the former government 's secret agreements , Mr Barrow told the assembly on April 25th that “ The days of doing things in the dark behind the backs of the Belizean people in order to screw the Belizean people are over . ” )
What is the truth of the matter ?
Philip Johnson , the chairman of Belize Bank , says in a letter to The Economist only that “ a further settlement was reached which allowed monies to be made available for the purchase of the assets of UHS . ”
He insists that the guarantees were legal , and claims that Belize Bank in fact received less than it was entitled to .
As to the transfer instructions from Venezuela specifying that the funds be paid to the government of Belize for housing , his bank “ was not privy to the arrangements between the Governments of Belize and Venezuela ” ( though , as the deposit was made into Belize Bank 's correspondent account in London , it seems odd that the bankers should have been unaware of Venezuela 's instructions ) .
A different interpretation is summarised by Mark Espat , a minister under Mr Musa who lost his cabinet job for opposing the guarantee .
Money , he says , was “ diverted from its intended purpose to honour a debt that should never have been agreed in the first place ” .
They seek him here , seek him there
Lord Ashcroft 's Belizean existence has caused him trouble before now .
When he was ennobled in 2000 , the Tories said he would assume permanent residence in Britain — fulfilling the inverted principle of no representation without taxation .
His nomination for a peerage had previously been rejected , partly , it is thought , because of his tax status .
It remains unclear whether that pledge has been fulfilled ; his attendance in the Lords has been infrequent .
And as the UHS row demonstrates , he is as controversial a figure in his adoptive homeland as he is in what is theoretically his real one .
The Economist sought his comments on Belize Bank 's involvement in the affair , but none has been forthcoming from him or from his aides .
So Lord Ashcroft 's own role in the matter , if any , remains unclear .
But Belize Bank is owned by a holding company of which he is the majority shareholder and executive chairman .
His son runs Belize Bank in the Turks and Caicos .
Meanwhile , Lord Ashcroft and his fortune continue to exert huge influence on British politics .
Exploiting a clause in party - funding laws that allows unlimited campaign spending before an election period , he is funding aggressive campaigns by prospective
Tory candidates in key marginal constituencies — a tactic that reaped big benefits at the 2005 election .
Almost two years after it paid $ 1.65 bn ( £ 848 m ) for the YouTube video - sharing site , Google still has not worked out how to make money from the business , its chairman and chief executive conceded , even though hundreds of millions of people visit it every day .
In a public interview in San Francisco yesterday , Eric Schmidt said that Google while wants to change the world , it had yet to transform YouTube into a money - spinner .
" The goal of the company is not to monetise everything , our goal is to change the world – monetisation is a technology to pay for it , " he said .
It " seemed obvious " there should be " significant amounts of money " to be made from YouTube , he added , but the company has not yet come up with the formula .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
While Google remains committed to retaining its hugely successful model of offering all services for free , the question of how sites such as YouTube can make the most of their enormous success does not yet have a satisfactory answer .
Mr Schmidt 's admissions may come as a relief to critics who have become increasingly anxious about Google 's worldwide dominance of the internet .
Despite Google 's much - vaunted " do n't be evil " corporate slogan – which Mr Schmidt said was a joke designed to provoke internal ethical debate – the company 's meteoric expansion into , most significantly , the online advertising market , is causing concerns about privacy for individuals and commercial organisations .
Still , Google is certainly looking for ways to make money from YouTube .
It is due to launch video - based advertising of an unspecified new type on the site in the coming months , having already tried using banners and " in video " ads .
Although Mr Schmidt rejected accusations of market dominance on the grounds that Google only leads the market in search advertising – Yahoo wins on display ads – it is the future that worries both his company 's rivals and some of its customers .
Google takes a massive 85 per cent share of search advertising , and pockets some 50 per cent of the UK 's total online advertising spend , which includes display , search and classified .
Not content with auctioning sponsored links to run alongside its searches , Google is also taking over other links in the chain .
The $ 3.1 bn ( £ 1.6 bn ) takeover of DoubleClick that was cleared by regulators this spring , for example , creates a platform linking to any number of individual , smaller sites , as well as providing Google with an unprecedented amount of commercial data .
Google 's dominance has also acted as a catalyst for an internet landgrab as technology companies such as Yahoo and Microsoft rush to reinvent themselves as advertising platforms – Yahoo through the $ 300 m purchase of BlueLithium , Microsoft by buying Acquantive for $ 6bn – as the only way to hope to compete .
" Google is establishing a vast advertising ecosystem , " said Nigel Gwilliam , of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising .
Seven Iraqi athletes from five different sports qualified for the Olympics Athletes from Iraq have been banned from taking part at this summer 's Beijing Games , the International Olympic Committee has announced .
The team was already the subject of an interim ban after the Iraqi government replaced the country 's Olympic committee with its own appointees .
Under the IOC charter , all committees must be free of political influence .
Iraq had been planning to send a team of at least seven athletes to the Olympics which start on 8 August .
Two rowers , a weightlifter , a sprinter , a discus thrower , a judoka and an archer were in the frame for the trip to Beijing .
" The deadline for taking up places for Beijing for all sports except athletics has now passed , " said IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies .
" The IOC very sadly has now to acknowledge that it is likely there will be no Iraqi presence at the Beijing Olympic Games , despite our best efforts . "
She added : " Clearly , we 'd very much like to have seen Iraq 's athletes in Beijing .
" We are very disappointed that the athletes have been so ill - served by their own government 's actions . "
The four Iraqi athletes that qualified could have competed under the Olympic flag
BBC Radio 5 Live 's Gordon Farquhar Hussein al - Amidi , the general secretary of the Iraqi Olympic Committee , said : " This morning we were informed of the final decision of the International Olympic Committee to suspend the membership of the Iraqi Olympic Committee .
" It 's a final decision , there is no way to appeal .
This means that Iraq will not take part in the coming Olympic games .
" It is a blow to Iraq and its international reputation , its athletes and its youth .
" I swear those athletes who have been training - they phoned me today and they were crying and were very upset . "
The Iraq government dissolved the National Olympic Committee in May and the interim IOC ban was put in place on 4 June .
Davies added that the Iraqi government had been asked to travel to Switzerland to meet the IOC to discuss possible remedies but failed to do so .
The committee which the government dismissed was elected in 2004 , in line with the Olympic movement 's regulations .
The Iraqi government said it took the decision to appoint a new committee because the previous one was corrupt and had not been functioning properly .
But the move has been widely seen as another example of Shia officials wresting administrative power from Sunnis .
Among the government 's claims against the committee was that it was illegitimate because it lacked enough members for a legal quorum .
Four members of the committee , including its chief Ahmad al - Samarra'i , were kidnapped two years ago and their fates remain unknown .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
For the second time in three days , Sen .
Hillary Clinton told reporters that the pledged delegates awarded based on vote totals in their state are not bound to abide by election results .
Sen. Hillary Clinton lags behind Sen. Barack Obama in the popular vote and in pledged delegates .
It 's an idea that has been floated by her or a campaign surrogate nearly half a dozen times this month .
Sen . Barack Obama leads Clinton among all Democratic delegates , 1,622 to 1,485 , in the latest CNN count .
Among pledged delegates , Obama leads Clinton 1,413 to 1,242 .
" Every delegate with very few exceptions is free to make up his or her mind however they choose , " Clinton told Time 's Mark Halperin in an interview published Wednesday .
" We talk a lot about so - called pledged delegates , but every delegate is expected to exercise independent judgment , " she said .
Clinton 's remarks echoed her Monday comments to the editorial board of the Philadelphia Daily News .
" And also remember that pledged delegates in most states are not pledged , " she said Monday .
" You know there is no requirement that anybody vote for anybody .
They 're just like superdelegates . "
Clinton also made similar comments in a Newsweek interview published two weeks ago .
The last time a major candidate lobbied pledged delegates to switch sides was at the 1980 convention , when Ted Kennedy 's campaign tried to recruit delegates who arrived at the convention supporting eventual nominee Jimmy Carter .
After that battle , the Democratic Party altered a provision that required pledged delegates to support the candidate they had arrived at the convention to back .
Clinton advisers have cited the altered rule , which dates to 1982 and says only that pledged delegates " shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them . "
The same year , The Democratic Party created a new category of delegate -- the so - called " superdelegates " -- party leaders and elected officials who are free to support any candidate they wish , regardless of vote totals in their home states .
Some states require their delegates to support the candidate they are pledged to but most do not .
Earlier this month , Clinton adviser Harold Ickes first raised the prospect that pledged delegates were not legally bound to vote as election results indicate -- an idea that has drawn sharp criticism from supporters of rival Obama .
Watch more on the candidates ' dust up »
" Despite repeated denials , the Clinton campaign has again admitted that they will go to any length to win , " Obama spokesman Bill Burton said again Wednesday .
The Clinton campaign has said that they had not been planning to try to actively convince the Illinois senator 's pledged delegates to switch sides and would not do so in the future .
But on a conference call with reporters Tuesday , Ickes defended Clinton 's Monday remarks and repeated his view that pledged delegates were free to switch their allegiance at any time .
" I think what Mrs. Clinton was trying to make clear was that no delegate is required by party rules to vote for the candidate for which they 're pledged , " said Ickes .
" I mean obviously circumstances can change , and people 's minds can change about the viability of a particular candidate and that 's permitted now under our rules ever since the 1980 convention . "
He added that although the rules permitted them to campaign pledged delegates to switch sides , they had not engaged in such an effort .
The timing of the latest round of comments was not an accident , according to veteran Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf .
" It keeps them in play .
It makes party players understand that they 're serious , and they 'll stay in the game , " Sheinkopf said .
He added that party insiders were likely to view the threat merely as a bargaining chip by an extraordinarily seasoned political team .
Clinton spokesman Phil Singer dismissed the criticism entirely .
" I do n't think she floated that idea .
I think she was repeating the idea , " he told reporters Monday .
" Simply stating a fact I do n't think is a cause for hysteria . "

Gordon Brown and President George Bush have warned Iran to accept their " offers of partnership " or face tough sanctions and international isolation .
The UK prime minister said he wanted to maintain a dialogue with Tehran , but if Iran ignores UN resolutions then sanctions would be intensified .
Europe would freeze overseas assets of Iran 's biggest bank and impose new oil and gas sanctions , he said .
But the EU foreign policy chief said no new sanctions had so far been agreed .
Javier Solana was speaking after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg .
Iran 's nuclear ambitions Mr Brown and Mr Bush were speaking at a press conference after talks in London .
The trip is part of Mr Bush 's European tour - although he dismissed reports that it would be his last before leaving office as " speculation " .
In their talks on Monday the two leaders discussed issues including Iraq and Afghanistan , Burma and Zimbabwe and oil and food prices .
Iran has been accused of not co-operating with the UN over its nuclear programme , amid fears it is enriching uranium to use in weapons .
The prime minister said the Iranians did not have to choose a " path of confrontation " and Britain would do " everything possible " to maintain dialogue with Tehran .
They face serious isolation and the people who are suffering are the Iranian people
President Bush

President Bush said Tehran 's demand for nuclear power for civilian purposes was " justifiable " - but could be met by Russia 's offer to supply them with fuel .
In a message to Tehran , he said : " You bet you have a sovereign right , absolutely , but you do n't have the trust of those of us who have watched you carefully when it comes to enriching uranium . "
Mr Brown said Britain would urge Europe to impose " further sanctions " on Iran and Europe would take action to freeze the overseas assets of the country 's biggest bank and impose new sanctions on oil and gas .
Troop numbers President Bush thanked Mr Brown for his " strong statement " and added : " The Iranians must understand that when we come together and speak with one voice we are serious . "
Let me thank President Bush for being a true friend of Britain

He said pressure was necessary to " solve this problem diplomatically " - but added : " Iranians must understand , however , that all options are on the table . "
Mr Brown , who became prime minister a year ago , and President Bush , who leaves office in six months ' time , also discussed Afghanistan , with Mr Brown announcing there would be an increase in British troop numbers .
Mr Brown described the US president as a " true friend of Britain " while President Bush praised Mr Brown for being " tough on terror " and said it was in " all our interests " to help people in Afghanistan and Iraq .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Unless he comes on bended knees begging for forgiveness , I do n't think it will achieve very much - just wasting more of the US taxpayers ' money .

And he dismissed reports of a split between the UK and US on troop numbers in Iraq as " typical " .
" He 's left more troops in Iraq than initially anticipated and like me , we will be making our decisions based on conditions on the ground ... without an artificial timetable . "
President Bush said history would judge whether the military tactics could have been different in Iraq , but he stood by the decision to remove Saddam Hussein as the right one for " our security " , for peace and for 25 million Iraqis .
He said it was important to support democracy " at the heart of the Middle East " .
" It 's a democracy that 's not going to look like America , it 's not going to look like Great Britain , but it 's a democracy that will give government responsive to the people . "
He said it had " absolutely " been worth it and democracy in Iraq would make it easier to deal with " the Iranian issue " and would send a message to reformers and dissidents .
He dismissed the idea that " perhaps freedom is not universal - maybe it's only western people who can self govern " as " the ultimate form of political elitism " .
After the press conference in Downing Street , Mr Bush and Mr Brown travelled to Stormont , Belfast , for talks with Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson and his deputy , Martin McGuinness .

How would you respond if you had paid Google $ 136.11 for advertising that appeared not on quality sites like The New York Times , but on parked domains and error pages ?
If you were lawyer Hal Levitte , you might file a federal lawsuit in California over Google 's behavior and then seek class - action status for the claim .
That 's exactly what Levitte did on July 11 , when his lawyer filed a complaint against Google ( first reported by Information Week ) .
The complaint , a copy of which was provided to Ars Technica , argues that Google is guilty of " unjust enrichment " by promising high - quality ad placements and then serving a substantial portion of ads on low - quality sites .
Levitte learned this the hard way in 2007 , when he mounted an $ 887.67 campaign to promote his law practice 's web site .
Levitte hoped the click - throughs would generate phone calls , e-mails , and filled - in online forms , but he was surprised at the number of clicks that came from parked domains and errors .
According to the lawsuit , 16.3 percent of all the clicks in the campaign came from such sites , but not a single one of those clicks led to a conversion .
" These websites result in a lower conversion rate than standard search traffic or websites with actual content on them , " says the complaint .
The suit claims that it was difficult to opt out of having ads placed on such sites until March 2008 ; after that date , Google provided a way to opt into third - party sites while excluding error sites and parked domains , but this option was buried " four clicks deep within [ Google 's ] interface , where many advertisers would not notice it . "
Levitte claims that Google never made clear to him that his ads would appear on error sites and parked domains and is guilty of fraudulent advertising .
He contacted the company , which looked into the situation and determined that the clicks which had come from those parked and error sites were legitimate , even if they resulted in no conversions .
Although the policy has since been changed , and although Levitte only spent about a hundred dollars on such sites , his suit seeks class - action status for everyone in the US with an AdWords account over the last four years ( assuming that at least one ad impression appeared on a parked or error site ) .
If the judge allows it , that could be a terrifically large class .

( CNN ) --
A missionary family from Minnesota is glad to be alive and together after surviving a plane crash in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the father said Wednesday .
From left : April , Barry , Keith , Marybeth and Andrew Mosier , with Marybeth 's mother , Dorothy Burghart .
Barry and Marybeth Mosier were on their way to visit their son Keith , 24 , in Kinsangani , Congo , with two younger children when their plane crashed on takeoff Tuesday in Goma .
At least 36 people died as the plane plowed through a market and burned .
Most of the people who died were on the ground , according to the U.N. mission in DR Congo .
April Mosier , 14 , managed to escape quickly , her father said from Goma .
" April raced ahead , and she got to the front of the plane as one of the first people , I think , " said Barry Mosier , 53 .
The girl encountered a man who was tearing through an opening in the fuselage , Mosier said .
" He was pulling parts of the plane in or pushing them out , trying to make a hole .
And she told him -- she speaks Swahili well -- she said , ' We 've got to get a hole in this plane , or we 're all going to die . ' " Watch as Barry Mosier describes the chaos »
When the hole was big enough , April tried to dive through it .
She made it with a push from the man , and other passengers followed , he said .
Meanwhile , Mosier said , he and his wife were carrying their son Andrew , 3 , in the shoving " mass of humanity " trying to escape the burning plane .
They got out through the opening in the fuselage .
The child 's leg was broken in the crush of people , but his parents did n't realize it until later .
April became separated from her parents and was whisked away to a hospital , convinced that her family was dead , her father said .
" Outside the plane , she was wandering around .
...
It was total chaos , " he said .
" People were screaming and yelling because the plane had landed on this market .
All of a sudden , out of the blue , all of these people who were just standing there are now dead .
" So there 's parts of bodies and people burning and people screaming and yelling , and she was out there by herself . "
About 25 minutes later , the Mosiers were reunited at the hospital .
" When we saw each other at the hospital , I can tell you , it was a grand reunion , " he said .
The Mosiers , who have been Seventh - day Adventist missionaries in Iringa , Tanzania , for eight years , went to the church office in Goma to let Keith and other loved ones -- including two other grown children in the U.S. -- know that they were all right .
While there , someone noticed that Andrew 's leg was swollen , and the Mosiers returned to the hospital .
They learned that Andrew 's femur was broken near the hip , and he is now in a cast that reaches from his toes to his rib cage , Barry Mosier said .
" He does n't like it very well , as most 3 - year - olds would n't , " Mosier said .
The family will recuperate in Goma for a few days before deciding whether to resume the trip to Kisangani , where Keith Mosier has been a volunteer missionary for two months , Barry Mosier said .
" But flying here is not a popular thing to talk about just now , " he said wryly .
Andrew has made up his mind , his father said .
" He says he does n't want to ride in airplanes anymore , " he said .
Marybeth Mosier , 51 , suffered a black eye and bruised ribs , said her husband , who added that he was unhurt .
" We could n't believe that our family of four could all escape a plane that was crashed and on fire , but by God 's mercy , we did , " he said .
Mosier said he believes the family made it for a reason .
" I think the Lord has a plan for us , otherwise we would n't have survived , " he said .
" He still has work for us to do . "
And that work just might be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
" We actually came here with the idea of seeing if we could move here to Congo , so it 's been kind of a rough introduction , " Mosier said .
" I think we 'll keep praying about that .
We know that the safest place in the world to work is where the Lord wants you to work . "

Apparently not in Bay Shore , Long Island resident Eric Stetz 's lease : Being able to set homemade booby traps to make sure unwanted people stay out .
Stetz was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment for a vicious - looking booby trap his super found .
Apparently Stetz 's super had told him in advance that a Verizon agent needed to access his apartment on Thursday , but no one was around when they knocked .
Newsday reports the " super went to open the door , felt resistance and found the rigged contraption " -- a big knife duct - taped to a crutch , which was installed with an elastic cord .
The super was not injured .
Stetz also had another similar trap at his bedroom door .
A police officer told the Post , " It was a real crude setup .
Somehow , you push the door open , the strings get tighter , and [ the knives ] snap into you . "
His mother told Newsday that squatters who lived in the building " made him paranoid and fearful he would be robbed .
Freda Stetz said , " It was a stupid thing to do and he 'll never do it again . "
Her son , who reportedly asked investigators " Did anyone get hurt with my knives ?
I wish they did , " was released on bail .
Lack of zoning has paid off for Houston
During the past year , I 've made several appearances on television news programs to talk about the housing crisis .
My role was that of the straight man .
Typically , the shows would have three journalists from different regions of the country — one from the Northeast , one from the West Coast and me .
After the doom - and - gloom pronouncements from the coasts , I would come on and say , " Things are n't so bad here in Houston . "
Houston has remained on the sidelines of the latest national financial crisis .
Our housing prices have n't plunged , just as they did n't soar as the national housing bubble inflated .
Our prices remained modest , if you believe the conventional wisdom , because we have a secret ingredient : plenty of land .
An abundance of open space by itself , though , may not be what protected us .
Texas , after all , experienced an ugly real estate implosion in the late 1980s .
In a report issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas ' Houston branch , senior economist Bill Gilmer found another reason Houston has been shielded from the country 's real estate crisis : the lack of zoning .
Gilmer 's findings are worth considering as the zoning debate rages anew .
From an economic perspective , zoning laws work as a constriction of supply , which played a role in rising housing prices in other parts of the country .
" It raises the price of new - home construction , " Gilmer said .
" Those supply restrictions began the process of price increases . "
Speculators finish the job , inflating the housing bubble with demand for mortgage securities that encourage ever - riskier lending practices .
As housing demand has increased , cities with tight zoning laws saw a steep rise in prices because of limited supply .
Rising prices ultimately extinguish demand , as we 're now seeing with the collapse of the mortgage market .
Construction met demand
In Houston , however , demand was met with new construction rather than rising prices .
As a result , when the real estate bubble burst , the effects on Houston were less severe than elsewhere .
As of January , about 4 percent of Texas homes backed by subprime loans were in foreclosure , according to the Fed .
That compares with 11.5 percent for California and 14.4 percent for Florida .
That 's not to say we 've been immune .
For the first four months of the year , foreclosures in the Houston area were almost 17 percent higher than a year earlier , according to Foreclosure Information and Listing Service .
Houston 's combination of available , unrestricted land and municipal utility districts to fund infrastructure have allowed it to grow at a lower cost than other metropolitan areas , Gilmer said .
" A lot of cities want to force you into particular patterns of development , " he said .
The higher prices that come with zoning essentially close some of the most desirable neighborhoods to all but the wealthiest homeowners .
Shock , disbelief
Gilmer said he 's often surprised by the reaction of colleagues in other cities when he discusses Houston 's housing prices .
" They do not believe housing could be that cheap , " he said .
" It 's a tremendous draw for people who are locked out of communities in San Francisco , where they have to commute two or three hours each way . "
Of course , Houston 's lack of zoning is something that outsiders view as , well , crazy for a city our size .
I must admit that before I moved here , I was among them .
After all , who wants to see their property values fall because a neighbor opens a nightclub or an auto repair shop in a residential neighborhood ?
Many neighborhoods , though , already have deed restrictions or homeowners associations that address such concerns , Gilmer said .
Zoning , by comparison , is designed to regulate development on a broader scale , which is why it can become exclusionary , he said .
As homeowners , many of us do n't mind the higher prices that come with building restrictions .
We like to see the value of our real estate investment rise .
Cost of zoning
The question for Houston becomes whether the cost of zoning is worth the benefit .
Gilmer 's study , released earlier this year , is a reminder that the real secret ingredient in Houston 's economic recipe is affordable housing , not just abundant land .
Not only do our housing prices make Houston attractive for relocations , it means that residents spend less of their income on housing , so they have more to spend on other things .
" It 's a big driver of our growth , " Gilmer said .
" There are n't a whole lot of places that can offer a big city life and affordable housing . "
That 's something I never get to talk about on TV .
As the straight man , I do n't get to deliver the punch line .

WE KNOW about good and bad fats .
Now suspicion is growing that not all sugars are created equal either .
Overweight adults who consume large amounts of fructose have been found to experience alarming changes in body fat and insulin sensitivity that do not occur after eating glucose .
Pure fructose is found in fresh fruit , fruit juice and preserves .
But much of it sneaks into our diets though high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) in soft drinks – which gets broken down into 55 per cent fructose and 45 per cent glucose in the body – or via sucrose ( ordinary sugar ) , which is …
Quite some time ago , I set out to work through the course materials at MIT ’s OpenCourseWare website for the introductory Computer Science course Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs .
I wanted to tackle the fundamental CS concepts that the course presented , but I also wanted to learn Scheme , the elegant Lisp dialect that SICP uses to illustrate its concepts .
I was lucky enough to have some excellent help from a group of people who wanted to work through the course together .
However , the going got tough , pressing business pressed , and soon I was stopped .
Last month , I got started again .
I worked through the environment model , which is itself worthy of a post , but what I ’d like to discuss right now is the section on object - oriented programming , which surprised and then delighted me .
Not only is OOP possible yet cumbersome in Scheme , but its very cumbersomeness has given me a deeper understanding of OOP than I ’ve gotten from object - oriented languages .
Object - oriented programming in … Scheme ?
There was a time when I thought object - oriented programming had developed straight out of procedural , imperative programming .
I also did n’t really separate OOP mentally from the languages that implemented it .
C++ and Java were OOP for me .
My understanding grew a bit more sophisticated in time , as I came to understand that most languages could model classes , let you define objects , implement inheritance , and all that practical stuff .
But I was still thinking about implementations , really .
It was a surface understanding .
When I got to the lectures on OOP in SICP , and the project that involved implementing a simple game using OOP , I was n’t sure what to expect .
Scheme is a functional programming language , I thought .
It was n’t even natural to work with variables in Scheme the way I did in other languages : how would class definitions work ?
The answer was twofold .
Implementation - wise , objects would be created out of procedures , using the concept of the closed procedure that had been illustrated earlier in the course in a curious reimplementation of the cons function .
But more important than the intriguing “ how ” stuff was the way OOP was conceived in the course materials — as fundamentally concerned with state and message - passing .
OOP fundamentals : state and behavior
It ’s pretty easy to get to thinking about OOP as all about class definitions and inheritance trees .
But the state and behavior of objects are the essentials .
The OOP System ( OOPS , as the course materials ’ jokily called it ) maintains state with closed procedures .
Here is an example :
( define ( make - named - object name ) ( lambda ( message ) ( cond ( ( eq ? message ' name ) ( lambda ( self ) name ) ) ( else ( no - method name ) ) ) ) )
( All examples that I use are from a sample problem set publicly - available at the course ’s site . )
This code snippet is a constructor : when executed it returns a procedure ( marked by the internal lambda statement ) that is ready to respond to requests for specific behavior .
There ’s no class or keyword or explicit method definition .
But if we define a variable using make - named - object , passing it a certain string for a name , and then we invoke the procedure pointed to by the variable with the argument ‘ name , then we ’ll get back another procedure that will return the name .
We can define another variable with make - named - object , with its own name , and we can then ask it for the name back .
Both variables will have the same behavior , but return different information — they ’re saving different states .
A more complicated example , the procedure make - mobile - object , shows a simple inheritance setup and some more interesting behavior :
( define ( make - mobile - object name location ) ( let ( ( named - obj ( make - named - object name ) ) ) ( lambda ( message ) ( cond ( ( eq ? message ' place ) ( lambda ( self ) location ) ) ... ( ( eq ? message ' set - place ) ( lambda ( self new - place ) ( set! location new - place ) ' place - set ) ) ( else ( get - method named - obj message ) ) ) ) ) )
First , a variable named - obj is defined by calling make - named - object , the procedure we just examined .
This becomes a reference to a named - object , a procedure that implements the named - object ’s state and behavior .
The name passed to the make - mobile - object procedure is passed on to make - named - object : that procedure will handle the state of the name .
Notice the last line of the make - mobile - object procedure : any message that our mobile - object does not know how to handle will be passed to the named - object .
The message ‘ name , for instance , will cause the named object to return a procedure that will in turn return the object ’s name .
This is how a mobile object inherits the state and behavior of a named object .
A mobile object will also respond to the messages ‘ place and ‘ set - place .
The first returns a procedure for the object ’s location and the second returns a procedure that will update the object with a new location .
Setter and getter .
This works because the location is closed by the make - mobile - object procedure and the procedure that it returns .
“ location ” points to a bit of computer memory , and set !
lets us change the data at that memory .
The closure allows the returned procedure to remember this pointer from one execution to the next .
Asking objects to behave
Note how each object ( which is just a procedure ) responds to messages by returning other procedures .
These innermost procedures are essentially methods .
It ’s important to understand that passing the message in this OOP system does not trigger the “ methods ” .
They must still be evaluated , often with specific arguments , like the new location expected by the location - setter method .
You may have noticed that in the definitions of make - named - object and make - mobile - object the returned procedure expects an argument “ self ” .
Why ?
Because the authors of the OOPS wanted to make it easier to trigger the “ methods ” and to handle in a consistent way the case in which an object cannot respond to a message .
So they created a general way for messages to be passed to objects that allows them to build in some robustness .
They have written a procedure called ask :
( define ( ask object message . args ) ( let ( ( method ( get - method object message ) ) ) ( if ( method ? method ) ( apply method ( cons object args ) ) ( error " No method " message ( cadr method ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( get - method object message ) ( object message ) )
The ask procedure first uses get - method to ask the object for the “ method ” procedure that corresponds to the message .
If the method is not found , a special “ no - method ” value ( defined elsewhere ) is returned , and ask will recognize the value and act accordingly .
But if a valid method is returned , Scheme ’s apply procedure ( hmm , or is it a macro ? ) triggers the method procedure , passing it first a reference to the object from which the method was extracted , and then any arguments passed along to ask .
Because of ask , we can do this :
( define book ( make - mobile - thing ' SICP office ) ( ask book ' name ) ==> SICP ( ask book ' set - place bag ) ( ask ( ask book ' place ) ' name ) == > bag
Since bag is an object , we have to ask its name if we want the name of our book ’s location .
OK , so ?
You may be asking why this is so great .
Coding this way is a lot of trouble compared with coding in an OOP - optimized language like Java or Ruby .
Well , there are two reasons why I loved working with Scheme and OOP this way .
First , having to wire up the state - management and message - passing mechanisms made me focus on these fundamentals in a way that ‘ easier ’ languages save you from .
So I got a much deeper appreciation for them than I had before .
I wo n’t be programming my next OOP application in Scheme , but I think I ’ll have a better idea of what I ’m doing no matter what language I ’m using .
Second , there are complicated issues in OOP , like multiple inheritance or method inheritance , that you do n’t really grasp until you ’re actually implementing them .
In the case of method inheritance , the lecture notes on the OCW site offer up as an example a system with a person “ class ” and several subclasses that inherit from person : students , professors , and arrogant professors .
Any objects defined as people , students , professors , or arrogant professors can speak .
Professors and arrogant professors can lecture .
Arrogant professors preface anything they say with “ Obviously ” .
It ’s useful to base the implementation of the behavior “ lecture ” on the behavior “ say ” , which is defined in the superclass person , but it gets complicated when arrogant professors have this unique “ say ” behavior .
It becomes clear that there ’s a difference bewteen delegating to a superclass method and invoking that method on the object itself and then letting method inheritance play out .
( The latter approach is the one that ask implements ) .
These concepts are not easy to get your head around if you ’re using a language optimized for OOP in which these kinds of decisions are handled for you .
Once you ’ve taken a shot at setting them up yourself , you get a better idea of what ’s going on out of your sight .
Epilogue : OOP in Lisp
Of course , I know better now about OOP being invented by C++ or Java .
Not only was a little work done on OOP in Palo Alto once upon a time , but Lisp was an early language for OOP experimentation and development .
CLOS is a sophisticated OOPS :-) for example .
It only goes to show how right Abelson was to call Lisp a lousy language for solving most problems but an excellent one for building new languages to solve problems .
The Arctic ice cap is in trouble .
Due to global warming , summer sea ice cover has been disappearing at approximately 70,000 km2 per year , an area the size of Scotland .
Measurements from submarines indicate that the ice has grown thinner by at least 40 % over the last two decades .
Predictions of if and when the permanent ice will disappear from the Arctic vary widely , but few models give it longer than 100 years and many predict that a total melt - down of the Arctic will occur within our lifetimes .
This image compares the average sea ice extent for September 2007 to that of September 2005 .
The magenta line indicates the long - term median from 1979 to 2000 .
This image is from the NSIDC Sea Ice Index .
This is not just troubling news for the North Pole .
" There is a lot of feedback between Arctic sea ice and climate systems in general , " says Peter Wadhams , Head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the University of Cambridge .
" As the ice area decreases you 're replacing an area of white , which reflects about 90 % of the solar radiation , by open water , which reflects less than 10 % .
As the sea ice retreats you 're absorbing a lot more radiation and this increases the rate of warming at high latitudes . "
This effect can raise the global average rate of warming by 20 % .
And there are more knock - on effects .
The marine eco-system will change dramatically with many species , from the Polar bear to tiniest bacteria and zoo plankton , facing extinction .
Melting areas of permafrost will release trapped greenhouse gases like methane — this effect has already been observed in the Pacific Ocean and on the Siberian continental shelves — driving on global warming .
As surface temperatures increase , more ice will melt and sea levels rise .
Sea ice also helps drive the Gulf Stream , the ocean current responsible for the mild climate in North - Western Europe .
As the ice forms in areas of the central Greenland Sea , it rejects salt , creating a layer of high - density water .
This water then sinks and the resulting convection gives rise to a global ocean current system known as the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt .
If the ice fails to form , the Gulf Stream could slow down .
" Some of the implications of an ice free Arctic have n't even been dreamed up yet , " says Wadhams , " The modelling of the impacts is still in quite a primitive state . "
Peter Wadhams and one of the submarines that takes him below the ice .
If the recent warming in global temperatures is human - made — as scientists now accept — it 's ironic to note that an ice free Arctic will provide new opportunity for human intervention .
In the summer the Arctic will become accessible to oil exploration and fishing , and act as a shipping short - cut between Europe and Japan .
Geo-political conflict may well be on the cards .
To prepare for the effects of climate change , not to mention to try and halt or even reverse them , we need to know for how long the Arctic ice cap will be around , and we need to know it fast .
Mathematical modelling of sea ice behaviour can provide this much - needed glimpse into the future .
And although comprehensive ice - ocean - climate models are complex beasts indeed , some relatively simple maths can give us a glimpse of the kind of challenges that scientists face .
How does ice grow ?
Sea ice is subject to a huge range of influences : air and water temperature , ocean currents and wind , to name but a few .
But let 's leave reality aside for the moment and ask some very simple questions .
How would a layer of ice behave if temperature was the only factor to consider ?
How fast would it grow and is there a limit to the thickness it can reach ?
Figure 1 : A simple model of ice growth .
To build a simple model , imagine a round slab of ice of uniform thickness and surface area of , say , 1m2 floating on a column of water .
Above the ice we have a column of air .
We 'll assume that the air has a constant temperature below the freezing point of sea water .
The temperature of the water below the ice is of course above the freezing point .
Now the warmer sea water will transfer energy through the ice into the air above in the form of heat , measured in joules .
Letting stand for heat and for time , Fourier 's law of heat conduction tells us that the rate of heat transfer is given by the differential equation
where is the thermal conductivity of the ice , is the thickness of the ice , and and are the temperatures at the ice / water interface and the ice / air interface respectively .
We 'll assume that the latter two values remain constant as time passes .
As the sea water below the ice loses heat , some of it — a layer on the water surface — will freeze .
There is a simple linear relationship between heat loss and the mass of the layer :
whereis the latent heat of sea water , in other words the amount of heat loss required to freeze 1 kilogram of it .
Now the mass of a layer of water is equal to its density times its volume .
Density varies with temperature , but we will assume that in a thin layer close to the ice / water interface temperature is constant ( around freezing point ) .
Since a cross section of our water column has surface area 1 , we have that is equal to times times the height of the layer .
Thus , as the water loses joules in heat through the ice layer , the ice thickness grows by an amount , giving
Combining this with equation ( 1 ) above , we get the differential equationA solution to this is the functionwhereis the initial thickness sof the ice layer .
Do n't worry about the various constants in this expression .
The important bit of information is the fact that ice thickness grows with timelike the square root of
Despite its simplicity , the model picks out some of the main features of ice growth .
As the ice thickness increases , the rate of growth slows , reflecting the fact that cracks in the ice will try and " heal " themselves by growing faster than the surrounding thicker ice .
An ice field of varying thickness will try to become level as thin ice grows more rapidly than thick ice .
The first mathematical model for the growth of young ice , formulated in the 1890s by Josef Stefan , does in fact predict exactly this kind of ice growth .
Since Stefan 's time , scientists have refined thermodynamic models to take account of more factors , including , for example , the effect of solar radiation .
A standard model used by scientists today was developed by Maykut and Untersteiner in the 1970s .
It predicts that if left alone for years , the ice approaches an equilibrium thickness of 2.88 metres , around which it oscillates on a seasonal basis .
Ice on the move
Ice fields often resemble rubble fields with randomly heaped blocks of ice .
So far we have completely ignored that sea ice is in constant motion .
Winds tear at its surface and it is driven by ocean currents .
The ice responds to these stresses with cracks and pressure ridges , which in turn change its response to wind and ocean .
It 's a complicated business , but again a relatively simple model can get us quite far .
To understand how ice motion depends on external forces , we turn to Newton 's second law of motion , which states that the acceleration of an object is equal to the net force acting on it divided by the object 's mass .
So let 's take a piece of ice of area , say , 1m2 .
The net force at work here comes from the various stresses acting on the ice , which clearly include air stress , due to wind , and water stress , due to currents .
But another factor we can't ignore is the fact that all our measurements are made with respect to the Earth , which is itself in motion .
This gives rise to what is called the Coriolis force ( see the Plus article Galloping gyroscopes for an explanation ) .
It 's negligible on a human scale , but it plays an important role in sea ice motion , not least because its effect is strongest at the poles .
So we have
which we write asNote thatandare all vectors that encode the direction of the movement or force , as well as its magnitude .
Let 's first turn to the stress exerted by the air .
This is due to the air flowing around the ice floe dragging it along .
In general the drag of a body in a flowing fluid is calculated using the equation
Figure 2 : The wind drags the ice floe in the direction of U a .
As the ice moves in the direction of U i , air resistance works in the opposite direction - U i .
Together we have the relative velocity U a - U i .
whereis the density of the fluid , is the body 's surface area , andis the fluid 's velocity .
Again remember thatis a vector , and thatstands for the magnitude of a vector .
The constantis called theof the body and it encodes the body 's shape — a bulky body obviously reacts differently to the fluid flow than a flat and thin one .
Note that the magnitude of the drag grows as a square of the speed of the airflow .
In our case the density becomes the density of air , .
Since ice fields often resemble rubble fields with randomly heaped blocks of ice , there 's no easy formula for the drag coefficient of ice .
Scientist usually assign it a value between 0.0014 and 0.0021 , based on observations .
We 've assumed the surface area to be equal to 1 .
Now if the ice floe itself is stationary , we get the equation
whereis the air velocity .
However , we must take into account that the ice might itself be moving with a velocity , so rather than justwe 'll use the relative velocity
Water stress can be modelled in a similar way , this time with water density instead of air density , and with an underwater drag coefficient .
The Coriolis force is given by
whereis the mass of our piece of ice , is the Earth 's angular velocity , is ice velocity andis latitude .
The force 's direction is 90 degrees to the right ofin the northern hemisphere and 90 degrees to the left ofin the southern hemisphere , a fact that has given rise to myths of water spiralling down plug holes in different directions on different ends of the planet .
What kind of motion does this model predict ?
Imagine that our floe of ice starts off perfectly still in the water until a sudden wind rises .
Also assume , slightly unrealistically , that the water is not in motion , so that it only acts to slow down the piece once it is set in motion .
Figure 3 : The air stress acting on the top of the floe is in the direction of the wind .
The water drag is opposite to the direction in which the ice floe is moving .
The Coriolis force is at right angles to the direction of movement ( shown for the Northern hemisphere ) .
The result is steady motion under a triangle of forces .
The force exerted by the wind will start moving the ice into the direction of .
As soon as it has gathered sufficient speed , the Coriolis force will kick in , diverting its direction off to the right of the wind direction .
The water drag will slow the floe , but as long as it is still accelerating , the Coriolis force will keep turning it .
Eventually , as shown in the diagram , the direction of motion is far enough to the right of the wind for the Coriolis force , wind drag and water drag to balance in a perfect triangle of forces .
The floe moves steadily at an angle of about 45 degrees to the right of the wind and at about 3 % of the wind speed .
This phenomenon was discovered by the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen during the drift of his ship Fram across the Arctic in 1893 - 1896 , and has become known as the Nansen rule .
Real ice bergs and floes have also been seen behaving like this .
But still , reality is more complicated .
We have n't taken into account that the water itself will move when a wind rises .
Ice floes do n't usually float about on their own , and the bumping and grinding in pack ice , for example , cause internal stresses that may well cause floes to break up .
To model this you need a coherent theory of ice as a material .
And to get a comprehensive ice - ocean model , you need to couple ice dynamics with thermodynamics .
More sophisticated models do exist however , and it is these that are fed into global climate models to predict the future of the whole planet .
The stats
There 's another important component to ice - ocean modelling : statistics .
Any mathematical model is built on observations and its predictions must be compared to real - life data .
Many of the quantities that feed into the models , for example the drag coefficients , need to be estimated from observations .
But collecting the necessary data is no easy task and requires statistical analysis .
Hands - on work : Wadhams 's team drilling a hole in the ice .
Satellites give scientists a good idea of what the surface of the ice looks like , but to get a picture of its underside — and its thickness — you need to get under the ice .
Submarines with upward - looking sonar give valuable data , but only along the lines they follow .
They only give a picture of a two - dimensional vertical slice of the ice .
" It 's a sampling problem , " says Wadhams , " What we get from submarines is still not a perfect representation of the real distributions of ice thickness and features such as pressure ridges and open leads .
When we 're looking for trends in the data , we have an enormously difficult job assessing the statistical significance of our measurements and how representative they are of the ocean as a whole . "
Wadhams and his team have indeed found that some features of the ice appear to follow regular laws .
They found , for example , that the proportion of ice of thickness decays exponentially with .
" We do n't know why , " he admits , but spotting patterns like that can give vital clues about the processes — including wind , air and thermodynamics — that turn the ice into what it is .
Let it be noted , at this point , that there is no doubt about the recent thinning of the ice : it is statistically significant and can't be put down to purely accidental factors .
A newly - developed multi-beam sonar and improved satellites will give more and better data in the near future , but to get a truly detailed data set , there 's nothing but to go and see for yourself .
In February 2009 a team of explorers will set out on foot on a 2000 km journey from Point Barrow in Alaska to the North Pole ( see Plus article The Arctic ice cap — how long has it got ? ) .
With them will be a surface - penetrating impulse radar that will measure ice thickness every 20 cm along the journey .
At the end of the journey , probably in June 2009 , scientists from the Polar Ocean Physics Group in Cambridge , and from other institutions , will descend on the ten million or so readings to get the clearest picture of ice thickness to date .
Wadhams and his team regularly visit the Arctic and venture under the ice in submarines , as well as working from camps on the ice surface .
Their next expedition is in May 2008 , using an AUV ( autonomous underwater vehicle ) , a kind of unmanned computer - controlled mini-submarine .
It 's not what you 'd expect from Cambridge professors , but in these times there is n't the luxury to separate theory from practice .
Arctic mathematicians may be a rare breed , but they 're certainly not faced with extinction .

Decided that now was the right time to do an NBA overview , starting first with a ranked listing / review of the trading season ( early February to the deadline ) followed by predictions and if we ’re lucky a quickie mock draft .
NOTE : These are not power rankings , just how I think teams did in terms of personnel .
However , they ARE ranked in order of how well they did in terms of trades and whatnot during February
Los Angeles Lakers -
Simply put , this team at full potential is better than any Lakers team since Magic Johnson retired .
They have size ( Gasol / Bynum / Odom ? ! ) , versatility , and experience / toughness .
What ’s more , they have a beast of a bench that will only improve with time and Ariza coming back from injury .
The best thing about them is how well they match up against each and every other top team , except that I worry about their PG ’s match up against speedy or overall top - flight PG ’s ( but they ’ll do fine if that ’s their biggest worry ) .
San Antonio Spurs -
Many pundits have them lower on the list , but it boils down to this : they got a guy in Kurt Thomas who adds something substantial to their size and defense without giving up anything of note .
It ’s compounded by the possibility of getting Brent Barry back , but honestly that ’s not too big a deal .
Miami Heat -
They took a guy in Shaq who was unquestionably a majorly expensive drag on their current team and turned him into a player who is a phenomenal talent with a substantially better contract in Shawn Marion .
If Marion opts out ( or leaves after the opt - in ) , all they get is better money , and if he stays , they have a great SF / PF who compliments
Wade well as long as they can have a shooter or have Cook blossom .
New Jersey Nets -
Another team that took a detriment and turned him into an asset .
Much of their long - term grade depends on whether they keep Diop beyond this year .
Devin Harris is a very good young player who is substantially better long - term than what they could probably get otherwise .
The X - Factor now is whether they can move Carter and Jefferson and get anything for them .
Cleveland Cavaliers -
If I were to tell you that you could dump Larry Hughes and pick up some talented guys without having worse contracts to deal with in terms of the cap , would that be something you ’d be interested in ?
In all seriousness , it was a pretty great trade for the Cavs .
LeBron has much more natural compliments and the front court of Z , Joe Smith , Varejao , and Big Ben is pretty potent as long as Mike Brown plays them in the right combinations .
Sure they lose on perimeter D , but Delonte West and the bigs are good enough to make the trade a significant net gain .
Also , getting the 3 - seed in the East is huge , because Orlando , Cleveland , and Toronto are fighting for it and the winner plays a mediocre team ( Washington , Atl , whoever ) while the losers play each other for the right to play the # 1 squad .
New Orleans ( for now ) Hornets – I really like what they did .
Bobby Jackson was n’t doing a whole lot there , and the Mike / Bonzi combo adds depth that they desperately needed .
It would have been nice to get some size , but there really is not much of that around .
Sacramento Kings -
Some will criticize them for not moving Artest , but there ’s no reason to move him for an expiring and a low pick when there is a chance he either does n’t opt out or re-ups there .
As far as the Bibby trade goes , they moved a useless piece for expiring and a guy in Shelden who is a natural compliment for Brad Miller and Spencer Hawes and is still on his rookie deal .
Houston Rockets -
While the trade with New Orleans is n’t my favorite for them , essentially adding Gerald Green ( overrated as he may be ) is a compelling move .
I ’ve heard that GG idolizes T - Mac , and he might be one of the few people that can actually make him try .
Utah Jazz -
They did n’t do anything in this time period ( Korver trade was earlier ) , but there was no need to .
It would have been nice to get a shot - blocking presence to play with either Boozer or Okur , but it was n’t a necessity and tough to find .
Atlanta Hawks -
Welcome to relevance , fellas .
It ’s been a quite some time .
While I like that they did n’t give up much to get Mr. Bibby ( besides Shelden , who does n’t fit in their up and down system ) , I ’m not sure how much he adds .
It seems like they ’re a playoff team in the East now , which is nice , but it ’s not a meaningful change in the long term .
Toronto Raptors -
It ’s not entirely clear how much Primoz will bring , but he has size and Juan Dixon was not necessarily an asset for the Raptors .
Boston Celtics - Certain “ differently abled ” personalities like Stephen A. Smith criticized them for not making moves , but it ’s relatively clear that they will get a PG and / or players that get cut off other teams in the next few weeks .
Sam Cassell will almost definitely be on this team soon .
Detroit Pistons - Juan Dixon is better than Flip Murray , but I worry that they may be looking for rebounding .
However , getting Magloire or Dale Davis would correct that , and it ’s definitely possible .
Seattle / Oklahoma City Sonics -
They saved money for Clay Bennett ( huzzah ! ) , but part of me worries that a piece like Wally ’s expiring contract next year would have been more valuable than what they got , especially in light of the Gasol theft .
Part of what puts them so high is converting Rashard Lewis ( who could have just signed outright with Orlando ) into three first rounders in total , which is simply incredible , especially now that the 2010 pick might be from a Suns team on the slide with Nash and Shaq on the downslope then .
Washington Wizards -
Did n’t do a whole lot , but were pretty hamstrung by the guys they already had on roster .
They really should give Dominic McGuire more minutes - he has the potential to be a very good player down the road .
Philadelphia 76ers - Probably the hardest team to place in this .
On the upside , they have potential as a playoff team , but they did n’t get anything for Andre Miller .
However , the final verdict is that the current team is good enough to have Andre Iguodala stick around , which makes a net positive since Miller / Iggy / Thad / Dalembert is a core that just needs a good PF to complete .
Chicago Bulls -
While I ’m 100 % down with the addition by subtraction of Ben Wallace , Larry Hughes only blocks Thabo Sefolosha ( and is a worse player eventually ) and losing Joe Smith has to hurt .
Still , giving Noah , Tyrus , and the underrated Aaron Gray more minutes to see what they ’ve got puts them higher on the list than other teams that made moves .
Charlotte Robert JohnsonCats -
Not much they could have done , and they did n’t do anything .
That ’s what happens when you have terrible management and undesirable talent .
They better pray that Emeka does n’t want to leave , because they ’d be down to Nazr Mohammed and the cadaver of Sean May on the inside .
And for the love of God and all that is holy , give Jermareo Davidson .
Milwaukee Bucks -
It ’s good that they did n’t give up Michael Redd ( since they probably would n’t have gotten a good offer ) , but moving Charlie V would have made some sense because he and Yi pretty much fill the same niche in the long - term .
LA Clippers -
Why exactly could n’t they get something like Najera and a pick for Cassell instead of the inevitable buy - out ?
It also would have been nice to see them go ballsy and move someone like Maggette , but that ’s Elgin Baylor for ya …
Indiana Pacers -
Why exactly could n’t they get something for Jermaine O’Neal ?
They need a leader ( and a SG ) in the worst way , and they did absolutely nothing to fix those issues .
Phoenix Suns -
Some love the trade , some hate it .
There is a significant chance that Shaq hooks up to the Juvenation Machine™ and I like Amare as a PF defensively ( hell , nothing ’s worse than him as a strong - side defender ) , but they ’ll need to learn how to handle the pick and roll .
Also , I ’m worried that Shaq dominating the paint will draw Amare out to take more mid-range shots and he wo n’t have the same speed advantage on PF ’s that he had on C’s .
The bigger issue is that they lost an underrated Shawn Marion and his great D , and it is appalling how they sold away so many picks ( including picks that directly resulted in Rudy Fernandez , Rajon Rondo , and Sergio Rodriguez ) and gave away Kurt Thomas .
If they ’d have used a smidge of the money saved there , they might not have the depth problems that will cost them a shot at the title .
Golden State Warriors -
They did n’t do anything , but since they have to re-sign Baron , Monta , and Biedrins this off - season , it was not practical for them to move a guy like Pietrus for a long - term deal .
New York Knicks -
It sure seems like they could have moved a guy like Starbury for a longer running contract and some young talent .
I ’ve written extensively on them , so you can read what I would ’ve done there .
Portland Trailblazers - Taurean Green is a good player , and it does n’t make sense to cut the cord on him for essentially nothing at this juncture .
Paul Allen has the money to make a move like that after Summer League .
It was time to hold pat or put their eggs in a basket and get a legit PG or SF .
Denver Nuggets -
They really needed to make a move to have the depth and versatility to make any real noise and had an asset in Najera to do so .
That said , I really like Linas , but they could have made a move with Najera , JR Smith , and their draft picks .
Minnesota Timberwolves -
They made two major mistakes .
First off , they let a potential guy in Gerald Green go for essentially nothing ( a mid-50 ’s pick ) .
Do they really need that roster spot ?
The bigger issue is that they have zero chance at being meaningfully under the cap next year , but they still kept Theo Ratliff ’s Expiring Contract™ around instead of moving it to a team Gasol - style .
Hell , they could have made a better offer to Memphis than the Lakers easily …
Dallas Mavericks -
I worshipped Jason Kidd as a child ( he went to Skyline High and Cal and I grew up in the Bay Area ) , but there ’s a line between what Kidd was in his prime and what he is now .
The best things he brings to the table are smoother transition offense and leadership ( when he ’s happy ) .
The things he does not bring to the table are shooting skill and defensive ability against top - notch PG’s .
Guess what the Mavs need ?
That is compounded by losing Diop , who is pivotal for stopping teams like the Lakers and Spurs , and the draft picks .
The Mavericks made themselves much more beatable against the Spurs , Lakers , Hornets , Jazz , and Rockets .
Those are n’t the teams that they should be getting worse against .
Memphis Grizzlies - Possibly the funniest GM thing I ’ve ever seen is the perennially incompetent Chris Wallace trying to show backbone on trading Mike Miller after gift - wrapping Pau .
If the Grizz had the goal of cutting their long term salary , they had three guys to move : Pau , Miller , and Brian Cardinal .
Naturally , you move the most valuable with the least valuable if someone has negative value ( as Cardinal does ) .
Instead , he basically screws the pooch and slaughtered the team to get a feeble amount of cap space that the team will not be able to use to get any free agents .
Orlando Magic - Simply unforgivable .
They have an arsenal of expiring contracts , need quality players , and will unquestionably be over the cap next year , but do not move ANY of those valuable assets .
They could have easily outbid the Spurs for Kurt Thomas or countless other players that their teams did n’t want to handle .
Instead , they stayed shallow and hollow , and will pay the price for it and moving Trevor Ariza .
I ’m really sorry Dwight - you deserve better .
Maybe you can convince Lebron to make the move when he has his opt-out …
With that out of the way , it ’s time for a little playoff projection and some awards predictions .
Yeah , boyyyyyy !

Exit polls show signs that Limbaugh 's minions turned out for Clinton Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Rush Limbaugh would like little more than to see Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama keep fighting each other for at least the next month , if not until the Democratic Convention itself .
Before the Texas and Ohio primaries in early March , the conservative talker began encouraging listeners to cross over and cast ballots for Clinton in Democratic primaries .
At the very least , he figured , the Democrats would keep fighting each other and let GOP nominee John McCain float above the fray .
In perhaps his most optimistic scenario , Clinton would grab the nomination , giving the right another crack at one of their favorite foes in a general election campaign .
Limbaugh dubbed his scheme " Operation Chaos , " and plenty of signs were emerging Tuesday evening that it was working , especially in Indiana , where Clinton appeared headed for a slim victory .
Exit polls conducted by the major news networks showed an unusually high number of Clinton supporters planned to vote for McCain in the fall and felt the former first lady did not share their values .
Indiana exit polls showed that four in ten Democrats who said they would vote for McCain over Clinton in a general election nonetheless voted for Clinton on Tuesday ; however , just twelve percent who would vote for McCain over Obama voted for the Illinois senator .
Citing this figure , the Obama campaign sent an e-mail to reporters Tuesday night arguing that 7 percent of the Indiana electorate could be attributed to the " Limbaugh effect " -- 41 percent of the 17 percent who said they 'd vote for McCain over Clinton but still supported Clinton .
A similar discrepancy was evident in North Carolina exit polls .
Evidence of meddling Republicans also presented itself when they were asked which candidate shared their values .
A third of Indianans said Clinton did not share their values , yet twenty percent of those voters still supported the New York senator .
A similar portion said Obama did not share their values , but only seven percent of those voters supported him in the primary .
The discrepancy was smaller in North Carolina , but voters there also were more likely to support Clinton despite believing that she did n't share their values .
Of the ten percent of Indiana voters who thought neither Clinton nor Obama shared their values , three in four cast ballots for Clinton .
On his show Tuesday afternoon , as Indiana and North Carolina voters were heading to the polls , Limbaugh crowed about early reports of his success .
" I have also been receiving field reports via email today ... from people , commandos , operatives , reporting that they have followed orders and fulfilled their duty .
Nobody 's been challenged .
The Indiana voters all say that they have not been challenged , and they were hoping to be , " he said .
" In fact , some of the people show up and they ask for a Democrat ballot , and the poll worker says , ' Why , what are you going to do ? '
He says , ' Operation Chaos , ' and they just laugh .
' Oh , is that what 's going on here ? ' one poll worker said . "
Along with the exit polls , anecdotal evidence was emerging that it was having at least some effect .
Crooks & Liars blogger SilentPatriot was less convinced of Limbaugh 's effectiveness based on another piece of exit poll data .
" The way it 's looking now , Republicans , who account for 11 % of the entire Indiana electorate , have voted for Hillary by the same margin that the entire state has , " they wrote .
" Stick to ruining your own party , Rush .
Lord knows you 've done a fantastic job at that . "
The Huffington Post 's Sam Stein saw a few possible explanations for the exit poll data .
" A ) Clinton 's support in Indiana , while clearly there , is not entirely solid ; B ) a large swath of Indiana primary goers simply did n't like the nominees and thought of Clinton as the lesser of two evils ; or C ) Limbaugh 's hatchet plan could be having political ripples , " he wrote , adding that each factor could be having some effect .

U.S.- supported ‘ referendum ’ Oligarchs trying to break up Bolivia Published May 8 , 2008 10:00 PM
On May 4 , massive demonstrations of Indigenous people , peasants , workers and students took place all over Bolivia to protest an attempt by wealthy landowners and business heads to divide their country .
These demonstrations got little attention in the international media emanating from the imperialist countries .
Photo : Granma.cu
What they focused on instead was the “ referendum for autonomy ” in the province of Santa Cruz , which had been declared illegal and unconstitutional by the progressive government of Evo Morales .
The Indigenous people in Bolivia have been ignored , persecuted and exploited for 500 years .
But today they are defending their rights , the unity of their country , and the national government led by Morales , Bolivia ’s first Indigenous president .
U.S. imperialism has been carefully orchestrating a divisive strategy in Bolivia that it plans to apply in other countries of the region as well , including Ecuador and Venezuela .
Santa Cruz is one of nine Bolivian provinces .
The vote for “ autonomy ” is meant to destabilize the Morales government and divide the country , much as Kosovo was separated from Yugoslavia .
In fact , some of the same actors are busy at work in Bolivia .
The current U.S. ambassador there is Philip Goldberg , who was instrumental in the separation of Kosovo .
Concentrated wealth Santa Cruz , in the eastern lowlands of Bolivia , is part of the Media Luna ( half moon ) — a crescent that includes the provinces of Pando , Tarija and Beni .
The Media Luna is also the wealthiest part of the country , generating 44 percent of the gross national product .
A right - wing opposition to the Morales government is entrenched there , with its leadership centered in Santa Cruz .
Santa Cruz is the largest province in Bolivia , with almost one third of the national territory .
Its capital , Santa Cruz de la Sierra , is the largest city in the country , with nearly 1.4 million people .
Santa Cruz alone generates 30.63 percent of the GNP .
Home to a white European oligarchy , it is also vehemently racist .
Many of the oligarchs are “ latifundistas ” who own huge farmlands that produce export goods like soy , rubber and cattle .
One of those landowners is Ronald Din Larsen , a U.S. citizen who has lived in Bolivia for many years and owns 141,203 acres in Santa Cruz .
According to Bolivian authorities , Larsen does n’t even have a Bolivian registration or identity card , yet his family is actively opposing the land reform proposal of the Morales government that would break up these large estates and make land available to poor Bolivians .
When Vice - Minister of Land Alejandro Almaraz made a recent visit to Santa Cruz , he was attacked by a gun-toting group instigated by Larsen , according to the news agency ABI .
Santa Cruz is where most of the transnational corporations have their headquarters .
It also has the largest reserves of natural gas , petroleum and other minerals .
The province ’s business owners are organized in the Santa Cruz Civic Union , headed by Branko Marinkovic , a Croatian capitalist with close ties to the U.S. Embassy .
Carolus Wimmer , national secretary of the Venezuelan Communist Party , told Venezuelan television that some members of the Croatian oligarchy in Bolivia had been expelled from Socialist Yugoslavia after World War II as fascist sympathizers .
The Croats settled in several Latin American countries with the help of the CIA .
Marinkovic and Rubén Costas , the administrator of the province , are the leaders behind the separatist movement in Santa Cruz .
Their armed wing , the Santa Cruz Youth Union , is a violent group closely allied to the Falange , a fascist organization active in the 1940s and 1950s that seems to be resurfacing .
In search of jobs , thousands of people from the highlands in the west have moved to Santa Cruz , particularly members of the Indigenous Aymara and Quechua nations .
In Santa Cruz they face discrimination and often racist violence , perpetrated mostly by the fascist youth group .
Illegal referendum
The referendum on autonomy was illegal under the Bolivian constitution .
Even the United Nations and the Organization of American States , no champions of progress , opposed the referendum .
Gen. Luis Trigo , head of the Bolivian Armed Forces , publicly denounced it as affecting “ the security and the defense of the Bolivian State . ”
He pointed out that some of the articles establish local control over legislation , all transport by land , river , air and roads , as well as the airwaves , security and defense .
It is in fact a project to provide legal cover for setting up a new country .
Informal polls show that the majority of the people in Santa Cruz did not know the exact contents of the referendum .
In an effort to deceive , the oligarchy ’s media reported on May 5 that the “ Yes ” option approving autonomy won by more than 80 percent .
In the U.S. , the Washington Post echoed those numbers in an article that quoted Marinkovic as saying , “ It ’s a historic day , and tomorrow we have more work to do .
...
We have to determine a new course for Bolivia , and it wo n’t be an easy task . ”
Morales , in a televised speech , said , “ This poll , which is illegal and unconstitutional , was not the success that they hoped for .
...
Between the abstention rate of 39 percent , the votes ‘ no ’ and the blank ballots , that is practically 50 percent . ”
The turnout for the “ referendum ” had been low .
Interior Minister Alfredo Rada , in an interview with Telesur , stated that the elections were marked by “ violence , confrontations and irregularities . ”
He said some names were erased from voters ’ lists and 20 people were injured in confrontations with the fascist youth group .
In a neighborhood called Plan 3000 , a stronghold of the Morales party , the fascist youth picked a fight against the Indigenous and peasant residents , shouting racist epithets .
The residents shouted back , “ Get out fascists ” and “ Long live Evo . ” People in Santa Cruz who support Morales had seized and burned ballot boxes in rejection of the referendum .
In the process , they found many supposedly blank ballots were already marked with the Yes option .
They immediately called the press to announce the fraud .
In a Telesur broadcast , Morales also accused the United States of funding the opposition .
“ The Embassy of the United States is the one that leads this conspiracy , ” he said , adding that “ the U.S. ambassador is the great defender of the division of Bolivia , of the anti-constitutional attitudes , of those groups that do not want equality for our peoples , of the groups that want to steal from our country . ”
Articles from different sources mention that USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy have given million of dollars to the opposition groups in the name of the “ fight against drug trafficking . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York lawyer is suing Delta Air Lines for $ 1 million , saying his family vacation turned into a nightmare after they were stranded in an airport for days and treated disdainfully by airline employees .
Richard Roth , who filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself and his mother , said he planned the Christmas 2007 trip to Buenos Aires to celebrate his mother ’s 80th birthday .
She had grown up in the city , but had not returned in years , he said .
Instead , Roth , his two teenage children , his wife and mother spent three days in airports , went days without their luggage , were treated rudely by airline employees and were forced to spend $ 21,000 on unused hotel rooms in Argentina , replacement clothes , and other costs .
“ Through its gross negligence , malfeasance and absolute incompetence , Mr. Roth holds Delta responsible for ruining his vacation , ” said the lawsuit , filed in New York state court .
Delta Air Lines Inc had no immediate comment .
Roth said that he has been in touch with Delta about getting reimbursed , but was repeatedly rebuffed .
He told Reuters on Wednesday filing the suit was a last resort .
After the initial flight from New York was delayed by more than two hours , the family was not allowed to board their connecting flight in Atlanta , Roth said .
A Delta employee “ literally walked away chuckling that he had left them stranded , ” he said .
After waiting in the airport for hours , Roth was told the next available flight would depart more than two weeks later .
He then booked a flight through a different airline and arrived in Argentina three days later than planned .
The family was not reunited with their luggage for more than five days .
“ Suffice it to say , Mr. Roth ’s elderly mother was a mess .
And she has been suffering ever since .
The kids are all upset .
And it was Christmas Eve. Mr. Roth had spent one - half of his vacation in Buenos Aires chasing Delta and its incompetent representatives , ” the lawsuit said .

The south - western US is suffering its eighth consecutive year of drought .
There are concerns that the Colorado River , which has sustained life in the area for thousands of years , can no longer meet the needs of the tens of millions of people living in major cities such as Las Vegas and Los Angeles .
The BBC's Matthew Price is travelling along the river to investigate the scale of the problem and is sending a series of diary items from there .
DAY THREE : LAKE MEAD
It 's not often you see the general manager of a golf course hugging the man who 's digging up the grass on his fairways and replacing it with something similar to desert gravel .
That though is exactly what Stephen Goldstein , who 's in charge of the Black Mountain Golf and Country Club outside Las Vegas did , after bringing his golf cart to an abrupt stop on the way back to the club house .
Mr Goldstein is having 55 acres ( 22 hectares ) of the grass on his course removed .
It 's costing between $ 2 m and $ 3 m ( £ 1 m - £ 1.5 m ) to have done .
It should save him more than $ 50,000 ( £ 25,000 ) a year .
" The main reason was financial " , says Mr Goldstein .
" We knew that as time went on that water costs were going to increase . "
" There was going to be a time when we would either be mandated to reduce our water consumption or obviously from a financial condition it would be difficult for us to water all the areas . "
Water in Las Vegas is at a premium .
One of the most important cities in the United States is slap - bang in the middle of one of the driest areas in the world .

The reason Mr Goldstein can afford to tear up some of his grass is because the Southern Nevada Water Authority is so keen to get people and businesses here to use less water that it 's paying them $ 1.50 for each square foot of grass they remove .
So some gardens now no longer have grass and thirsty shrubs in them .
They have gravel , desert landscaping , and cacti .
Indeed new housing developments are not allowed to put in gardens .
This part of the US has suffered almost a decade of drought .
Las Vegas is at the sharp end , but all the states in the region are affected .
There 's plenty of disagreement about what 's causing the drought .
Many here say it 's just a dry spell , that the rains will return .
But the General Manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority , Patricia Mulroy , says there 's no doubt in her mind that man-made climate change is to blame .
" We 're going to have to change our whole approach to water management in this part of the United States " , she says .
It 's such thinking that helps explain the water authority 's push to stop any water being wasted .
Already they recycle all the city 's used water .
If it goes down a plug hole , or a drain it stays in the system .
But if a rogue sprinkler sprays the road , or a hosepipe is left running into a lawn , the water is lost .
Hence the water police .
On patrol every day , they are chasing the source of every little dribble of water .
This community [ in Las Vegas ] is realising that they need to adapt to the desert
Patricia Mulroy
Southern Nevada Water Authority
So when Scott Comstock stops his patrol vehicle by the side of the road , and starts filming a small puddle of surface water on the pavement , it looks almost comical .
The water 's coming from inside the grounds of a school , dribbling out from a leaky irrigation pipe .
" It does indeed seem like a very small amount when you consider the fact that in a day this city can burn through 600 m gallons of water " , he says .
" If this is not checked and something done about it , " Mr Comstock says , pointing at the water , " this will get worse all the time , it will get worse . "
These and other measures do seem to be working .
Between 2002 and 2007 , the population of Las Vegas grew by 400,000 people .
In the same time , water consumption dropped by 15bn gallons , according to the water authority .
That 's roughly an 18 % fall .
Patricia Mulroy admits that for a long time people here acted as if they could change the environment .
She now believes attitudes are changing .
" With the onslaught of the drought and the rude wake - up call that global warming and climate change is bringing to the entire western United States , this community [ in Las Vegas ] is realising that they need to adapt to the desert " , she says .
" It 's a cultural shift that we are going through first , but every other western community will have to go through . "
DAY TWO : LAKE MEAD
It takes slightly longer to get to Lake Mead these days .
That 's because for the past few years , the largest man-made lake in the US has been shrinking .
Water lapped at the underside of this pontoon just seven years ago
So you have to drive further round to hit the water 's edge , towards the famous Hoover Dam , which was built back in the 1930s to help regulate the flow of the Colorado River and to guarantee a constant water supply to Las Vegas and other cities in the American south - west .
Eventually you arrive at a launch ramp .
" American Angler Captain R W ' Bob ' Wood " ( that 's what his card says ) is waiting on the pontoon with his fishing boat .
" We used to launch the boat clear back where you turned off on the highway .
It 's probably close to a half mile away , " he says .
In just six or seven years , the water level has dropped significantly .
Where we are now bobbing on the surface is 102ft ( 31 m ) below the old water level .
Bathtub line
We idle out of the little harbour - the marina used to be here , but a few months ago they towed it away because the water level had made it difficult to get the boats in and out .
It 's now further round the lake , in deeper water .
To the left there 's a water intake pump , way , way above our heads .
It used to be on the water 's surface .
There are towering rock formations , rising up above the land , that just a few years ago were islands in the lake .
The most telling sight though is what they call the bathtub line .
We speed towards one section of the lake shore , where the distant white line gets larger and larger , until the boat is alongside a vast towering cliff face , perhaps 600 ft or 700 ft high .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The rock is naturally black , but where the water used to be it has turned white , because of the calcium in the water .
The bathtub line is 100 ft high here .
This matters .
The reservoir , and the Colorado River which serves it , is still the principal water source for millions of Americans .
Some argue that one day there may not be enough water to feed the cities here .
There are disagreements as to why water levels in the lake are dropping .
Many environmentalists argue climate change is to blame .
Richard Seager from the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory told me that they expect global warming to reduce the amount of water in the area by 10 % to 15 % by the middle of the century .
" It 's comparable to the 1930s dust bowl drought , but instead of that lasting just a few years it will become the new drier climate that will be there for ever more , " he says .
Others - Captain Bob included - do not believe climate change is to blame , arguing that weather is cyclical .
He is certain the lake will regain its normal levels one day .
Desert
In a sense , it does not matter what is causing it .
Both sides of this debate agree on the fact that humans are using too much water in this part of the US .
" Down in San Diego , there are people watering the grass - and it's raining !
Too many people using the water , yes , " Captain Bob says .
It is not just people watering their gardens - indeed most scientists say that is almost a minor problem .
It is estimated that around one tenth of the water taken from reservoirs like Lake Mead is used by the urban area - by households , hotels and businesses .
Most of the water that comes down the Colorado River , around 90 % , is used by agriculture , and most of that is in vast farms , which help keep America in fruit and veg .
Seven years ago you could have had a picnic right by the lake Others are smaller concerns , like that of Robert Houston who farms up near the north rim of the Grand Canyon .
Like farms across this desert area , he sprays his crop of alfalfa with a series of sprinklers .
" Water resources are very scarce , " he agrees .
Are they being overused , I ask .
" I guess there 's always that chance .
The whole world 's getting overused .
All our resources are getting overused .
[ There are ] more and more people . "
But , he adds : " We might as well use the water rather than just letting it flow into the ocean . "
Back on Lake Mead , that bathtub rim of white flashing past our heads as we speed back to the pontoon , Captain Bob admits that they are now relying on the weather .
They need more snow up on the Rocky Mountains , he says , to feed the river and the lake .
Still , he says , " Sooner or later water is going to become a major , major problem .
" We have to do things to curb water usage . "
It 's not exactly a radical idea , considering the fact that we 're in the middle of a region dominated by deserts and naturally low precipitation .
Do though people who live here realise that they are living in a desert ?
" I do n't think they do , " says Captain Bob .
" I think the older people realise it .
I think the people who move here from [ elsewhere ] have n't a clue .
They have no idea that it 's dry . "
Tomorrow Matthew Price rides along with the water police in Las Vegas , one of the ways city officials are trying to reduce the water that people use .
DAY ONE : PAGE , ARIZONA
It takes several hours to get to Page , Arizona .
From anywhere .
Trees along the riverbanks soak up a lot of water
The drive , though , is far from dull .
It 's one of those journeys that can make you feel incredibly insignificant .
Vast landscapes dwarf everything made by man .
The cars and trucks speeding along the desert highways appear as small as model vehicles .
You could stick the skyscrapers of Manhattan , from where I flew in a few hours earlier , next to the immense rock formations , and they would look like Toy Town .
In places the landscape falls sharply away into canyons , in others it rises up towards plateaus , and everywhere the geological history of the place is obvious .
Today , as I walked alongside the Colorado River just outside the town of Page , I saw two prints in the red Navajo sandstone , each with three " toes " .
It was the fossilised footprint of a dinosaur which had stood at the same spot many thousands of years before me .
This land is sacred to the Native Americans who live here .
Shana Watahomigie is a park ranger with the National Parks Service .
She is also a member of the Havasupai tribe , which still lives alongside the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon .
Dams have brought changes to the river 's ecology Havasupai means " people of the blue - green water " , and , as we dip our toes in the chilly river , Ms Watahomigie tells me the Colorado is part of her history .
" It 's my lifeline , my bloodline .
We have a lot of respect for the river , water and the earth . "
The Colorado River springs up from the snowy peaks of the Rocky Mountains to the north .
It winds through the south - western states , towards Mexico and the ocean .
Source of life
The river helped form the Grand Canyon .
It is one of planet Earth 's most iconic rivers .
It has also been the source of life for this region and the people living here for hundreds of years , which is now a problem , as far as people like Shana Watahomigie are concerned .
Two vast dams were built along the river in the last century .
They have caused changes to the ecology of the river .
The lakes behind the dams supply water to agriculture , to industry and to tens of millions of people living in the south - western US .
" We are compromising [ the river ] by controlling it , " says Ms Watahomigie .
" The plants have suffered .
The wildlife has suffered , as well as human beings .
Now the water is n't reaching them . "
On the river though , as I get onto a raft with Drew Grim , a local river guide , it is hard to see the problem .

It is a haven .
Our boat glides almost silently past the terracotta red canyon walls that rise up high on either side above us .
The river seems to be flowing well , there are plenty of other tourist boats out on the river , there are fishermen angling for trout .
It is what is happening behind the dams on the waterway that is the problem .
" Lake Powell [ the lake formed by the Glen Canyon Dam ] has been less than half full for a number of years and it did n't show signs of going up , " says Mr Grim .
" This year we did get some good snow , and levels rose , quite dramatically , eight inches at a time , but this is just one year . "
Trees of salt
For the best part of a decade the water levels have been falling rapidly .
The tens of millions of water users downstream , in huge sprawling cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles , are simply using too much water .
The Colorado River has ecological , commercial and symbolic importance So too , Drew Grim says , is some of the vegetation along the river .
Tamarisk trees - otherwise known as salt - cedars - were brought to the region from overseas decades ago to try to stop erosion elsewhere in the south west .
Their seeds spread , and now the plants line much of the river .
" The problem is the amount of water they drink .
They drink a tremendous amount , " says Mr Grim .
" This adds to the problem of water , as now we have our fresh water source being sucked dry by these invasive trees . "
He says they are trying to remove the tamarisk trees .
Once they were seen as no particular threat .
" Now it 's becoming more of an issue , since water 's such a concern .
Anything we can do to save water , we need to try . "
This though is a pretty minor problem , compared to the vast amounts of water used by households , and , more importantly , by agriculture .

What are these ?
Most of us feel the most alive when we 're driving , which is why we occasionally pause before getting into cars that look somewhat less - than - safe .
Of course , we 're no strangers to waving off life - flight helicopters , so our perception of safety may be different from that of than others .
Any car can be unsafe if not properly maintained or intelligently driven , but some cars just seem deadlier than others .
Among cars remembered as death traps are the Ford Pinto , Chevy Corvair and the Bridgestone tire - equipped Ford Exploder .

Big Toys For Top Dollar : 5 Reasons People Spoil Their Kids
Big toys for rich , spoiled kids : when a $ 10,000 kid ’s birthday party is n’t enough .
There are few things that are more delightful to parents than to see their kids happy : such as the moment right after the kids receive their toy of choice — a doll house , firetruck or new novelty gadget of the season .
And few things are more baffling to parents than to see that same toy discarded after a few hours of play , barely to be picked up again .
Ca n’t blame the kids really — these days , attention spans are shorter than ever and there ’s just too much stimuli going around to keep one ’s focus for too long .
We grownups may not be helping either , when we ’re so indulgent .
Yet the market out there for parents who love to splurge is bigger than ever , fueled by those of us who have a lot of disposable income to throw around .
Imagine that you have all the money in the world , or maybe you can just plain afford a few more extras in your life — would you be buying some of these things for your child anyway ?
Big Toys For The Kid Who Has Everything
Ferrari Go-Cart , Price : $ 50,000 at FAO Schwarz
This toy car may be a drop in the bucket if you ’re a mega- millionaire , but in my estimation , this could very well represent the car budget for a two income family over a span of a decade .

High - End Baby Stroller , Price : $ 2,000
While this custom Bugaboo stroller looks awesome , I was more than happy with my own basic Graeco model , which withstood the test of time and two kids .

But some others may not think this is good enough for their precious .
New mom Paola Canahuati did n’t bat an eyelash when forking over nearly $ 1,000 for her Bugaboo stroller .
That ’s because she believes certain high - end baby gear is worth the price , particularly when the baby is her own precious , albeit oblivious , 13 - day - old Aristotles .
“ For baby clothes , I ’ve tried to be more economical , ” says Canahuati , 23 , who is currently on maternity leave from her position as a proofreader at the United Nations in New York City .

Now you can really stress the importance of personal finance to your child by making a huge impression with this piggy bank , as featured in CNN Money .
😉
Well , this remains to be seen , actually : instead of spending that dough on this art piece , why not stuff your savings down these more affordable ones ?
~ooOoo~
If you had the money , would you buy any of these items , or anything along these lines ?
The truth is , many people certainly would !
And here ’s why :
Why We Spoil Our Kids
1 . We feel guilty .
Some of us may feel like we ’re not doing a good enough job as parents and thus end up wanting to “ make up for it ” somehow through other means .
Unfortunately , a lot of folks do n’t ( can’t ? ) spend enough time with their families and they fill that void by supplying their kids with stuff .
It ’s a way of assuaging their guilt .
But this just adds to the problem in the long run , when kids end up spoiled , lonely and craving attention .
2 . To return to our childhood .
How many times do we buy stuff for our kids so that we can relive our childhood ?
We do n’t want to admit this to ourselves but I bet some of us are in this position .
Those video game systems and entertainment centers are n’t really entirely for your toddlers are they ?
3 . We want the “ best ” for our child .
That ’s every parent ’s motto — we all want the best for our kid .
New parents especially seem to fall into that spell that compels them to over - prepare and go over - budget for their first child .
When more children come into the picture , the fuss often dies down .
I admit that I was this way a bit with my first - born and when the second one came along , it was all about hand - me - downs .
But there are still families that do n’t get over the “ anything for my child ” syndrome .
4 . Because we can .
When you ’re sitting on a lot of money , you have that problem that the rest of us would like to have : not knowing what to do with it all .
And it ’s human nature for your appetite to grow in line with your pockets .
But it ’s one thing to indulge yourself as an adult , and another to project and shower your children with extreme generosity .
It ’s just too easy to fall into this routine just because we can , being that it ’s the path to least resistance .
In my opinion , kids are naturally “ unspoiled ” : it ’s often the case that I see children prefer to play with low cost toys vs their more expensive counterparts .
Would n’t it have been great if we could have all grown up preserving these views ?
But life is n’t that simple .
5 . It ’s become a negotiating tactic .
How do you shape your child ’s behavior ?
For most of us , it ’s through some combination of discussion , reward and punishment .
But our methods are as diverse as we all are , and rewards can span the range of expensive to excessive , for those of us who can afford it .
~ooOoo~
If you ’re like most parents , then you ’ve occasionally splurged on stuff for your kids ( and you ’ll keep on doing so for a while ) .
We all do it because we love our kids and enjoy seeing them thrilled .
It only becomes an issue when we go overboard with addressing our children ’s every desire , as the actions we show them through their formative years end up shaping , influencing and affecting their behaviors as adults .
Whatever we buy them as kids will surely haunt them ( for better or for worse ) when they ’re older .
It ’s also quite likely that whatever attitude we have over money and spending will transfer over to our kids as well .
I ’m not one to say how you should or should not parent your child as we all have different parenting philosophies and styles that govern the way we raise our kids .
Ultimately though , despite all the parenting theories that abound , I personally always fall back on common sense .
And common sense tells me that most everything should be in moderation : including spending , splurging and spoiling .
As for saving ?
Well that ’s another story 🙂 .

Prop. 13 property taxes in the voters ' hands PROPOSITION 13 : 30 YEARS LATER Popular state initiative saves property owners billions but severely limits governments

Thirty years ago today , California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 13 as a way to keep seniors from losing their homes to skyrocketing property taxes .
But the 1978 vote also ignited a revolution that dramatically changed the way people across America look at government and taxes .
The grassroots initiative has saved California property owners billions of dollars since it was passed , but the shackles Prop. 13 put on the ability of state and local governments to increase taxes could turn out to be its most important legacy .
Even today , with the state facing a $ 17 billion budget shortfall , tax increases face certain opposition from many legislators and voters .
" Clearly , the Prop. 13 movement had the general attitude ... that government and its ability to tax people is n't to be trusted , " said Mark Baldassare , head of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California .
" That 's very much the theme that Ronald Reagan picked up when he ran for president in 1980 , and it's had a dramatic impact on national politics , particularly on the Republican side . "
When GOP Rep . Newt Gingrich of Georgia put together his " Contract with America " in 1994 as part of the successful Republican effort to take control of Congress , his call for requiring a three - fifths majority vote on tax increases was straight out of Prop.
13 .
And when liberal Democratic Illinois Sen. Barack Obama says that , as president , he would reverse President Bush 's tax cuts only for the wealthiest Americans , he recognizes the same middle - class antipathy to taxes that Prop.
13's backers saw three decades ago .
A distrust of officials
Both Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann , the public faces of Prop. 13 , disliked government almost as much as they despised taxes , and neither was willing to trust elected officials to do the right thing with the public 's money .
That 's one reason the measure not only put tight limits on property taxes but also required a two - thirds vote of the Legislature for state tax increases and a two - thirds vote of the people for most local tax boosts .
" The disaster of the moment was that people were being taxed out of their homes , " said Joel Fox , past president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association .
" But Howard Jarvis and others behind the initiative were determined that they were going to control the tax monster . "
More than property tax relief
The heated discussions backers of Prop. 13 had when they were putting the initiative together make it clear they were looking for more than property tax relief , said Ted Costa , who runs the People 's Advocate , an organization founded by Gann .
" The overwhelming opinion was that the purpose of Prop. 13 was to limit the size of government , " he said .
" By the month before the election , it was clear that blue - collar voters and homeowners everywhere were using Prop. 13 to send a message to government . "
It 's a message that even many opponents of the initiative admit was needed .
For decades before 1978 , property tax in California was based on a percentage of the assessed value of a home .
Every two or three years , the county assessor would look at the sales prices of homes in a neighborhood and set a new and generally higher assessment , which generally meant higher property taxes .
But this low - key process went haywire in the runaway inflation of the 1970s , which sent home prices - and assessments - soaring .
Homeowners paying $ 500 a year in property taxes in 1972 found themselves looking at a $ 2,000 tax bill in 1978 .
Between 1974 and 1978 , the average value of a California home jumped from $ 34,000 to $ 85,000 , and property taxes rose with it .
Homeowners , many of them seniors on fixed incomes , could n't come up with the cash for their dramatically higher property tax bills and faced the terrifying prospect of losing the houses they had lived in for decades .
In one of the great grassroots political efforts in California history , Jarvis and Gann , joined by an army of angry and anxious homeowners , collected more than twice as many signatures as needed to get the initiative on the ballot .
On election day , Prop. 13 passed with 65 percent of the vote .
But those angry voters did n't just celebrate and go home .
After tasting the political power of ballot - box democracy , they quickly went back for more .
A year later , Gann wrote an initiative to limit government spending that passed with 74 percent of the vote .
In 1982 , Proposition 7 , which prevented state income tax from rising with inflation , passed .
Proposition 218 , a 1996 initiative , required a public vote on many local assessment increases .
Tightening the screws
Each new measure tightened the screws on state and local government , either limiting revenues or making it tougher to raise money through taxes .
" Because of Prop. 13 , taxpayers felt they needed to be in control because government was n't giving them a fair shake , " said Teresa Casazza , president of the nonpartisan California Taxpayers Association .
" Taxpayers have a real skeptical view of how the government is taking care of the money it 's receiving . "
Requiring a two - thirds vote for any type of statewide tax increase has tied the Legislature in knots because Republicans , who make up more than a third of both the Assembly and the state Senate , have adamantly opposed any tax hikes .
California voters do n't see the restrictions as a bad thing .
In a Field Poll released today , 72 percent of those surveyed disapproved of changing Prop. 13 to allow the Legislature to raise taxes by a simple majority vote .
When they were reminded that the state faces a multibillion - dollar deficit , the numbers barely moved .
" The huge deficit and state debt do n't make a difference , " said Mark DiCamillo , director of the poll .
" Voters want to set a fairly high bar for increases in taxes and want to see bipartisan support . "
Bureaucrats unhappy
Complaints about Prop. 13 come mainly from government officials and bureaucrats unhappy with the way the initiative transferred the power of the purse to the people paying taxes , said Fox , who worked closely with Jarvis .
" What was revolutionary is that under Prop. 13 , certainty goes to the taxpayer , " he said .
" Before 1978 , the certainty belonged to the tax collector . "
Reagan , both as governor of California and as president , took the view that government was more the problem than the solution .
But with the passage of Prop. 13 , conservative voters saw a solution , a way to shrink government by starving it of revenue .
Costa , who took over People 's Advocate after Gann died in 1989 , has involved the organization not only in tax battles but also in ballot fights on such issues as term limits , victim 's rights , legislative reform and the 2003 recall of Gov. Gray Davis .
He 's talking about a ballot initiative that would define taxes to include several of the government charges and fees that do n't now fall under Prop.
13 's rules .
" We want to reduce the size of government , " he said .
" Our ballot measures do n't say it in so many words , but that 's understood to be on the top of any initiative we put out . "

Columbia University , by inviting Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak , has shown confidence in the wisdom and adultness of their students and our republic .
Ahmadinejad is the president of a major nation in a vital part of the world , and we should have enough self - assurance and belief in our own system of government , and in the intelligence of our college students , that we can let them ( and our larger public ) evaluate his words , whatever they may be .
To be terrified of his speaking there ( or , for that matter , laying a wreath at Ground Zero ) is behavior one would have expected from a fragile regime like Khrushchev 's USSR or Burma 's military junta , not the bold , brave , and fearless USA .
We are the nation whose President Nixon reached out to and met with China 's Mao Tse Tsung at the same time Mao was funding and arming the North Vietnamese to kill our soldiers in Vietnam .
We 're the nation whose President Reagan confronted Soviet President Gorbachev , who at the time had thousands of nuclear warheads armed and pointed at us and was actively funding and arming proxy wars we were fighting in more than a half - dozen nations .
We 're the nation whose President Roosevelt said , " We have nothing to fear but fear itself . "
And let 's also remember that the people of Tehran , Iran , produced one of the largest candlelight vigil demonstrations in the Muslim world in support of the USA the day after 9/11 , repudiating the act and actors of that event .
We still have the ability to make an ally of that nation , and should n't blow it by fear and bluster ( or bombs ) .
America is better and stronger than the nervous Nellies and chickenhawk war - mongers who currently have control of the Republican Party ( and a few Democrats , apparently ) .
As JFK said : " We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts , foreign ideas , alien philosophies , and competitive values .
For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people . "
We are not afraid .
We are Americans !

And by increasing perceptions of shortages , the restrictions have led to hoarding around the world , by farmers , traders and consumers .
“ People are in a panic , so they are buying more and more  at least , those who have money are buying , ” said Conching Vasquez , a 56 - year - old rice vendor who sat one recent morning among piles of rice at her large stall in Los Baños , in the Philippines , the world ’s largest rice importer .
Her customers buy 8,000 pounds of rice a day , up from 5,500 pounds a year ago .
The new restrictions are just an acute symptom of a chronic condition .
Since 1980 , even as trade in services and in manufactured goods has tripled , adjusting for inflation , trade in food has barely increased .
Instead , for decades , food has been a convoluted tangle of restrictive rules , in the form of tariffs , quotas and subsidies .
Now , with Australia ’s farm sector crippled by drought and Argentina suffering a series of strikes and other disruptions , the world is increasingly dependent on a handful of countries like Thailand , Brazil , Canada and the United States that are still exporting large quantities of food .
On a recent morning here in Bangkok , sweaty and heavily tattooed dock workers took turns grabbing 120 - pound sacks of rice from a conveyor belt and carrying them on their heads to cranes that whisked the sacks deep into the hold of a freighter bound for the Philippines .
Most of the one million tons of rice that leaves the dock here each year follows the same spine - crushing routine .
Mom accused of endangerment after boy , 4 , loses fingers to fireworks
An Oakland woman is scheduled to be arraigned today on felony child endangerment charges after her 4 - year - old son was badly injured when he set off a large firecracker while home alone , authorities said .
Adonneka Gilchrist , 26 , is to appear in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland in connection with last week 's incident .
The boy reportedly lost a thumb and three fingers on his right hand and suffered a shattered eardrum when he ignited a firecracker at his home on the 1100 block of 65th Avenue in East Oakland about 2 p.m. Thursday .
The boy was reported to be in fair condition today at Children 's Hospital Oakland .
Gilchrist was also charged with violating probation for a previous misdemeanor count of driving with a suspended license .
Over the years , Black has represented some truly dreadful people .
In what follows , I will leave aside domestic clients , like Blackwater , Philip Morris , and Chiquita ( which pleaded guilty to paying Colombian terrorists last year . )
I will also ignore Black 's work on behalf of dictators who are bad but not truly horrific : for instance , Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo .
I 'm just going to focus on two groups : first , Black 's work for people who used disinformation to get us into the Iraq war , and second , the truly horrible dictators Charlie Black represented .
Black , Manafort ’s own clients at the time included Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire , one of the most kleptocratic rulers of all time , Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines , also known for stealing a few billion dollars , and the murderous Angolan rebels known as UNITA .
“ The well - compensated flacks at Black , Manafort stand at the pinnacle of organizational apologism , ” Spy noted .
“ Name a corrupt despot , and Black Manafort will name the account . ” "
Spy reviewed the operations of a number of top beltway lobbying firms and ranked Black , Manafort as the “ sleaziest ” of the firms it surveyed , giving it a “ blood - on - the - hands ” rating of four .
That was a full bloody hand more than the rating accorded to lobbyist Edward van Kloberg , whose clients included Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania .
Here 's Ken Silverstein quoting an offline piece from Spy , which has a different take on Black 's record :
Now 60 , Mr. Black is easing Mr. McCain into his new role as standard bearer for a party that the senator has clashed with and even snubbed over the years .
Mr. Black has done so in the quiet way that has made him such an enduring player in Washington . "
In between , and often at the same time , he has parlayed his political connections to become one of Washington ’s most successful lobbyists , making him an embodiment of the city ’s permanent establishment .
I 'm going to concentrate on Charlie Black .
He 's generally described as McCain 's chief political advisor .
He was the chair of BKSH & Associates , a lobbying firm , until last month , when he announced he was stepping down to work on McCain 's campaign fulltime .
There 's a good profile of him here :
Since McCain's Convention CEO and one of his campaign 's regional managers resigned when it came out that they had been lobbying for the government of Myanmar , I figured it was only a matter of time before more information about the clients of the many lobbyists who populate the McCain campaign began to come out .
And lo !
here 's a rundown on some of them .
(1) Chalabi and the Lincoln Group : According to this NYT piece , Black 's firm " worked for Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress , as well as the Lincoln Group , hired by the Pentagon to generate positive stories about the Iraq war . "
( Though his work for Chalabi was actually paid for by , well , us : the US taxpayers . )
The Lincoln Group , as you might recall , was an amateurish group hired by the Pentagon to plant pro-American stories -- some true and some " deceptive " -- in the Iraqi press .
My favorite of their proposals was " an anti-terrorist comedy based on " The Three Stooges . " "
For some unfathomable reason , that proposal was rejected .
Ahmed Chalabi , the snake who used disinformation to help convince the US to invade Iraq , and who has since come under suspicion of being an ' agent of influence ' for Iran , is presumably familiar to our readers .
Here 's a 2003 article on Black 's work for him :
" Consider BKSH & Associates , the firm run by well - known GOP strategist Charlie Black .
Over the past four years , BKSH has been boosting the interests of the Iraqi National Congress , whose leader , Ahmed Chalabi , was a key anti-Saddam opponent and now sits on the newly formed Iraqi Governing Council .
Besides helping the INC - which has enjoyed extensive backing from the Pentagon but is quite controversial at the State Department and the CIA - BKSH has started to help open doors for such U.S. companies as AT&T , Cummins Engine , and Fluor that are seeking business in Iraq .
" Due to our past representation of the INC , " says Black , " we know and have worked with a lot of people who will be in the provisional government .
We have a number of clients who are interested in doing business in Iraq . "
Black adds that his firm is " strongly considering " opening an office in Baghdad . "
And :
" BKSH had a special interest in Iraq .
The firm was a key member of the coterie of talking heads , lobbyists , and politicians pushing for war in Iraq that centered around Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) , the anti-Saddam exile group , which was itself a BKSH client .
( The lobbying firm provided the exiles with lobbying and media services ; its staffers acted as the INC 's spokesmen , brokered meetings and deals with Washington insiders , and arranged Chalabi's trips to the United States . ) "
BKSH even won an award for its PR campaign on behalf of Chalabi and the invasion of Iraq :
" The last week of October 2003 had been particularly gory in Baghdad .
Rockets tore into the Al - Rashid Hotel , where Paul Wolfowitz lay sleeping on a rare visit .
Terrorists destroyed the International Red Cross compound , and then , on Wednesday , October 29 , a land mine gutted a US Army Abrams tank outside Baghdad , killing two soldiers .
That was the day BKSH and the Iraqi National Congress were honored for their work in the run-up to the war .
The black - tie award ceremony took place far from the violence in Iraq , in London , where more than 1,000 of the public relations industry elite assembled in a ballroom at the luxurious Grosvenor House Hotel .
PR
Week hosted the event , its annual awards dinner for public relations companies .
Burson - Marsteller , whose subsidiary BKSH had carried out the work , was named the winner in the public affairs category .
The " Awards Supplement " of PR Week called BKSH 's work a " solid , disciplined campaign that is totally deserving of this award . "
" Of particular importance , " said the citation , " was positioning INC founder Dr. Ahmad Chalabi and other Iraqi opposition spokespeople as authoritative political leaders . "
BKSH " compiled intelligence reports , defector briefings , conferences and seminars ....
The PR team also ran a contact - building programme , focusing on the European Union , Downing Street , the Foreign Office and MPs in the UK , matched to a US programme aimed at the White House , the Senate , Congress and the Pentagon . "
The awards description does not mention that the funding came entirely from the US government , let alone that many of the campaign 's claims turned out to be erroneous . "
Minor extra : Black also helped arrange the bizarre coronation ceremony at the Capitol for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon .
(2) Truly horrible dictators : Those Black represented include : Ferdinand Marcos ( the odious dictator of the Philippines ) , Mobutu Sese Seko ( the odious dictator of Zaire ) , Ibrahim Babangida ( the odious dictator of Nigeria ) , Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo ( the odious dictator of Equatorial Guinea ) , Mohamed Siad Barre ( the odious dictator of Somalia ) , and , just to break the pattern , Jonas Savimbi ( who plunged Angola into decades of immensely destructive civil war in an unsuccessful attempt to become its odious dictator . )
I 'm saving Savimbi for a separate post .
Here , some background on the others :
Mobutu Sese Seko : I take it Mobutu , the thuggish kleptocrat who devastated Zaire , needs no introduction .
In case I 'm wrong , here 's a good NYT retrospective .
Excerpt :
" Resplendent in his signature leopard - skin cap and carved wooden scepter topped with an eagle , Mr. Mobutu -- through his canny courtship of Western support , destabilization of his neighbors , systematic corruption and grandiose economic schemes -- left Zaire teetering on the brink of economic collapse .
His cult of personality rose to such heights that for weeks at a time , Zaire 's official press was forbidden to mention the name of any other Zairian than the President himself .
Mr. Mobutu almost singlehandedly invented Zaire , even giving the country its name in replacement of the colonial name , Congo .
But his personal appetite for luxury and wealth spawned a system of official corruption so rapacious that he leaves behind a country in ruin , where revenue from lucrative mines has been squandered or squirreled away in foreign bank accounts .
Life in a vast country deprived of roads , health care , electricity , telephones and often education has reverted to a brutishness unknown since the 1940's . "
( Note : the bank accounts turned out to have a lot less in them than people thought . )

Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo :
Here 's the short version :
" As vast offshore oil fields generate hundreds of millions of dollars for tiny Equatorial Guinea , there are few signs of the petroleum boom in the impoverished West African nation .
Most of the population lives on about a dollar a day , and a U.S. State Department report found " little evidence that the country 's oil wealth is being devoted to the public good . "
So where has the money gone ?
That has been declared a " state secret " by Equatorial Guinea 's ruler , Brig .
Gen. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo .
But the Guinean ambassador to the U.S. and other sources close to Obiang say the country 's oil funds are held in an account at Riggs Bank in Washington .
(...)
Equatorial Guinea 's oil production has jumped from just 17,000 barrels per day in 1996 to a current rate of more than 220,000 barrels per day .
As a result , the Bush administration has initiated a political thaw with the Obiang regime .
In late 2001 , President Bush authorized the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Equatorial Guinea , which had been closed six years earlier , in large part due to the country 's horrific human rights record .
There 's been little if any improvement since then on that issue . "
And then there 's this :
" State radio in the tiny west African state of Equatorial Guinea has hailed the nation 's leader as " the country 's God " . (...)
" He can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell because it is God himself , with whom he is in permanent contact , and who gives him this strength , " a presidential aide announced on the show . "
Note to self : even God needs a lobbyist .
Is n't that special ?

Ferdinand Marcos :
Here I should probably just defer to dr ngo , who knows more about the Philippines than I ever will .
( Especially since it turns out to be surprisingly hard to find a decent summary of Marcos ' human rights record . )
However , until dr ngo shows up to correct and / or amplify ( as I hope he will ) :
Ferdinand Marcos was President of the Philippines from 1965 until 1986 .
He declared martial law in 1972 , after which he ruled as a dictator .
He was fantastically corrupt : Transparency International put him second on its list of most corrupt leaders , which is pretty impressive , given the competition .
His human rights record was dreadful : one historian puts the number of extrajudicial killings under Marcos at 3,257 , and the number of people tortured at 35,000 ; he was successfully sued for " the tortures and killings of nearly 10,000 Filipinos . "
You can read some of their stories here , or here , or here .
Also :
" Marcos inflicted immeasurable damage on democratic values .
He offered the Filipino people economic progress and national dignity , but the results were dictatorship , poverty , militarized politics and a politicized military , and greatly increased dependence on foreign governments and banks .
His New Society was supposed to eliminate corruption , but when Marcos fled the country in 1986 , his suitcases contained , according to a United States customs agent , jewels , luxury items , and twenty - four gold bricks .
Estimates of Marcos 's wealth ran from a low of US $ 3 billion to a high of US $ 30 billion , and even after his death in 1989 , no one knew the true value of his estate , perhaps not even his widow .
If Marcos had been merely corrupt , his legacy would have been bad enough , but he broke the spell of democracy .
The long evolution of democratic institutions , unsatisfactory though it may have been in some ways , was interrupted .
The political culture of democracy was violated .
Ordinary Filipinos knew fear in the night .
An entire generation came of age never once witnessing a genuine election or reading a free newspaper .
Classes that graduated from the Philippine Military Academy were contemptuous of civilians and anticipated opportunities for influence and perhaps even wealth .
Marcos 's worst nightmare came true when Corazon Aquino used the power of popular opinion to bring him down . "
While researching this , I found an email that Steve Clemons posted about Black 's work for Marcos .
In my experience , Steve Clemons ' anonymous sources are usually quite reliable .
Note that " Black Manafort " is Black , Manafort , Stone , and Kelly , a previous version of BKSH & Associates .
The email reads , in part :
" During the final years of the Marcos regime , Black Manafort had the Marcos lobbying account .
Matt [ Freeman ] was one of three guys servicing the account in the field .
US policy was undergoing a dramatic shift at the time .
Secretary of State George Shultz had quietly persuaded Ronald Reagan that it was time to ditch the Marcos family -- and the Black Manafort retainer from the Marcos family had been hugely increased in an effort to turn this around .
The USG was discreetly funding the Marcos opposition ( including the more sedate opposition group led by Cardinal Jaime Sin and the more radical NAMFREL ) .
One of Matt 's tasks was to attempt to document these connections in hopes that they could be used to drive a wedge into Hill support for the administration policy shift .
It was a time of " battling flacks " .
Cory Aquino , widow of the opposition leader Benigno Aquino who had been murdered by a Marcos thug earlier that year , had retained none other than Mark Malloch Brown as her Washington lobbyist .
Mark and Matt were frequently in and out of the Philippines in those days , each developing sources and feeding material into the SFRC and the HFAC .
Dick Lugar proved central to this story .
Shultz won Lugar 's support for dropping the Marcos connection .
. . provided Marcos could be ousted in an election .
Republican election specialist Eddie Mahe was retained by the USG to analyze and defeat the Marcos election - rigging schemes .
Meanwhile , Matt was among those helping the Marcos family to carry out such schemes . "
Charming .

Mohamed Siad Barre took control of Somalia in 1969 , and remained in power until 1991 .
The NYT summarizes :
" In May 1988 , fierce fighting broke out in the north between the Government and rebels who contended they had been discriminated against by the Siad Barre Government and were fighting for a more democratic Government .
A report commissioned by the State Department and made public in September 1989 said the Somali Army " purposely murdered " at least 5,000 unarmed civilians over a 10 - month period in the early phases .
The Government denied the allegation .
More than 10,000 people were reported killed in the months that followed , with allegations that the Somali military had bombed towns and strafed fleeing residents .
Amnesty International said in August 1988 that since 1981 the Government had used torture and " widespread arbitrary arrests , ill treatment and summary executions " of civilians suspected of collaborating with the rebels . "
From the US Country Study of Somalia :
" Faced with shrinking popularity and an armed and organized domestic resistance , Siad Barre unleashed a reign of terror against the Majeerteen , the Hawiye , and the Isaaq , carried out by the Red Berets ( Duub Cas ) , a dreaded elite unit recruited from among the president 's Mareehaan clansmen . (...)
In November 1986 , the dreaded Red Berets unleashed a campaign of terror and intimidation on a frightened citizenry .
Meanwhile , the ministries atrophied and the army 's officer corps was purged of competent career officers on suspicion of insufficient loyalty to the president .
In addition , ministers and bureaucrats plundered what was left of the national treasury after it had been repeatedly skimmed by the top family .
(...)
The Red Berets systematically smashed the small reservoirs in the area around Galcaio so as to deny water to the Umar Mahamuud Majeerteen sublineages and their herds .
In May and June 1979 , more than 2,000 Umar Mahamuud , the Majeerteen sublineage of Colonel Ahmad , died of thirst in the waterless area northeast of Galcaio , Garoowe , and Jerriiban .
In Galcaio , members of the Victory Pioneers , the urban militia notorious for harassing civilians , raped large numbers of Majeerteen women .
In addition , the clan lost an estimated 50,000 camels , 10,000 cattle , and 100,000 sheep and goats . (...)
The military regime conducted savage reprisals against the Isaaq .
The same methods were used as against the Majeerteen -- destruction of water wells and grazing grounds and raping of women .
An estimated 5,000 Isaaq were killed between May 27 and the end of December 1988 .
About 4,000 died in the fighting , but 1,000 , including women and children , were alleged to have been bayoneted to death . (...)
In the late 1980s , disaffection with the regime set in among the Hawiye who felt increasingly marginalized in the Siad Barre regime .
From the town of Beledweyne in the central valley of the Shabeelle River to Buulobarde , to Giohar , and in Mogadishu , the clan was subjected to ruthless assault .
Government atrocities inflicted on the Hawiye were considered comparable in scale to those against the Majeerteen and Isaaq .
By undertaking this assault on the Hawiye , Siad Barre committed a fatal error .
By the end of 1990 , he still controlled the capital and adjacent regions but by alienating the Hawiye , Siad Barre turned his last stronghold into enemy territory .
Faced with saboteurs by day and sniper fire by night , Siad Barre ordered remaining units of the badly demoralized Red Berets to massacre civilians .
By 1989 torture and murder became the order of the day in Mogadishu .
On July 9 , 1989 , Somalia 's Italian - born Roman Catholic bishop , Salvatore Colombo , was gunned down in his church in Mogadishu by an unknown assassin .
The order to murder the bishop , an outspoken critic of the regime , was widely believed to have had come from the presidential palace .
On the heels of the bishop 's murder came the infamous July 14 massacre , when the Red Berets slaughtered 450 Muslims demonstrating against the arrest of their spiritual leaders .
More than 2,000 were seriously injured .
On July 15 , forty - seven people , mainly from the Isaaq clan , were taken to Jasiira Beach west of the city and summarily executed .
The July massacres prompted a shift in United States policy as the United States began to distance itself from Siad Barre . "

On reflection , that 's enough for now .
As I said , I had intended to save Savimbi for a subsequent post , and you can probably live without a description of Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria .
If you think about it , though , Black has represented a more than usually repellent group of dictators .
Two of Transparency International 's top three kleptocrats in recent history ( Marcos and Mobutu ) ; a self - proclaimed God ; torturers , murderers , and even someone who deliberately destroys reservoirs in arid country , so people will die of thirst .
I was reminded recently that a couple of months ago , last time he was defending the number of lobbyists who work on his campaign , McCain said :
" " These people have honorable records , and they 're honorable people , and I 'm proud to have them as part of my team , " McCain told reporters following a town hall meeting in Indianapolis . "
And in the debate at the Reagan Library , he said , as he often has : " I 'll rely on people to judge me by the company that I keep . "
So judge away .
Do you think that it 's possible to be the lobbyist for Chalabi , Mobuto , Marcos , Obiang , and Siad Barre , not to mention Blackwater , Philip Morris , and so on , and still be an honorable person ?
If not , what do you think that the fact that this guy is one of McCain 's closest advisors says about him ?
Farmer given fines for ' illegally parking ' vintage tractor in London ... but he has n't visited the capital for 45 years
Cloned : Farmer Eric
Smart has been given a parking fine for the second time in 18 months and believes his numberplate has been copied
Farmer Eric Smart has been to London once - on a bus 45 years ago .
So the 74 - year - old was surprised to receive a fine at his home near Chesterfield , Derbyshire , for parking his vintage tractor in the capital last month .
Transport for London said the penalty for the alleged offence in Wandsworth , 150 miles from his home , had risen to £ 180 because he had not paid in time .
The vehicle had the registration SWA 525 - the same as Mr Smart 's old Massey Ferguson tractor , which he says has not left his barn for 14 years .
It is the second time in 18 months he has been fined for supposedly parking his tractor illegally in London .
Last year , he was told he owed £ 100 for unloading it in Sloane Square , an area where 4x4 ' Chelsea tractors ' are often sighted - but Massey Fergusons seldom seen .
It is thought Mr Smart may be the victim of a cloned number plate .
He said yesterday : ' I 've run up £ 30 in phone bills trying to explain to Transport for London that my tractor only has a speed of 15 mph and it would take me the best part of two days to get there and back . '
Last year , Kensington and Chelsea council apologised to Mr Smart and told him he did not have to pay after his situation was explained .
He hopes he can resolve the second fine , saying he does not even know where Wandsworth is .
Fines :
The letters Mr Smart received at his home in Chesterfield ... for parking the tractor that has been in his garage for the last 14 years
In a letter to him , they said : ' If a penalty charge notice is not paid or contested within 14 days of issue the council will send an enquiry to the DVLA to find out the name and address of the registered keeper of the vehicle .
' In this case , your name and address was notified to us and that is why a notice to owner was posted to you .
' However , it is clear from further investigation that due to a system error your address details were added incorrectly and as you state your vehicle was not parked in the Royal Borough area at the relevant time . '
Mr Smart hopes his second parking fine for the tractor can also be resolved with Transport for London , and is maintaining a sense of humour about the situation .
' The first time it happened there was only one thing I could think of - that the tractor was delivering a bale of hay to Queen 's horses and if it got there on time she did n't have to feed them sawdust , ' he said .
' This time I just ca n't think - I do n't even know where Wandsworth is . '
back More Evidence That America's Greatest Appellate Court Judge Likes To Share Music Files
As a follow - up to my previous post , an illuminating letter can be found here
The letter suggests that Kozinski and his staff were big NAPSTER fans .
I continue to maintain that trying to deflect this issue in the name of ' privacy ' not only misses the mark , but is actually counterproductive for the ideas that this site stands for .
Legal notions of ' privacy ' can be twisted into another pernicious form of monopoly that is just as destructive as any overbearing IP law .
Assuming these allegations are true ( and I hope that they are ) , it is far better to simply stand up and applaud a great judge for doing what we should all be encouraging : a re-shaping of fair use culture in the digital age .
Far from tarnishing his reputation , this should actually enhance Kozinski 's reputation among defenders of informational freedom .

Yes , I am bemused at the idea that a web server 's published files can be considered private by dint of a lack of promotion or prominence .
The term ' private ' seems to be abused to describe personal information or material that one would wish to be kept private ( such a wish often increasing after consequences of public availability have been appreciated ) .
In terms of a right to privacy , the term strictly only applies to material that IS private .
Aspiration is not actuality .
It is possible that the private domain gets fuzzy at the edges , e.g. an unclasped briefcase left on a train .
Its owner has an expectation that the privacy of their private property will be recognised and respected despite having been lost , except that it may be invaded as far as is necessary to return the lost property .
Here we can argue whether expectation or accessibility defines privacy .
In Kozinski's case it's as if he has pinned a scrapbook to a noticeboard , and an index alongside it - an index that omits to mention the contents of some pages .
For some people it is quite natural to leaf through the book without consideration of the index .
All pages must be considered public .
Especially since the webserver 's raison d'etre is to publish files to members of the public who ask for them .
But , yes Justin , you 're right .
We do need to be very careful that privacy describes a clearly bounded domain and not the subjectively defined class of work or data whose unrestricted circulation or publication is liable to cause embarrassment .
There is a fair bit of web chat at the mo ( http://www.digitalproductions.co.uk/index.php?id=117 ) that seems to drift into the idea that personal information is the rightful property of the person it describes .
This could easily drift into the idea that being found in possession of embarrassing IP is the rightful secret of the person so embarrassed , even though they unwittingly let it slip .
But as for ' re - shaping of fair use culture ' ?
I think it would be more coherent to suggest that we should all be encouraging a freer culture .
The cultural constraint of copyright is inherently unfair because it unnecessarily and unethically suspends cultural freedom .
The definition of ' fair use ' you 'll find in copyright legislation describes only a tiny class of potential defenses that may be used after one has been prosecuted - they do n't negate the fact of copyright infringement .
I 've never heard of a ' fair use culture ' .
And if you believe that judges can reshape our culture , such an atrocious predicament should give you a clue that something has gone terribly wrong .
Judges should be the last to reshape culture .
Our culture shapes the law !

by Crosbie Fitch ] Crosbie - " Judges should be the last to reshape our culture . "
Point well taken .
I do n't think I was as clear as I could have been .
I did n't mean to suggest that Kozinski was actively trying to reshape our culture in terms of IP - but rather that we ( meaning society ) should be actively trying to reshape it and that we should hold up Kozinski 's actions as a positive step to help fuel the discussion .

Overweight men are not more likely to be infertile , as past research has shown to be true in obese women , according to a new study .
Findings of the study , performed in New York in nearly 300 very overweight men , were unexpected , said coauthor Nanette Santoro , MD , an Albert Einstein College of Medicine obstetrician - gynecologist who is trained in reproductive endocrinology .
“ We see pretty significant deficits in fertility in women due to obesity , so we thought we ’d see an effect in men , ” Santoro said .
“ But that was n’t the case . ”
Santoro and her colleagues studied 292 men who gave semen samples at fertility clinics .
The men were ages 18 to 50 and , on average , had a body mass index ( BMI ) of 28 , which is considered nearly obese .
The authors found that greater body weight was not associated with worse sperm production or sperm motility .
Impaired sperm production is the cause of infertility in 90 percent of infertile men , according to Santoro .
About 6 percent of reproductive - age men are infertile , she said .
Increasing body weight was linked to lower testosterone in the 31 study participants for whom testosterone was tested .
However , Santoro said low testosterone causes infertility only if it is very low or occurs in morbidly obese men .
“ Our results show that the process of making sperm is pretty robust and is hard to interrupt , ” Santoro said .
“ It ’s good news for men that body size may be less related to fertility than it is in women . ”
She cautioned that the findings should not serve as an excuse for overweight men to avoid losing weight .
Santoro and her coworkers plan to further study a trend they saw toward reduced sperm motility in the six men who were taking an antidepressant in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) class .
This class of drugs includes Prozac , Celexa , Lexapro , Paxil and Zoloft .
“ We know that SSRIs affect sex drive , but there are n’t much data on their effect on fertility , ” she said .
The results will be presented at The Endocrine Society ’s 90th Annual Meeting in San Francisco .

Yeah , let \'s see Republicans try to \ " Swift Boat \ " Jim Webb ( Navy Cross , Silver Star , Ronald Reagan\ 's Navy Secretary ) -- good luck !
More broadly , Jim Webb brings to the table tremendous national security , military and foreign policy experience .
Webb also brings a focus on economic fairness and social justice , somewhat similar to what John Edwards talks about except Webb calls it the \ " Three Americas\ " ( the rich getting richer , the poor getting poorer , the middle class getting squeezed out of existence ) .
Finally , it was Jim Webb himself who said , \ " The greatest realignment in modern politics would take place rather quickly if the right national leader found a way to bring the Scots - Irish and African Americans to the same table . \ "

The following update was sent by Ze ’ev Drori to Tesla customers yesterday .
You know of course the saying “ Good things are worth waiting for ” ... undoubtedly we were trying the truism of this adage longer than warranted , but we have broken the logjam .
We are delivering the Roadster to our customers .
Already 9 production Roadsters have arrived in California , another 3 arrive this weekend , and they will keep arriving at the rate of 4 per week ( except for the scheduled factory shut down in the last two weeks of August ) .
In fact , currently there are 27 Roadsters in various stages of assembly .
In large measure we deliberately limit the production until we install our own born and bred final transmission by mid-September , at which time production will start to ramp up leading toward a monthly rate of over 100 cars in December .
From the start we planned a slow production rate for the first several months to allow us time to work out the kinks of production prior to increasing the rate of production .
As mentioned above , an important mile marker of our progress is the development and implementation of Powertrain 1.5 , which is going smoothly .
Already we have prototypes running with the Powertrain 1.5 configuration and we are establishing the manufacturing facility for the gearboxes in our own facilities .
The performance of this production configuration is extraordinary .
The Roadster delivery to our customers perfectly dovetails with the Grand Opening of our second Tesla store in as many months .
The first was the one in Los Angeles and it ’s a huge success , and now the one in the heart of Silicon Valley right near Stanford in Menlo Park .
The store in Menlo Park replicates the unique customer experience so successfully present in the LA store and more , since in addition to sales and service it is the place where all final assembly , tests and preparations are made with each car prior to customers ’ delivery .
We are pushing forward with planning for our next stores in New York , Chicago , Miami and Seattle .
In other news , I have hired Mike Donoughe , an accomplished auto industry executive , as our Executive Vice President of Vehicle Engineering and Manufacturing .
Mike spent over 24 years at Chrysler , where most recently , as Vice President of “ Project D ” , he had been tapped to lead their critical redesign of their mid-size vehicle program .
Mike ’s addition is an example of my commitment to build a world class team at Tesla , combining the best of what Silicon Valley and Detroit have to offer , to build this company into the next great car company .
Keep an eye out for additional news on this front .
On behalf of Tesla employees world wide I would like to thank all of our loyal customers and assure you that we do our utmost to justify the faith that you have shown .

Police in Iceland say they shot and killed a polar bear that was threatening the public .
The polar bear is the first to have been seen in Iceland in 20 years .
Police say a farmer saw the bear in northern Iceland .
Icelandic authorities said they were forced to shoot the bear to protect the public after a plan to anaesthetise the animal was abandoned .
The bear , an adult male weighing about 250 kilograms , was presumed to have swum to shore from drifting ice .
The last time a polar bear came ashore in Iceland was in 1988 .
" There was a lot of fog in the area and the bear was moving into the fog .
We could n't risk losing him and there was no time to wait for anaesthetics , so we had to shoot him .
It was for the safety of the public , " Police Superintendent Stefan Vagn Stefansson told Icelandic national radio on Wednesday .
In response to a public outcry at the shooting , the environmental ministry said it would review the incident to see if it could avoid shooting the next bear that lands in the country .
The world 's largest land - based predator lives in the Arctic , depending largely on sea ice to hunt seals .
When bears have come to Iceland they have usually travelled most of the way on icebergs from the east coast of Greenland .
The animals are excellent swimmers .
Last month , polar bears were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species
Act because their sea ice habitat is melting away .
The US Geological Survey said two - thirds of the world 's polar bears - 16,000 - could be gone by 2050 if predictions about melting Arctic sea ice hold true .

Tip :
Do it in the summer .
( If that ’s all you needed , there you go .
Story and explanation follow . )
Let ’s start with the assumption that the majority of the population probably intends to wear engagement and / or wedding rings to mark those events in their life .
I could write another whole post about my ambivalence on the subject .
Despite this ambivalence , I have both .
In the last month , however , I ’ve only been wearing my engagement ring .
It makes me feel strange , just not as strange as if I were n’t wearing a ring at all .
I realize what a different connotation it has .
Engaged ai n’t married .
The reason : the heat that ’s been plaguing DC lately .
My fingers always get fatter in the summer and the recent humidity has been making them almost fluffy .
We got engaged in the end of June ( 2006 ) , so I had my ring sized for fat fingers ( Delaware gets quite humid too ) .
We got married in July but I got to weigh in on that ring and had it sized that March .
It was n’t humid at all and quite cool , so my fingers were their svelte selves .
On the first day of my honeymoon , I probably made Micah quite nervous by spending a lot of time taking off my ring .
I ’d fight with it , tug at it , finally get it off .
Then I ’d put it back on for another hour until I felt the panic again .
I ’m not sure where it came from , but I was terrified that it ’d be stuck on my finger and my finger would die and fall off .
It was also uncomfortable , too tight and constricting .
This summer , I decided to avoid the discomfort and panic altogether by taking it off when the weather warmed up .
I ’ll put it back on in the fall .
It ’d be smart for me to get the ring sized now that it ’s summer , I just do n’t have the same comfort with the area that I had in Delaware .
After living there for years , I knew a trustworthy jewelry store .
So maybe I ’ll do it , maybe I ’ll wait until I find a store I know and trust .
I ’ve got the engagement ring anyway .
But if when I do get it resized , I ’m going to do it in the summer .
Save yourself time , money , frustration , and freaking out your spouse ( though Micah ’s quite understanding ) .
When getting your rings , get them sized at a hot and humid time .
It ’s easier and cheaper to buy a little ring guard for the winter ( if your fingers dramatically shrink in the cold ) than to deal with this discomfort your whole life .
Am I the only one with this seasonal problem ?
As a rule , women are more pessimistic than men .
The pattern has been among the most consistent across years of tracking U.S. consumer sentiment in the Reuters / University of Michigan survey .
Since the survey began tracking gender differences in outlook in January 1978 , women have shown a higher sentiment reading just twice .
Things changed this month .
The long - term trend continued in May as overall consumer sentiment dropped to a 28 - year low .
Yet the mood among women improved slightly whereas sentiment for men soured for a fourth consecutive month , dropping to the lowest since 1980 ( second graphic above ) .
Moods darkened for men by the biggest margin in nearly three years , since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
What ’s behind it ?
One factor at play is a diverging view of personal financial situations .
Women in the survey indicated their situations improved modestly this month from April , albeit from a 27 - year low .
For men , however , May marked the seventh straight month of worsening finances .
In fact , men rated their finances in the worst shape since the survey began tracking the differences between the genders .
Wonder Woman Lynda Carter Finds Dead Body in Potomac
of the popular 1970 's television series Wonder Woman was out boating on the Potomac River in Washington D.C. yesterday when she came upon a dead body .
She was stunned to see a woman floating face down and promptly notified nearby boaters .
Police believe the dead woman was a hiker who may have slipped and fallen into the river .
Washington D.C. fire and emergency services spokesperson Scott Kane says :
A middle - aged woman was found floating in the water about a quarter mile north of Three Sisters Island .
She was found by a woman in a canoe who flagged down some boats and they called Fire and EMS . "
Carter was Miss World USA in 1972 .
Still stunning at age 56 , she returned to films in 2005 and appeared in the remake of The Dukes of Hazzard and Sky High .
She has also appeared in an episode of Smallville this season .
The actress is married to attorney Robert Altman .
He made headlines in 1992 when he stood trial for banking and securities fraud .
He was eventually found not guilty in the highly publicized court proceedings .
Carter was shown in front of the courthouse with her arms wrapped around her husband shouting , " Not guilty , not guilty " to a television reporter .
The shot made national news at the time .

Anybody depending on somebody else ’s gods is depending on a fox not to eat chickens .
~ Zora Neale Hurston
Almost every black person , conservative or liberal , is familiar with the phrase , " It takes a village … "
Almost every libertarian , radical or otherwise , is familiar with the terminology , " methodological individualism . "
Occasionally , as I 've struggled with the pre-liberal genesis of my belief in libertarian law , playing it off against the learnings of my childhood and the raw , unfiltered truths of adulthood , a recurring question remains :
Are those points of view — the individual versus the collective — at odds with each other ?
According to an essay I came across a while ago , written by Dr. Anthony Asudullah Samad , black people are caught in a quandary .
Do black folks have " No Black Agenda or Too Many Blacks With An Agenda ? "
This question — despite the collectivist paradigm within which it resides — likely generates intense interest in any black libertarian , no matter his political pedigree .
Ironically , when my wife proof - read my piece on the Don Imus situation , she said , " this piece makes it seem like you have an agenda . "
This caught me a little off guard , since , having read all my pieces one would have thought my wife would know by now .
I , Wilton D. Alston , have an agenda .
That agenda is : personal liberty .
I want to make my own decisions , be judged upon my own performance , and reap the rewards ( or penalties ) of that performance .
I want to keep the money I make — all of it — unless I decide to give it away .
( And even then I want to decide who gets it . )
I 'm comfortable with the proposition of handling any disputes that may arise between me and those from whom I purchase products or services .
If I need to seek professional help , I 'm okay with finding it .
I am not worried about being foreigner - invaded , globally - warmed , food - and - drug - unadministrated or environmentally - unprotected .
If I get duped into buying a " lemon " from a car dealership , I realize that caveat emptor was in full effect from the get - go .
Simply put , Wilton D. Alston 's agenda with respect to the government is : Leave me the heck alone .
As Cedric the Entertainer says , " I'm a grown - ass man . "
I do n't particularly need a nanny , a straw boss , or a bevy of ostensible black leaders to help me along that journey .
My parents are available should I need advice and I 'm certainly not opposed to obtaining supplemental advice , ideas , and mentoring from others as the need arises .
I realize that seldom does anyone make it alone , and that the image of someone " pulling himself up by his own bootstraps " is just that , an image .
Everyone receives help along their journey through life .
However , the State has proven generally unable to provide that help in a way that does not result in long - term dependence and / or short - term graft .
Simply put , I will take my chances .
If anyone wishes to judge me based upon the ostensible data and race - based predictions dredged up by some washed - up pseudo - thinker — such as those mentioned in my " Tell Me Again Why You 're a Libertarian " essay , that 's a risk I am quite happy for them to take .
This is the kind of individualism that my maternal grandfather , and my father and mother drove into me as a child .
My grandfather would likely have spit in your face if you implied that he needed " help " from some over - arching body .
My father , the son of a share - cropper who never owned the roof over his head , felt ( and feels ) pretty much the same way .
So I 've no compunction with taking the risks , be there any , or with living with the consequences of my performance .
I believe I 'm ready , willing , and able .
All that said — and I 'd be the first to admit that " a rant will do you good " — there sometimes appears to be a friction present in the larger black community , if I may be collectivist for a moment , with regard to such a paradigm .
It was that friction that scratched at my psyche as I read Dr. Samad 's piece .
Such is the friction between being black in Amerika — " we 're all in this struggle together " — and embracing the libertarian ethic of methodological individualism .
Says Dr. Samad :
… we need a Black agenda more than ever .
Some people say we have one .
There is no shortage of organizations and activities in which we may involve ourselves .
But do they lead us to progress ?
We 're all busy doing something , but our involvements gain little for the masses .
All motion is n't progress .
If it were , then why are n't we going forward ?
Maybe , it ’s because there is no Black agenda pointing directly to collective progress .
Dr. Samad goes on :
In nearly every major city in America , Black communities are suffering from a combination of poverty , economic subjugation and police oppression .
The Black community is in a constant state of struggle and a constant debate over its progress and what we 're doing ( what we gon ' do , y'all ) to bring about that progress .
Over the past few months several significant issues , from police shootings across the nation ( New York to Inglewood ) , to campus violence ( elementary schools to college campuses ) , to the " Black Image " of other people calling African Americans everything from Ni**ers to Hoes , and everything in between .
With all due respect , why should I care if someone else does or does not think I 've " made any progress " ?
Why would I continue to let my self - image be not only affected but also defined and defamed by someone else ?
Why must progress necessarily be judged collectively ?
Thinkers such as Hurston provided an answer to these types of question some time ago but more recent folks have put a new twist to it .
Shawn Carter , better known to some as Jay - Z has a song entitled " 99 Problems . "
Given the popularity of hip - hop , it would seem that the words of this song and the defiant , supremely confident tone it sets could have seeped into the collective psyche of any supposedly struggling people .
Here is a particularly relevant set of verses , where our hero gets into a bit of a debate with an officer of the law during an all - too - typical DWB traffic stop :
The year is ’ 94 and in my trunk is raw In my rear view mirror is the [ bleeper - bleeping ] law I got two choices y'all pull over the car or bounce on the double put the pedal to the floor .
Now I ai n’t trying to see no highway chase with u2018Jake '
Plus , I got a few dollars I can fight the case .
So I …pull over to the side of the road And I heard , “ Son do you know why I ’m stopping you for ? ” u2018 Cause
I ’m young and I ’m black and my hat 's real low ?
Do I look like a mind reader sir , I do n’t know .
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo ?
“ Well , you was doing fifty - five in a fifty - four . ” “ License and registration and step out of the car . ”
“ Are you carrying a weapon on you ?
I know alot of you are . ”
I ai n’t stepping out of [ bleep ] all my papers legit .
“ Do you mind if I look round the car a little bit ? ”
Well , my glove compartment is locked , so is the trunk and the back .
And I know my rights so you gon ’ need a warrant for that .
“ Are n’t you sharp as a tack , are some type of lawyer or something ? ” “ Or somebody important or something ? ” Nah , I ai n’t pass the bar but I know a little bit , Enough that you wo n’t illegally search my [ bleep ] .
Now that brother has an agenda .
His agenda is , " leave me the heck alone . "
I am doing my thing , and I know exactly what that is , so just leave me to do it and take your lying , thieving rear - end out of my face .
Yes , that about sums it up for me too .
( Hey , I wonder if Jay - Z is a libertarian . )
One should not think , however , that the items lamented by Dr. Samad and scholars like him are illegitimate .
Far from it .
( And certainly , rap music might not be the well from which springs the map for the future of the black race . )
When Dr. Samad says , " In nearly every major city in America , Black communities are suffering from a combination of poverty , economic subjugation and police oppression , " he is absolutely correct .
Where he and I differ is not in the identification of the problems .
We disagree , if at all , on what to do about it .
Some have opined that covert white racism still holds the black man down .
That racism remains virulent and expressive in the U.S. is a relatively obvious conclusion , but unless one wants things to be worse versus better , he simply cannot look to the State to fix it .
Besides , Lew Rockwell voiced my opinion , and found a legitimate ( and in my mind primary ) culprit , with , " The Enemy Is Always the State . "
S. B. Fuller , a man who should be a hero to many , black and white alike , rose to robust entrepreneurial success at a time when Jim Crow racism was much worse than it has ever been in my lifetime .
I 'd like to believe that if Fuller can become a " Master of Enterprise , " the racism of today 's America is n't quite the problem some would claim .
However , the history of black people in the U.S. is difficult , long , and complex ; I would not presume to simplify it via that one example .
Even if covert racism , hell - bent on maintaining the position of the white race , is still virulent , there is but one way to meet it : head - on and , for goodness sake , not with the " help " of the Nanny State .
History has proven time and again — from Montgomery , Alabama , where the police and mayor used their state - provided authority to facilitate the ability of the bus company to hang on despite the boycott , up to the present day , when the Prison Industrial Complex , financed with stolen ( tax ) revenue , is based almost totally upon free labor extracted from predominantly black men convicted of non-violent drug offenses — that the State is exactly the wrong place to look for help .
( If one is still unconvinced , he need only examine stories like this one where a " suspect " died in police custody after being tased multiple times .
Yeah , they 'll protect you alright . )
During one of our somewhat typical discussions , my fellow LRC columnist Rob Wicks addressed some of these issues :
The impending lower standard of living can really be chalked up to increasing amounts of regulation , which makes it very difficult for poor people to go into business .
A poor but industrious black person cannot start a business unless they either : 1 ) have enough money for whatever licensing ( from business licenses to cosmetology licenses ) they will need ; or , 2 ) conduct an illegal business .
Not all illegal businesses are drugs and guns .
Some are home hair and nail salons .
Some are bakeries without a commercial kitchen .
A black person who wishes to conduct business has to register with the State to have permission to do so .
This was not the case with Madam C.J. Walker .
Indeed .
A black person who is full of drive and determination is all too often thwarted by that which supposedly has his best interest at heart .
He is forced into black ( or grey ) market activity which provides some of the financial outlet he seeks , but brings with it the increased risk of retribution from that very organization — the coercive state — that precludes many of his initial options .
All the while , he is bombarded with questions and banal debate about the collectivist positioning of his race vis -à - vis some other race .
As our discussion concluded , Rob ended with :
The problem is not " no black agenda , " nor too many black agendas .
It ’s too many people waiting around for someone else ’s agenda .
We need far more black agendas .
Each person needs to have their own agenda .
The problem is that far too many people want some “ great man ” to come along with one which they can follow .
( I probably could n't have said it better , although I did add the emphasis . )
If you want freedom for you , but not for others , you 're a hypocrite .
If your idea of liberty is when the free government handouts go the people you think deserve them , you 're still supporting naked theft .
If you 're concerned that [ place racial designation here ] people just can't make it without help , your concern is duly noted , but your condescension is insulting .
( If you want to support worthy causes or needy people , I commend you .
Feel free to use your money , not someone else 's . )
I 'll take my chances either way .
Conclusion
Allow me to end this essay the same way I started it , with the great Zora Neale Hurston .
It would be against all nature for all the Negroes to be either at the bottom , top , or in between .
We will go where the internal drive carries us like everybody else .
It is up to the individual .
That 's an agenda I can embrace .
Handle your business and let the chips fall where they may .
Just in case Hurston is n't your cup of tea , here 's a little something from the great Frederick Douglass .
Everybody has asked the question : ‘ What shall we do with the Negro ? ’
I have had but one answer from the beginning .
Do nothing with us !
Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us .
Do nothing with us !
If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength , if they are worm - eaten at the core , if they are early ripe and disposed to fall , let them fall !
I am not for tying or fastening them on the tree in any way , except by nature ’s plan , and if they will not stay there , let them fall .
And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs , let him fall also .
All I ask is , give him a chance to stand on his own legs !
Let him alone !
The Best of Wilton Alston
With an export boom and oil finds , Brazil , the sleeping giant of South America is awakening
Sitting in his air - conditioned office in Guarantã do Norte , a remote agricultural town on the edge of the Amazon rainforest , local mayor José Humberto Macêdo looked a contented man .
Thanks largely to the global boom in commodities , this soya - growing region has been transformed into the vanguard of Brazil 's march on to the world stage .
" This is going to be the new Brazil , " Macêdo beamed , explaining how ballooning commodity prices had made his region , Mato Grosso state , into a powerhouse of the Brazilian economy .
Across the country , similar optimism can now be heard among businessmen and politicians , all convinced that South America 's sleeping giant is finally waking up .
Brazil has long been known as the país do futuro ( country of the future ) .
But a series of economic and political crises and 21 years of military rule somehow meant the future never quite arrived .
Now things seem to be changing .
Brazil 's currency recently hit a nine - year - high against the dollar , inflation is under control and millions of Brazilians are being propelled towards a new middle class .
Last week , meanwhile , Brazil was awarded " investment grade " status by the financial rating agency Standard & Poor 's , sending the country 's stocks soaring to an all - time high .
Following the announcement , Brazil 's president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , said : " If we translate this into a language that the Brazilian people understand , it means that Brazil was declared a serious country , that has serious policies , that takes care of its finances with seriousness and because of this we deserve international confidence . "
From oranges and iron ore to biofuels , Brazilian exports are booming , creating a new generation of tycoons .
Brazil 's millionaire club grew from 130,000 in 2006 to 190,000 last year - one of the fastest rates in the world , according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group .
" We are the biggest exporters of meat , coffee , sugar , fruit juices and the second biggest of grains , " Brazil 's agriculture minister , Reinhold Stephanes , boasted at a conference in Brasília last month .
Meanwhile , Brazil 's stockmarket , known as the Bovespa , was one of the best performing in the world last year .
Despite the world economic crisis , the Brazilian government recently raised the projected growth rate this year to 5 % - lower than the other so - called BRIC nations of Russia , India and China but impressive for a developing country .
" The future has already arrived , " said David Fleischer , a political scientist at the University of Brasília .
" Foreign investments coming into Brazil are very strong ; inflation is more or less under control ; Brazil now has more international reserves than foreign debt , and the commodities are booming . "
Not to mention the oil .
A series of huge offshore discoveries by the state - owned energy company Petrobras has led many to dub the president " Sheikh Lula " and claim that Brazil may soon become a major oil producer .
In April , when Haroldo Lima , head of Brazil 's national petroleum agency , made headlines after claiming that another huge oilfield had been found off Rio's coast , the news appeared to confirm what many Brazilians have long claimed : God is Brazilian .
Lia Valls , an economist at Rio's Getulio Vargas Foundation , said : " We are now living a singular economic situation we have never experienced before .
The international situation is very favourable to Brazil . "
In February , when the government announced that it had paid off its foreign debt , Lula boasted that Brazil had " taken an extremely important step towards transforming itself into a country taken seriously in the financial world " .
" We will transform this country , definitively , into a great economy and a great nation , " the president added .
Keen to transform itself from developing nation to world power , Brazil is also presiding over a 1,200 - strong UN stabilisation force in conflict - ridden Haiti .
Paulo Cordeiro , the country 's former ambassador in Port - au - Prince , said the presence of Brazilian troops was a " demonstration of Brazil ... wanting more responsibility .
" I think Brazil has already reached a certain level of development in which the international community starts calling on it to act more , " he said .
" Brazil 's international leadership has grown a great deal over the last six or seven years , " said the University of Brasília 's Fleischer , citing Brazil 's involvement in the UN mission and its leadership of the emerging nations in the Doha talks .
" The tendency is for this influence to keep growing . "
For analysts , much of the euphoria sweeping Brazil is down to the ability to control the inflation that plagued the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
In 1993 inflation reached 2,490 % .
Today the figure stands at about 4.7 % .
" I think now it is difficult to imagine a return to this , " said Valls .
Analysts are less certain , however , about the effects that a drop in commodity prices might have .
Many believe this could bring a dramatic end to Brazil 's boom .
Others question whether the infrastructure and education systems are strong enough to maintain the economic momentum .
Valls warned : " All this does not mean you are guaranteed economic growth .
Brazil still has serious structural problems ; there needs to be lots of investment in infrastructure .
There are some serious pitfalls that compromise this growth : education , having a qualified workforce , health . "

The late André Bensoussan worked with me on the Multics operating system at Honeywell in Cambridge .
We were working on a major change to the file system , which required a subsystem , the VTOC manager , to manage file description information .
It had to transport the file information between disk and memory , manage a shared memory buffer pool , and manage space on disk for the information .
In other words , it was a small virtual memory manager .
André took on the job of design , implementation , and test of the VTOC manager .
He started by sitting at his desk and drawing a lot of diagrams .
I was the project coordinator , so I used to drop in on him and ask how things were going .
" Still designing , " he 'd say .
He wanted the diagrams to look beautiful and symmetrical as well as capturing all the state information .
I was getting nervous about the schedule , so I was glad when he finally began writing code .
He wrote in pencil , at his desk , instead of using a terminal .
He declined offers of typing help , and just kept writing away in pencil .
He rewrote parts , copied things over , erased and rewrote .
Finally André took his neat final pencil copy to a terminal and typed the whole program in .
His first compilation attempt failed ; he corrected three typos , tried again , and the code compiled .
We bound it into the system and tried it out , and it worked the first time .
In fact , the VTOC manager worked perfectly from then on .
Only one bug was ever found in it , and that was my fault :
André had asked me the calling sequence for an error procedure , and I 'd guessed instead of looking it up , so it crashed the first time it hit an error .
Beyond that the program was perfect .
How did André do this , with no tool but a pencil ?
Different sort of free Wi-Fi starts to thrive

San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that citywide wireless Internet access is slowly becoming a reality despite political infighting - and that 144,000 residents will be surfing the Web for free by the end of the year at no cost to the city .
Standing on the rooftop of a Mission District single - room - occupancy hotel , Newsom pointed to a " repeater antenna " - which looks like an oversized , white computer mouse - and said the devices someday will blanket the city with free blanketed Wi -Fi .
The devices are made by a South of Market company named Meraki , and hundreds now dot the rooftops and balconies of private residences , nonprofit hotels and public housing projects .
Meraki is donating the devices plus free Internet access point to any San Francisco resident who wants them .
Neighbors within a block 's radius of the device can tap into the Internet for free , too .
Blanketing the city is expected to require 15,000 devices .
The company , founded two years ago , is using San Francisco as a testing ground to bolster its name and reputation so it can sell more devices elsewhere .
The mayor 's office is working to ensure that SRO hotels and public housing projects are some of the first to receive the devices because residents there typically do n't have Internet access .
Five public housing projects now have the technology , and 13 more are expected to have it by the end of the year , Newsom said .
Newsom is calling the idea Wi - Fi 2.0 - a nod to his high - profile but unsuccessful first attempt to bridge the " digital divide " between San Franciscans who take Internet access for granted and low - income people who can't easily log on to e-mail , find job listings or surf news sites .
After years of negotiating , the city agreed last year to a deal in which EarthLink would pay San Francisco $ 2 million for the right to build , install and run a free mesh Wi -Fi network and to team up with Google to provide Internet service .
The deal needed approval from the Board of Supervisors , but many members expressed concern for a variety of reasons .
Some worried about users ' privacy , others about whether the connection would be fast enough to make it worthwhile , and still others about whether the plan amounted to a monopoly giveaway of a public resource .
EarthLink backed out of the deal in August .
On Wednesday , some supervisors said the mayor finally has come around to their thinking about Wi-Fi .
" I 'm glad the mayor finally sees it my way , " Supervisor Jake McGoldrick said .
" You do n't need to hand over city assets .
I never thought the city needed to give away a public asset and create a monopoly .
...
It took him three years to finally see the light of day .
I 'm very pleased , very pleased . "
Board President Aaron Peskin said he always thought there was a " more democratic solution " and pointed out that cities around the country are having problems with their Wi-Fi partnerships with EarthLink .
" We made the right decision , " he said .
Newsom remains aggravated the EarthLink deal fell apart and still blames the supervisors .
" They made it crystal clear they did not want it to succeed - for no , I would argue , good reason , " he said Wednesday .
" This has been a very frustrating process to make real the commitments we made years ago .
... We just did n't give up .
We never take no for an answer . "
Meraki plans to blanket the city for less than $ 5 million .
It will deliver download speeds of 1 megabit per second , three times faster than the free access proposed in the original plan .
" We 're excited to be changing the way people get online , " said Sanjit Biswas , CEO and co-founder of the company .
Mr Durham , along with other newcomers to the village , was warned he would have to live alongside Percy when he moved to Martin 14 months ago , added : " Who knows where this will all end - we could have 20 by the end of summer . "
A friend of mine , Arrigo Triulzi ( no web page that he wants to admit to ) , has just posted this fantastically scary missive to the Robust Open Source mailing list ( no public archive , so I will quote it in its entirety )
I ’ve been working on firmware for the past two and a bit years , in particular in the field of firmware viruses .
Without needlessly boring everyone with the various steps allow me to share an interesting observation : drivers often assume the hardware is misbehaved but never malicious .
It is fascinating to discover what can be done by making the hardware malicious .
Summarising briefly my work , as yet unpublished except the obligatory notices to the affected vendors ( in what follows please read NIC as strictly wired , no wireless cards ) :
1 ) there are remarkably naive “ protection ” methods to prevent malicious users from overwriting NIC firmware with something of their choice ,
2 ) as an extension to 1 ) above it is amazing to discover how simply firmware can be updated over the wire on specific NICs ,
3 ) from 1 & 2 above , after about two years , I ’ve reached my goal of writing a totally transparent firewall bypass engine for those firewalls which are PC - based : you simply overwrite the firmware in both NICs and then perform PCI - to - PCI transfers between the two cards for suitably formatted IP packets ( modern NICs have IP “ offload engines ” in hardware and therefore can trigger on incoming and outgoing packets ) .
The resulting “ Jedi Packet Trick ” ( sorry , could n’t resist ) fools , amongst others , CheckPoint FW - 1 , Linux - based Strongwall , etc .
This is of course obvious as none of them check PCI - to - PCI transfers ,
4 ) I have extended the technique to provide VM escape support : one writes packets from a bridged guest into the network which initiates the NIC firmware update , updates the firmware and then the NIC firmware is used to inject code into the underlying VM host .
The requirement to write to the network is then dropped as all that is required is the pivoting in the NIC firmware .
John McCain 's campaign could not have seen this coming -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee forced on the defensive by , of all people , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
Much as McCain and his staff wanted to hammer home their view that Barack Obama is clueless about Iraq , Maliki seemingly gave the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee a big dose of credibility when word surfaced over the weekend that , as quoted by the German magazine Der Spiegel , he said he would like to see U.S. troops leave his country " as soon as possible . "
Maliki , Der Spiegel reported , went on to say : " U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right time frame for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes . ”
Maliki's office , suddenly finding him thrust smack in the middle of the U.S. campaign , issued a somewhat half - hearted demurral , insisting something got lost in the translation of what he said .
But an audio recording of his comment , vetted by the New York Times , showed that Der Spiegel essentially got it right .
And in the initial readout from Obama 's visit today with Maliki in Baghdad , the Associated Press reported that the Iraqi government would like to see American combat units gone at some point in 2010 -- a timeframe , the story noted , that " falls within the 16 - month withdrawal plan proposed by Obama . "
[ UPDATE : The L.A. Times has the story , as well . ]
McCain , during a round - robin set of appearances this morning on the major morning talk shows , did his best to try to change the subject by focusing on how wrong , in his view , Obama was for opposing the U.S. troop surge in Iraq last year , which has been widely credited with restoring a semblance of security there .
On ABC's " Good Morning America , " for instance , McCain chided Obama for a " fundamental misjudgment " on the surge .
And on NBC ’s “ Today ” show , he said his rival " badly misjudged " what was needed in Iraq .
McCain , though , did not escape unscathed during his interview sessions .
In a verbal flub that will spark renewed recollections of his Shiite / Sunni miscue earlier this year while he was visiting the Middle East , he erroneously reconfigured the map of the world .
Asked on ABC about the uptick in violence by Islamic extremists in Afghanistan , he replied : " We have a lot of work to do and I 'm afraid it 's a very hard struggle , particularly given the situation on the Iraq / Pakistan border . "
Iraq borders several nations , but Pakistan is not among them -- looming between the two is Iran .
( Pakistan 's neighbors , however , include Afghanistan ) .
The Note , ABC 's daily political summary , opined that by " appearing to confuse Iraq and Afghanistan " McCain ended up committing " the first big gaffe " since Obama embarked on his overseas trip amid much speculation about mistakes he might make .

Carbon - based fuels ( oil , coal , natural gas ) provide about 85 percent of U.S. energy and generate most greenhouse gases .
So , the simplest way to stop these emissions is to regulate them out of existence .
Naturally , that ’s what cap - and - trade does .
Companies could emit greenhouse gases only if they had annual “ allowances ” — quotas — issued by the government .
The allowances would gradually decline .
That ’s the “ cap . ” Companies ( utilities , oil refineries ) that needed extra allowances could buy them from companies willing to sell .
That ’s the “ trade . ” ...
By 2050 , U.S. greenhouse gases would be rapidly vanishing .
Even better , their disappearance would allegedly be painless .
Reviewing five economic models , the Environmental Defense Fund asserts that the cuts can be achieved “ without significant adverse consequences to the economy . ”
Fuel prices would rise , but because people would use less energy , the impact on household budgets would be modest .
This is mostly make - believe .
If we suppress emissions , we also suppress today ’s energy sources , and because the economy needs energy , we suppress the economy .
The models magically assume smooth transitions .
If coal is reduced , then conservation or non -fossil - fuel sources will take its place .
But in the real world , if coal - fired power plants are canceled ( as many were last year ) , wind or nuclear wo n’t automatically substitute .
If the supply of electricity does n’t keep pace with demand , brownouts or blackouts will result .
...
As emission cuts deepened , the danger of disruptions would mount .
...
The idea that higher fuel prices will be offset mostly by lower consumption is , at best , optimistic .
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a 15 percent cut of emissions would raise average household energy costs by almost $ 1,300 a year .
This is just a fundamental misreading of the intent and probable effect of a cap and trade system .
At base , cap and trade is about establishing a price for the right to emit carbon because unpriced emissions have huge social costs .
The effect of a carbon price will then be to make alternatives competitive and to induce investments in efficiency .
I do n’t know anyone who believes that a transition away from fossil fuels will be painless , but there is wide agreement that the market mechanisms embodied in a carbon pricing scheme are the least painless way to achieve reductions .
...
And there will only be shortages of energy if consumers do n’t feel the cost of the carbon price , which they will .
...
But really , this is just laying the groundwork for the big stupid conclusion :
Unless we find cost - effective ways of reducing the role of fossil fuels , a cap - and - trade system will ultimately break down .
It would n’t permit satisfactory economic growth .
But if we ’re going to try to stimulate new technologies through price , let ’s do it honestly .
A straightforward tax on carbon would favor alternative fuels and conservation just as much as cap - and - trade but without the rigid emission limits .
A tax is more visible and understandable .
If environmentalists still prefer an allowance system , let ’s call it by its proper name : cap - and - tax .
Yowza .
As any economist worth his or her salt will tell you , a cap and trade plan with auctioned permits is essentially identical to a carbon tax .
That also happens to be exactly what Barack Obama is proposing .
So , another way for Samuelson to have written this column would have been to title it , “ Barack Obama has a good plan to reduce carbon emissions . ”
I ’ll give Samuelson some credit–he ’s right to worry about government handouts , of either permits themselves or of revenues from the sale of the permits .
But that ’s a concern with either plan ( and a much bigger concern in conservative plans to forgo pricing altogether in favor of large research subsidies ) .
And he fails to mention the big advantage of a cap and trade plan , which is that it allows us to target an emissions level ( and adjust it easily ) rather than guessing at a carbon price .
But apparently , Samuelson thought the best way to inform his readers was to significantly misrepresent the details of a cap and trade plan , en route to advocating a different solution which is nearly identical and in some ways inferior to cap and trade .
His readers are now dumber for his efforts .
H
ow to explain the oil price ?
Why is it so high ?
Are we running out ?
Are supplies disrupted , or is the high price a reflection of oil company greed or OPEC greed .
Are Chavez and the Saudis conspiring against us ?
In my opinion , the two biggest factors in oil ’s high price are the weakness in the US dollar ’s exchange value and the liquidity that the Federal Reserve is pumping out .
The dollar is weak because of large trade and budget deficits , the closing of which is beyond American political will .
As abuse wears out the US dollar ’s reserve currency role , sellers demand more dollars as a hedge against its declining exchange value and ultimate loss of reserve currency status .
In an effort to forestall a serious recession and further crises in derivative instruments , the Federal Reserve is pouring out liquidity that is financing speculation in oil futures contracts .
Hedge funds and investment banks are restoring their impaired capital structures with profits made by speculating in highly leveraged oil future contracts , just as real estate speculators flipping contracts pushed up home prices .
The oil futures bubble , too , will pop , hopefully before new derivatives are created on the basis of high oil prices .
There are other factors affecting the price of oil .
The prospect of an Israeli / US attack on Iran has increased current demand in order to build stocks against disruption .
No one knows the consequence of such an ill - conceived act of aggression , and the uncertainty pushes up the price of oil as the entire Middle East could be engulfed in conflagration .
However , storage facilities are limited , and the impact on price of larger inventories has a limit .
Saudi Oil Minister
Ali al - Naimi recently stated , “ There is no justification for the current rise in prices . ”
What the minister means is that there are no shortages or supply disruptions .
He means no real reasons as distinct from speculative or psychological reasons .
The run up in oil price coincides with a period of heightened US and Israeli military aggression in the Middle East .
However , the biggest jump has been in the last 18 months .
When Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 , the average price of oil that year was about $ 27 per barrel , or about $ 31 in inflation adjusted 2007 dollars .
The price rose another $ 10 in 2004 to an average annual price of $ 42 ( in 2007 dollars ) , another $ 12 in 2005 , $ 7 in 2006 , and $ 4 in 2007 to $ 65 .
But in the last few months the price has more than doubled to about $ 135 .
It is difficult to explain a $ 70 jump in price in terms other than speculation .
Oil prices have been high in the past .
Until 2008 , the record monthly oil price was $ 104 in December 1979 ( measured in December 2007 dollars ) .
As recently as 1998 the real price of oil was lower than in 1946 when the nominal price of oil was $ 1.63 per barrel .
During the Bush regime , the price of oil in 2007 dollars has risen from $ 27 to approximately $ 135 .
( see here )
Possibly , the rise in the oil price was held down , prior to the recent jump , by expectations that Democrats would eventually end the conflict and restrain Israel in the interest of Middle East peace and justice for the Palestinians .
Now that Obama has pledged allegiance to AIPAC and adopted Bush ’s position toward Iran , the high oil price could be a forecast that US / Israeli policy is likely to result in substantial supply disruptions .
Still , the recent Israeli statements that an attack on Iran was “ inevitable ” only jumped the oil price about $ 8 .
Perhaps more difficult to understand than the high price of oil is the low US long term interest rates .
US interest rates are actually below the rate of inflation , to say nothing of the imperiled exchange value of the dollar .
Economists who assume rational participants in rational markets cannot explain why lenders would indefinitely accept interest rates below the rate of inflation .
Of course , Americans do n’t get real inflation numbers from their government and have not since the Consumer Price Index was rigged during the Clinton administration to hold down Social Security payments by denying retirees their full cost of living adjustments .
According to statistician John Williams ( www.shadowstats.com ) , using the pre-Clinton era measure of the CPI produces a current CPI of about 7.5 % .
Understating inflation makes real GDP growth appear higher .
If inflation were properly measured , the US has probably experienced no real GDP growth in the 21st century .
Williams reports that for decades political administrations have fiddled with the inflation and employment numbers to make themselves look slightly better .
The cumulative effect has been to deprive these measurements of veracity .
If I understand Williams , today both inflation and unemployment rates , as originally measured , are around 12 % .

THREE hundred and fifty years ago today , religious freedom was born on this continent .
Yes , 350 years .
Religious tolerance did not begin with the Bill of Rights or with Jefferson ’s Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom in 1786 .
With due respect to Roger Williams and his early experiment with “ liberty of conscience ” in Rhode Island , this republic really owes its enduring strength to a fragile , scorched and little - known document that was signed by some 30 ordinary citizens on Dec. 27 , 1657 .
It is fitting that the Flushing Remonstrance should be associated with Dutch settlements , because they were the most tolerant in the New World .
The Netherlands had enshrined freedom of conscience in 1579 , when it clearly established that “ no one shall be persecuted or investigated because of his religion . ”
And when the Dutch West India Company set up a trading post at the southern tip of Manhattan in 1625 , the purpose was to make money , not to save souls .
Because the founding idea was trade , the directors of the firm took pains to ensure that all were welcome .
For example , while the Massachusetts Bay Colony was enforcing Puritan orthodoxy , there were no religious tests in the Dutch colony .
So open was New Amsterdam that at least 16 languages were being spoken there by the 1640s ; by 1654 , the first Jews in what is now the United States had been able to settle there peaceably .
But religious tolerance had its limits in New Amsterdam , especially when it came to Quakers , who then had a reputation as obnoxious rabble - rousers .
Peter Stuyvesant , the provincial director general and a Type A personality if ever there was one , was not going to tolerate a Quaker presence in his domain .
To make his point , he ordered the public torturing of Robert Hodgson , a 23 - year - old Quaker convert who had become an influential preacher .
And then he issued a harsh ordinance , punishable by fine and imprisonment , against anyone found guilty of harboring Quakers .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. , Iranian and Western diplomats played down worries about a looming Israeli military attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities on Tuesday after reports of heightened tensions rattled nerves and helped drive oil prices near record highs .

“ The military option is the last thing that we need to do and it will not be used easily , ” said a Western diplomat in Tel Aviv .
“ I do n’t think there will be an attack in the next six months . ”
Efforts to ease public fears of a possible confrontation between Israel and Iran followed more than a week of speculation touched off by a New York Times report that U.S. officials believed Israel had practiced for a possible military strike against the Islamic Republic .
Concern about a confrontation flared again on Tuesday when ABC News reported that an unnamed senior U.S. defense official said there was an increasing likelihood that Israel would attack Iran over its nuclear program , which could prompt Tehran to retaliate against both Israel and the United States .
The news jangled nerves and helped push oil prices up $ 2 a barrel , near the record $ 143.67 hit on Monday , on worries Tehran could move to halt shipments through the Strait of Hormuz .
About 40 percent of all seaborne oil trade passes through that Gulf choke point .
Iran is the world ’s fourth - biggest oil producer .
U.S. officials sharply dismissed the ABC News report .
“ I have no information that would substantiate that , ” State Department spokesman Tom Casey said .
“ The official State Department reaction to that is one , laughter , and saying ‘ Coward , get out there and talk about in on the record if you ’ve actually got something to say , ’ ” he said , referring to the unnamed official cited in the report .
IRANIAN DOUBTS
Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told NBC
News he did not believe Israel would attack Iran .
“ Where Israel is today ... will not allow it to engage in regional adventurism , ” Mottaki said .
“ Israel is still facing the post trauma of the attack against Lebanon in 2006 .
So we do n’t believe that Israel ... is in a position to be able to engage in another attack in the region . ”
But Mottaki said Iran would make no distinction between an attack by Israel or an attack by the United States and would deliver a widespread response , NBC reported .
“ It should be understood that all efforts should be made towards Israel avoiding a militaristic action in the region , ” he said .
The Western diplomat in Israel said there was no consensus in Israel in favor of an attack and the United States was unlikely to act because it estimated Iran ’s nuclear program would not reach a point of no return for about two years .
The United States and other Western powers charge Tehran with seeking to develop nuclear weapons , but Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful energy production .
Israel is widely assumed to be the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons , although it has never said it has an atomic arsenal .
Despite efforts to allay public fears of a looming clash , the United States kept up its pressure on Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program .
U.S. envoy Garold Larson , marking the 40th anniversary of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in Geneva , said the United States “ remained very concerned that parties like Iran have violated their commitments and thereby undermined the treaty . ”
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , in Germany on a European trip , said he was talking to European leaders about coordinating efforts “ to make sure the financial system is n’t perverted or abused by those who would attempt to use it to acquire weapons , to further their nuclear objectives or to finance terrorists . ”
A great idea I learned from weight training is the concept of progressive training .
Progressive training means that you keep gradually increasing the weights you lift ( over a period of weeks , months , and years ) , so you always experience a high degree of challenge in your training .
In broader terms progressive training means changing various aspects of your training to increase the challenge , including distance , speed , duration , etc .
If you keep lifting the same weights week after week , you are n’t going to get much stronger .
Progressive training helps ensure that you remain in the sweet spot of challenge , so you grow stronger in less time than you would otherwise .
Of course progressive training can be applied to other areas beyond your physical body .
I find it especially valuable as a skill - building tool .
Here ’s an example of how I ’ve been using progressive training since the summer of 2004 to build my speaking and communication skills .
Deciding to Train
First , I made the conscious decision to train up in this area .
I knew I eventually wanted to do professional speaking , and it was n’t hard for me to recognize that I lacked the basic knowledge and skills required to succeed .
I also had very little experience doing public speaking .
I figured it would take me at least a few years and many hundreds of hours to reach the level of skill I desired .
But instead of being intimidated by all that work ahead of me , I just accepted it .
Those years were going to pass anyway , so I might as well emerge on the other side a better speaker .
Basic Training
In May 2004 I decided to kick things off my training by joining Toastmasters International .
I attended local club meetings as a guest to find a club I liked , and then I joined one .
A few weeks later I gave my first 7 - minute “ icebreaker ” speech .
Over the following months , I gave more 7 - minute speeches .
I experimented with humorous speeches , storytelling , and various delivery styles .
I was less concerned about giving great speeches at this time than I was with simply gaining experience .
In the fall of 2004 , I entered Toastmasters ’ humorous speech contest and made it pretty far for a first - timer ( 2nd place at Division level ) .
Shortly after that I was invited to attend a couple advanced Toastmaster clubs and began visiting their meetings as a guest in addition to my regular club .
Six months later I competed in the Spring 2005 International speech contest and again did fairly well for my experience level ( 3rd place at Division ) .
Advanced Training
After 10 months in Toastmasters , I had earned my CTM award ( “ Competent Toastmaster ” ) .
This qualified me to join the most advanced club in Las Vegas , and I joined as soon as I could .
In that club the challenge was much greater .
Many of the members were pro speakers , some with decades of experience .
I began giving longer speeches , gradually building to the 20 - 40 minute range .
I received a lot of great feedback and coaching .
After six months in the advanced club , I dropped my original club because it was no longer challenging me enough .
A few months later I presented a 90 - minute workshop to a group of about 60 people , soon followed by a 90 - minute Q&A session .
I was well - prepared and received very positive feedback .
Stretching the Boundaries
To push myself even further , I began attending weekly improv comedy workshops to develop my improvisational skills .
I performed in a live show earlier this month .
I ’ve found improv very challenging , but it helps me think fast on my feet .
Plus it ’s stretched me in ways that Toastmasters meetings never would .
I get to experiment with unusual characters , do physical comedy , act out scenes with other players , and basically make a complete fool of myself in front of an audience .
But the benefit is that after doing this for a while , everything else seems much easier by comparison .
Throughout this time I worked on my content , speech writing , organization , delivery skills , gestures , vocal variety , facial expressions , eye contact , blocking ( i.e. movement around the stage ) , humor , storytelling , manner , take - home value , etc .
I attended workshops and seminars and read books on speaking skills and professional speaking .
This was a lot of work over an almost two - year period , probably amounting to almost 1000 hours of my time .
That ’s about 6 months of 40 - hour weeks .
And I did n’t get paid for any of it .
In fact , I had to pay for it , although the money was n’t much .
And the Training Continues …
So am I done training yet ?
Not remotely .
My next step is to join the National Speakers Association .
I ’m not qualified to join the national organization yet , but I can join the Las Vegas chapter , which just formed last year .
I plan to attend my first local NSA meeting in about three weeks .
Once again this will increase the challenge , introduce me to better coaches , and compel me to grow stronger and more competent .
In fact , the training will never really end .
Even as I start doing professional speaking , I ’ll continue the private training to keep improving .
Why Progressive Training ?
The major benefit to progressive training is that as you increase the challenge , what once seemed heavy to you will begin to feel much lighter .
Maybe that 20 - lb dumbbell feels heavy now , but once you ’ve progressed to 40 - lb dumbbells , that 20 - pounder feels light .
It still weighs the same it always did , but your capacity has grown , such that seems lighter by comparison .
You ca n’t always change the weight of the tasks ahead of you , but you can increase your strength to the point that those same tasks feel lighter .
When I delivered my first 7 - minute Toastmasters speech in June 2004 , it was a reasonable challenge for me .
But the speech I gave was very dull with no stories or humor .
And my delivery ( using notes , standing behind a lectern , monotone vocalization , lame gestures ) was unexciting .
But it was the best I could do at the time .
I was at the point of unconscious incompetence — I did n’t even know what I did n’t know .
Fast forward almost two years , and doing a 7 - minute speech like my first one seems like a ridiculously light weight .
Today I could give a better impromptu speech with no preparation , and I ’d feel more confident than I did back then with plenty of preparation and notes .
The weights I ’m training with today are so much heavier that a 7 - minute speech is feather - light by comparison .
But it sure did n’t feel that way when I first started .
Progressive training is the key to growing stronger .
If I ’d stuck with my basic Toastmasters club and kept doing vanilla 7 - minute speeches over and over , I ’d still have improved over time .
But I accelerated my growth significantly by progressing to longer speeches , workshops , humor , storytelling , bigger audiences , speech contests , improv comedy , etc .
After doing improv workshops , when I went back to doing impromptu speaking in Toastmasters , it seemed almost trivially easy , even though impromptu speaking used to challenge me greatly .
I thought to myself , “ All I have to do is speak for a minute off the top of my head ?
I do n’t have to sing it … with a foreign accent … while making it rhyme … while pretending to be a funny character … while trying to make it funny to the audience ?
Oh , this is going to be easy ! ”
Private Training Improves Public Performance
Whether your real - world performance involves public speaking , selling , or programming , you can accelerate your growth with progressive training .
Keep raising the bar for yourself , taking on challenges that are just beyond the edge of your comfort zone .
These should be weights that you can still lift , but they ’re going to require close to 100 % effort .
A lazy 50 % effort just wo n’t cut it .
50 % effort wo n’t help you grow .
100 % effort will .
The more we sweat in training , the less we bleed in war .
– U.S. Navy SEALs
That pretty much says it all , does n’t it ?
Live Performance Is NOT Training
When you train , hard is good .
When you perform , easy is good .
A live show is not acting school .
Making a sales call is not sales training .
Competing in a game is not practice .
The main difference between real - world performance and actual training is coverage .
In real - world performance situations , you ’ll lack sufficient coverage of those elements that occur infrequently in the real world but which can still be critical to your long - term success .
In the real world , situations will arise for which you are unprepared , and private training can prepare you for them , regardless of how often they occur outside of training .
It ’s often these infrequent situations that throw amateurs for a loop but which the pros handle competently .
For example , suppose you want to master the game of blackjack .
Grabbing a deck of cards and playing sample hands is a very poor way to learn .
Some situations occur very infrequently , but they can still make a significant difference in your results if you screw them up .
One of those situations is knowing when to split pairs and when to double down after splitting .
You can place an initial $ 100 bet , but with repeated pair - splitting and doubling down after splitting , you can suddenly have $ 500 or more riding on that same hand .
( Example :
The dealer has a 5 showing .
You split a pair of 7s and get another 7 , so you split again .
On the first 7 you get a 3 and double down with your 10 .
On the second 7 you get a 4 and double down with your 11 .
On the third 7 you get a 10 and stand at 17 .
Your original $ 100 bet is now $ 500 .
And this is indeed the correct strategy . )
If you play it incorrectly , the swing of that one hand can make or break your entire session , even though the probability of it happening is remote .
Most beginners would play this hand too conservatively and never split the first pair of 7s , standing at 14 against the dealers 5 .
They miss the opportunity for a big win when the odds are in their favor because they did n’t prepare for this situation in advance .
It ’s an improbable situation to be sure , but if you play long enough , it ’s only a matter of time before it happens .
Live performance also gives you excessive training where you least need it .
Even inexperienced blackjack players know they should always stay when they ’re dealt a 20 ( the most common hand in the game ) , and there ’s no point in continuing to practice the play of these hands .
Private training should be used to strengthen your weak areas , especially when your live performance is n’t giving you enough coverage of them .
Training Pays !
One of the reasons top professional speakers get paid thousands of dollars for an hour of their time is because of all the training and experience they ’ve endured to reach that point .
A great speaker can use that hour to permanently change the way people think and behave , and that skill will always be in high demand .
You can apply progressive training to build skill in any area of your life : physical , mental , social , spiritual , etc .
I ’ve found it especially useful in building my modern day survival skills .
Through lots of reading and experimentation , I learned how to create systems that generate income for me ( like this web site ) .
I have no hourly rate because I do n’t trade my time for money .
Consequently , I enjoy an almost ridiculous level of freedom .
On this Saturday morning , I ’m choosing to write this article , but I could just as easily blow off the next few months and do nothing .
Years of private training , which mainly involved conditioning the right mindset , made it possible for me to make plenty of money without needing a job .
Traditional employment wo n’t teach you such skills .
It ’s the kind of thing that must be learned via private practice .
Be Your Own Coach
You ’re the coach as well as the trainee .
You decide which areas of your life you want to train .
Just do n’t reinvent the wheel .
You do n’t have to develop your own custom program from scratch .
In many cases you can get a pre-made program from someone else .
For example , Toastmasters has a basic manual and more than a dozen advanced manuals , and they cost only a few dollars each .
Take full advantage of books , audio programs , web sites , classes , and so on .
Learn from others who ’ve already done the hard work of creating these resources for you .
No Excuses
Do n’t bother making up feeble excuses to justify why you do n’t have time for training .
If you have time to watch TV , you have time for training .
If you have time to go out to lunch , you have time for training .
If you have a CD or cassette player in your car , you have time for training .
Kick It Off With a 30 - Day Trial
I recommend kicking off a new training program with the 30 Days to Success approach .
Give yourself a strong push with 30 days of conscious effort , and then just allow momentum to carry you forward .
For example , it took some effort for me to reach the point of attending that first Toastmasters meeting .
But it was a no - brainer to show up for the fifth meeting after I ’d already attended the first four .
Showing up the first time is the hardest step .
Showing up the fifth time is easy .
After 100 times it ’s harder NOT to show up .
So Let ’s Get Training !
Now for your homework …
Pick one area of your life that you ’d like to see become a lot easier for you .
Remember that the whole point of progressive training is to make yourself stronger , so the weights in your life feel lighter and lighter .
The net effect is that your life will begin to feel easier .
Would you like to have an easier time performing your job ?
Would you like to be physically stronger ?
Do you want to have an easier time earning money ?
Would you like to have an easier time communicating with people , including members of the opposite sex ?
Do you want it to be easier for you to behave ethically and morally ?
Do you want it to be easier for you to write ?
Once you ’ve selected an area for growth , make the conscious decision to train that area over the next several weeks , months , or years .
Remember that the time is going to pass anyway .
Brainstorm some ideas for what you can do to begin training , and then immediately pick one and get started .
Find a local club like Toastmasters , and add the next meeting date to your calendar .
Buy a new book or audio program .
Sign up for a class .
Pick up the phone or fire off an email to request advice from someone who ’s already ahead of you in this area .
Take some kind of physical action to get the ball rolling .
And once it ’s in motion , keep it moving forward .
Once the ball has some momentum behind it , then and only then should you think about where you ’d like to direct it .
It ’s OK if it ’s moving in the wrong direction , as long as it ’s moving .
The worst thing you can do is to get stuck in analysis paralysis , thinking and planning but not actually doing anything .
The time to intelligently sculpt your training program is after you ’re in motion , not before — after you ’ve read a book or two , gotten advice from people , and attended a few classes or meetings .
The reason is that in the beginning you ’re still at the point of unconscious incompetence .
You do n’t even know what you do n’t know .
So first you have to reach the point of conscious incompetence , where you at least come to know what you do n’t know .
Then you can begin formalizing and structuring your skill building program .
Once the fog clears up a bit , you can use progressive training to work gradually towards conscious competence , and eventually … to unconscious competence , where your talent actually becomes a subconscious habit .
Now get started !
