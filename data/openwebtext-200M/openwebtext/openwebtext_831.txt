The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey has just been released .
Confirming earlier trends , the fasted growing segment of the American population is still the " Nones " , especially in the Northeast .
The Survey tables show how the 8.2 % of Americans in 1990 who declared their atheism , agnosticism , or lack of belief in any religion has grown to 15 % by 2008 .
Confirming this lack of belief in religion is a new question asking people about their belief in God .
2.3 % answered " there is no such thing " as God , while 4.3 % said " there is no way to know " and another 5.7 % said " I ’m not sure . "
Adding together the atheists with the strongly skeptical and the personally skeptical reaches 12.3 % which is similar measure of American skepticism and disbelief .
With another 12.1 % of Americans who think there is a god but it is n’t a personal theistic god , a grand total of 24.4 % of Americans announce that the traditional supernatural God of Christianity , Judaism and Islam does n’t exist .
We can applaud surveys of American belief / disbelief that use more nuanced questioning about what people actually do and do n’t believe in .
So far , as indicated by this latest definitive survey , these lines of questioning show that Americans are much more willing to express their skepticism than they are willing to label themselves as " atheist " or agnostic " .
The labels are holding people back , as many have suspected for a long time .
Is n’t this a good time to remind everyone that the label of " skeptic " is perfectly fitting and ready for use ?
The dividing line between ‘ atheism ’ and ‘ agnosticism ’ got too murky after the atheist was strategically defined as dogmatically knowing that God does not exist .
Agnostics too willingly stepped into the new gray area between dogmatic belief and dogmatic disbelief .
This verbal tactic worked admirably .
Friends of religion can portray atheists as even more close - minded than they are ( quite a feat in itself ) .
Agnostics can look more open - minded than really necessary .
( Is " I ’m just agnostic " the trimmer hipper version of " I ’m just spiritual " ? )
But putting your faith in a label might not be working .
The portion of the Nones who label themselves as " atheist " still remains small .
But " agnostic " has not fared much better .
Surveys show that more and more people are willing to express doubt about God , yet most do n’t want to even call themselves " agnostic " much less " atheist " .
Pundits and atheologists endlessly debate what exactly is the big difference between an atheist and an agnostic ( after all , neither believe in God ) .
New flavors of ‘ negative ’ or ‘ weak ’ or ‘ strong ’ or ‘ positive ’ atheism , and ‘ negative ’ or ‘ weak ’ or ‘ strong ’ or ‘ positive ’ agnosticism are test marketed to the unfaithful .
Which of these eight flavors is the most reasonable stance , since traditional supernaturalism is unreasonable ?
Yet the American people are leaving all that debate and semantics behind .
Are the American people wrong - headed about this ?
Why not return to the original meaning of atheism : simple skepticism .
The most reasonable atheist is the skeptical atheist , unable to believe because reasonable support for any religious claim is lacking .
The skeptical atheist only need worry about countering given evidence and arguments for gods with skeptical complaints .
“ Disproving god ” once and for all is never a clear or attainable goal .
( How many possible divinities would have to be proven non-existent ? )
Fortunately , this goal is entirely unnecessary for the atheist who avoids distractions .
The skeptical atheist is not dogmatic , and not a ‘ weak ’ or ‘ negative ’ atheist – or some kind of agnostic .
Such fine distinctions must be discarded .
The skeptical atheist claims the strongest possible position concerning the existence of god : no one should believe that any god exists because of insufficient reasonable justification for belief .
More and more Americans are coming to agree .
The Nones are simply skeptical , and that ’s atheism enough .
By now you 've probably all conquered the all - conquering Fallout 3 , Eurogamer readers ' number one game of 2008 and one of our favourite RPGs set in a post - apocalyptic American city where Qui -Gon Jinn 's your dad .
But that 's no reason to stop playing it - or at least Bethesda Softworks hopes so , because the developer is busy crafting three discrete bundles of downloadable content for Xbox Live and PC users as part of a Microsoft exclusivity arrangement .
The first of these , Operation : Anchorage , is due for release this month , with two others ( The Pitt and Broken Steel ) to follow in February and March respectively .
Anchorage pops players in a " military simulation " within the world of Fallout 3 that replicates the Battle of Anchorage scenario from the game 's back - story , with players heading a stealthy squad across a wintry Alaskan environment seeking to oust Chinese Communist invaders .
It 's got new toys , gamerpoints and all sorts , and is set to cost 800 Microsoft Points ( GBP 6.80 / EUR 9.60 ) .
Although the official release date has yet to be set , Bethesda 's clearly in the final stages , so when we were offered the chance to speak to Jeff Gardiner , lead producer on the DLC , to dig out some more details , we jumped as high as our irradiated legs would allow .
Here 's the result , along with three new screenshots of Operation : Anchorage .
Eurogamer : Jeff !
Can you describe what we 're seeing in our sexy new screenshots ?
Jeff Gardiner :
All three of these shots are taken inside the ' simulation . '
One is a shot of the approach to a Chinese base .
Another is a shot of a player , donning a winterised version of combat armor looking out over a lake .
The third , and most sexy shot , is a " Chinese Stealth Suit " .
If worn , it will greatly increase the stealth rating of a PC while crouching .
It makes for a quite interesting fight when equipped by enemies as well ...
Eurogamer : Operation : Anchorage takes place in a simulation .
Was that because you wanted to tell the story of Anchorage , or because it gave you the chance to experiment ?
Jeff Gardiner : A bit of both , but mostly we were always intrigued by the Battle of Anchorage .
It 's a very compelling bit of Fallout lore , and we figured we could really do it justice .
Eurogamer : Given the military sim setting , would you say the balance in Anchorage swings more towards gameplay than storytelling ?
Or have you tried to remain consistent with the way the two are interwoven in the main game ?
Jeff Gardiner :
There definitely is a story here - the Brotherhood Outcasts are trying to acquire advanced military technology , and the only way to open the vault containing these relics is by completing a tactical simulation only the player can enter .
The bulk of the gameplay in this DLC is gunplay and stealth , along with some ' team building exercises . '
The approach to the Chinese base , says Gardiner .
Eurogamer : Having stripped out resources for Anchorage , how do you tackle the potential for players to feel weak again having become so empowered in the latter stages of the main game ?
Jeff Gardiner : Since Operation : Anchorage can be entered at anytime , we 've made sure that the player will feel challenge no matter what their level is in the main game .
And , since it's a simulation , we 've taken liberty to add some traditional game elements to it since it 's justified in this context - health and ammo replenishing stations , for instance .
Eurogamer : Can you tell us anything more about the way the Strike Teams under the player 's command work , or elaborate on any of the " exotic gadgets " mentioned last week ?
Jeff Gardiner :
The player will be able to choose , from a limited resource pool , what type of team members will accompany him or her on several missions within the simulations .
These choices include different troop types like snipers or heavy weapons troops .
They 'll also be able to make tactical decisions on how to deploy these troops in certain situations .
The Chinese Stealth Suit was what I was hinting at last week - it works similar to stealth boy every time you crouch !
Eurogamer : Did you have a sense of what you 'd do with the DLC during development of Fallout 3 ?
Or did you sit down at the end and go , " Right , what the hell are we doing ? "
Jeff Gardiner : " What the hell are we doing ? " is much closer to the mark .
We opened up to ideas from the whole development team , and Operation : Anchorage is just one of several that rose to the top .
Heroes 3.20 – Welcome Back , Bryan
Cue up the John Sebastian , people , ’ cause it ’s time to formally offer a hearty “ welcome back ” to Bryan Fuller .
Tonight ’s episode is the first time we ’ve seen the man ’s name in the writing credits since the glory days of “ Heroes , ” i.e. Season 1 , and although his return comes at the expense of “ Pushing Daisies , ” you have to respect the guy for trying to do his part of save the series that he helped to make .
And , yeah , I know , it ’s not like he created the show , but given how many times Fuller ’s “ Company Man ” has been held up as the series ’ definitive episode , you ca n’t deny that his contributions helped make “ Heroes ” appointment television during the 2007 – 2008 TV season .
It was clear from the opening sequence , with Zeljko literally being handed a gift - wrapped Puppet Master , that we were finally going to get something we had n’t seen in forever : a “ Heroes ” episode that actually felt like it was taken from a comic book .
You would n’t think it ’d be so hard to accomplish that in a show about people with superhuman abilities …and , apparently , it is n’t hard for Fuller , since he ’s proven time and time again that he can manage it .
Watching Zeljko turn the tables on Mohinder was awesome ( “ Why did you bring me here ? ” “ I thought it ’d be a whole lot easier than carrying you . ” ) , and his typically tense conversations with HRG were typically solid , as was the HRG / Mama Petrelli chat at the beginning .
I do n’t think there was anything that came out of Hiro ’s mouth tonight that was n’t genius , whether it was his addressing of Matt Parkman , Jr. ( “ Baby Matt Parkman , we will save you ; if you understand , shake rattle once for ‘ yes ’ and twice for ‘ no ' ” ) , his using a “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” episode to rationalize how a de-aging process might ’ve occurred and offering up a “ Wrath of Khan ” reference ( “ Life from lifelessness ! ” ) , or his asking Ando , “ What are we saving the baby from ?
Lead - based toys ? ” I thought it was a great touch that , despite the TV being turned on and off repeatedly , Hiro and Ando still never once noticed that it was actually the baby ’s daddy on the screen .
The sequence where Hiro finally addressed having witnessed his mother ’s death in the past and had an emotional bonding moment with Ando was unexpectedly effective ( sometimes you forget that those guys can work together in drama as well as comedy ) , but then it was back to the comedy with the “ E.T. ” homage .
And once the men in black busted in to take Li’l Parkman and Matt ’s ex into custody … words fail me .
Hiro ’s powers are back !
Thank you , Toddler Touch and Go! Except they ’re not entirely , which means he can stop time again but still ca n’t teleport .
Oh , well , so the kid ’s not perfect .
Anyone else do a spit take when Hiro rolled Ando out in a wheelbarrow ?
Like it was n’t good enough to see that Bryan Fuller had brought his buddy Swoozie Kurtz over from “ Pushing Daisies , ” he even gave her one of the great opening lines in “ Heroes ” history : “ Oh , my God : you look like you ’ve been mugged , and the first thing they stole was your dignity . ”
Her appearance gave us a very different side of Angela Petrelli .
Was Millie her sister ?
Was that what we were supposed to infer from the watercress soup comment at the end … ?
Anyway , her escape from the men in black was action - packed , and having Peter save her was the icing on the cake .
Daphne looked pretty smokin ’ with her new Gwen Stefani haircut ( nice ruse at the hospital , was n’t it ? ) , but , y’know , the best part of the whole Matt & Daphne storyline this week was the fact that , for once , they were talking solely in cliches .
I should ’ve known it was too good to be true , particularly when Parkman mysteriously developed the ability to fly from out of nowhere .
The HRG / Tracy conversation in the dressing room was hilarious , and it was nice to see HRG call her out for her egotism in leaving Parkman behind .
Of course , it turns out that the theory floated by the folks over at TV Squad was right on the money : Rebel was indeed the long - missing Micah , who ’s grown up a hell of a lot since we saw him last .
Of course , that surprise would ’ve gone a lot farther if they had n’t put Little Dude ’s name in the opening credits !
Not that it should surprise me .
It is n’t the first time they ’ve pulled that stunt .
( Remember when they ruined the first appearance of George Takei ? )
The effects involved in Tracy ’s move in the parking garage were extremely well executed , but , wow , Zeijko ’s destruction of her was … you ’ll pardon the pun…pretty damned cold .
My God , though , how horrifying was that shot of her eye blinking amongst the shards of her shattered face ?
I do n’t know about you , but I got chills .
So we end by looking through the State of Liberty , with Angela having been reunited with Peter once more .
Will next week be as good without a Bryan Fuller script ?
I ’m certainly going to be there to find out .
Woodchips With Everything
Here comes the latest utopian catastrophe : the plan to solve climate change with biochar
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 24th March 2009
Whenever you hear the word miracle , you know there ’s trouble just around the corner .
But however many times they lead to disappointment or disaster , the newspapers never tire of promoting miracle cures , miracle crops , miracle fuels and miracle financial instruments .
We have a bottomless ability to disregard the laws of economics , biology and thermodynamics when we encounter a simple solution to complex problems .
So welcome , ladies and gentlemen , to the new miracle .
It ’s a low - carbon regime for the planet which makes the Atkins Diet look healthy : woodchips with everything .
Biomass is suddenly the universal answer to our climate and energy problems .
Its advocates claim that it will become the primary source of the world ’s heating fuel , electricity , road transport fuel ( cellulosic ethanol ) and aviation fuel ( bio- kerosene ) .
Few people stop to wonder how the planet can accommodate these demands and still produce food and preserve wild places .
Now an even crazier use of woodchips is being promoted everywhere ( including in the Guardia n ( 1 ) ) .
The great green miracle works like this : we turn the planet ’s surface into charcoal .
Sorry , not charcoal .
We do n’t call it that any more .
Now we say biochar .
The idea is that wood and crop wastes are cooked to release the volatile components ( which can be used as fuel ) , then the residue – the charcoal – is buried in the soil .
According to the magical thinkers who promote it , the new miracle stops climate breakdown , replaces gas and petroleum , improves the fertility of the soil , reduces deforestation , cuts labour , creates employment , prevents respiratory disease and ensures that when you drop your toast it always lands butter side up .
They point out that the indigenous people of the Amazon created terras pretas ( black soils ) by burying charcoal over hundreds of years .
These are more fertile than the surrounding soils , and the carbon has stayed where they put it .
All we need to do is to roll this out worldwide and the world ’s problems – except , for the time being , the toast conundrum – are solved .
It takes carbon out of circulation , reducing atmospheric concentrations .
It raises crop yields .
If some of the carbon is produced in efficient cooking stoves , it reduces the smoke in people ’s homes and means they have to gather less fuel , curtailing deforestation ( 2 ) .
This miracle solution has suckered people who ought to know better , including the earth systems scientist James Lovelock ( 3 ) , the eminent climate scientist Jim Hansen ( 4 ) , the author Chris Goodall and the climate campaigner Tim Flannery ( 5 ) .
At the UN climate negotiations beginning in Bonn on Sunday , several national governments will demand that biochar is eligible for carbon credits , providing the financial stimulus required to turn this into a global industry ( 6 ) .
Their proposal boils down to this : we must destroy the biosphere in order to save it .
In his otherwise excellent book , Ten Technologies to Save the Planet , Chris Goodall abandons his usual scepticism and proposes that we turn 200 million hectares of “ forests , savannah and croplands ” into biochar plantations .
Thus we would increase carbon uptake , by grubbing up “ wooded areas containing slow - growing trees ” ( that is , natural forest ) and planting “ faster - growing species ” ( 7 ) .
This is environmentalism ?
But that ’s just the start of it .
Carbonscape , a company which hopes to be among the first to commercialise the technique , talks of planting 930 million hectares ( 8 ) .
The energy lecturer Peter Read proposes new biomass plantations of trees and sugar covering 1.4 billion ha(9 ) .
The arable area of the United Kingdom is 5.7 m hectares , or one 245th of Read ’s figure .
China has 104 m ha of cropland .
The US has 174m .
The global total is 1.36 billion ( 10 ) .
Were we to follow Read ’s plan , we would either have to replace all the world ’s crops with biomass plantations , causing instant global famine , or we would have to double the cropped area of the planet , trashing most of its remaining natural habitats .
Read was one of the promoters of first - generation liquid biofuels ( 11,12 ) , which played a major role in the rise in the price of food last year , throwing millions into malnutrition .
Have these people learnt nothing ?
Of course they claim that everything can be reconciled .
Peter Read says that the new plantations can be created across “ land on which the occupants are not engaged in economic activity ” ( 13 ) .
This means land used by subsistence farmers , pastoralists , hunters and gatherers and anyone else who is n’t producing commodities for the mass market : poorly - defended people whose rights and title can be disregarded .
Both Read and Carbonscape speak of these places as “ degraded lands ” .
We used to call them unimproved , or marginal .
Degraded land is the new code for natural habitat someone wants to destroy .
Goodall is even more naïve .
He believes we can maintain the profusion of animals and plants in the rainforests he hopes to gut by planting a mixture of fast - growing species , rather than a monoculture ( 14 ) .
As the Amazon ecologist Philip Fearnside has shown , a mixture does “ not substantially change the impact of very large - scale plantations from the standpoint of biodiversity ” ( 15 ) .
In their book Pulping the South , Ricardo Carrere and Larry Lohmann show what has happened in the 100 m ha of industrial plantations planted around the world so far ( 16 ) .
Aside from trashing biodiversity , tree plantations have dried up river catchments , caused soil erosion when the land is ploughed for planting ( which means the loss of soil carbon ) , exhausted nutrients and required so many pesticides that in some places the run-off has poisoned marine fisheries .
In Brazil and South Africa , tens of thousands of people have been thrown off their lands , often by violent means , to create plantations .
In Thailand the military government that came to power in 1991 sought to expel five million people .
Forty thousand families were dispossessed before the junta was overthrown .
In many cases plantations cause a net loss of employment .
Working conditions are brutal , often involving debt peonage and repeated exposure to pesticides .
As Almuth Ernsting and Rachel Smolker of Biofuelwatch point out , many of the claims made for biochar do n’t stand up ( 17 ) .
In some cases charcoal in the soil improves plant growth ; in others it suppresses it .
Just burying carbon bears little relationship to the complex farming techniques of the Amazon Indians who created terras pretas .
Nor is there any guarantee that most of the buried carbon will stay in the soil .
In some cases charcoal stimulates bacterial growth , causing carbon emissions from soils to rise .
As for reducing deforestation , a stove that burns only part of the fuel is likely to increase , not decrease , demand for wood .
There are plenty of other ways of eliminating household smoke which do n’t involve turning the world ’s forests to cinders .
None of this is to suggest that the idea has no virtues ; simply that they are outweighed by hazards , which the promoters have either overlooked or obscured .
Nor does this mean that charcoal ca n’t be made on a small scale , from straw or brashings or sewage that would otherwise go to waste .
But the idea that biochar is a universal solution which can be safely deployed on a vast scale is as misguided as Mao Zedong ’s Great Leap Backwards .
We clutch at straws ( and other biomass ) in our desperation to believe that there is an easy way out .

Biochar for Climate Change Mitigation : Fact or Fiction ?
http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/docs/biocharbriefing.pdf
Two hundred Turkish intellectuals last month launched an Internet signature campaign for an apology to Armenians for the 1915 massacres .
“ My conscience does not accept the insensitivity showed to and the denial of the Great Catastrophe that the Armenians were subjected to in 1915 , ” the brief statement reads .
“ I reject this injustice and for my share , I empathize with the feelings and pain of my Armenian brothers and sisters .
I apologize to them . ”
Within a month , more than 26,000 people signed on , a significant number in a country where the fate of the Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire has been largely unmentionable for decades .
To those long frustrated by Turkey ’s intractability on the issue , this campaign may appear an inadequate gesture .
But it has immense value , educating many Turks about the violence done to Armenians for the first time and enabling those who are ready to come to terms with it .
The official Turkish position on 1915 has shifted over time .
It was a fight between local Turkish and Armenian bands .
Or it was a forced resettlement -- a march on which hundreds of thousands of Armenians were sent to Syria , but most never arrived .
Historians and politicians also have argued that it was actually Armenians who massacred Turks and that talk of an Armenian genocide was an international conspiracy .
In contemporary Turkey , novelists , journalists , historians or other intellectuals who call the events a genocide or even mass murder can face trial under the infamous Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code , which outlaws insulting Turkey , its government or its people .
Organizers of the “ I apologize ” campaign notably shied away from the word genocide , opting instead for “ the Great Catastrophe , ” a phrase initially used by Armenians .
Still , Turkish nationalists were quick to condemn the project and launch multiple , counter we - want - an - apology campaigns .
Turkey ’s prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , quickly dismissed the apology movement .
“ These Turkish intellectuals must have committed the genocide , ” he said mockingly , “ since they are the ones who are apologizing . ”
Opposition parties in the parliament , other than the Kurdish - inclined Democratic Turkey Party , have all condemned the campaign as well .
The Nationalist Action Party , for example , issued a statement that said , in part , “ There is no single page in the honorable history of the Turkish nation for which we should be embarrassed , and no crime for which we should apologize .
No one has the right to smear our ancestors by deviating from history , declaring them guilty , and ask them to apologize . ”
Granted , 26,000 signatories to the campaign means Turks interested in apologizing remain few and far between in a nation of 70 million .
Still , this is a very significant development in Turkey .
In the last 10 years , several Turkish scholars began studying the Armenian massacres outside the official Turkish framework , and some of them , such as Taner Akcam , have openly acknowledged those events were a genocide .
Turkish and Armenian scholars organized joint workshops to discuss what happened to Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire .
When Hrant Dink , a prominent journalist of Armenian background , was assassinated by a nationalist thug in Istanbul two years ago , 200,000 Turks marched in the streets carrying banners that said , “ We are all Armenian . ”
Critics will certainly reply that these modest activities do not compensate for the original crime nor the suffering caused by its denial for almost a century .
They will complain that the current signature campaign does not use the word genocide .
Yet the significance of this campaign cannot be understated .
I grew up in Turkey in a politically engaged , educated and reasonably liberal family in the 1970s and the 1980s , and I had only a vague idea about the animosity between Turks and Armenians .
It was n’t until I enrolled in graduate school at the University of Michigan , one of the most important centers of Ottoman and Armenian studies in the United States , that I learned about the unacceptably sad end of the Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire .
Turks growing up today surely are better informed about the history of the land they inhabit .
Even those who accept the nationalist line have to be aware of the sudden end of the centuries - long Armenian presence in Anatolia .
Regardless of the terms they employ or the specific amount of responsibility they willingly shoulder , this next generation of Turks is already in a much better position to face the darkest aspect of their national history and develop a more responsible relationship to it .
It may appear a small gesture now , but the initiators of the “ I apologize ” campaign have introduced a ray of hope for reconciliation between Armenians and Turks before the 100th anniversary of the catastrophe comes around .

I will be out of the office and away from all things digital next week , for a much - needed break .
The next full entry will be on Monday , December 14th - but do n't forget the 2009 Hubble Advent Calendar , which will keep updating once a day until the 25th ( hurray for automation ) .
I 'm off on vacation next week - trying to catch the tail end of the summer , and enjoy some time on Boston 's Harbor Islands with my family .
If anything huge and photogenic happens next week , I 'll try to do my best to wrap it up with my next entry on Monday , August 24th .
One year ago , I set out on this long crazy journey , not knowing where it would go , but certainly having high hopes .
things have gone amazingly - if hectic , but it 's been a very rich experience that I will continue with as long as I can .
Many thanks again to the photographers and supporters out there , you have all been very generous .
If you are interested in a more personal take on the past year , I wrote about it in my personal blog ( the first entry there since I started Big Picture last year - heh ) .
If there 's anything you 'd like to see different in The Big Picture , or more of ( or less of ) , feel free to let me know .
And please , feel free to be critical - comments like " too many photos " , " too sad " or " not enough celebrities " or " not enough kittens " are all welcome .
I 'll be out of town all next week on a much - needed vacation , so posts to The Big Picture will resume again on May 18th .
The past few months have been ... stressful to say the least , with threats of the Boston Globe closing down , last - minute negotiations , concessions and more .
After a weekend of moderating comments on a previous entry on the Pirates of Somalia , I felt compelled to run this photograph .
A huge number of comments came into that earlier entry with attempts to explain , justify , cheer or laud these Somali men who are seizing ships and boats at gunpoint ( various claims about toxic waste dumping , illegal fishing , unfair treatment by western nations , somalis defending their coast ) .
I usually make a point not to editorialize , so forgive the indulgence here - but what possible justification could there be for what is seen in this photograph ?
All of the above rationalizations ring terribly hollow .
In this photo are three of the five armed Somalis who captured the private yacht " Tanit " on April 4 , off the coast of Somalia , and four of the five French hostages , including the 28 - year - old skipper Florent Lemacon ( sunglasses ) , his wife Chloe , and - barely visible - their 3 - year - old son Colin .
On Friday , April 10th , with the captors sailing the yacht toward land , French special forces stormed the boat , killing two of the pirates and capturing three others .
Florent Lemacon was killed in the crossfire , an investigation is underway to determine exactly whose bullet killed the man .

I had a fantastic time at the SXSW Interactive Festival , and really enjoyed meeting everyone I got a chance to speak with .
Some of the best conversations I 've had in months .
I 'm working on recovering my slides to try to get them online ... however , my laptop died ( hardware failure ) less than an hour after my presentation - at least it was after and not before - whew .
The big theme that resounded with me in the talks I attended was the accelerating transformation ( or death ) of print media .
Clay Shirky has some sobering , thought - provoking thoughts on the subject here : Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable .
It 's obvious that big changes are happening , with the biggest question being " how will journalism be supported " ?
Note that I did not ask " how will newspapers be funded " , but journalism - how will the reporters and photographers who are out there in the world digging for the stories and telling them to the world support themselves ?

I 'm excited to be heading to Austin , Texas in a week for the South by Southwest Interactive Festival .
It 's my first time to Austin , even though I 've been a judge for their Web Awards ceremonies in the past ( even won an award for Technical Achievement a while back ) .
The Big Picture is a finalist in the SXSWi Web Awards , blog category ( all finalists here ) .
I 'm also going to be giving a talk about The Big Picture on Tuesday the 17th at 10 am ( more here ) .
Be sure and say hi if you 're there and see me wandering about the place .

The small town of Chaiten , Chile was largely destroyed by last year 's eruption of a nearby volcano ( famous for the lightning - strike eruption photos featured here ) .
Flooded , buried in ash , cut off from utilities and abandoned for many months , the town of Chaiten has been declared " dead " by Chile 's government , which now plans to relocate the citizens to a safer location several kilometers up the coast .
The volcano is still active , but that has not stopped a handful of die - hard residents who wish to stay in their old town and try rebuilding despite a lack of any governmental assistance .
Here a few photos showing recent scenes from the region .

The Chilean government says the town destroyed by a volcanic eruption will be rebuilt six miles ( 10 kilometers ) away and out of the path of the volcano 's landslides .
The original seaside village is in ruins after the volcano sprang to life in May 2008 for the first time in thousands of years .
Volcanic mudflows swept through much of the town and forced the evacuation of its 4,000 residents .

I realized while watching the season finale of the Biggest Loser , this show sucks !
Hollywood usually gets a bunch of ridiculously good looking people to be in ridiculous situations , and believe it or not , even on a show centered around fat people , Hollywood is able to still end up with the best looking fat people available .
Once the cast has been set , we have a few months of ridiculous weight loss – 5 , 10 , even 20 + lbs a week .
Two trainers giving the contestants four hours of dedicated attention a day , food that ’s calculated and measured for them , no jobs to worry about , no family events , no church ‘ fellowships ’ , no pizza places , no ice cream shoppes , nothing to keep them from full focus on their weight loss goals !
Reality Television is anything but real – and The Biggest Loser is no exception !
Just this season , Bob ( the male trainer on the show ) explained that the winner of the first biggest loser season has already gained all of his weight back .
While they have had one “ Did they keep it off ” followup episode , they only showed us a fraction of the contestants from the show ’s history .
Just like lottery winners that blow through millions of dollars within the first few years of winning – these guys start putting the weight back on shortly after leaving the show .
Ok – maybe I ’m disgruntled because they did n’t pick me to be on the show – I did try out when they came to Mesa , AZ .
I drove 40 miles , stood in the longest line of fat people I have ever been in that did n’t end in a buffet , waited for hours while listening to extremely overweight people tell other extremely overweight people how to lose weight ( I ’m not making this up ) , just to get 5 minutes at a table with 9 other fat people all talking over each other in order to make an impression on the casting director for a chance to be called back .
I was not called back .
But I did learned a few things while waiting in that long line of large people .
I learned that everyone thinks they know something about weight loss regardless of how fat they are .
I learned that a lot of people want to get on the Biggest Loser as a way of winning the fat man ’s lottery .
I learned that I ’m no exception .
I want to avoid having to figure out how to fit a work out into my schedule , or how to know good food from bad food , or learning portion control .
I want it all to be done for me .
But that ’s not going to happen – and it would seem from the biggest loser contestants that put the weight back on , that you ca n’t avoid those steps even if you make it on the show .
I am going to have to learn a lot over the next several months if I ’m going to lose weight .
I think I need to start by learning more about me .
I want to know more about being a food adict .
I want to know more about the triggers that cause late night snacking and over eating .
I want to learn what has me staying up too late at night , or what has me so unorganized that I cannot find my workout cloths in the morning .
I have a feeling my weightloss journey is going to be as much about personal awareness and development as it will be about weight .
In any case – The Biggest Loser sucks for not picking me …

Disclosures about how some research has been conducted , by whom , and for what , continue to mount .
In the last week , a trial , a research psychiatrist , and a journal fought for attention :
• Item 1 : Documents from a lawsuit about AstraZeneca 's antipsychotic drug , Seroquel , provided more evidence about the withholdng of unfavorable research - the kind that would affect how doctors and the public viewed the benefits of a particular medicine .
If what the London - based drug company called " Study 15 , " sounds inconspicuous , something that would n't sound the alarms , it was meant to be .
Kaiser Daily Health
Policy summarizes how the company cherry picked findings to make the new drug seem superior to older drugs while not disclosing information or AstraZeneca 's own doctor 's evaluation of the dangerous weight gain .
Also hidden were the numbers of subjects who withdrew from the evaluation before it was completed .
Study 15 compared Seroquel to an older drug called Haldol and found that patients taking Seroquel gained an average of 11 pounds per year , that the drug was not more effective than Haldol in preventing psychotic relapses , and that 82 % of the patients on Seroquel dropped out of the study before its completion .
Will Study 15 become slang and enter conversation as shorthand , like Deep Throat or Ponzi Scheme ?
Will we now say " it was a Study 15 " to refer to deliberately hiding information unless a law suit or whistle blower shed light ?
• Item 2 : A New Jersey court will consider Harvard psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman 's request a request to seal information in a law - suit about off - label use of antipsychotic drugs to children .
Biederman 'a name has become linked to medicating children for bipolar disorder , and for receiving more than $ 1.5 million from drug companies .
His lawyers say the information , including lectures he delivered , " could be immensely damaging to him , both personally and professionally . "
He is not a defendant in this case but the facts could well make him look bad .
That could well be the case when a researcher violates the ethics underlying research , which is not skewing the outcome ( even if there is a hunch ) .
The New York Times reports how Biederman pitched studies .
Other reasons it would not be useful to have the documents made public were addressed by the Wall Street Journal health blog :
Biederman had at least six violations of research protocol , according to an April 2004 letter from Massachusetts General Hospital 's Human Research Committee , which is responsible for monitoring patient studies at the facility .
• Item 3 : JAMA , the Journal of the American Medical Association , became embroiled in a controversy about disclosures of one of its authors .
It started with a letter about conflict - of - interest by Dr. Jonathan Leo writing in the British Medical Journal and led to ugly words , allegations and the announcement of a new editorial policy by JAMA .
But is this the end or just the beginning all over ?
No one likes a speeding ticket .
But 47 - year - old Michael Harold Lynch , of Bellevue , Wash . , apparently took his anger to a new level when he emptied $ 206 in small change into a plastic bag , soaking it in urine and mailing it to the payments division of the Multnomah County courthouse .
Mailroom staff handed over the box -- and the angry letter that accompanied it -- to a sheriff 's sergeant .
" It was nasty .
It reeked , " said Sgt. Phil Anderchuk .
Anderchuk called a U.S. postal inspector to see if federal law had been broken , and learned that it 's not against the law to mail a box of bodily fluids , as long as it's properly packed and does n't emit an obnoxious odor .
( Court staff could only smell the contents once they opened the package ) .
So the sergeant sealed up the box and mailed it back to Lynch -- with $ 27.30 postage due if Lynch wanted his change back .
Lynch had been ticketed by Portland police Officer Chris Cass last October for driving 19 mph over the posted 35 mph speed limit in a construction zone along Southeast McLoughlin Boulevard near the Ross Island Bridge .
Lynch apparently ignored the ticket and missed a court date in which he could have shown up to fight the ticket or argued his case to the judge in a letter .
He racked up an extra $ 65 in fees .
Then , the box showed up .
In explaining why the courthouse could n't accept Lynch 's payment , the sergeant wrote that " the pile of coins emitted a strong , pungent odor of stale urine .
This was very concerning to me . "
Anderchuk reminded Lynch he still owed for the ticket .
" I encourage you to submit your payment in a more traditional form , " he wrote in a January letter .
He told Lynch to expect a visit from a postal inspector , presumably to talk about how close he came to violating federal law .
Lynch apparently got the message , because a few weeks later a check arrived .
But it was made out to the wrong agency .
Courthouse staff sent it back .
In February , a new check arrived , but this time it was made out for the wrong amount : $ 206 , which did n't account for $ 65 in penalties for arriving late .
Last week , the state turned Lynch 's case over to a collection agency .
The Oregonian could not reach Lynch for comment .
But Lynch clearly has lost his fight .
Which goes to show , one court manager says , that there are better ways to express one 's distaste for a speeding ticket .
Such as writing a letter to the judge , since showing up in court would have involved a 175 - mile drive for Lynch , said Eric Hall , who oversees the mailroom where ticketed drivers send their payments .
Hall said receiving letters -- or even checks -- laced with obscenities is " a common daily occurence . "
Other drivers , who come in person , occasionally try to pay their fines with jars full of change .
But that is time consuming for staff and forces longer waits for other ticket payers , so Hall 's office limits the form of payment to no more than 25 pennies , nickels , dimes , quarters and half dollars .
" People do get really worked up , " Hall said .
But , said Hall , a box full of coins and urine is a first in his years on the job .

Although these kids probably got an F on these exams , they should of got an A+ for creativity .
These exam papers remind me of the past when we were all stuck in boring classrooms taking tests that were pretty pointless .

大きな会社では、その内側で起こっていることのすべてを一介のエンジニアが把握することは不可能に近い。そういう規模の会社では、インサイダーであるのに外部の人から知らされる会社情報というものも案外おおかったりする。とくに、自分があまり注意を払っていないゴシップ系の情報になると、その傾向は顕著になる。
たとえば 「グーグル、本社キャンパスの無料カフェテリアを閉鎖 」
という記事に書かれている内容も、友人に教えてもらうまで知らなかったし、読んでみて驚いた。きっと、知らない同僚もたくさんいると思う。
この記事を読んで初めて Café 5IVE が閉鎖になったことを知り、どうせだったら最後にもう一回だけ行っておけばよかったと思ったが、そんなことよりももっと衝撃的なことがこの記事には書かれていた。
グーグルの本社キャンパスにはこれまで3つの無料カフェテリアがあったが、その内、一つは昨年10月に閉鎖、そして今回、もう一つが閉鎖となったことを受けて無料カフェテリアは一つだけを残すのみとなった。
この事態を受けて残った無料カフェテリアには昼時には長蛇の列ができる状態にもなっており、グーグラーの間からは「会社は上位50位に属する高級取りのエンジニアをその他大勢の安月給のエンジニアと同じ列に並ばせているらしい」といったジョークも飛び交っているという。
さすがにこれは、興味ないので知らなかったではすまないほどの大事件だ。死活問題とまでは言わないが、その残された唯一の無料のカフェで食べない限りは昼飯代がかかってしまうし、そのカフェで食べるためには会社の上位
50位に属する高級取りのエンジニアと一緒に長蛇の列に並ばなくてはいけなくなってしまった。これは困った。
いや、まあいいのか。以前のように、晩御飯の残りを弁当にして持参することにすれば。弁当持参ならカフェまで行く手間や何を食べるかを考える手間も省けるし、時間をさらに有効に使えるし、一石二鳥かもしれない。
それにしても、最後の無料のカフェテリアというのはどこのことだろうか。Charlie's のことだろうか 。No Name Café のことだろうか。 Oasis のことだろうか。 BigTable のことだろうか。 Pintxo のことだろうか 。 Cafe 150 のことだろうか。 American Table のことだろうか。 Café MOMA のことだろうか。 Andalé のことだろうか。（って、ぼくが比較的よく使っているカフェテリアを列挙してみた。にぎり寿司で有名な
Cafe 7 は Yelp に載ってなかったので割愛 ）
ぼくの本社には未だ に 20 弱の無料のカフェテリアがあるように見受けられるし、もしかしたらこれはどこか違うグーグル本社の話だろうか。だといいな。
The Obama administration will soon open the money spigots for billions of dollars in energy and environmental investments .
That was the message from Matt Rogers , senior adviser to Energy Secretary Steven Chu , and Jason Grumet , president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and an Obama adviser on energy .
They talked to The Wall Street Journal 's Alan Murray and Kimberley A. Strassel .
Here are edited excerpts of their discussion :

A former mafia hitman turned informant looks like he may lose his federal protection in the witness protection program over a calzone .
Joey Calco , the man who made a name for himself when he turned on the Bonanno crime family and ratted out consigliere Anthony Spero in 2001 , has been living in Florida and running a pizza place under the name Joseph Milano .
When he was arrested last month after being caught on tape beating down and pistol - whipping customers at Goomba 's pizzeria who complained about a calzone , a Daytona paper matched his new identity to the man known as " Crazy Joe " as part of the " Bath Avenue Crew . "
Calco himself was convicted for two murders he pleaded guilty to in 2004 and was out of prison two years later .
After " Milano " was arrested for charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon , the newspaper 's discovery prompted police to reveal his true identity and charge Calco under his real name .
The former mobster has also been sued for sexual harassment while running Goomba's .
The News points out that he is not the sharpest tool in the shed , detailing how he repeatedly struggled to remember the word " foyer " during one of his trips to the witness stand .
Below is the video of the attack that could end up making him a marked man .
起動ディスクを丸ごとバックアップしようとすると、そこに含まれるファイルやフォルダの多さに圧倒される。環境にもよるが、その数100万個前後あるんじゃないだろうか。なので、前回のバックアップと比較して、変化しているファイルやフォルダをしらみ潰しにチェックする作業には、Core2Duo 2GHzのCPUでも相当時間がかかりそう。
実際、.Macが提供するBackupアプリケーションは差分を検出するために上記の作業をしていたと思うのだが、バックアップするファイルが増えるほどに差分チェックに時間が掛かっていた。だからBackupによる起動ディスク丸ごとのバックアップというのは負荷が大き過ぎると思う。一度試してみたが、チェック作業中にメモリを異常に消費して、いつまで経ってもバックアップが終わらない状態だったと記憶している。
ところ がTime Machineの場合、初回こそ相当な時間がかかってしまう（一晩とか）場合があるが、その後の毎時のバックアップにはそれほどの時間を必要としない...。一体、どのような方法で差分チェックを行っているのだろう？

Over 100 Canadians are facing prosecution for chipping in to buy a plane ticket for a Canadian who has taken refuge inside the Canadian Embassy in Sudan .
Abousfian Abdelrazik is a Canadian citizen from Sudanese descent , visiting his mother in Sudan when he was arrested for alleged terror ties .
He claims to have been tortured , but was not charged .
He was released from prison because Sudanese investigators found no evidence to support criminal activity .
As he is a Canadian national , he took refuge inside the Canadian Embassy in Sudan , but lacked the funds to pay for his return fair .
Over 100 Canadians chipped in for him .
According to Canadian law , these benefactors can be charged , and could spend up to 10 years behind bars , as Abdelrazik is still on a UN terrorist blacklist .
Oh , and he is on the international no - fly list also .

Go figure .
Neu­ro­feed­back — also known as EEG Biofeed­back — is an approach for treat­ing ADHD in which indi­vid­u­als are pro­vid­ed real - time feed­back on their brain­wave pat­terns and taught to alter their typ­i­cal EEG pat­tern to one that is con­sis­tent with a focused , atten­tive state .
This is typ­i­cal­ly done by col­lect­ing EEG data from indi­vid­u­als as they focus on stim­uli pre­sent­ed on a com­put­er screen .
Their abil­i­ty to con­trol the stim­uli , for exam­ple , keep­ing the smile on a smi­ley face , is con­tin­gent on main­tain­ing the par­tic­u­lar EEG state being trained .
Accord­ing to neu­ro­feed­back pro­po­nents , learn­ing how to do this dur­ing train­ing gen­er­al­izes to real world sit­u­a­tions and this results in improved atten­tion and reduced hyperactive / impulsive behav­ior .
Neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment for ADHD has been con­tro­ver­sial in the field for many years and remains so today .
Although a num­ber of pub­lished stud­ies have report­ed pos­i­tive results many promi­nent ADHD researchers believe that prob­lems with the design of these stud­ies pre­clude con­clud­ing that neu­ro­feed­back is an effec­tive treat­ment .
These lim­i­ta­tions have includ­ed the absence of ran­dom assign­ment , the lack of appro­pri­ate con­trol groups , raters who are not ‘ blind ’ to chil­dren ’s treat­ment sta­tus , and small sam­ples .
For addi­tion­al back­ground , you can find a recent review I wrote on exist­ing research sup­port for neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment of ADHD — along with links to exten­sive reviews of sev­er­al recent­ly pub­lished stud­ies -: How Strong is the Research Sup­port for Neu­ro­feed­back in Atten­tion Deficits ?
- Results from a New Study of Neu­ro­feed­back -
Recent­ly , a study of neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment for ADHD was pub­lished that address­es sev­er­al lim­i­ta­tions that have under­mined pri­or research [ Gevensleben , et al. , ( 2009 ) .
Is neu­ro­feed­back an effi­ca­cious treat­ment for ADHD ?
A ran­dom­ized con­trolled clin­i­cal tri­al .
Jour­nal of Child Psy­chol­o­gy and Psy­chi­a­try . ]
The study was con­duct­ed in Ger­many and began with 102 chil­dren aged 8 to 12 .
All had been care­ful­ly diag­nosed with ADHD and approx­i­mate­ly over 90 % had nev­er received med­ica­tion treat­ment .
About 80 % were boys .
Chil­dren were ran­dom­ly assigned to one of two treat­ment con­di­tions : 36 ses­sions of neu­ro­feed­back train­ing or 36 ses­sions of com­put­er­ized atten­tion train­ing .
The com­put­er­ized atten­tion train­ing task was intend­ed to serve as the con­trol inter­ven­tion .
Train­ing was con­duct­ed in two 50 - minute blocks per ses­sions , with a short break in - between ; chil­dren in both groups par­tic­i­pat­ed in two to three such train­ing ses­sions per week .
- Descrip­tion of Train­ing -
Neu­ro­feed­back Train­ing —
As not­ed above , neu­ro­feed­back entails pro­vid­ing chil­dren with real - time feed­back on their EEG state so that they become able to learn how to cre­ate and main­tain a state that is con­sis­tent with focused atten­tion .
This is done by link­ing their abil­i­ty to con­trol what appears on the com­put­er screen to their abil­i­ty to pro­duce and main­tain the EEG state being trained .
Tech­ni­cal details of the train­ing pro­to­cols are not sum­ma­rized here but were based on research find­ings sug­gest­ing the spe­cif­ic EEG dif­fer­ences between chil­dren with and with­out ADHD that train­ing should address .
For exam­ple , one part of train­ing focused on teach­ing chil­dren to ele­vate their pro­duc­tion of high­er fre­quen­cy beta waves and supress the pro­duc­tion of low­er fre­quen­cy theta waves .
This is based on pri­or find­ings that indi­vid­u­als with ADHD tend to have an ele­vat­ed ratio of theta to beta activ­i­ty rel­a­tive ( see Neurofeedback / Quan­ti­ta­tive EEG for ADHD diag­no­sis ) .
Com­put­er­ized Atten­tion Train­ing —
This treat­ment was based on a pro­gram called ‘ Skil­lies ’ , described as award - win­ning Ger­man learn­ing soft­ware that pro­vides sys­tem­at­ic exer­cis­es in visu­al and audi­to­ry per­cep­tion , vig­i­lance , sus­tained atten­tion , and reac­tiv­i­ty .
It was con­sid­ered the ‘ con­trol ’ con­di­tion to which the results of neu­ro­feed­back train­ing was com­pared .
Per­form­ing well on the pro­gram requires chil­dren to sus­tain their atten­tion to a vari­ety of game - like tasks that become increas­ing­ly chal­leng­ing and that pro­vide chil­dren with fre­quent feed­back about their per­for­mance .
Chil­dren thus receive extend­ed prac­tice in ‘ pay­ing atten­tion ’ for increas­ing peri­ods to tasks that become increas­ing­ly demand­ing and need to learn to sus­tain their atten­tion in order to do well .
Unlike neu­ro­feed­back treatment , however , no direct feed­back on EEG state is pro­vid­ed .
- Exper­i­men­tal Con­trols -
As not­ed above , chil­dren were ran­dom­ly assigned to treat­ment con­di­tion , which is essen­tial when com­par­ing dif­fer­ent inter­ven­tions .
Efforts were also made to make the inter­ven­tion expe­ri­ence as sim­i­lar as pos­si­ble , except for the crit­i­cal dif­fer­ence as to whether chil­dren received direct train­ing in man­ag­ing their EEG state .
Thus , treat­ment for both groups entailed com­put­er - game like tasks that demand­ed atten­tion .
In both con­di­tions , chil­dren were encour­aged to devel­op strate­gies to focus atten­tion and to prac­tice these strate­gies at home and school .
They also received sim­i­lar amounts of atten­tion and praise for doing so .
By equal­iz­ing as many aspects of the train­ing expe­ri­ence as pos­si­ble , the researchers could attribute any out­come dif­fer­ences that emerged to crit­i­cal dif­fer­ences in the pro­grams them­selves , i.e. , whether feed­back on EEG state was pro­vid­ed , as opposed to some extra­ne­ous fac­tor such as atten­tion from the exper­i­menters , time spent on a demand­ing com­put­er task , etc .
In addi­tion to these impor­tant con­trols , efforts were made to keep par­ents and teach­ers ‘ blind ’ to the type of train­ing chil­dren received .
Thus , par­ents were only told that their child would receive either of two promis­ing com­put­er - based treat­ments for ADHD .
They also did not accom­pa­ny their child into the treat­ment room to observe .
Chil­dren ’s teach­ers were also not informed about the child ’s treat­ment .
Although a num­ber of par­ents became aware of which treat­ment their child received , and per­haps some teach­ers did as well , it is not pos­si­ble to keep every­one tru­ly ‘ blind ’ in a study like this .
- Mea­sur­ing Treat­ment Out­comes -
The main out­come mea­sure used were par­ent and teacher rat­ings of chil­dren ’s ADHD symp­toms .
In addi­tion to rat­ings of core inat­ten­tive and hyper­ac­tive - impul­sive symp­toms , rat­ings were col­lect­ed on a vari­ety of oth­er behav­iors , e.g. , oppo­si­tion­al behav­ior , con­duct prob­lems , emo­tion­al prob­lems , and social prob­lems .
These rat­ing scales were obtained before and after treat­ment .
To rule out place­bo effects as an expla­na­tion for any treat­ment dif­fer­ences found , the researchers also asked par­ents about their atti­tudes towards treat­ment , how moti­vat­ed they thought their chil­dren were , and how sat­is­fied they were with their child ’s treat­ment .
- Results -
Pre­lim­i­nary analy­sis revealed no group dif­fer­ences in par­ents ’ atti­tudes towards , or sat­is­fac­tion with , their child ’s treat­ment or in how moti­vat­ed they felt their child was .
These fac­tors thus should not have influ­enced par­ents ’ rat­ings of core symp­toms .
Results of the par­ent and teacher behav­ior rat­ings indi­cat­ed the fol­low­ing :
1. Par­ents of chil­dren treat­ed with neu­ro­feed­back report­ed sig­nif­i­cant­ly greater reduc­tions in inat­ten­tive and hyper­ac­tive - impul­sive symp­toms than par­ents of con­trol chil­dren , i.e , . those who received com­put­er­ized atten­tion train­ing .
The size of the group dif­fer­ence was in a range that would be con­sid­ered mod­er­ate , i.e. , about .5 stan­dard devi­a­tions .
2. Teach­ers of chil­dren treat­ed with neu­ro­feed­back report­ed sig­nif­i­cant­ly greater reduc­tions in inat­ten­tive and hyper­ac­tive - impul­sive symp­toms than teach­ers of con­trol chil­dren .
The size of the group dif­fer­ence was sim­i­lar in mag­ni­tude to that found for par­ents , about .5 stan­dard devi­a­tions .
3 . Apart from these dif­fer­ences in core ADHD symp­toms , few group dif­fer­ences were found .
How­ev­er , neu­ro­feed­back was asso­ci­at­ed with greater reduc­tions in par­ents ’ rat­ings of oppo­si­tion­al and aggres­sive behav­ior .
Teacher rat­ings for the two groups did not dif­fer on any of the remain­ing behav­ioral mea­sures .
The results sum­ma­rized above reflect aver­age dif­fer­ences between the groups .
The authors also exam­ined the per­cent­age of chil­dren in each group that were judged to derive sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fit where this was defined as at least a 25 % reduc­tion in core ADHD symp­toms .
Fifty - one per­cent of chil­dren in the neu­ro­feed­back group met this thresh­old com­pared to only 26 % of chil­dren in the atten­tion train­ing con­trol group .
This dif­fer­ence was sta­tis­ti­cal­ly sig­nif­i­cant as well .
- Sum­ma­ry and Impli­ca­tions -
This was a well - designed study of neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment for ADHD that used ran­dom assign­ment , blind raters , and includ­ed an appro­pri­ate con­trol group .
Results indi­cate that neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment yield­ed sig­nif­i­cant­ly greater reduc­tions in par­ent and teacher rat­ings of core ADHD symp­toms than the com­par­i­son treat­ment .
Fur­ther­more , the mag­ni­tude of the reduc­tions appear large enough to be clin­i­cal­ly mean­ing­ful .
Although the impact of neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment on oth­er aspects of chil­dren ’s func­tion­ing was less pro­nounced , sig­nif­i­cant reduc­tions in par­ents ’ rat­ings of oppo­si­tion­al behav­ior were also found .
Over­all , these find­ings add to the research sup­port for neu­ro­feed­back as a treat­ment for ADHD .
How­ev­er , despite the many strengths of this study , there are con­cerns to note and rea­sons why some researchers will find a basis for crit­i­ciz­ing it .
The main con­cerns — and my own take on them — include the fol­low­ing :
1. With­out get­ting too tech­ni­cal , some researchers will argue that the sta­tis­ti­cal tests used in this study were not ide­al and may have over­es­ti­mat­ed the advan­tages of neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment .
My sense from exam­in­ing the data is that the pri­ma­ry find­ings would hold up even if more con­ser­v­a­tive sta­tis­ti­cal tests were employed .
How­ev­er , it would be real­ly nice to see that done .
2. Neu­ro­feed­back is sup­posed to work by teach­ing chil­dren to trans­form their EEG state to one that is char­ac­ter­is­tic of chil­dren with­out ADHD .
How­ev­er , there were no EEG mea­sures tak­en in this study .
Thus , there is no way to know whether neu­ro­feed­back actu­al­ly result­ed in these hypoth­e­sized changes in EEG .
While this is cer­tain­ly true , this has more to do with doc­u­ment­ing the mech­a­nism by which neu­ro­feed­back led to reduc­tions in ADHD symp­toms and has noth­ing to do with whether those reduc­tions actu­al­ly occurred .
I believe that some neu­ro­feed­back prac­ti­tion­ers would argue that this may have also dimin­ished the ben­e­fits pro­vid­ed by neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment .
The rea­son for this is that train­ing was not matched to the spe­cif­ic EEG para­me­ters that need­ed to be altered for each indi­vid­ual and that addi­tion­al ben­e­fits would have accrued had this been done .
Whether this is actu­al­ly the case , how­ev­er , would require addi­tion­al research to deter­mine .
3 . No mea­sures of chil­dren ’s aca­d­e­m­ic func­tion­ing were col­lect­ed .
Because improv­ing aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance is a crit­i­cal treat­ment tar­get for most chil­dren with ADHD , the absence of this data is an impor­tant study lim­i­ta­tion .
There is no argu­ing with this and it is unfor­tu­nate that mea­sures of aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance in the class­room were not col­lect­ed .
4 . No long - term fol­low up was con­duct­ed .
There is thus no basis for know­ing whether neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment result­ed in any endur­ing ben­e­fits .
While this is cer­tain­ly a lim­i­ta­tion , it should be not­ed that nei­ther med­ica­tion treat­ment nor behav­ioral treat­ment have been shown to have endur­ing ben­e­fits after treat­ment ends .
How­ev­er , one of the reput­ed advan­tages of neu­ro­feed­back is that it may result in endur­ing gains .
Thus , adding a long - term fol­low up to this study would have been an impor­tant addi­tion .
5 . It is impor­tant to remem­ber that when improve­ment was defined as at least a 25 % reduc­tion in core ADHD symp­toms , about 50 % of chil­dren treat­ed with neu­ro­feed­back did not meet this thresh­old .
Thus , many chil­dren did not derive sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fit from this treat­ment even though the ben­e­fits aver­aged across all chil­dren were sta­tis­ti­cal­ly sig­nif­i­cant .
This is not sur­pris­ing as no treat­ment — includ­ing med­ica­tion — will help every­one .
How­ev­er , the rate of non-respon­ders is less than what is typ­i­cal­ly found in con­trolled stud­ies of med­ica­tion treat­ment and this is impor­tant to remain aware of .
Despite these lim­i­ta­tions and con­cerns , my take on this study is that it rep­re­sents an impor­tant addi­tion to the research lit­er­a­ture on neu­ro­feed­back treat­ment for ADHD .
In the con­text of oth­er pos­i­tive find­ings that have been report­ed for neu­ro­feed­back , it pro­vides addi­tion­al basis for regard­ing this as an extreme­ly promis­ing treat­ment approach for some chil­dren with ADHD .

Congressman demands to know if discussions regarding new reserve system to replace dollar have taken place
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , November 18 , 2008
Congressman Ron Paul confronted Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke this morning about plans to replace the dollar with a new global currency during the House Financial Services Committee meeting on Capitol Hill .
“ Already we see talk …. about a new international world reserve currency and to me that ’s pretty important because the fiat dollar reserve system is not gonna work anymore , ” said the Congressman , adding that currencies have failed throughout history .
Paul asked Bernanke , “ In your meetings with other central bankers , does this thought come up about a new international world reserve currency and if so , does the subject of gold ever come up …. is there a move on to replace the dollar system ? ”
“ I do n’t think the dollar system is dead , I think the dollar remains the premiere international currency … .
I think the dollar system remains quite strong , ” responded Bernanke .
Bernanke failed to address the issue of a new system of currency so Paul repeated the question of whether the subject ever came up , to which the Federal Reserve chairman responded , “ no it does n’t ” .

( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Asked if the subject of whether such a currency , or indeed the dollar itself , would ever be backed by gold and if gold ever came up in conversation , Bernanke responded , “ only in terms of the sales that banks are planning ” .
Despite Bernanke ’s dismissal of talk about a new world currency system , such speculation has been rife and indeed French President Nicolas Sarkozy has repeatedly called for the dollar to be demoted as the premiere currency .
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde has also called for the dollar to be replaced by the Euro as the world reserve currency , so to believe that such proposals have not emerged in meetings between central banks is stupidly naive .
In September , the Chinese state media , the official voice of the ruling Communist Party , called for the creation of a new currency system following the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
The recent G20 meeting was itself billed as “ Bretton Woods II ” in reference to the first Bretton woods conference at which the dollar was established as the world reserve currency in the summer of1944 .
Nobel prize - winning economist and former World Bank chief Joseph Stiglitz has also called for a new global currency , as have scores of other top economic analysts .
Bernanke ’s claim that such talk has not cropped up during central bank meetings is dubious to say the least .

In the " viability plan " that Chrysler submitted to the Treasury department the carmaker laid out some more changes to its product line - up .
Some of those changes had already been announced shortly after Chrysler 's new owners , Cerberus Capital Management , took over in 2007 .
The new management team quickly announced that the Chrysler Pacifica crossover , Dodge Magnum wagon and PT Cruiser convertible would be dropped .
As part of its latest announcement , Chrysler co-president Jim Press told reporters that the hard - top PT Cruiser , shown here , and two of Chrysler 's SUVs , are being dropped from the line - up as well .
Chrysler also said that new versions of two of Chrysler 's popular sedans would be coming soon , as well as a new Jeep .
Chrysler also has vague plans to bring an electric car to market next year .
In 1989 a female jogger was beaten senseless , raped and left for dead in New York City 's Central Park .
Her skull had multiple fractures , her eye socket was crushed , and she lost three quarters of her blood .
She survived , but she cannot remember anything about the incident .
Within 48 hours of the attack , solely on the basis of confessions obtained by police , five African - and Hispanic - American boys , 14 to 16 years old , were arrested .
The crime scene had shown a horrific act but carried no physical traces at all of the defendants .
Yet it was easy to understand why detectives , under the glare of a national media spotlight , aggressively interrogated the teenagers , at least some of whom were " wilding " in the park that night .

For even more action , we have Transporter 3 and it ’s filled with car chases , speeding trains , and hot women ( right ) .
According to Amazon :
Trying to get out but regretfully pulled back in , uber - driver Frank Martin ( Jason Statham ) , in his third misadventure in the Transporter series , eschews retirement to hit the road again – but under unique duress .
Frank ’s services as a wheel man are wanted by a pathological villain , Johnson ( Robert Knepper ) , who pressures him to drive Valentina ( Natalya Rudakova ) , the party - girl daughter of a Ukrainian official ( Jeroen Krabbé ) , across Eastern Europe as part of an environmentally - unfriendly blackmail scheme .
The story ’s gimmick is that Johnson outfits Frank and Valentina with wrist bracelet bombs that will go off if either of them gets more than 75 feet away from the car .

In LA for two sold - out shows at the Teragram Ballroom , two members of the Dandy Warhols — frontman Courtney Taylor - Taylor and keys / bass / vocalist Zia McCabe — chatted with High Times backstage before the gig .
The First Time
Courtney Taylor - Taylor : I was a ’ 70s kid , so I do n’t even remember when I first smoked pot .
I might have been 10 years old .
Playboy magazines and black - light posters , hanging out in friends ’ bedrooms , who knows when that was .
Maybe I was 9 … or 12 — who knows ?
Synergy and Sinsemilla
Zia McCabe :
The band was the only thing for years .
Constantly touring , packing and unpacking .
There ’s wonderful things about having a life in a place [ Portland ] , but there ’s also something wonderful about leaving that place from time to time , and when we get this just right , we get to appreciate both worlds .
Getting along with other humans is not easy , and we are n’t even easygoing people .
We have opinions , baggage , and grudges , but we also really appreciate each other and we love what we do together so much that it ’s worth it .
Somehow , what the four of us bring synergistically has created this project … that just keeps going and going .
CTT : Fans have flown in from all over the country and the world to follow us from LA to San Francisco and Oakland , to Portland ’s Crystal Ballroom for the Cowboy Christmas .
We ’re playing a whole lot of new songs and if we switch out the first song , it ’s gonna feel like a different set for the people following us …
Right ?
ZM : We ’ll rehearse for an hour or so , then take a “ break , ” and when we get back our perspective may have changed , sometimes wildly , and it changes the way the music feels and the way we relate to each other .
Same thing when we ’re recording .
You can get lost in the weeds , then smoke some weed and come back with a heightened sensitivity .
You might be less focused , but you ’re more clear on what feels right and what feels wrong .
This is probably why cannabis and art go so well together .
When I DJ stoned , I ’m hypersensitive to what should and should not be played .
The Green Rush
ZM : Nowadays the pot industry up in Portland is like a gold rush .
It ’s everywhere .
It ’s amazing .
Friends are growing it — and I might when I ’m not traveling so much .
It ’s a great alternative to alcohol .
Going to a show stoned is way better than going to a show drunk .
Rather than prohibition , they should have made it culturally uncouth to be drunk .
Going to a show drunk is like not even really going to a show .
CTT : I liked it when pot smoking was illegal .
You ’d meet in a bar for a few drinks , then go over to someone ’s house to burn one .
You ’d listen to their music , meet their friends …
That ’s never really going to go away , I hope .
ZM : I ’d choose cannabis over alcohol in almost every situation .
I ’ve seen a few “ dab ’til they drool , ” but it ’s rare — and they wo n’t need to go into rehab .
Staying Power
ZM : We ’ve been working on a new album and I have to say , I ’m more excited about this one than the last three .
It ’s so good to be that excited about something like this after 24 years of being in this band .
That ’s a long relationship .
It ’s like music is our sex .
I guess that ’s an odd analogy because we get paid for our music — but you get what I mean .
All Together Now
Zia is thrilled that cannabis companies are supporting artists : “ Denver ’s Sacred Seed has a gorgeous shop , and they ’ve paid for me and other artists to come and DJ at their events .
We ’ve played gigs we ’d never have been able to without the support of the pot industry . ”

Some big wind developers , like NextEra Energy Resources and even the Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens , a promoter of wind power , have cut back or delayed their wind farm plans .
Renewable energy sources like biomass , which involves making electricity from wood chips , and geothermal , which harnesses underground heat for power , have also been slowed by the financial crisis , but the effects have been more pronounced on once fast - growing wind and solar .
Because of their need for space to accommodate giant wind turbines , wind farms are especially reliant on bank financing for as much as 50 percent of a project ’s costs .
For example , JPMorgan Chase , which analysts say is the most active bank remaining in the renewable energy sector , has invested in 54 wind farms and one solar plant since 2003 , according to John Eber , the firm ’s managing director for energy investments .
In the solar industry , the ripple effects of the crisis extend all the way to the panels that homeowners put on their roofs .
The price of solar panels has fallen by 25 percent in six months , according to Rhone Resch , president of the Solar Energy Industries Association , who said he expected a further drop of 10 percent by midsummer .
( For homeowners , however , the savings will not be as substantial , partly because panels account for only about 60 percent of total installation costs . )
After years when installers had to badger manufacturers to ensure they would receive enough panels , the situation has reversed .
Bill Stewart , president of SolarCraft , a California installer , said that manufacturers were now calling to say , “ Hey , do you need any product this month ?
Can I sell you a bit more ? ”
More than a decade after the death of a princess inspired thousands of grieving strangers to leave tributes of flowers , cards and messages outside Buckingham and Kensington Palaces , the flowery shrine has become a commonplace sight on dangerous streets .
Sprays of carnations , roses , lilies and orchids seem to spring out of the prosaic municipal fixtures and fittings , like living creatures insisting on their power to transcend death .
Andy Barter is a successful commercial photographer whose work has appeared in award - winning ad campaigns ( such as Heineken ) and the pages of Wallpaper* , Arena and Esquire .
His art work tends to push simple subjects – paint splashing from a bottle , the silhouette of a naked body – into abstract and surreal forms .
Show him a floral roadside tribute , however , and he 'll photograph it with loving realism , as if it 's a French or Dutch still - life .
" Why floral tributes ?
Because I find them very moving and sad , " he says .
" You can be sitting in your car , totally cosseted from the world , getting frustrated with your journey , and one of these appears , to remind you that awful things happen on the road , much worse than being stuck in a traffic jam .
I decided to photograph them in the most sensitive way I could , because they 've been put there by people experiencing probably the worst time of their lives . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Barter does n't reveal much about the circumstances of the deaths so eloquently memorialised in his work .
He lets the tributes express their own ramshackle melancholy : the notes in children 's handwriting , the details of a truncated life inside a polythene case , the spooky digital photo .
The sheer variety of tributes surprised him .
" Some were no more than a simple bunch of flowers , gaffer - taped to a lamppost .
But one , in south London , was a really elaborate shrine : a bench , little statues , religious mementoes , poems , photos , around this tree that the car must have run into ... "
Though the dark backgrounds suggest the middle of the night , he took the pictures in late afternoon .
" We used a flash , with my assistant holding a light on a boom above the flowers , to make them feel more God -lit , if that makes sense .
It isolated them from their environment . "
Barter cleverly contrasts the drama of the flowers and the everyday tedium of the park railings , tarpaulins , bollards and no - right - turn signs that are the language of the road .
The flowers are gloriously lit , in triumphant pinks , yellows and greens .
Some of the displays seem a touch too perfect , in combining dead flowers with live ones .
Had he ... you know ... adjusted the displays ?
" No , no , " says Barter , indignantly .
" I did n't want to touch them .
When you photograph them you feel a sense of responsibility : the last thing you want is to be seen as some kind of ghoul . "
He noted , however , that bereaved relatives would sometimes respond to the decay of their tribute roses by introducing new live ones .
The combination , he agrees , is too symbolic : it 's fitting that the French for " still life " is nature morte .
I wonder if Barter had taken pictures of the Diana flowers in 1997 .
" No , " he says .
" It 's not something I 'd done before .
Even now , I find these tributes puzzling .
If someone I 'd known had died , I 'm not sure I 'd want to mark the spot in that way – though , to me , the mystery only makes the shrines all the more haunting and intriguing . "
Obama Administration seeks to give Treasury Secretary power to seize more companies John Byrne
Published : Tuesday March 24 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama is considering asking Congress to give Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner the power to seize non-bank financial companies -- such as insurers or hedge funds -- according to a report in Tuesday 's Washington Post .
The measure , Administration officials hope , will allow the government to forestall an economic domino effect , such as was caused by the failure of the investment house Lehman Brothers last year .
The Post 's story is based on an " administration document , " which was not printed .
" Giving the Treasury secretary authority over a broader range of companies would mark a significant shift from the existing model of financial regulation , which relies on independent agencies that are shielded from the political process , " the Post 's Binyamin Appelbaum and David Cho wrote .
" The Treasury secretary , a member of the president 's Cabinet , would exercise the new powers in consultation with the White House , the Federal Reserve and other regulators , according to the document . "
Meanwhile , a senior Democratic lawmaker told Reuters on Tuesday that he was willing to give Treasury Secretary Geithner more authority to oversee the unwinding of financial institutions that are not now federally regulated .
U.S. Rep. Paul Kanjorski , chairman of a House Financial Services subcommittee , said Geithner would be asking for additional authority to oversee organizations like giant insurer American International Group .
Kanjorski said he would work with the Obama administration to give the Treasury Department the additional authority to handle such institutions " if there is a systemic problem involved .
Legislation to allow Geithner expanded powers could go to Congress as soon as this week .
" The powers would parallel the government 's existing authority over banks , which are exercised by banking regulatory agencies in conjunction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , " Appelbaum and Cho wrote .
" Geithner has cited that structure as the model for the government 's plans . "

I was talking yesterday with Spark Capital founder Todd Dagres ... and I asked him if the rumors were true that he has begun Twittering .
( Spark is the lone Boston investor in San Francisco - based Twitter , having recently participated in the company 's $ 35 million fourth round .
It 's true , but his Twitter identity is tough to find .
( It 's here . )
A pithy sample post : " Lots of coats and ties in the room .
Ties = bear market .
" I asked Dagres why he'd started using Twitter ( though others at his firm blog , he has never been a big blogger ) , and when we'd hear about Twitter 's business model .
" I tried it because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about , " Dagres said .
" This thing is growing about as fast as I ’ve ever seen anything grow before .
Now , I ’m addicted to the stupid thing .
I follow Shaq and a few other people who ’ve got interesting insights . "
That would be Spark colleagues Bijan Sabet and Santo Politi , and Jonathan Seelig from GlobeSpan Capital .
( While at Battery Ventures , Dagres was an investor in Akamai Technologies , which Seelig helped start . )
Dagres says that Spark and Union Square Ventures are the two biggest shareholders in Twitter .
" We think it ’s kind of funny to listen to people [ in the press ] talk about the lack of a business model , " he said .
" We know how we ’re going to do it , and we ’re very confident about how we ’re going to do it , and it ’s not necessarily in our interest to tell people how we ’re going to do it .
There is a biz model that has yet to be implemented .
Of course , I can't guarantee it ’s going to work .
" Dagres continued , " All of a sudden there will be some changes that wo n’t undermine the experience or the virality -- but it will be pretty obvious how we ’re going to moentize it .
" Twitter has n't generated any revenue thus far .
Dagres said that changing that situation was definitely a project for 2009 .
But " we ’re in no rush right now , " he said .
Is n't it nice to fantasize , amidst the current economic gloom , that you work for a company that is under no pressure to start bringing in revenue any time soon ?
" Calgon , take me away ..... "

Even as it attacks DRM on music , Apple is continuing to add more DRM to its own hardware ( we recently documented all of Apple 's various hardware DRM restrictions ) .
The latest example is the new iPod Shuffle .
According to the careful reviewers at iLounge , third - party headphone makers will have to use yet - another Apple " authentication chip " if they want to interoperate with the new Shuffle .
Normally , of course , independent headphone makers could simply reverse engineer the interface .
The " authentication chip " is there so that Apple 's lawyers can invoke the DMCA to block those efforts .
So this shows us , yet again , what DRM is for -- not stopping piracy , but rather impeding competition and innovation .
[ See below : Apple subsequently denied any authentication features . ]
iLounge sums up what this means for consumers :
This is , in short , a nightmare scenario for long - time iPod fans : are we entering a world in which Apple controls and taxes literally every piece of the iPod purchase from headphones to chargers , jacking up their prices , forcing customers to re-purchase things they already own , while making only marginal improvements in their functionality ?
It ’s a shame , and one that consumers should feel empowered to fight .
Could n't have said it better myself .
One final thought : why have so many of the reviews of iPods failed to notice the proliferation of these Apple " authentication chips " ?
If it were Microsoft demanding that computer peripherals all include Microsoft " authentication chips " in order to work with Windows ( or Toyota or Ford doing the same for replacement parts ) , I 'd think reviewers would be screaming about it .
UPDATE : iLounge has posted an editorial confirming its reporting on the authentication chip for 3G Shuffle and suggesting that the reluctance of many reviewers to cover these kinds of issues may be the result of a very specific Apple policy :
Apple has now decided to “ punish ” buzzkillers — journalists who the company does n’t consider friendly enough to its marketing mission .
And by “ punish , ” we mean to say that this specific word is used to refer to what happens if someone has said something Apple does n’t approve of .
...
And Apple ’s upset because we ’ve been telling our readers too much — and constantly taking your side , rather than Apple ’s , whenever the company is in the wrong .
We do this proudly .
And we ’re not going to apologize for it . "
Thanks , iLounge , keep it up .
UPDATE 2 : BoingBoing Gadgets is now reporting that Apple has said that " there is no encryption or authentication on the chip , so clones could conceivably be made , just not with " Made for iPod " official certification . "
If that 's right , then I was wrong about the DMCA angle on this story , misled by the term " authentication chip " used in the original iLounge report , as well as Apple 's previous " authentication chips " in various iPod dock products .
UPDATE 3 : Both Monster Cable and V - Moda are also confirming that there is no authentication requirement for headphones for the new Shuffle .
So it looks like there 's no DMCA threat here , after all , unlike with jailbreaking your iPhone or talking about syncing your iPod with software other than iTunes .
A frustrating couple days of coding has crystalized a new rule for me :
If you ca n’t demonstrate your new feature in three lines of code , you ’re not done .
But it works from the client UI ?
Great .
And it ’s fully tested ?
Super !
But you ’re still not done .
If it took twenty lines of setup code to make the unit tests work , you ’re not done .
There should be a close to one - to - one correspondence between artifacts in the UI and artifacts in your codebase .
Did you add a new command ?
There should be a single methodthat encapsulates that command .
Did you add a new form ?
There should be a single classwhich can be instantiated in a valid state with a single constructor or factory call .
I ’m not saying this just for the sake of style .
This is for your own good .
It ’s so that six months from now , you can look at that feature on the screen and track it to a single point in the code .
It ’s so that when you ’re training the new guy , you can open up a console and type three lines to demonstrate how that feature works .
It ’s so that when you write a conference presentation on your brilliant code , you can fit the examples on one slide .
Do n’t just be a domain expert ; be an API designer .
A humane one .
The brain you may save from imploding is your own .
I do n’t have time to go into technical details , but the Facade pattern is your friend .

A Free Rider is considered someone who consumes more than he should , or more than what is considered “ fair ” .
In the more extreme case it is someone who contributes nothing but still receives the full benefits of society .
In a more mild case , it might be the lazy person who manages to obscure the fact that he ’s only working half the time .
Both of these cases are considered a problem because they present a prisoner ’s dilemma to whatever they apply .
If I work in a factory and can simply slack off half the time , this will bring me the benefit of living a happier , less tiring and stressful job .
If this can pass unchallenged it will trigger others in the factory to act in the same way ( defect ) so as to get the same benefit .
When a few people become free riders then it usually does not create an issue as others can cover for their loss without noticeable drawbacks .
However when everyone , or a critical mass , defects then everyone suffers .
Free rider then must be somehow convinced or coerced to stop defecting from contributing what is expected of them , and societies have come up with various ways to work around this problem .
In a modern nation for example , active coercion is used via the form of taxes to insure that everyone contributes their share .
In a theoretical “ Anarcho ” - Capitalist society on the other hand , this problem is resolved through death .
The question occurs then , how would an Anarchist / Communist society deal with Free Riders .
The way I see it , there ’s two necessary conditions that must exist to turn someone into a free rider .
These are Incentive and Obfuscation .
Incentive is the fact that in a prisoner ’s dilemma the best result is when the other side cooperates as you defect .
The greater the difference from the result of mutual cooperation compared to cooperation / defection , the greater the incentive to defect .
Obfuscation on the other hand is the ability to hide your choice in the prisoner ’s dilemma so as to avoid coercion or others defecting with you .
The greater the incentive and the easier the obfuscation , the more free riders you will get in your system until it collapses .
A Capitalist system ( wether a fascist , democratic or an stateless one ) has such a a major issue with free riders because both conditions are high .
It is easy to hide the fact that you ’re lazy when your co-workers wo n’t care to give you away and the rewards for doing it are considerate ( same pay for less work ) .
I want to show how in a Socialist society both of these conditions are severely reduced .
Incentive
Lets say we have a factory where our potential free rider is a worker .
In a Capitalist run factory he would either be getting the minimum wage ( the cost to survive ) due to the commoditization of labour , or in the lucky case that the worker is living in a Bourgeois nation , he ’ll be getting a decent one .
Whatever happens then , the worker knows that he will be getting the same wage and it will also be unlikely that any extra effort will be rewarded .
But this is not the case in a socialist mode of production .
Because the workers themselves reap all the fruits of their own labour any slacking at work will come directly out of one ’s “ paycheck ” while any extra effort will increase their reward .
Because of this , in our prisoner ’s dilemma abstraction of the situation , the reward one receives from cooperating with others within Socialism are approaching the reward one receives via defection .
The smaller this difference between rewards becomes , the smaller the incentive for one to defect
Obfuscation
The second condition is how easy it is for a potential free rider to hide the fact that he is slacking about .
Within a capitalist company , the limited management finds it very difficult to tell apart who is the slacker as opposed to who is simply slower than others ( but still trying ) or who is having a bad time .
And since other workers generally do n’t rat on their colleagues , especially when working conditions are bad , it becomes quite easy to hide the fact that you ’re avoiding work , and this only gets easier in direct proportion to the size of the company .
However when you have a company where every worker ’s reward is directly affected by every other contribution , suddenly people who take but do not give stand out much more .
And because we ’re talking about interactions between equals , workers will find it much easier to speak out and pressure the slacker socially to behave .
Whereas it ’s easy to hide from ( ( or suckup to ) the minority of the people who have the power to punish or fire you , it is not as easy to do the same when everyone you work with has a chance to notice , complain and eventually get rid of you .
Now you might have noticed that I ’m mostly talking about workplaces as this is the main area where someone might try to free ride , but there ’s also the case that one tries to escape working altogether .
How can you tell then if your neighbour is contributing his part to the community for all the benefits he ’s getting back ?
Like the workplace , in a small scale community it is very difficult to hide the fact that you never seem to be doing anything .
Sooner or later neighbours and other member will start adding 2 and 2 together and come to the right conclusions .
We also should consider that it ’s very unlikely that any person would prefer doing nothing for most of his life .
I think it ’s in our evolved psychology to want to feel productive to some degree .
Certainly there are subcultures where it seems as if free riding ( on social benefits ) is promoted , but how much that is caused by other social conditions is a big argument ( ie are people free riding because they can , or are they free riding because the alternative low - paying crappy non-fulfilling jobs are a far worse option ? )
Dealing with Free Riders
So I ’ve argued how the number of Free Riders within an Anarchist / Communist society would be much lower than what we ’ve come to expect from experience , but it ’s still conceivable that a number of them will still exist .
While it will be easier to be discovered and the rewards of them defecting will be marginal , some may opt for this method .
Perhaps they are just that lazy or do n’t care what others think etc .
How will we deal with them ?
Social Pressure
Humans are primarily social animals and do n’t really want to live alone .
When a free rider is discovered in work , his colleagues can easily make his life miserable by avoiding contact and / or being hostile , depending on how much he is slacking off .
This type of pressure works even now to a significant degree and you very often see people quit from nice jobs because of office hostility .
If this can work on people who can even be on the right ( that is , not being lazy ) then it will doubtly work on people who have to face their colleagues and their own conscience .
Outside work , the same thing can happen .
Friends & Family will start urging you to do your part or abandon you if you do n’t .
Social contacts may become hostile and as the information spreads more and more , people around you will do the same .
Imagine your grocery store clerk wordlessly giving you your necessities , imagine your postman “ forgetting ” to bring you the mail .
You get the idea .
I do not think there ’s many who will want to be in this situation , especially if it ’s their own fault for wanting to be lazy .
Ostracism
There is always a chance that a free rider will associate with other free riders in order to alleviate the effects of social pressure .
As long as food and shelter are always provided , then one only needs to avoid social withdrawal in order to function in society and if they can find other like them , a subculture of free riders may be created that will be more resistant to social pressure .
Hopefully a future society will be a federation of communities whereas people cluster together with whoever they want to associate with .
As such , each community will get to decide with whom they want to associate with and provide their communal resources .
Were such a group of free riders to appear amidst the community , it would be relatively simple for the productive members of society to refuse to support them .
Whereas this is impossible in a tax based welfare system , it would be fairly simple under Anarchism .
Leaving them be
It is very possible that even with the small incentive and low chance to hide , some people might still find a way to free ride in a Anarchist / Communist society and this is unavoidable in any kind of system really .
For example in a taxation situation , you still have a lot of people who find a way to hide their true income or simply become invisible and only work through the black market .
In the sense that these people keep using public services that the rest of us have paid for , they are free riding .
Well how about simply ignoring them ?
The number of such undiscovered free riders can never be large enough to be disruptive as this would mean that the method they achieve it would eventually leak to the rest of the community which would then take action .
Trying to get rid of them through blanket measures is more likely to do more harm than good , as it may require authoritarian measures and the like .
So in the end you have a very small percentage of any community leeching off somehow in a way that does not incite others to do the same , we simply write it off as part of the waste .
Among the people with special needs , the sick , the children and the elderly , a bunch of free riders will never make any difference .
A vulgar right - wing libertarian might here say that as long as there is any waste , as long as any person has the possibility to leech off his hard work , then the system is unacceptable .
But the problem is that under Capitalism not only do the free riders abound but they also get to wield all the power .
Who are they ?
Well , as per the initial definition , they are of course the ones who do not contribute anything by themselves and retain all the benefits of society .
How do they do that ?
By simply turning their wealth to more wealth without having to lift a finger .
They are the parasitic class who skim all the surplus value without having to break a sweat .
They are the Capitalists .
Given the choice of a free rider in an Anarchist society – who can never have anything more than anyone else , nor exert any power over his comrades – and a free rider in a Capitalist society who not only gets to live the good life without even trying , but also get to be more powerful as time passes at the expense of everyone else … well I ’d like to think that most can see which is the best choice .

As a book reviews editor at New Scientist , I often come across so - called science books which after a few pages reveal themselves to be harbouring ulterior motives .
I have learned to recognise clues that the author is pushing a religious agenda .
As creationists in the US continue to lose court battles over attempts to have intelligent design taught as science in federally funded schools , their strategy has been forced to ... well , evolve .
That means ensuring that references to pseudoscientific concepts like ID are more heavily veiled .
So I thought I 'd share a few tips for spotting what may be religion in science 's clothing .
Red flag number one : the term " scientific materialism " .
" Materialism " is most often used in contrast to something else - something non-material , or supernatural .
Proponents of ID frequently lament the scientific claim that humans are the product of purely material forces .
At the same time , they never define how non-material forces might work .
I have yet to find a definition that characterises non-materialism by what it is , rather than by what it is not .
The invocation of Cartesian dualism - where the brain and mind are viewed as two distinct entities , one material and the other immaterial - is also a red flag .
And if an author describes the mind , or any biological system for that matter , as " irreducibly complex " , let the alarm bells ring .
Misguided interpretations of quantum physics are a classic hallmark of pseudoscience , usually of the New Age variety , but some religious groups are now appealing to aspects of quantum weirdness to account for free will .
Beware : this is nonsense .
When you come across the terms " Darwinism " or " Darwinists " , take heed .
True scientists rarely use these terms , and instead opt for " evolution " and " biologists " , respectively .
When evolution is described as a " blind , random , undirected process " , be warned .
While genetic mutations may be random , natural selection is not .
When cells are described as " astonishingly complex molecular machines " , it is generally by breathless supporters of ID who take the metaphor literally and assume that such a " machine " requires an " engineer " .
If an author wishes for " academic freedom " , it is usually ID code for " the acceptance of creationism " .
Some general sentiments are also red flags .
Authors with religious motives make shameless appeals to common sense , from the staid - " There is nothing we can be more certain of than the reality of our sense of self " ( James Le Fanu in Why Us? ) - to the silly - " Yer granny was an ape ! " ( creationist blogger Denyse O'Leary ) .
If common sense were a reliable guide , we would n't need science in the first place .
Religiously motivated authors also have a bad habit of linking the cultural implications of a theory to the truth - value of that theory .
The ID crowd , for instance , loves to draw a line from Darwin to the Holocaust , as they did in the " documentary " film Expelled :
No intelligence allowed .
Even if such an absurd link were justified , it would have zero relevance to the question of whether or not the theory of evolution is correct .
Similarly , when Le Fanu writes that Darwin's
On the Origin of Species " articulated the desire of many scientists for an exclusively materialist explanation of natural history that would liberate it from the sticky fingers of the theological inference that the beauty and wonder of the natural world was direct evidence for ' A Designer ' " , his statement has no bearing on the scientific merits of evolution .
It is crucial to the public 's intellectual health to know when science really is science .
Those with a religious agenda will continue to disguise their true views in their effort to win supporters , so please read between the lines .

BBC News , Ethiopia
Deep in the gorge country that falls off the Ethiopian plateau , workers in boots and hard hats are hammering , drilling , blasting and digging their way into the mountainside for the foundations of the vast wall that will , when finished , create the second largest hydroelectricity dam in sub-Saharan Africa .
Teams of workers are blasting out the " keyhole " - the slot in the side of the valley that will hold the dam wall in place .
Others are finishing the concrete lining to the last of three 1,000 m long tunnels that have already begun diverting the Omo River waters around the main construction site .
Africa is in the dark .
Give us a choice .
Should we stay in darkness ?
Mihert Debeba , Ethiopia Electricity Corporation According to the engineers , they are now about a third of the way through the project , and on schedule to finish the Gilgel Gibe III hydroelectricity project sometime in 2012 .
By then , the wall will soar 240 metres high - the tallest of its type anywhere in the world ; holding back a reservoir 150 kilometres long .
The dam will provide 1,800 megawatts of electricity .
That will more than double the country 's current generating capacity in one hit , and according to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi , solve a national energy crisis .
" We can not afford not to have Gilgel Gibe III , " he said .
" We need that type of mega - project given the increased domestic demand and the requirements of export .
" And secondly , it enables us to store water and regulate the flooding [ downstream in the Omo River ] . "
He rejects fears that some 500,000 people could see their livelihoods destroyed by the dam .
Tall order
The dam will also produce far more electricity than the country is capable of consuming .
The vast bulk of it has been earmarked for export to neighbours like Sudan and Kenya .
" That would provide us with valuable foreign currency that will help with our balance of payments , " said the prime minister .
The Environmental Impact Assessment ... is fatally flawed
Richard Leakey
Turning Turkana 's tap off Dam ' could spark water wars '
So urgent was the need to get the dam built quickly that the government short - circuited the usual internationally accepted procedures for these kinds of massive infrastructure projects .
Usually , a government will first conduct a feasibility study followed by an environmental and social impact assessment to decide whether it really is wise to go ahead with the plan .
Then , it will raise the finance , call for competitive tenders and award the construction contract .
Instead , the government first negotiated the contract directly with Italian civil engineering giant Salini Costruttori .
It then went looking for the finance - a procedure that has left the government with a massive hole in its budget .
The two financial institutions that the government had hoped would back the project - the World Bank and the European Investment Bank - have both refused to get involved because the government broke international and domestic transparency rules by dealing directly with Salini .
" I think quite rightly , we have an obligation not only to do the right thing but to demonstrate very clearly that we are doing the right thing , " said Greg Toulmin , the World Bank 's country director for Ethiopia .
" In order to do that , we have to go through all these very meticulous processes to check all the aspects of any operation that we provide loan or guarantee to .
That 's something that takes time . "
Standing firm
It 's a luxury that Mihert Debeba , head of the Electricity Corporation , said Ethiopia simply can't afford .
He said : " Africa is in the dark .
If we have to use very luxurious preconditions we would n't develop any hydro - power .
Some fear the dam could destroy traditional ways of life " Give us a choice .
Should we stay in darkness ?
Should we avoid all this development ? "
The corporation also short - circuited the environmental and social impact assessment ( EIA ) process .
Instead the study - which gave the project a clean bill of health - was published two years after construction began .
One of the project 's staunchest critics , Kenyan ecologist Richard Leakey , suspects the study was produced with one aim in mind .
He said : " The scientists that I 've shown [ the EIA ] to - some of whom have worked in Ethiopia for years and may have even advised the Ethiopian government at some point - suggest it is fatally flawed in terms of its logic , in terms of its thoroughness , in terms of its conclusions .
" And it looks like an inside job that has come up with the results that they were looking for to get the initial funding for this dam . "
FLOODING EFFECT OF DAM ON OMO RIVER Choose a view :
At present With dam built 1 .
At present 2 .
With dam built Before any large project can go ahead , Ethiopia 's Environmental Protection Agency first has to give its approval .
Twolde Berhan Gebre heads the agency , and he dismisses critics like Mr Leakey as misguided .
" Leakey 's a big name but I do n't know what he 's based his arguments on .
I do n't think he 's right , " he said .
" My experts have also examined it .
They have studied the environmental impact statements .
They have visited the site and I know them .
" I do n't know you .
I trust them and I do n't care for what you say . "
Science disputed Still , Mr Leakey 's criticism echoes that of another collection of European , American and East African academics calling themselves the " African Resources Working Group " , headed by University of Montana Geography Professor Jeff Gritzner .
The group has released a commentary on the environmental research , which asserts : " The document rests on a series of faulty premises and it is further compromised by pervasive omissions , distortions and obfuscation .
The dam , visualised above , will begin producing power in 2011 " The downstream EIA is laced with tables and figures with multiple types of ' quantitative data ' , creating the illusion of a scientific work .
" While this practice is well known to increase the likelihood of approval by development , finance and oversight agencies , it is fully unacceptable .
" The quantitative [ and qualitative ] data included in virtually all major sections of the report were clearly selected for their consistence with the predetermined objective of validating the completion of the Gibe III hydro - dam . "
The commentary goes on to insist that rather than being beneficial to the river valley as the government insists , the dam will " produce a broad range of negative effects , some of which would be catastrophic " to both the environment and the indigenous communities living downstream .
The science is still very much in dispute - a factor that Mr Leakey believes is reason enough to invoke the precautionary principle and stop the project before it is too late .
For if the Ethiopian government is wrong , those communities living along the lower Omo River Valley all the way down into neighbouring Kenya will pay a heavy price .

QUITO – The Yasuni-ITT initiative , Ecuador 's offer to forgo exploiting Amazon oil reserves in exchange for aid from wealthy nations , will take the form of a trust with an initial endowment from Germany , the Andean nation 's foreign ministry said Friday .
The plan emerged from a meeting in Berlin between Foreign Minister Fander Falconi and Germany 's secretary for economic cooperation and development , Erich Stather , the ministry said .
Falconi and Stather agreed to strive for the creation of " a trust , within an international body , where Germany will deliver the first significant contribution , " according to a foreign ministry statement .
The ministry noted that Germany had supported the Yasuni-ITT initiative from the beginning , funding the technical studies needed to draft a detailed plan .
Quito wants the international community to provide $ 350 million a year in aid for a decade in exchange for Ecuador 's pledge not to extract millions of barrels of oil from the ITT field in Yasuni National Park .
Ecuador says it will use proceeds from the ITT - Yasuni trust to fund economic development and renewable energy projects and to prevent deforestation in 40 environmentally protected zones .
Oil is Ecuador 's main export , and the Andean nation currently produces an average of about 500,000 barrels per day of crude , of which state - owned Petroecuador accounts for just over 50 percent .
Revenue from oil exports finances roughly 35 percent of Ecuador 's public spending .

The International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) today released its latest annual report ( available on February 20th here ) on the global drug situation .
The report strongly suggests that the INCB remains stuck in the last century when it comes to drug policy .
INCB brochure
The INCB is the independent , quasi- judicial United Nations agency that monitors compliance with the UN anti-drug conventions , the legal backbone of global drug prohibition .
As such , it has generally been very conservative , and despite the rising global clamor for a new approach , this year is no exception .
One of the targets of the INCB 's ire this year is marijuana , which the agency says the international community is underestimating .
" The international community may wish to review the issue of cannabis , " the report said .
" Over the years , cannabis has become more potent and is associated with an increasing number of emergency room admissions , " the report stated , adding that marijuana is frequently called a " gateway drug . "
" In spite of all these facts , the use of cannabis is often trivialized and , in some countries , controls over the cultivation , possession and use of cannabis are less strict than for other drugs , " the INCB complained .
While some countries are lax on personal use and others allow medical use , public perceptions of the herb " are overlapping and confusing , " the agency said .
It was also critical of opiate maintenance therapy and harm reduction programs .
Heroin maintenance programs violate the UN conventions , while some harm reduction practices facilitate drug use , the INCB charges .
Another key concern for the INCB was the rise of the Internet in the trafficking of both licit and illicit drugs .
" Drug traffickers are among the main users of encryption for Internet messaging and by this means evade law enforcement , coordinate shipments of drugs and launder money , " the report warned .
" A coordinated , global response is needed to meet this challenge . "
The agency also reported that purveyors of chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs are also using the Internet .
Sometimes criminals will create fictitious companies or bogus authorizations to import such chemicals , the INCB charged .
But the INCB was also " alarmed " by the development of " rogue " Internet pharmacies .
While it granted " that purchasing pharmaceuticals online can be beneficial , especially in areas where hospitals and pharmaceutical services are widely dispersed , [ the INCB ] is alarmed that ' rogue ' pharmacies are encouraging drug abuse among vulnerable groups . "
The report called for international action " to address the illegal sale of drugs on Internet pharmacies and web sites . "
" The Internet is a major problem , " said professor Hamid Ghodse , the board 's president .
" That is why we started three years ago to have contact with Interpol on the issue .
There are illicit Internet pharmacies and they do not have natural boundaries . "
On the positive side , the INCB , which is charged with monitoring the use of opiate - based pain relievers , said " millions of patients " were suffering unnecessarily and urged governments to " stimulate " the use of such pain relievers . "
Although the access to controlled medicines , including morphine and codeine , is considered by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to be a human right , it is virtually non-existent in over 150 countries , " the report said .
" The WHO estimates that at least 30 million patients and possibly as many as 86 million annually suffer from untreated moderate to severe pain . "
But overall , the report was full of doom and gloom , warning that the global drug trade was expanding and becoming more violent .
When assessing blame for this state of affairs , the INCB should look in the mirror , critics said .
" With the release of its annual report today , the International Narcotics Control Board boldly reaffirmed its shameful commitment to politics over science as well as its shocking indifference to the failures and harmful consequences of the global drug prohibition regime , " said Ethan Nadelmann , executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance .
" The INCB is the last of the UN drug agencies to still prioritize abstinence - only ideology over evidence - based policies that have proven effective in reducing drug - related harms .
Its recommendations regarding substitution treatment , cannabis policy , and harm reduction measures to reduce death , disease , crime and suffering are all at odds with both scientific evidence and evolving policies in many parts of the world , " Nadelmann continued .
" Perhaps most stunning is the board 's failure to consider the crime , violence and corruption as well as over - incarceration and violations of human rights associated with the global drug prohibition regime . "
" The tragic irony is that it is the board 's inhumane , unjust and irrational policing of the UN drug control system that has created or exacerbated most of the problems outlined in its report , " agreed Danny Kushlick of Transform , the British drug policy foundation .
" The board is complicit in gifting the illegal drug market to terror groups , paramilitaries and organized criminals , contributing to the political and economic destabilization of producer and transit countries and putting millions at risk of contracting blood - borne viruses .
The INCB and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime pose a greater threat to global well - being than drugs themselves . "
Nadelmann pointed out that there are alternatives .
" Coming on the heels of the report released last week by the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy , which came to very different conclusions with its call for a paradigm shift in global drug control policy , the INCB report seems sadly irrelevant to the most important issues in drug control today , " he said .
" Now that the Obama administration shows signs of joining with other nations in emphasizing health and science over anti-drug rhetoric and ideology , the INCB may soon be faced with the choice of evolving or going out of business .
It will soon be one hundred years since the International Opium Congress convened in Shanghai in 1909 , thereby initiating the global drug control system .
An appropriate memorial would be the abolition of the INCB . "
Miss Manners :
If friends do n’t give to charity , back off Miss Manners :
If friends do n’t give to charity , back off
Dear Miss Manners :
My husband and I serve on the board of directors of a nonprofit YMCA Camp , which was founded decades ago by my husband ’s father and bears his name .
It is dear to our family and does wonderful things for children , including providing “ camperships ” for children not able to afford camp tuition on their own .
This year , our board sent out personalized letters to friends and family members soliciting donations to the Camp ’s Annual Fund Campaign .
My letter made it abundantly clear that no amount was too small to make a difference to this camp , which is struggling to survive in a difficult economic time .
I chose the recipients of my letters carefully and sent only to long - established friends :
a ) who I felt could easily afford to give something .
b ) who have been guests at our home for lavish dinners and parties many times , at least once in 2008 .
c ) for whom we have often done personal favors — for them or their children .
A few were friends who have solicited us for donations to their favorite charities , and we have responded with gifts each time , sometimes generously .
Most responded with donations .
Some wrote that they were not able to give at this time but wanted to be kept on a list for next year ’s campaign .
Some said they already had charities to whom they donated to the limit of their abilities .
What do I do or say to the few who failed to respond in any way , not even the courtesy of a reply ?
If the letter did n’t reach them , then my disappointment in them is unfounded .
On the other hand , if I call or write and they either do n’t respond at all or are discomfited by my importunity , what then ?
Gentle Reader :
It is not surprising that you feel awkward .
You are harboring an improper expectation that puts you on the verge of embarrassing your friends , possibly to the extent of terminating your friendships .
It is one thing to solicit charity funds from your friends , although Miss Manners does not care for your selection B , which suggests a payback for your hospitality .
It is quite another to demand that those who do not donate provide you with an excuse .
Solicitations do not require “ the courtesy of a response . ”
Courtesy , in this case , consists of not prying into how people budget their money .

Our country is on a rapid downward slide into a socialist morass .
We were once a proud and free people but now look to government for medical care , education , home mortgages , student loans and a host of other services .
The bankers that have had control of our money for a century are now demanding trillions of our dollars to avoid a total economic collapse , so they say .
They have convinced the American people that free enterprise is a failure and requires government intervention to prevent disaster .
Our senators are not challenging the foolishness of attempting to bailout the economy .
They are merely questioning how to structure the monetary dissemination process and while they 're at it , like hogs at the feeding trough , getting as much as they can for themselves and their constituencies .
Why is it that we have such unprincipled leaders , leaders that are totally self - seeking and care not a whit for us , except at election time when they lie through their teeth to get us to keep or put them in office ?
I submit that the problem lies , not primarily with them , but with us .
The spirit of liberty that pervaded early America has faded to the point of unrecognizability .
Patrick Henry 's “ give me liberty or give me death ” has degraded to “ give me my share of the goodies . ”
Why has the penchant for freedom that characterized the average American , who was ready to shed his blood rather than lose his liberty , virtually disappeared ?
What changed us from what we were as colonists , in the Civil War or even in WW - 2 to the spineless creatures we have become ?
The problem , as is always the case , is many layers deep but at the bottom , the root cause is really very simple .
Libertarianism has failed and is continuing to fail because its principles are inconsistent with its fundamental philosophy of life .
Liberty , the concept of a free people that respect each other 's freedom and live together in peace with a minimum of government intervention , requires an inherent constraint within each individual against the natural desire for self - gain at the expense of others .
This characteristic is not inborn in any of us .
Our natural instincts are for self - preservation and self - improvement whether at the expense of others or not .
The entrepreneur goes into business to make a profit for himself ; the purchaser tries to get the lowest price he can and the seller the highest .
Do they ever lie or cheat to maximize their gains ?
Yes , if they can get away with it without any real loss to reputation that would hurt them later .
If we 're honest with ourselves we must see and admit that deep down we are all really out for number one .
We very naturally , almost automatically , place ourselves and our personal well being before the concerns of our neighbors .
We 're really not so different from those senators and congressmen that are selling us out in Washington .
So whence comes this necessary restraining influence and what are the limits beyond which personal interests are not permitted to reach ?
Basically and practically there are only two possible sources : self - government or a coercive external government .
Robert Winthrop stated it very clearly and succinctly when said :
All societies of men must be governed in some way or other .
The less they may have of stringent State Government , the more they must have of individual self - government .
The less they rely on public law or physical force , the more they must rely on private moral restraint .
Men , in a word , must necessarily be controlled , either by a power within them , or by a power without them ; either by the word of God , or by the strong arm of man ; either by the Bible , or by the bayonet .
It may do for other countries and other governments to talk about the State supporting religion .
Here , under our own free institutions , it is Religion which must support the State .
Why does he bring religion into the discussion ?
Why only the word of God ?
Could n't it be the word of man that instills in our hearts a love for our neighbor and a concern for his well being , a concern that causes us to give up personal benefit ?
No , selfishness is too deeply embedded in our very being for that to work .
We would be looking for others to follow such a philosophy while we personally would try to use their gullibility to our own advantage .
It must be the word of one who knows exactly what we 've thought , said and done and can take away our gains and our peace in this life and the life to follow .
All the philosophies of the world cannot reach into our inner beings and change us from within .
But a God that reads our thoughts , sees every deed and has the power to judge and punish disobedience can provide real internal constraints .
Without such constraints , we cannot have the freedom libertarians seek .
Until fairly recently America was a very religious , Bible - believing country .
The vast majority of the population , even those that were only outwardly Christians , were self - governed .
They demanded and fought for freedom and could keep it because the Bible governed their behavior .
They did n't put the kind of men into office that we do today .
In their day , Ron Paul would have won in a landslide against the kind of opposition he faced last year .
As libertarians we might win some battles here and there but we can't and wo n't get back to where we once were , and enjoy the freedom we once had , without addressing this root problem .
We want liberty but it can't be had without faith .
Sam Calavitta presides over what may be the noisiest , most spirited math class in the nation .
He greets each student personally , usually with a nickname ( “ Butterfly , ” “ Batgirl ” and “ Champ ” are a few ) and a fist bump .
Then he launches a raucous , quiz - show - style contest .
Boys and girls line up on opposite sides of the room , Calavitta shouts out complex equations from index cards , and the opposing sides clap and cheer with each correct answer .
“ State the anti-derivative of the secant function , ” Calavitta yells .
“ The natural log of the absolute value secant x plus tangent x plus c , ” a student answers correctly .
Next it ’s a trigonometry game , with students shifting partners after each question is posed , making a mad dash around tightly squeezed desks to find a new spot .
This is a typical day in Calavitta ’s Advanced Placement calculus class .
His students at Fairmont Preparatory Academy in Anaheim think he may be the best math teacher on any campus , anywhere .
They may be on to something .
Just look at his AP calculus exam scores from last year :
All 81 of his students aced the college - level test , earning an average score of 4.79 out of 5 .
Sixty - nine of the students earned a perfect 5 .
On Feb. 19 , he was one of 50 teachers from around the country to win the 2009 Siemens Award for Advanced Placement , which recognizes “ exemplary teaching and enthusiastic dedication to students and the AP program . ”
He received a $ 1,000 prize .
And in 2008 , the College Board recognized Fairmont Prep as having one of the strongest AP calculus programs in California .
On a campus with about 560 students in seventh through 12th grades , 30 % are enrolled in AP calculus classes .
Since Calavitta began teaching AP courses in 1993 , his students have had a 96 % pass rate on the exam .
On campus , he is called Mr. Cal or simply Cal .
His rapport with students , like his energy , comes easily .
Think drill sergeant and trusted advisor .
He sees himself as a math coach .
Boredom is an enemy .
He -- and his students -- are always on the move .
“ He challenges you , but he also makes you feel comfortable and makes it understandable , ” said Brook Jeang , a 16 - year - old junior .
“ It ’s the Cal method .
You ca n’t really duplicate it . ”
Calavitta , the father of nine , is a former aerospace engineer who developed his philosophy of teaching from sports , where he competed as a wrestler and is now a triathlete .
The drill is the same -- learn new skills , master them through practice , but always circle back to the basics .
“ One of the difficulties with the conventional teaching approach is teachers ’ feeling their job is to disseminate information from the textbook and have the kids regurgitate it , and then it ’s quickly forgotten , ” said Calavitta .
“ The promise I make to my students is that , ‘ I will never let you forget . ’ ”
Esther Chung , 16 , said Cal helped her feel confident in her skills from the start , even though she ’d never taken an AP exam .
Students can receive college credit if they pass AP tests ;
Chung got a 5 .
“ There ’s never a day when we ’re not having quizzes and competitions , ” said Chung .
“ He prepares you so well that when you actually get to the exam , it feels like just another day in Cal ’s class . ”
Stephen Yoo , 13 , was n’t about to miss an opportunity to learn from Mr. Cal .
He is one of two eighth - graders taking AP calculus this year ; 13 is an extremely young age to tackle the subject .
Last year , one of Calavitta ’s eighth - grade students scored a perfect 5 on the AP exam .
“ He ’s known as a teacher who can change students , not only in school but out of school , ” Stephen said .
“ I had never been used to putting everything I had into math , because it was relatively easy .
But this year I ’ve learned about effort , and I really appreciate that . ”
Calavitta ’s route to the classroom has been somewhat circuitous .
He has taught for 19 years but started off as an analyst at an aerospace firm that developed satellite telecommunications systems .
He coached high school wrestling and , in 1999 , moved his family to Montana , where he worked as a hand on a 100 - year - old ranch .
He was a principal at Calvary Chapel Academy in Yorba Linda before being recruited by Fairmont .
He has written calculus textbooks and consults with public school districts and teachers on math instruction .
Calavitta is also an associate professor at Cal State Fullerton under an arrangement that allows students taking any of his classes to receive full college credit .
He tutors students during lunch and holds Saturday sessions that draw up to 60 students every weekend .
And he and his wife , Monica , run a summer wrestling and character - building camp in Montana .
Fairmont , housed in a hacienda - style mansion built in 1929 , charges a top tuition of $ 16,870 , and 10 % to 12 % of students receive financial aid .
Most of his students are not math whizzes , Calavitta said , but they are jazzed about calculus , a branch of mathematics that involves rates of change and is used in science , engineering and economics .
“ What they get out of calculus here is a belief that they can do something that they never thought they ’d be able to do , ” Calavitta said .
“ My job is not to foster or cater to brilliance but to nurture perseverance . ”
Before taking Calavitta ’s class in 2004 , former student Stephen Whitlock hated math .
But he ended up with a 5 on the AP exam and is senior at Orange ’s Chapman University majoring in math and planning to teach .
“ I had always wanted to teach , but I never knew what [ subject ] until I took his class , ” said Whitlock , who is Calavitta ’s classroom assistant .
“ It takes hard work and meticulous planning on his part .
I see that now that I ’m working for him . ”
Whitlock is one of a group of former Calavitta students on the path to math degrees and teaching careers , said Fairmont Chief Executive Robertson Chandler .
“ If you think back to the past , everyone has a teacher who had an impact , someone they remember for years , ” he said .
“ It ’s about the math , but it ’s also about developing character and discipline and having a commitment to them doing well . ”
Fairmont offers an advanced math program in which students can earn up to 22 units of college credit .
Next fall , it will launch an Engineering and Applied Sciences Magnet Program , co-founded by Calavitta and colleague Joe Dossen .
Calavitta ’s ability to spark interest in math is unusual , said Hank Kepner , president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics , who added that the number of math majors in colleges is flat .
“ Kids have so many competing things they can get interested in , both in and out of school , and there are so many other disciplines calling them , ” said Kepner , a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee .
“ Selling that passion and excitement for a subject is something that students need to hear and see . ”
Teaching runs in Calavitta ’s blood -- his mother , father and grandfather were in the profession -- and he ’s frustrated by people who blame instructors for the shortcomings of public education .
He has taught in public schools with 55 kids in class and understands the stress and frustration .
He feels a kinship with another storied Southern California math teacher , Jaime Escalante , whose success teaching AP calculus to minority students at East Los Angeles ’ Garfield High School won national plaudits and inspired the film “ Stand and Deliver . ”
Both teachers subscribe to the theory that learning should be fun .
Calavitta has met several of Escalante ’s former students at professional seminars .
“ I feel what Escalante himself saw is that academics are secondary , ” Calavitta said .
“ If you want to make a difference in a kid ’s life , you have to first of all let them know that they make a difference in your life . ”

“ I can be a good Muslim and be gay . ”
The LA Times recently ran a story on Aliyah Bacchs , who is a Muslim lesbian that left an arranged marriage and came to her family with two choices : accept her sexuality or lose her forever .
Her case is not an isolated incident or limited to Muslims in America as exemplified in the Channel 4 documentary that was shot in Britain .
“ I think my mom would rather say that I ’ve been hit by a truck than say that I am gay . ”
- Farah
Abdullah says in the documentary that people pick and choose what they want from the Koran .
He takes the good parts and does not believe he is doing anything wrong .
After all , Allah is forgiving .
While the documentary is restrictive in terms of the fact that many faces are never shown or blurred , it still manages to explore the lives of a group of gay Muslims living in Britain , some closeted and others openly homosexual , but all struggling with some aspect of their sexuality .
The double standard of condemning gay men more than lesbians is always worth mentioning : Islam does not have an opinion on lesbians but gay behavior is strongly condemned and punishable to death .
That stems from living in a society where the feminine is disparaged and women are merely objects for consumption ( and it is true for all countries including the United States ) .
There were several profound statements in the video .
One that particularly struck me had to do with the intersectionality of being an ‘ Asian ’ and a queer .
The gay community wants us to step out and be proud while the pan-Asian community wants us to remain in the closet and constrict ourselves .
How does someone deal with that contradiction ?
Says a queer Muslim in the video , “ Are they both competing with each other and we are having to pay for it ?
Why ca n’t I live my life ? ”
Why ca n’t we live our lives ?
It ’s an un-Islamic notion to be ‘ out and proud ’ says one member of Imaan — the largest support group for gay Muslims ( more support groups can be found here ) .
With colorful hijabs on at Gay pride in Britain , the members of Imaan seem to tow the fine - line between leading their lives as queers who are also respectful of the modesty in Islam .
But Abdullah , another gay Muslim , says he would n’t have hidden his identity at Pride as it is important for people to see who is speaking , who is telling their story .
I am a hardliner on these issues —
If our families do n’t accept us ‘ out and proud , ’ they do n’t deserve to be considered family .
Recently , I told my mom about a woman I met in Los Angeles and it was the first time really that I bothered to mention anything about my sexuality and only for the sake of the woman .
The conversation went like this :
“ Mom , I need to tell you something . ”
She looked up with some sort of understanding .
“ Speak quietly , mama [ uncle ] is up and around . ” I lowered my volume .
“ I met someone in LA and she will be here in two weeks for a visit .
And yeah , that ’s it . ”
There is no way I will put myself in a position to explain what is deemed ‘ homosexual behavior ’ to anyone .
We have plenty of online resources and pamphlets for that such as the ones put out by PFLAG .
It ’s ludicrous from where I stand —
We do n’t have pamphlets about being straight and explaining why straight people have sex , so why do I need to ‘ teach ’ people about my sexual orientation ?
“ You have to be careful about these things .
You ca n’t just jump into a relationship . ” I smirk .
Mom really does n’t need to know how this girl and I got together so I just go out on a limb .
“ Well , I have known her for a while . ”
That is true , we were facebook friends for like 1.5 months .
“ Oh , ok . ” “ Yeah …So anyway , I want her to get the same level of respect that Zach [ brother - in - law ] gets in this family and if she does n’t , I will pack up and move and you will never hear from me again . ”
Quite dramatic but I was making an honest statement that I hope she heard and believed .
It is not an empty threat .
“ She is just coming for a visit , ” my mom reasoned .
“ Still , I do n’t want any kind of BS when she is around because I wo n’t stand around and tolerate it .
You can announce it to everyone if you want so they are warned . ”
“ I do n’t have to announce it .
No one needs to know .
Just be discreet about it . ” “ HA ! ”
I felt annoyed at her last statement as I am anything but discreet about my sexuality and it felt like she was still ashamed of me but then again , I am lucky to be a Desi and an Asian American Pacific Islander with a parent who is open to hearing about her daughter ’s homosexuality and new budding relationship in a few short abstract lines .
I do n’t think my non-apologetic , non-descript statements would fly with most Desi and AAPI parents .

I yield to few in my admiration for Mr Adam Boulton , the political editor of Sky News .
On this occasion , however – the visit of Mr Gordon Brown to Washington – Mr Boulton 's coverage struck me as being on the less than generous side .
The commentator kept coming back to Mr Tony Blair 's ecstatic reception after the Iraq war .
In fact the present Prime Minister received no fewer than 19 standing ovations , exactly the same number as Mr Blair had six years previously .
Perhaps the applause was less full of zeal than it had been before .
That could not be helped .
A briefly successful war of aggression against a smaller state works wonders for the spirit of a representative assembly .
In any case , standing ovations are not what they were .
They are given away cheap .
When he addressed the United States Congress , CR Attlee got no standing ovations ; Winston Churchill , a handful .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
I am reminded of the young man from Wales who went to Oxford and was asked by the local MP , Lady Megan Lloyd George , how he was getting on with the English .
" All right , " the young man said .
" Funny lot , " Lady Megan said .
" All that standing up and sitting down . "
American political audiences are much the same .
They expect to be pleased and easily pleased they are .
Mr Brown is entitled to be reasonably well pleased with himself as well .
But then , all prime ministers give in to the temptation to cut a dash in foreign parts .
There was James Callaghan 's " Crisis ?
What crisis ? " on his return from the Guadeloupe summit , when the words were a Sun headline , not a quotation .
And there was the Paris meeting to celebrate the end of the Cold War , when Margaret Thatcher chose to absent herself from her followers at Westminster .
Nothing too bad is going to happen to Mr Brown as a result of his brief absence from these shores , except that he is going to lose the election .
He still clearly reposes hopes in international financial gatherings of one sort of another .
They will not shift a single vote .
Things are too far gone .
William Caxton himself might be manning the printing presses and the voters would remain , well , unimpressed .
Several of my colleagues in the writing trade – Mr Steve Richards in The Independent , Mr Jonathan Freedland in The Guardian , perhaps one or two others – persist in detecting , not signs of recovery exactly , but hopes for the future .
I was never able to see it myself , though perhaps I never wanted to see it in the first place .
With every week that has passed since Mr Brown 's rescue operation of the autumn – numerous other ministers or apparatchiks were involved in the exercise as well – the lifeboats concerned have sunk , capsized or sprung a leak .
Thus it was up to the Government or its emissary , Lord Myners , to fix the terms of the pension arrangements of the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland .
The Government , or its emissary , or both , made a muddle .
It is too late now .
Earlier , Ms Harriet Harman made a reference to " the court of public opinion " .
This sounds to me suspiciously like the retrospective legislation that was eventually enacted by Sir Robert Walpole 's administration after the South Sea Bubble of 1720 .
Ms Harman used to be Solicitor
General , a practising solicitor and an official of what was the National Council for Civil Liberties ( who once reported me to the Press Council , though I do not hold that against her ) .
Ms Harman ought at least to have some idea of due process and the rule of law , instead of chasing after every populist idea that comes into the head of the editor of The Sun newspaper on a wet afternoon .
This is not a matter of simple ambition on Ms Harman 's part .
It is more complicated than that .
New Labour is finished , done for , kaput , along with Mr Brown .
New Labour arrived not with the resignation of Neil Kinnock after the defeat of 1992 but with the death of John Smith .
There was a subdued debate about the future of the party in this short period .
Smith reformed the party on the lines of " one member , one vote " in 1993 , aided by John Prescott .
But the complicated electoral college which was set up as a result of the new procedures ( and most recently produced Ms Harman as deputy leader ) fell short of the slogan " one member , one vote " .
The prevailing slogan under Smith was : " one more heave " .
Mr Blair was even more cynical than Smith , but effortlessly purveyed greater moral uplift , a quality he has possessed to this day .
If we see Ms Harman as a representative of older Labour ( " over my dead body , " some even older representatives may exclaim ) , then Lord Mandelson stands for another way of looking at these strange times .
I first met Peter Mandelson in 1979 or 1980 .
I was then briefly chairman of something called the Political Advisory Group of the British Youth Council , the first and only quango with which I have ever been associated .
I was paid nothing .
It was conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science , as it was then called .
I was the only candidate to whom none of the other constituent bodies took objection .
These included the Conservative Party , the Labour Party , the Communist Party ( oddly , I thought ) and , less oddly , the Boy Scouts .
The Communist representative was Ms Sue Slipman and the Labour representative was Mr Mandelson .
He once turned up at a by - election I was covering for another paper as a researcher for London Weekend Television .
His period of efflorescence culminated in his stint as press adviser to Kinnock , when he more or less organised the 1987 campaign .
He was always civil but never effusive .
Occasionally he used to talk to me .
" At this stage of your career , " he once said , " your problem is .... "
At this point his attention was distracted , whether by somebody that he wanted to talk to or by somebody who wanted to talk to him .
He moved away effortlessly , as if he had castors not big feet .
So I never discovered what my problem was .
It soon became evident that Lord Mandelson , before he was a lord , was an intense romantic about the Labour Party .
He liked to hear stories about his maternal grandfather , Herbert Morrison , who had been deputy prime minister under Attlee ( though not much was made of that at the time ) .
I was not old enough to know these figures at this period , but I did know Dick Crossman , Tony Crosland , even the monstrous Tom Driberg .
Lord Mandelson liked the old stories and old jokes .
And yet , not content with being provided with the elixir of life beyond Brussels , Lord Mandelson is determined to risk all once again .
The part - privatisation of the Royal Mail was rejected not only by Mrs Thatcher ( it is often forgotten ) but by Michael Heseltine as well .
It only goes to show that politicians such as Lord Mandelson and Ms Harman go about things in opposed ways to satisfy their own ambitions .
The US says the Impeccable was conducting routine manoeuvres Five Chinese ships have manoeuvred dangerously close to an unarmed US navy surveillance vessel in the South China Sea , the US government says .
US officials said the incident on Sunday came after days of " increasingly aggressive " acts by Chinese ships .
These violated international law on respecting other users of the seas , a Pentagon spokesman said .
As Beijing kept silent , the US made a formal complaint to China 's military attache at the Pentagon .
The incident happened as the USNS Impeccable was on routine operations in international waters 75 miles ( 120 km ) south of Hainan island , a US statement said .
The ships " aggressively manoeuvred " around the Impeccable " in an apparent co-ordinated effort to harass the US ocean surveillance ship while it was conducting routine operations in international waters " , according to the Pentagon .
Impeccable is designed specifically to detect underwater threats such as submarines for the US navy .
Aggressive manoeuvring by ships by rival navies in sensitive international waters is not uncommon but Washington was sufficiently disturbed by the incident involving the Impeccable to make its concerns public , the BBC's Kevin Connolly reports from Washington .
Emergency stop
The US ship sprayed one Chinese vessel with water from fire hoses to try to force it away , the Pentagon said .
But the Chinese crew stripped to their underwear and carried on approaching to within 25 ft ( 8 m ) , it added .
The Pentagon identified the Chinese boats as a naval intelligence - gathering ship , a Bureau of Maritime Fisheries Patrol Vessel , a State Oceanographic Administration patrol vessel , and two small trawlers .
When the Impeccable radioed requesting a safe path to leave the area , two Chinese vessels dropped pieces of wood in its path , forcing the US ship to make an emergency stop , the Pentagon said .
" The unprofessional manoeuvres by Chinese vessels violated the requirement under international law to operate with due regard for the rights and safety of other lawful users of the ocean , " said Pentagon spokesman Marine Maj Stewart Upton .
" We expect Chinese ships to act responsibly and refrain from provocative activities that could lead to miscalculation or a collision at sea , " he said .
The Pentagon reported three other naval incidents involving China last week :
On Wednesday , a Chinese Bureau of Fisheries Patrol vessel used a high - intensity spotlight to illuminate the ocean surveillance ship USNS Victorious in the Yellow Sea and , the next day , a Chinese Y - 12 maritime surveillance aircraft conducted 12 fly - bys of Victorious
On Thursday , a Chinese frigate approached Impeccable without warning and crossed its bow at a close range of approximately 100 m ( yards ) , after which a Y - 12 aircraft conducted 11 fly - bys .
The frigate later crossed the US ship 's bow again
On Saturday , a Chinese intelligence collection ship challenged Impeccable over bridge - to - bridge radio , calling her operations illegal and directing her to leave the area or " suffer the consequences " .
Test for Obama ?
At issue in Sunday 's incident is the manner in which the US navy says the Chinese vessels went beyond the usual boundaries in shadowing and harassing the Impeccable , the BBC's Kevin Connolly notes .
This may be an example of China testing the mettle of a new US administration , just as it did when it impounded a US reconnaissance aircraft immediately after George W Bush took office , he says .
It held the crew of the plane , which was in collision with a Chinese fighter jet , for 11 days , causing a serious diplomatic row between the two countries .
While relations between Beijing and Washington are complex , any sense of military competitiveness is dwarfed by America 's need for China to continue buying US debt to fund its huge and growing deficit , our correspondent adds .

Barcelona – Amid the megapixels madness of its camera - phone announcements , Samsung has shown us another vision of the future – the Blue Earth .
The phone is an environmental champion , made from recycled water bottles and powered by a solar panel on the back .
And that 's about all we know .
Like the Mona Lisa , the only handset at the Mobile World Congress show is behind glass ( which is why we 've used the official product shot ) , and Samsung is being not exactly cagey but a little thrifty with the details .
We do know that the phone will have a touch screen and also a distinctly gimmicky pedometer , which measures how far you have walked and then tells you how much CO2 you haved saved by not driving .
This is just annoying , and exactly the sort of thing smug Prius owners would like .
It reminds me of the kind of vegan who eats wholemeal pasta – a form of self flagellation designed only to telegraph their pious intentions to us less morally aware mortals .
Still , the intention is good , and the phone has another few eco-tricks up its recycled sleeves .
There is an energy saving mode which will lower the backlight levels and switch off Bluetooth – useful when charging via the Sun .
That solar panel is also claimed to provide enough juice to keep the phone going indefinitely .
For those of us who live in less clear - skied climes ( I 'm looking at you , Britain ) it looks like Samsung will provide a separate charger .
Low - powered , of course .
Best of all , it will be a real phone , available in real shops in the second half of this year .
Microsoft ran into major bandwidth problems when they released the latest Beta of Windows 7 to the public .
The company decided to delay the release while they added some more servers , citing " very heavy traffic " .
If they had only used BitTorrent , this heavy traffic would have actually speeded up distribution , instead of slowing it down .
With an official Windows 7 torrent , Microsoft would not have had problems at all .
In fact , BitTorrent would have helped to get the Beta out faster than Microsoft servers are technically capable of .
The larger the demand and the greater numbers of people active on a torrent , the faster a file can potentially be distributed with BitTorrent , saving Microsoft money too .
This is not the first time that Microsoft has failed to see the benefits of BitTorrent though .
This is merely a replay of what happened two years ago when the Vista Beta was posted , but obviously they have n’t learned from that earlier failure .
At the time Microsoft said that “ legal and privacy issues , ” had prevented them from posting a torrent , but they did n’t explain why this was the case .
BitTorrent would have been the wise choice though .
During recent years BitTorrent has proved itself as the ideal tool to get large files from A to B ( C , D… ) on the Internet .
Linux distros all use BitTorrent , EA used BitTorrent to distribute the Warhammer Online Beta earlier this year , and even NASA embraced BitTorrent .
Although there is no official Microsoft torrent published , Windows 7 Beta is widely available on BitTorrent sites .
And since people generally do n’t like to wait for something that is already available elsewhere , many have turned to BitTorrent for this Beta , whether Microsoft likes it or not .
Water is the new snakeoil – well , it ’s an old snakeoil too .
There certainly seems to be something psychologically appealing about the notion of pure water .
It is clear , crisp , untainted – it just has to be healthy .
And , of course , clean water is essential for health and life , and nothing enhances a lie better than a kernal of truth .
It is not surprising , therefore , that “ magic ” water has long been a staple of snakeoil salesmen , gurus , and charlatans .
Health spas originally centered around special springs of water , or mineral water , and later carbonated water .
I was recently asked about a recent incarnation of the water snakeoil routine , Kangen Water .
The claims made on the website for this dubious product are unimaginatively representative .
Water is the single most important resource for the human body .
Water is the most essential nutrient involved in every function of the body .
Water accounts for approximately 70 % of an individual ’s complete fat free body mass .
In order to function properly , water must be consumed in set quantities in consistent intervals ( average of 2.5 liters per day ) .
When not enough water is consumed , people can begin to develop certain illnesses and even accelerate their aging processes .
Many of the “ magic water ” website begin like this – water is an “ important resource for the human body . ”
Well , duh .
This says nothing , of course , about why any particular water is more healthful then , say , the water that comes out of your tap .
Notice also that the website repeats the common myth that everyone needs a set amount of water to be healthy .
Actually , the amount of water each person needs on any particular day is not fixed – it is a variable depending upon how much water is consumed through food and how much is lost through sweat , urine , and breathing .
It also depends on how much salt and other electrolytes are consumed .
Also , millions of years of evolution have given us a pretty tweaked mechanism for knowing how much we have to drink – it ’s called thirst .
Next we get some nice vague claims :
Kangen water is being recognized by more and more people around the world as the purest and healthiest water for the human body .
This , naturally , is combined with testimonials about the miraculous effects of this water , and “ expert ” endorsements from various quacks .
That ’s the usual 1 - 2 - 3 combination – vague claims that get by the FDA , testimonials from private citizens ( hey , that ’s just free speech ) , and paid quacks to lend a false image of legitimacy .
There are two core claims made for the mechanism of this magic water ’s health benefits – it has anti-oxidant properties , and is alkaline .
Both claims are absurd .
Anti-oxidants are the latest in medical techno - babble for any self - respecting snake oil .
They do serve a legitimate function in the body , but their regulation is complex and so far there is no evidence that simply eating more anti-oxidants has any health benefits , in fact taking too much may be harmful .
The jury is still out on that .
They claim :
It is safe to say that Kangen water is an incredible antioxidant .
Some may go as far as to say that Kangen water is more powerful that any single food or vitamin
supplement in the world .
Simply stated , Kangen water contains active hydrogen which supplies vast amounts of free electrons to our body .
As far as I can tell , this is pure nonsense .
It also seems to be self contradictory – they claim the water is alkaline , but that it contains free hydrogen .
Uh – free hydrogen would make the water acidic – the opposite of alkaline .
Also , once absorbed into the body the water is just water ; it does not retain its pH or ionic state .
The alkaline claims are similarly nonsensical .
What happens when alkaline water hits the acid in the stomach ?
They neutralize each other a bit .
My guess is that the acid wins out .
It takes serious antacids to temporarily neutralize the acid in the stomach .
This slightly alkaline water would not have much of an effect .
Further , the blood pH is around 7.4 and is fairly tightly managed by elaborate metabolic systems in the body .
Most people are not too acidic , and this website claims , and you cannot change your body ’s pH by drinking alkaline water .
You would need to overwhelm your body ’s metabolic processes to alter the pH , or drink certain kinds of poison .
Either that or there needs to be a significant respiratory or metabolic disorder .
In any case , someone whose pH is out of whack is seriously and acutely ill .
If all these claims about pH and anti-oxidants is too much for some would - be customers , the promoters of Kangen water hedge their bets with some straightforward magic :
“ Magical miracle healing water ” has been found in nature at only a few specific locations throughout the world .
These so called “ miracle ” water sources have been discovered in Mexico , Germany , India , China , Australia , and Japan .
Large numbers of people from all over the world wait in line almost every hour of every day to obtain some of this “ magical water ” at all of these locations .
That ’s right – forget all that stuff about active hydrogen – this stuff is just plain magical .
Magic water claims are centuries old and will likely be around forever .
The sales pitches change over time , taking advantage of the latest craze or sexy scientific jargon .
But the con remains the same .
Today is President 's Day , that sacred holiday on the United States calendar devoted to honoring the births of the two most important presidents in the nation 's history by selling bed linens and used automobiles at discount prices .
There was a time in not - too - distant American history when the country could afford to give President Washington and President Lincoln each their own holiday in many places -- Feb. 12 for Abe and Feb. 22 for GW .
But those fat days are gone .
However today , as an added bonus , whether you buy new sheets or not , we 're throwing in publication of the intriguing results from C - SPAN 's latest ranking of past chief executives by leadership qualities .
It may not be a coincidence that the top five presidents of all time , as ranked by the cable channel 's panel of 65 histori ans , all come from the era before video clips and television .
Would Abe still be No. 1 if we 'd seen a million replays of that vintage Civil War footage of him hitting his burly head on the log cabin door ?
Or would a bald George Washington be No. 2 if his powdered wig had gotten blown out of the presidential carriage in a Washington wind , revealing the shiny presidential pate ?
Or FDR , TR and Harry Truman at Nos. 3 , 4 and 5 if we 'd heard audio tapes of their candid opinions of Henry Wallace , William Howard Taft and Strom Thurmond , respectively ?
As evidence suggesting that absence does make the memory grow softer , Bill Clinton slipped up from No. 21 in 2000 to No. 15 now , Ronald Reagan up to 10 from 11 and Bush I from 20 to 18 .
His son , Bush II , remains mired at No. 36 since he became a former president nearly four weeks ago .
Has n't budged a notch .
Ulysses S. Grant , however , made a major leap from No. 33 to the 23d spot .
Must be the beard .
On the other hand , despite a post - presidential record of building lots of houses , Jimmy Carter does n't seem to be doing himself much good more recently , falling from 22 to 25 in the last nine years .
Other dropsies in the latest C - SPAN presidential rankings : FDR from No. 2 to 3 , Millard Fillmore ( 35 to 37 ) , Woodrow Wilson ( 6 to 9 ) and the real shocker , James Buchanan brings up the presidential bottom again , this time at No. 42 , with Andrew Johnson still just above him .
Their belittled presidencies bracketed Lincoln 's , apparently a tough act to precede as well as follow .
The presidency of Buchanan , the only American bachelor president and , significantly , the only one from Pennsylvania , is consistently rated as the worst ever for his failure to avert the Civil War .
And Barack Obama thinks he inherited trouble !
Historian Richard Norton
Smith notes two things about the latest rankings of America 's 42 ex-presidents : " the fluidity with which presidential reputations are judged and the difficulty of assessing any president who has only just recently left office . "
“ How we rank our presidents is , to a large extent , influenced by our own times , " notes historian Edna Medford .
" Today ’s concerns shape our views of the past , be it in the area of foreign policy , managing the economy or human rights .
The survey results also reinforce the idea that history is less about agreed - upon facts than about perceptions of who we are as a nation and how our leaders have either enhanced or tarnished that image we have of ourselves . "
Lincoln , she adds , " continues to rank at the top in all categories because he is perceived to embody the nation ’s avowed core values : integrity , moderation , persistence in the pursuit of honorable goals , respect for human rights , compassion ; those who collect near the bottom are perceived as having failed to uphold those values . ”
Makes you wonder how someday the panel will view President Palin .
As long as you 're here , scroll down ( or click the " Read more " line below ) to see a fascinating video as the presidents ' faces morph into each other , one after the other .

Davies spat Mr Coghill 's tongue on the floor , the court heard A woman who bit off her boyfriend 's tongue during a drunken birthday kiss has been told she faces jail .
Tracy Davies , 40 , bit off a third of Mark Coghill 's tongue after telling him " you never give me smoochy kisses any more " .
Each had drunk a bottle of vodka before the attack at his flat in Jesmond , Newcastle , in October .
Davies was convicted of grievous bodily harm but cleared of the same charge with intent at Newcastle Crown Court .
The jury heard that the couple were celebrating Mr Coghill 's birthday when Davies grew upset because she was not pregnant .
As Mr Coghill , 45 , moved to comfort her , she asked him to kiss her , the court heard .
She let out a satisfaction sound , like if you have a cup of tea when you have n't had one for a few days
Mark Coghill
They kissed and she bit down hard on his tongue , causing him to scream , and he tapped her on the head , hoping she would let go .
He said : " Then when she did stop , she opened her mouth and looked at me in such a way that I have never seen anyone do before . "
Mr Coghill said he could see part of his tongue inside her mouth .
He said : " She let out a satisfaction sound , like if you have a cup of tea when you have n't had one for a few days .
" A ' mmmm ' sound . "
She then spat it on the floor , he said .
Taste buds
Davies later called paramedics , who alerted police , and when arrested she told officers : " You 're joking . "
Mr Coghill was treated at Newcastle General Hospital , but surgeons decided the risk of infection was too high to consider reattaching the torn tongue .
The former customer service adviser was no longer fit to work , struggled to speak and had lost many of his taste buds , the court heard .
Judge John
Evans adjourned the case for three weeks to allow for pre-sentence reports .
He granted Davies bail , but warned she would be jailed .

A pattern of tiny magnets can store data at unprecedented densities ( Image : Science )
For more than 40 years , computer processors have increased in power and shrunk in size at a tremendous rate .
But engineers are approaching the point where there is not much more to be gained from tweaking the traditional ways of making those components ( see our feature What happens when silicon can shrink no more ? ) .
However , advanced new forms of transistors and memory unveiled this week could develop into products that keep that growth from tailing off .
Two US groups have announced transistors almost 1000 times smaller than those in use today , and a version of flash memory that could store all the books in the US Library of Congress in a square 4 inches ( 10 cm ) across .

Domino effect
Thomas Russell at the University of Massachusetts and his international team have become the first to realise a long - mooted idea – that flash memory could be made from patterns of nanoscale magnets .
The group has worked out how to make the memory build itself , in a cascading domino - like effect .
They found weakening a specific plane in a sapphire or silicon wafer brings a subtle instability to the highly ordered crystal .
Heating the crystal to around 1400 °C then emphasises the instability and the atoms rearrange , producing a saw - tooth pattern of depressions across the wafer ’s surface .
That pattern is then used to shepherd polymers into a regular repeating nanoscale pattern and make a mask to create an array of tiny nickel magnets .
Each of these can store digital bits ( 1 or 0 ) in their magnetic north - south orientation .
Dense data
Using 3 - nanometre magnets , an array could store 10 terabits ( roughly 270 standard DVDs ) per square inch , says Russell , who is now working to perfect magnets small enough to cram 100 terabits into a square inch .
“ Currently , industry is working at half a terabit [ per square inch ] , ” he says .
“ They wanted to be at 10 terabits in a few years ’ time – we have leapfrogged that target . ”
Sebastien Lecommandoux who researches self - assembling nanotechnologies at the University of Bordeaux , France , is impressed .
“ The work described can , I believe , bring a real breakthrough in high - capacity storage devices . ”
Tiny transistors
This week also saw the announcement of an advance that could shrink the transistors used to make computer processors by 1000 times .
The smallest features in current silicon transistors are 45 nanometres in size , but the latest made by Jeremy Levy at the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues have features just 2 nanometers in size , allowing many more transistors to be crammed into the same area .
Rather than building them from silicon , the team used two different forms of the common mineral perovskite .
When two of the insulating crystals of the right thickness are held together , the place where they meet can conduct electricity .
But if one of the pieces is too thin , then current will not flow .
Working with wafers that were just too thin to conduct , Levy ’s team found that they could “ draw ” conducting patches onto the crystal using a microscopic needle .
A positive voltage from the needle rearranges the crystal ’s atoms to create lines 2 nm across that conduct like electrical wire .
Write and erase
The process has been used to make transistors roughly 1000 times smaller in area than those fashioned from silicon .
The “ wires ” can also be easily erased and recreated up to 100 times .
Being able to erase parts of a design and write over them again also offers more exotic possibilities , says Levy .
It could be possible to use the phenomenon to could create hardware that rewires itself as it handles data , he says .
“ It could blur or dissolve the distinction between software and hardware , for example by integrating memory and logic , ” he says .
Jean - Marc Triscone at the University of Geneva has shown that perovskite crystals can also behave as superconductors .
“ The achievements of Levy and co-workers coupled to [ our ] superconductivity [ work ] may allow small electronic circuits to be realised , which would open many interesting possibilities , ” he says .

Myth 1 : Linux is too difficult for ordinary people to use .
Myth 2 : Linux is insecure .
Myth 3 : It is not worth learning Linux because most companies use Windows .
Myth 4 : Businesses can't make money from Linux because it is free .
Myth 5 : Linux is a type of software piracy because it was copied from other operating systems .
Myth 6 : Free software is a kind of socialism and it destroys intellectual property .
Myth 7 : Linux has few application programs .
Myth 8 : Linux has poor support because there is no single company behind it .
Myth 9 : Linux is obsolete .
Myth 10 : Linux cannot survive because it is too fragmented .
Myth 11 : Linux cannot compete in quality .
Myth 12 : Linux has a higher TCO than Microsoft Windows .
Myth 1 : Linux is too difficult for ordinary people to use because it uses only text and requires programming .
The truth : Although Linux was originally designed for those with computer expertise , the situation has changed dramatically in the past several years .
Today it has a highly intuitive GUI ( graphical user interface ) similar to those on the Macintosh and Microsoft Windows and it is as easy to use as those operating systems .
No knowledge of programming is required .
This ease of use is evidenced by the fact that more and more people , including elementary school students and others with no previous computer experience , are starting to use it every day .
Moreover , once people become familiar with Linux , they rarely want to revert to their previous operating system .
In some ways Linux is actually easier to use than Microsoft Windows .
This is in large part because it is little affected by viruses and other malicious code , and system crashes are rare .
Myth 2 : Linux is less secure than Microsoft Windows because the source code is available to anybody .
The truth : Actually , Linux is far more secure ( i.e. , resistant to viruses , worms and other types of malicious code ) than Microsoft Windows .
And this is , in large part , a result of the fact that the source code ( i.e. , the version as originally written by humans using a programming language ) is freely available .
By allowing everyone access to the source code , programmers and security experts all over the world are able to frequently inspect it to find possible security holes , and patches for any holes are then created as quickly as possible ( often within hours ) .
Myth 3 : It is not worth bothering to learn Linux because most companies use Microsoft Windows and thus a knowledge of Windows is desired for most jobs .
The truth :
It is true that most companies still use the various Microsoft Windows operating systems .
However , it is also true that Linux is being used by more and more businesses , government agencies and other organizations .
In fact , the main thing that it preventing its use from growing even faster is the shortage of people who are trained in setting it up and administering it ( e.g. , system engineers and administrators ) .
Moreover , people with Linux skills typically get paid substantially more than people with Windows skills .
Myth 4 : Linux cannot have much of a future because it is free and thus there is no way for businesses to make money from it .
The truth :
This is one of those arguments that sounds good superficially but which is not borne out by the evidence .
The reality is that not only are more and more businesses and other organizations finding out that Linux can help reduce the costs of using computers , but also that more and more companies are likewise discovering that Linux can also be a great way to make money .
For example , Linux is often bundled together with other software , hardware and consulting services .
The most outstanding example is that of IBM , which has invested more than one billion dollars in Linux and is already making substantial profits from it .
Myth 5 : Linux and other free software is a type of software piracy because much of it was copied from other operating systems .
The truth : Linux contains all original source code and definitely does not represent any kind of software piracy .
Rather it is the other way around : much of the most popular commercial software is based on software that was originally developed at the public expense , including at universities such as the University of California at Berkeley ( UCB ) .
Myth 6 : Linux and other free software are a kind of socialism and they destroy the free market and intellectual property .
The truth : No , quite the opposite .
Free software helps prevent software monopolies , which destroy the free market and result in high prices and shoddy quality .
It does this by fostering competition among products and companies based on quality , features and service .
Free software , which is also called open source software , is software that is free both in a monetary sense ( i.e. , it can be obtained by anyone at no cost ) and with regard to use ( i.e. , it is permitted to be used by anyone for any purpose , including modifying , copying and distributing ) .
Interestingly , some of the harshest critics of free software actually incorporate it into some of their products .
Myth 7 : There are few application programs available for Linux .
The truth : Actually , there thousands of application programs already available for Linux and the number continues to increase .
Also , the quality of these applications is typically as good as , and often better than , their commercial counterparts , and most of them are free .
Moreover , some of these applications are so popular that versions have been developed for use on Microsoft Windows and other operating systems .
For examples , see Best Open Source Applications for Microsoft Windows .
Myth 8 : Linux has poor support because there is no single company behind it , but rather just a bunch of hackers and amateurs .
The truth : Quite the opposite : Linux has excellent support , often much better and faster than that for commercial software .
There is a great deal of information available on the Internet and questions posted to newsgroups are typically answered within a few hours .
Moreover , this support is free and there are no costly service contracts required .
Commercial support is also available , if desired , from major computer companies such as Red Hat , Novell , IBM and HP .
Also to kept in mind is the fact than many users find that less support is required than for other operating systems because Linux has relatively few bugs ( i.e. , errors in the way it was written ) and is highly resistant to viruses and other malicious code .
Myth 9 : Linux is obsolete because it is mainly just a clone of an operating system that was developed more than 30 years ago .
The truth :
It is true that Linux is based on UNIX , which was developed in 1969 .
However , UNIX and its descendants ( referred to as Unix - like operating systems ) are regarded by many computer experts as the best ( e.g. , the most robust and the most flexible ) operating systems ever developed .
They have survived more than 30 years of rigorous testing and incremental improvement by the world 's foremost computer scientists , whereas other operating systems do not survive for more than a few years , usually because of some combination of technical inferiority and planned obsolescence .
Myth 10 : Linux will have a hard time surviving in the long run because it has become fragmented into too many different versions .
The truth :
It is a fact that there are numerous distributions ( i.e. , versions ) of Linux that have been developed by various companies , organizations and individuals .
However , there is little true fragmentation of Linux into incompatible systems , in large part because all of these versions use the same basic kernels , commands and application programs .
Rather , Linux is just an extremely flexible operating system that can be configured as desired by vendors and users according to the intended applications , users ' preferences , etc .
In fact , the various Microsoft Windows operating systems ( e.g. , Windows 95 , ME , NT , CE , 2000 , XP and Longhorn ) , although they superficially resemble each other , are more fragmented than Linux .
Moreover , each of these systems is fragmented into various versions and then further changed by various service packs ( i.e. , patches which are supplied to users to correct various bugs and security holes ) .
Myth 11 : Linux and other free software cannot compete with commercial software in terms of quality because it is developed by an assorted collection of hackers and amateurs rather than the professional programmers employed by large corporations .
The truth : Almost all software , including that at large corporations , is created at least in part by people who might have beards and look slightly unconventional .
However , Linux and other free software has been created and refined by some of the most talented programmers in the world .
Moreover , programmers from the of the largest corporations , including IBM and HP , have , and continue to , contribute to it .
For more information , see Incentives to Develop Free Software .
Myth 12 : Linux is free at the start , but the total cost of ownership ( TCO ) is higher than for Microsoft Windows .
This has been demonstrated by various studies .
The truth : A major reason ( but not the only one ) for Linux 's rapid growth around the world is that its TCO is substantially lower than that for commercial software .
This has been demonstrated time and time again .
Reasons that it is lower include not only ( 1 ) the fact that it is free but also that ( 2 ) it is more reliable and robust ( i.e. , rarely crashes or causes data loss ) , ( 3 ) support can be very inexpensive ( although costly service contracts are available ) , ( 4 ) it can operate on older hardware and reduce the need for buying new hardware , ( 5 ) there are no forced upgrades and ( 6 ) no tedious and costly license compliance monitoring is required .
The only studies that show that Linux 's TCO is higher are those sponsored by Microsoft .
A major reason provided for the supposedly higher TCO of Linux is that Linux system administrators are more expensive to hire than persons with expertise in Microsoft products .
Although this is generally true , it overlooks the fact that Linux systems administrators are usually much more productive because there are relatively few viruses to deal with , security patches to install , system crashes to cope with and licensing issues to contend with .

How long do you think you 'll be able to get away with this game , hon ?
It 's astounding to watch you defending your virtue with one hand - and grabbing as much pork as possible for your state with the other .
As Mark Karlin puts it , it 's like foreclosing on a bakery and demanding a free cake .
We need to stop this kind of hypocritical grandstanding .
Here 's a good idea , via The Political Carnival :
UPDATE : Thanks to reader Kimmo for pointing out that we ( as in our source ) had gotten both the designer ’s and the product name wrong .
Thanks ,
AdAge , for the always - reliable information …
Is it possible to create a plastic bottle that is n’t just a despicable hallmark of human wastefulness ?
According to Finish designer Stefan Lindfors , yes .
Linfoss has created PLUP , a donut - shaped plastic bottle that not only revolutionizes the aesthetics of beverage manufacturing , but also solves some of the industry ’s largest functional and environmental problems .
One of the biggest shortcomings of traditional bottles is that they ca n’t be stacked .
Which means they take up too much space to store , they tip over on the table , and they ’re a nightmare to transport .
With PLUP , a waiter can put several bottles on a stick and take them to the table , and you can use the string that comes with the product to attach it to your belt when you go for a run on a hot day or just roam around town .
I think it ’s very important that you do n’t have too much knowledge of the industry as a designer , because it prevents you from flying high enough .
If you do have a lot of knowledge , you have to have the ability to let go of it in the creative process .
But here ’s the best part : PLUP is made of a modified PET polymer , which is not only highly recyclable , but also extremely durable , making the bottle as reusable as your average Nalgene , but without the carcinogenic connotations .
At the same time , the design — pure aesthetic brilliance — is “ cool ” enough to actually encourage such reuse , transforming the bottle from a functional aid into a lifestyle accessory .
Okay , we lied :
The real best part is that in every country where PLUP is distributed , a major share of the profits from each bottle sold goes to a charity fighting a major local environmental problem .
( In Finland , for instance , donations go towards cleaning up the Blatic Sea , which is the world ’s most polluted natural water resource . )
See the interview with Stefan and watch as PLUP transforms the packaging industry ’s sorest spot .

LANCASTER , California ( CNN ) --
The sound of pounding hooves thunders in the high desert air .
A cloud of dust marks the trail of a herd of wild horses as they race across the arid plain .
This is Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue , a shelter for wild mustangs and unwanted horses near Lancaster , California .
Jill Starr , president of Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue , vows to do right by the horses : " I will take care of them . "
Lifesavers President Jill
Starr says she and other shelter operators are witnessing an equine crisis .
" People have lost their homes , their jobs , their hope , " she said .
" And they are giving up their animals . "
" We 've had horses come onto the property in a horse trailer , unannounced , and just offloaded and [ owners ] ask us , beg us , if we could take these skinny horses , " she said .
Starr says she has taken in so many unwanted horses in the past year that her resources are stretched to the breaking point .
Watch rescue center that cares for horses »
" All of a sudden it 's like somebody flipped a switch and people started bringing back the horses they adopted from us , " she said .
" There are no hard numbers on this , " said Michael Markarian of the Humane Society of the United States .
" The states do n't seem to be keeping numbers .
The economy has been hard on everybody , and animals are no exception . "
Shannon Bonfanti is a case in point .
A freelance fashion industry worker , Bonfanti says that jobs have dried up , and so has her income .
" When I was working I was able to take care of all the expenses , " she said .
But she has since decided to sell three of the six horses in her stable -- to save her family as much as $ 800 a month .
" How do you sell your kids ? " a tearful Bonfanti asked .
So far , Bonfanti has found no buyers .
Not even for Hunni , a horse that has won trophies and ribbons in national riding competitions .
" I 'm willing to take almost any offer , " Bonfanti said .
" I know my trainer would say I 'm crazy .
' You can't give that horse away .
She is valuable . ' "
Bonfanti even considered the county animal shelter as a possible solution .
" I had contacted a few people , " she said .
" And the factor that there is the possibility that a horse could be put down made me look further . "
Last year , the Los Angeles County shelter took in 188 abandoned or abused horses -- up 600 percent from the previous year .
Veterinarian David Byerly says the numbers are even worse this year .
" It has not leveled off in any way , " Byerly said .
" It just keeps going up . "
Byerly says that for the first time , the county has had to euthanize abandoned horses because its facilities are full .
Horses considered likely adoption candidates are spared .
Even so , the Los Angeles County animal shelter is killing abandoned horses at a rate of three or four a week .
That is not a fate that James Gulledge wants for his horse , Rico .
Gulledge says he first met Rico at the Lifesavers shelter .
" I was volunteering over there and just fell in love with him , " he said .
But now the economy is forcing some hard choices .
" I 'm very conflicted about it , " Gulledge said .
" It 's just a decision about paying for him or having some money to help some important people make it through all this . "
Gulledge chose to return Rico to Lifesavers .
For Starr , the horse is one more mouth to feed , and she intends to .
" I 'm hoping that this is the worst of this , that we are going to climb out of this pretty soon , " she said .
In the meantime , she said , " I will take care of them and wo n't let anything bad happen to them .
...
They 're basically family members . "

You can remember many names when you use the right memory technique .
Remembering people 's names needs a slightly different approach from all the others explained so far in this section .
The techniques used , though , are quite simple .
You 'll find these tools helpful :
Using the Tools
1. Face Association
Examine a person 's face discreetly when you are introduced .
Try to find an unusual feature , whether ears , hairline , forehead , eyebrows , eyes , nose , mouth , chin , complexion , etc .

Create an association between that characteristic , the face , and the name in your mind .
The association may be to link the person with someone else you know with the same name .
Alternatively it may be to associate a rhyme or image of the name with the person 's face or defining feature .
2. Repetition
When you are introduced , ask for the person to repeat their name .
Use the name yourself as often as possible ( without overdoing it ! ) .
If it is unusual , ask how it is spelled or where it comes from , and if appropriate , exchange cards .
Keep in mind that the more often you hear and see the name , the more likely it is to sink in .
Also , after you have left that person 's company , review the name in your mind several times .
If you are particularly keen you might decide to write it down and make notes .

Iran has decided to open its infamous Bushehr nuclear reactor to tourists in a public relations effort aimed at quelling disputes about the nature of its nuclear program .
Iranian television reports said Monday that the reactor would open to the public during the Persian New Year holiday .
" Iran is ready to greet tourists interested in visiting its first nuclear reactor in Bushehr during the Persian New Year vacation , " said Ali-Raza Dajbend , a clerk at the country 's Tourism Ministry .
He said the program was aimed at " stressing the peaceful nature of Tehran 's nuclear activity . "
The Nurouz , or Persian New Year , occurs on March 21 and marks the first day of spring .
Just two weeks ago Iran held its first experiment in activating the reactor at Bushehr , built with Russian assistance over a decade ago .
The US opposed its activation until settlements were reached with Russia over remnants of its nuclear fuel .
Foreign powers remain wary of Iran 's uranium enrichment at its underground facility in Natanz .
Western nations fear the enrichment could lead to the development of a bomb .
Tehran has continuously denied allegations that its nuclear program is meant for anything other than civilian use , such as production of electricity .

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
Credit card late payments hit a record high in January , according to a report released Feb. 4 , as the recession continues to take its toll on consumers .
The Fitch Ratings report paints a bleak picture of credit card delinquencies .
It projects that charge - offs will breach the 8 percent mark in coming months and approach 9 percent during the second half of 2009 .
Charge - offs occur when credit card lenders give up on collecting a debt and charge it off their accounts .
“ U.S.consumers continue to struggle in the face of mounting pressures on multiple fronts , from employment to housing to net worth , ” said Fitch Managing Director Michael Dean .
Fitch watches credit card delinquency and charge - off rates for the purpose of rating the asset - backed securities that credit card issuers assemble and sell .
Late - pay and charge - off rates were not evenly spread out .
The charge - off rate for prime general purpose cards , for example , rose about a half point to 7.50 percent .
But retail card charge - offs hit 10.51 percent , 44 percent higher than a year ago .

JERUSALEM , March 25 ( Xinhua ) -- Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) had tested Anthrax vaccine on soldiers in the early 1990s during secret research project without disclosing full details , according to a report published on Wednesday .
The report of the experiments was approved for publication Wednesday evening by Israeli High Court of Justice , following a three - month legal battle , Ha'aretz said on its website .
IDF 's Medical Corps and the Nes Tziona Biological Institute held the experiment , nicknamed " Omer 2 , " during the first part of the 1990s that included 716 IDF soldiers from a pool of some 4,000 .
The test was aimed at determining the efficacy of an Anthrax vaccine , said the report .
The report alleged that those conducting the experiment failed to inform soldiers about the dangers of the vaccine and possible side effects .
The report also doubts whether the experiment fulfilled any operational purpose , saying that selecting soldiers as the sample group was a violation of ethical principles .
The report was drafted by a special committee of doctors , a legal advisor , and a scientist from the Israeli Weizmann Institute of Science .
What happens when a cable channel ’s programming no longer adequately reflects its name ?
Usually , the channel just holds onto its initials and pretends they do n’t stand for anything , like MTV , which has n’t featured music videos in many years , or AMC , which abandoned its claim to American movie classics the moment it started airing Missing In Action sequels .
It would seem virtually impossible to finesse a name like SCI FI , but the current home of Battlestar Galactica , Ghost Hunters , and Scare Tactics with Tracy Morgan has done it .
Awkwardly .
Beginning on July 7th , the SCI FI Channel will be changed to the phonetically identical but grammatically dubious Syfy Channel as part of a bid to give the 16 - year - old operation a distinct brand identity and the flexibility to wriggle outside its tight science fiction parameters .
In that spirit , it ’s also changed its tagline to “ Imagine Greater , ” all part of a strategy that “ invites both consumers and advertisers into a new era of unlimited imagination , exceptional experiences , and greater entertainment . ”
Taste the excitement :
The new brand broadens perceptions and embraces a wider and more diverse range of imagination - based entertainment including fantasy , paranormal , reality , mystery , action and adventure , as well as science fiction .
It also positions the brand for future growth by creating an ownable trademark that can travel easily with consumers across new media and non-linear digital platforms , new international channels and extend into new business ventures .

Why must we wait another five months ?
We want our imagination - based entertainment now !!!
Do Anxiety & Panic Play a Role in Your Crisis ?
I write a lot about getting rid of stress and anxiety in my blogs , articles and e-books .
In fact eliminating stress and anxiety in crisis is probably the biggest reason that I ’m writing my “ 10 Crucial Steps to SUPERCHARGE Your Life ” e-book .
You see , typically when I take on a new client for wellness coaching , crisis management , or spiritual counseling , many times I find that his or her stress level is so high that they ’re at the point of extreme anxiety .
In fact , many are having panic attacks on a fairly regular basis and DON ’T EVEN KNOW IT !
What does all of this stress & anxiety talk mean for you ?
Well , I ’m glad you asked .
Chances are that you ’re reading this blog because you ’re searching for help with an issue , a problem or a crisis .
That being the case , think of what you ’re reading now as a wake - up call , a WOW moment .
It might be that in the midst of your crisis , you ’re experiencing symptoms of anxiety and panic and DON ’T EVEN REALIZE IT .
Why is this important ?
The truth – stress kills and anxiety and panic can cause some pretty scary and REAL body symptoms .
The last thing a person needs while they ’re trying to work their way out of crisis is to be feeling physically awful and paralyzed by panic attacks and NOT EVEN REALIZE IT .
I ’ve been there , many , many times .
I know what it feels like to have problems or be in personal crisis and also be crippled by gripping anxiety and panic symptoms and NOT EVEN REALIZE IT .
Ok , so here ’s the practical part for you .
It ’s just one question for you .
And it ’s really important that you know the answer .
Because if you know the answer , then the simple knowledge of just knowing , will make your life much simpler for solving the crisis that you ’re dealing with – NO MATTER WHAT YOUR CRISIS MAY BE .
Are You Having Anxiety or Panic Attacks ?
Ok , before you answer the question , make sure that you first check with your physician to make sure that you do n’t have some underlying illness or condition ( since the following can be caused by serious medical conditions as well ) .
If your doctor does n’t find anything , then read through the anxiety symptoms below .
If you answer “ yes ” to at least a couple of them , then chances are , you could be dealing with anxiety and / or panic and NOT LOSING YOUR MIND .
Chest pains or palpitations ?
Muscle pains , tingling , numbness ?
Shortness of breath or smothering sensations ?
Stomach or bowel problems ?
Sweating , insomnia or tiredness ?
Dizziness or feeling faint ?
A spacy , hollow or vibrating feeling in your head ?
Feeling disconnect or like you ’re not real ?
Disturbing or confused thoughts ?
Depression , anger or irritability ?
Feeling alone , isolated or desperate ?
Fears or Phobias like agoraphobia or social phobia ?
You ’ve heard the saying “ Knowledge is power . ”
This is true , but I believe that knowledge is only powerful if you know what to do with that knowledge .
The fact is , many people in crisis are paralyzed by anxiety and panic and DON ’T EVEN REALIZE IT .
If you ’re in crisis mode and experiencing the above panic and anxiety symptoms , there are very effective methods to help these symptoms subside .
Furthermore , just the simple knowledge that you recognize that the above symptoms are due to anxiety and panic will make working your way out of crisis and finding renewal much easier .
There comes a stage in a government 's life when routine assessment concerning competence and managerial efficiency is replaced by questions about sanity .
Reading Michael Wills musing about New Labour 's plans for an enhanced bill of rights with all sorts of social and economic rights as well as defined responsibilities , I had that experience of watching an acquaintance descend into whimpering insanity .
Mr Wills , an admittedly plausible member of the justice team , says that even during this time of unprecedented economic crisis , the government should act " To strengthen communities ' and individuals ' sense of their stake in society by better articulating the responsibilities we owe and the rights we have " ( note the order ) .
Naturally this new charter wo n't challenge the sovereignty of parliament with entrenched rights but instead seek to nudge our society by suggestion .
" Words have power in their own right .
They can move us and mould our society , even though they are not law . "
I do n't know what kind of world Wills lives in , but any sane person would think of ways of consolidating the rights we are supposed to possess and make sure that the system works as it stands before proposing another tier of words in the hope that we all feel better about ourselves .
Actually , I suspect his motives are far from benign .
Putting rights behind responsibilities , which no government has any business defining when responsibility are already defined by law , is a clue to his true design of placing citizens under greater government control .
Wills , like many who defend the Human Rights Act , says the HRA " has put fundamental rights of the individual against the state at the heart of our domestic law " .
Despite its virtues , which actually seem to me to become more meagre as supporters rally to the HRA standard , we can be utterly sure that the HRA does not protect the individual against the state .
I repeat that I have no hidden motives in saying this , no desire to disparage the benefits that the act provides .
It is just that it seems absurd to go on insisting that the HRA offers up - front protection .
For confirmation look no further than the report on the database state commissioned by the excellent Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust , which , incidentally , is very much a friend of the HRA .
Released today , the report makes this point in its executive summary : " A quarter of the public - sector databases reviewed are almost certainly illegal under human rights or data protection law ; they should be scrapped or substantially redesigned .
More than half have significant problems with privacy or effectiveness and could fall foul of a legal challenge . "
This really excellent piece of work by the Foundation for Information Policy Research , led by Professor Ross Anderson , is all that you need to make up your mind about the lunatic expenditure ( £ 16 billion per annum on IT projects ) , the illusory benefits of data sharing and the threat to individuals .
It also claims that fewer than 15 % of databases assessed " are effective , proportionate and necessary with a proper legal basis for privacy intrusions " .
The people who wo n't have a word said against the HRA must surely respond to the revelations in Anderson 's report because this vast system of surveillance has grown up to threaten us all without the slightest impediment being offered by the act .
And why is that ?
Because the HRA requires someone to challenge the state 's actions in a court , and that takes money , energy , time , and a degree of commitment that most ordinary people do not have .
Besides how can one individual – or even a group of highly organised and motivated individuals – take on this vast superstructure of surveillance to prove their rights are being infringed by 25 % of public - sector databases .
The unveiling of the government 's new proposals on rights – which has all the credibility of putting Max Mosley in charge of drafting laws on prostitution – comes on the same day as another important report – this time from parliament 's Joint Committee on Human Rights – which voices serious concerns about the way police are misusing terror laws against legitimate protestors .
The very effective Labour chair of the JCHR , Andrew Dismore , said , " The right to protest is a fundamental democratic right and one that the state and the police have a duty to protect and facilitate .
The state must not impose restrictions unless it is necessary and proportionate , to do so . "
You can not be clearer than that .
The fact is that police have not been remotely troubled by the " guarantees " of the HRA , and of course they will continue to abuse the rights of peaceful protestors , whatever measures the insufferable Straw proposes today .
It really is time for those whose support for the HRA inhibits discussion about how rights and liberty can be secured in reality , and not just on paper , to move from their position of unshakable faith .
The HRA is not some kind of religious truth : its is flawed , and the tinkering of Straw and Wills can do nothing but further harm our liberty .
IT is said to be the most impregnable vault on Earth : built out of granite , sealed behind a 22 - tonne door , located on a US military base and watched over day and night by army units with tanks , heavy artillery and Apache helicopter gunships at their disposal .
Since its construction in 1937 , the treasures locked inside Fort Knox have included the US Declaration of Independence , the Gettysburg Address , three volumes of the Gutenberg Bible and the Magna Carta .
For several prominent investors and at least one senior US congressman , it is not the security of the facility in Kentucky that is a cause of concern : it is the matter of how much gold remains stored there — and who owns it .
They are worried that no independent auditors appear to have had access to the reported $ 137bn ( â‚¬104bn ) stockpile of brick - shaped gold bars in Fort Knox since the era of President Eisenhower .
After the risky trading activities at supposedly safe institutions such as AIG they want to be reassured that the gold reserves are still the exclusive property of the US and have not been used to fund risky transactions .
In other words , they want to be certain that the bullion has not been rendered as valueless as if a real - life Goldfinger had stolen it .
“ It has been several decades since the gold in Fort Knox was independently audited or properly accounted for , ” said Ron Paul , the Texas Congressman and former Republican presidential candidate .
“ The American people deserve to know the truth . ”
Mr Paul has so far attracted 21 co-sponsors for a Bill to conduct an independent audit of the Federal Reserve System — including its claims to Fort Knox gold — but an organisation named the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee ( GATA ) is taking a different approach .
It has hired the Virginia law firm William J Olson to test US president Barack Obama ‘s promise to bring “ an unprecedented level of openness ” to the US government .
Next month it will file several Freedom of Information requests for a full disclosure of US gold ownership and trading activities .
Nuclear
“ We ’re taking the president at his word , ” said Chris Powell , of GATA .
“ If you go online you can find out how to build a nuclear weapon but you wo n’t find any detailed records on central gold reserves . ”
A month after former US president Richard Nixon resigned over the Watergate affair , Congress demanded to inspect the contents of Fort Knox but the trip to Kentucky was dismissed by critics as a photo opportunity .
Three years earlier , Mr Nixon brought an end to the gold standard when France and Switzerland demanded to redeem their dollar holdings for gold amid the soaring cost of the Vietnam War .
Many gold investors suspect that the US has periodically attempted to flood the market with Fort Knox gold to keep prices low and the dollar high — perhaps through international swap agreements with other central banks — but facts remain scarce and the US Treasury denies that any such meddling has gone on for at least the past decade .
Pressure for more openness is mounting after the collapse of the global banking system and renewed interest in a return to the simpler era of the gold standard — a subject that is likely to be raised at the G20 summit next week .
China and Russia are calling for the creation of a new world reserve currency amid fears that the Federal Reserve ’s quantitative easing policy — essentially printing money — might cause hyperinflation , then collapse .
A spokesman for the US Treasury said that US gold holdings were audited every year by the Department of Treasury ’s Office of Inspector General .
He confirmed that although independent auditors oversaw the process they were not given access to the Fort Knox vault .
The website of the US Mint says that the 147.3 million troy ounces of gold in Fort Knox “ is held as an asset of the US ” .
It does not elaborate .

Tricks with Arrays and Hashes
[ Perl tips index ]
[ Subscribe to Perl tips ]
Today 's
Perl tip is about a simple programming concept , but one that 's easy to get wrong : basic operations when dealing with lists of data .
Let 's pretend we wish to find the unique elements in an array .
For example , if we had :
my @array = ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 ) ;
we 'd want to get back :
my @unique = ( 1 , 2 ) ;
Naive solution
This problem is naively solved using a nested loop .
For example :
# This is an AWFUL solution my @array = ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 ) ; my @uniques ; FIND : foreach my $ element ( @array ) { foreach my $ unique ( @uniques ) { if ( $element == $ unique ) { #
This is already in our unique array # so skip to the next element next FIND ; } } #
If we 're here , it 's not yet in our unique array , so add # it .
push @uniques , $ element ; } # Uniques now contains all the unique elements print " @uniques
" ;
While this solution looks correct , and may seem fast when dealing with small lists , it 's extremely slow when working with large lists .
In fact this algorithm has a complexity of O ( n2 ) , which means the time taken increases in proportion to the square of the number of elements .
( See our Perl tip on Big - O notation for more information . )
Hash slices
A better way to find the unique elements in a list is to use a hash , since it guarantees its keys are unique .
To build a hash , we only need to walk through our list once , which gives us an algorithmic complexity of O ( n ) , meaning our time scales in linear proportion to the number of elements we 're processing .
We could use a looping construct to build our hash , but Perl actually provides us with a short - cut , known as a hash slice .
A hash slice allows us to reference multiple keys at once , and looks a little like this :
my %favourite_colour ; # A hash slice still uses curly - braces around the keys , but # an ' @ ' to access multiple keys at once .
@favourite_colour{ qw( Paul Jacinta Sean ) } = qw( Blue Green Red ) ;
We can use the fact that hash keys are unique , as well as the short - cut of using a hash - slice , to very quickly find our unique set :
my @duplicates = ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 2 , 3 , 3 , ) ; my %unique ; # Our hash here has keys , but all its values will be undefined .
#
That 's fine , since we 're only interested in the keys .
@unique{@duplicates} = ( ) ; my @unique_elements = sort keys %unique ; print " @unique_elements
" ; # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Retaining the original order
If we did not sort the results , in the previous example , we might get back the set :
6 3 7 9 2 8 1 4 5
which is not related to the original order of @duplicates .
This is because hashes do not keep any internal ordering .
If it is important that the original ordering is preserved we can use Tie : : IxHash ( covered in our tip about Ordered hashes .
Tie :: IxHash does not come standard with Perl , but can be downloaded from the CPAN .
use Tie :: IxHash ; tie my %unique => ' Tie : : IxHash ' ; my @duplicates = ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 2 , 3 , 3 , ) ; @unique{@duplicates} = ( ) ; my @unique_elements = keys %unique ; print " @unique_elements
" ; # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
This works even if our @duplicates are words :
my @duplicates = qw( e d c b e e e b c a a d e e a b ) ; @unique{@duplicates} = ( ) ; my @unique_elements = keys %unique ; print " @unique_elements
" ; # e d c b a
There 's more than one way to do it ( List : : MoreUtils )
Although hash slices provide us with a very useful way to gain unique values , there 's another , even easier way to achieve the same purpose .
The List :: MoreUtils module ( available from the CPAN ) provides a uniq function which with the same results as our Tie : : IxHash example above :
use List:: MoreUtils qw( uniq ) ; my @duplicates = ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 2 , 3 , 3 , ) ; my @unique_elements = uniq ( @duplicates ) ; print " @unique_elements
" ; # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
The List :: MoreUtils subroutines are not only easier to understand than our hand - rolled code , but since they 're implemented in pure C they should also outperform our home - grown code by a significant margin .

Cross your fingers , then touch a small spherical object such as a dried pea : it feels like you are touching two peas ( Image : Stuart McClymont / Stone )
Read about all the tactile illusions in our special feature
One of the oldest tactile illusions is the Aristotle illusion .
It is easy to perform .
Cross your fingers , then touch a small spherical object such as a dried pea , and it feels like you are touching two peas .
This also works if you touch your nose .
This is an example of what is called “ perceptual disjunction ” .
It arises because your brain has failed to take into account that you have crossed your fingers .
Because the pea ( or nose ) touches the outside of both fingers at the same time – something that rarely happens – your brain interprets it as two separate objects .
A variation on the Aristotle illusion is to cross your fingers , close your eyes and then touch two different objects simultaneously – a piece of Blu Tack and a dried pea , say – one with each fingertip .
You will need someone to guide your fingers onto the objects , and the illusion does n’t always work , but if you ’re lucky your sense of touch will tell you that the objects are the opposite way round from where they actually are .
This is because your brain fails to correct for the fact that your fingers are crossed over .
There ’s also the reverse Aristotle illusion : cross your fingers and touch the inside of a corner of a room or a box .
This time , because the wall is contacting the insides of your fingertips , you should feel one surface , not two .
Some people even experience three . …

Some areas of the Amazonian rainforest may never recover from being stripped of their trees , and could even end up as dry savannah ( Image : Sipa Press / Rex Features )
The Mato Grosso , the most scarred region of the Amazon rainforest , is teetering on a deforestation “ tipping point “ , and may soon be on a one - way route to becoming a dry and relatively barren savannah .
Mônica Carneiro Alves Senna and colleagues at the Federal University of Viçosa , Brazil , used computer models to simulate how the Amazon would recover from various amounts of deforestation .
Their simulations ranged from a complete wipe - out of the entire forest to a situation where just one fifth of the forest would be removed .
Previous studies have shown that cutting trees has a double effect on the forest ’s recovery .
Fewer trees means less rain – because rainclouds are more likely to form above moist forests .
Advertisement
It also leads to poorer quality soil , as most of the Amazon ’s nutrients come from decaying vegetation , explains Yadvinder Malhi of the University of Oxford .
“ By removing the forest you remove the nutrients , ” he says .
Rain makers
Both of these conditions make it more difficult for trees to grow back , and can change the lush tropical forest to other landscapes , such as a seasonal forest – or even dry savannah .
Senna and colleagues confirmed that getting rid of any amount of trees would reduce the amount of annual rainfall .
With 20 % deforested region , on average , 0.5 mm less rain fell per day than in a fully forested region .
Beyond 40 % of deforestation , the reduction in precipitation was more severe – 1 mm less per day than a fully forested region .
In all cases , rainfall eventually returned to current levels after 50 years , but the forest did not return to its original state .
In their models , the researchers did not assume that the forest would be left alone after a certain level of deforestation was reached .
Instead , clearing activities continued at current rates and planned road projects were carried out .
The point of the study was to see if there were any critical “ tipping points ” beyond which the forest could not recover .
Treeless landscape
When Senna and colleagues integrated a loss of soil quality into their models , the change was much more profound .
The Mato Grosso region in the southern Amazon – an area more than twice the size of California – experienced irreversible effects with a relatively small drop in forested regions .
Already , about 17 % of this region ’s forest has been cleared .
When the team simulated 20 % deforestation , Senna found that northern Mato Grosso was not able to recover its forested state even after 50 years .
Instead , it became a dry , bare savannah .
Senna ’s simulation may even be optimistic .
Her modelling does not take into account the effect of climate change , which recent studies have shown could turn the Amazon into a tinderbox , more vulnerable to fires .

U.S. President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner received failing grades for their efforts to revive the economy from participants in the latest Wall Street Journal forecasting survey .
The economists ' assessment stands in stark contrast with Mr. Obama 's popularity with the public , with a recent Wall Street Journal / NBC poll giving him a 60 % approval rating .

In his Thursday column , Kristof describes the plight of an eight - year - old boy named Bakit who blew off his hands picking up a grenade that Kristof suspects was left behind by Bashir ’s forces operating on the Chad side of the border with Sudan .
“ Bakit became , inadvertently , one more casualty of the havoc and brutality that President Bashir has unleashed in Sudan and surrounding countries , ” Kristof wrote .
“ So let ’s applaud the I.C.C. ’s arrest warrant , on behalf of children like Bakit who can ’t . ”
By all accounts , Kristof is a well - meaning journalist who travels to dangerous parts of the world , like Darfur , to report on human rights crimes .
However , he also could be a case study of what ’s wrong with American journalism .
While Kristof writes movingly about atrocities that can be blamed on Third World despots like Bashir , he wo n’t hold U.S. officials to the same standards .
Most notably , Kristof does n’t call for prosecuting former President George W. Bush for war crimes , despite hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have died as a result of Bush ’s illegal invasion of their country .
Many Iraqi children also do n’t have hands – or legs or homes or parents .
But no one in a position of power in American journalism is demanding that former President Bush join President Bashir in the dock at The Hague .
Tortured Commission
As for the unpleasant reality that Bush and his top aides authorized torture of “ war on terror ” detainees , Kristof suggests only a Republican - dominated commission , including people with close ties to the Bush Family and to Bush ’s first national security adviser Condoleezza Rice .
“ It could be co-chaired by Brent Scowcroft and John McCain , with its conclusions written by Philip Zelikow , a former aide to Condoleezza Rice who wrote the best - selling report of the 9/11 commission , ” Kristof wrote in a Jan. 29 column entitled “ Putting Torture Behind Us . ”
“ If the three most prominent members were all Republicans , no one on the Right could denounce it as a witch hunt — and its criticisms would have far more credibility , ” Kristof wrote .
“ Democrats might begrudge the heavy Republican presence on such a commission , but surely any panel is better than where we ’re headed : which is no investigation at all .
…
“ My bet , based on my conversations with military and intelligence experts , is that such a commission would issue a stinging repudiation of torture that no one could lightly dismiss . ”
In an earlier formulation of this plan , Kristof suggested that the truth commission be run , in part , by Bush ’s first Secretary of State Colin Powell .
One of the obvious problems with Kristof ’s timid proposal is that Rice and Powell were among the senior Bush officials who allegedly sat in on meetings of the Principals Committee that choreographed the abuse and torture of specific detainees .
Zelikow remained a close associate of Rice even after she replaced Powell as Secretary of State .
And Scowcroft was President George H.W. Bush ’s national security adviser and one of Rice ’s key mentors .
It ’s also not true that any investigation is always better than no investigation .
I have witnessed cover - up investigations that not only failed to get anywhere near the truth but tried to discredit and destroy whistleblowers who came forward with important evidence .
[ For examples , see Secrecy & Privilege . ]
In other words , bogus and self - interested investigations can advance bogus and self - interested history , which only emboldens corrupt officials to commit similar crimes again .
No Other Context Kristof ’s vision of having President Bush ’s friends , allies and even co-conspirators handle the investigation of Bush ’s crimes would be considered laughable if placed in any other context .
But Kristof ’s cockeyed scheme passes almost as conventional wisdom in today ’s Washington .
On Wednesday , the Washington Post assigned its satirical writer , Dana Milbank , to cover – and mock – Sen.
Patrick Leahy ’s Judiciary Committee hearing on his own plan for a truth commission to examine Bush - era abuses .
Milbank ’s clever article opened with the knee - slapping observation : “ Let ’s be truthful about it .
Things are n’t looking so good for the Truth Commission . ”
The derisive tone of the article also came as no surprise .
Milbank has made a cottage industry out of ridiculing anyone who dares think that President Bush should be held accountable for his crimes .
In 2005 , when the Democrats were in the minority and the Republicans gave Rep. John Conyers only a Capitol Hill basement room for a hearing on the Downing Street Memo ’s disclosures about “ fixed ” intelligence to justify the Iraq War , Milbank ’s column dripped with sarcasm .
“ In the Capitol basement yesterday , long - suffering House Democrats took a trip to the land of make - believe , ” Milbank wrote .
“ They pretended a small conference room was the Judiciary Committee hearing room , draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official . ”
And the insults – especially aimed at Conyers – kept on coming .
The Michigan Democrat “ banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him ‘ Mr. Chairman , ’ ” Milbank wrote snidely .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Mocking the Downing Street Memo . ” ]
Then , last July , Milbank ridiculed a regular House Judiciary Committee hearing on Bush ’s abuses of presidential power .
The column ignored the strong case for believing that Bush had violated a number of international and domestic laws , the U.S. Constitution , and honorable American traditions , like George Washington ’s prohibition against torture .
Instead , it was time to laugh at the peaceniks .
Milbank opened by agreeing with a put - down from Rep. Lamar Smith , R - Texas , calling the session “ an anger management class . ”
Milbank wrote : “ House Democrats had called the session … to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen . ”
Milbank then insulted Rep. Dennis Kucinich , who had introduced impeachment resolutions against Bush , by calling the Ohio Democrat “ diminutive ” and noting that Kucinich ’s wife is “ much taller ” than he is .
What Kucinich ’s height had to do with an issue as serious as abuses of presidential power was never made clear .
What Milbank did make clear , through his derisive tone and repeated insults , was that the Washington Establishment takes none of Bush ’s crimes seriously .
So , Milbank ’s mocking of Leahy ’s latest initiative fits with this pattern of the past eight years – protecting Bush from the “ nut cases ” who think international law and war - crimes tribunals should apply to leaders of big countries as well as small ones .
The pattern of “ American exceptionalism ” also can be seen in Kristof cheering the application of international law against an African tyrant but suggesting that Bush ’s offenses should be handled discreetly by his friends .
Journalist Murray Waas often used the saying , “ all power is proximate . ”
I never quite understood what he meant , but my best guess was that Waas was saying that careerists – whether journalists or from other professions – might have the guts to take on someone far away or who lacked power , while ignoring or excusing similar actions by someone close by with the power to hurt them .
That seems to be especially true about Washington and its current cast of “ respected ” journalists .
They can be very tough on President Bashir but only make excuses for President Bush .

Economic Dirty Bomb Goes Off in New York
With a Whimper , Not a Bang the Old Neighborhood Empties
By Tom Engelhardt
A block from my apartment , on a still largely mom-and - pop , relatively low - slung stretch of Broadway , two spanking new apartment towers rose just as the good times were ending for New York .
As I pass the tower on the west side of Broadway each morning , one of its massive ground - floor windows displays the same eternal message in white letters against a bright red background : " Locate yourself at the center of the fastest expanding portion of the affluent Upper West Side . "
Successive windows assure any potential renter that this retail space ( 10,586 square feet available !
110 feet of frontage ! 30 foot ceilings !
Multiple configurations possible ! ) is conveniently located only " steps from the 96th Street subway station , servicing 11 million riders annually . "
Here 's the catch , though :
That building was completed as 2007 ended and yet , were you to peer through a window into the gloom beyond , you would make out only a cavernous space of concrete , pillars , and pipes .
All those " square feet " and not the slightest evidence that any business is moving in any time soon .
Across Broadway , the same thing is true of the other tower .
That once hopeful paean to an " expanding " and " affluent " neighborhood now seems like a notice from a lost era .
Those signs , already oddly forlorn only months after our world began its full - scale economic meltdown , now seem like messages in a bottle floating in from BC : Before the Collapse .
And it 's not just new buildings having problems either , judging by the increasing number of metal grills and shutters over storefronts in mid-day , all that brown butcher paper covering the insides of windows , or those omnipresent " for rent " and " for lease " signs hawking " retail space " with the names , phone numbers , and websites of real estate agents .
I had n't paid much attention to any of this until , running late one drizzly evening about a month ago , and needing a piece of meat for dinner , I decided to stop at Oppenheimer 's , a butcher shop only three blocks from home .
I had shopped there regularly until a new owner came in some years ago , and then the habit slowly died .
The store still had its awning ( " Oppenheimer , Established 1964 , Prime Meats & Seafood " ) and the same proud boast of " Steaks and Chops Cut to Order , Oven - ready roasts , Fresh - ground meats , Seasonal favorites , " but you could n't miss the " retail space available " sign in the window and , when I put my face to the glass , the shop 's insides had been gutted .
Taken aback , I made my way home and said to my wife , " Did you know that Oppenheimer 's closed down ? "
She replied matter - of - factly , " That was months ago . "
Okay , that 's me , not likely to win an award for awareness of my surroundings .
Still , I soon found myself , notebook in hand , walking the neighborhood and looking .
Really looking .
Now , understand , in New York City , there 's nothing strange about small businesses going down , or buildings going up .
It 's a city that , since birth , has regularly cannibalized itself .
What 's strange in my experience -- a New Yorker born and bred -- is when storefronts , once emptied , are n't quickly repopulated .
Broadway in daylight now seems increasingly like an archeological dig in the making .
Those storefronts with their fading decals ( " Zagat rated " ) and their old signs look , for all the world , like teeth knocked out of a mouth .
In a city in which a section of Broadway was once known as the Great White Way for its profligate use of electricity , and everything normally is aglow at any hour , these dead commercial spaces feel like so many tiny black holes .
Get on the wrong set of streets -- Broadway 's hardly the worst -- and New York can easily seem like a creeping vision of Hell , not as fire but as darkness slowly snuffing out the blaze of life .
A Stroll in the Neighborhood
Let me take you , then , on a little tour of the new face of my neighborhood .
Along the ten blocks closest to my home , the banks ( with one exception ) , the fast food restaurants ( Subway , Dunkin ' Donuts , Blimpie ) , and above all the chain drugstores that crowd onto successive blocks ( Rite Aid , Walgreens , Duane Reade ) still stand .
It 's the small places that seem to be dropping like flies .
So here we go up those subway steps at 96th where a branch of WaMu ( Washington Mutual Bank , placed in receivership by the FDIC in September 2008 and quickly sold to JP Morgan ) stands empty .
Now , start walking up the east side of Broadway , past Citibank on 96th and the Bank of America at the corner of 97th , until you come to little Alpine Sound Electronics , or the shell of it anyway , where I used to buy my cheap , waterproof watches for my daily swim at the Y .
Now it 's gone , though an emphatic " sale , sale , sale , sale , sale " sign over the door is a reminder of its final moments .
Take another sec and check out the other side of the street , where at mid-block a canopy advertising " Moroccan & Indian Home Decoratives Aromatherapy Exotic Gifts " still stands , but with a " Store for Rent " sign in the window and a desolate interior -- a couple of ratty shelves , a single chair , a half - filled black garbage bag , and a broom .
Right beside it is ( or was ) a tiny children 's clothing store .
Its striped awning now sports a gaping hole in its center as if it had been hit by a missile , though its window still says , " Made in New York City enjoyed worldwide ! "
Not so much today .
But let 's not tarry .
Keep going past 98th , by that butchered butcher shop , but do note , next to it , another vacancy , the shell that housed a small wine bar and restaurant , Vinacciolo , that came and went .
Only two long , bare , narrow tables remain on a floor scattered with trash .
Now , we 're almost at 100th , passing those two towers with their unrented frontages and , on the east side of the street , the classic façade of the old Metro movie house , closed to build one tower , and still empty .
The cracked glass of the ticket teller 's booth backed by plywood gives the neighborhood that distinctive Last Picture Show feel .
Just above 100th on the west side of Broadway is the store once occupied by Sterling Optical .
They moved more than two years ago ( I followed them faithfully ) and the metal security grill has remained in place ever since .
Ditto the storefront next to it , empty but for a little hand - lettered sign on the door , " Fedex Please Knock Hard " -- it better be mighty hard ! -- and a tiny " Zagat Rated 2006 Shopping Guide " decal on the window .
Well , you get the idea , if you have n't already experienced the equivalent wherever you live .
At 101st , A & S Art / Framing ( " custom framing and mirrors " ) , a sliver of a store , has closed up shop .
Between 102nd and 103rd , Planet Kids is emptying out .
( " After 18 years we are closing on March 31st ... " )
On 103rd , the Royal Kabab & Curry restaurant has , like the optician , moved on to lower - rent digs without being replaced ; and , on 105th , Tokyo Pop , a Japanese restaurant , all of whose wait staff mysteriously spoke English with French accents , has also disappeared , though its papered - over windows uniquely promise a " Pizzabar " in the Spring .
( I 'm not holding my breath . )
Actually , if you head in just about any direction , the toll is apparent .
Go south on Broadway from 96th , for instance , and you pass the same proliferating patches of emptiness .
At 93rd , the tiny storefront of the all - detective bookstore Murder Ink , which closed on the last day of 2006 ( about the moment when this deepening recession officially began ) remains unoccupied .
Further south , there are slaughtered neighborhood restaurants galore .
Not surprisingly , even in food - mad New York , people are eating out less and our streets , except perhaps on a Saturday night , seem visibly less populated .
Near the corner of 91st , Mary Ann's , a festive Tex - Mex spot , bit the dust ; just before 90th , the upscale seafood restaurant Docks Oyster Bar shut its doors so recently that its red " restaurant " sign is still lit ( " Docks thanks you all for your loyal patronage over the years but this restaurant is now closed " ) ; at the corner of 88th , in the spacious two - floor space that used to house Boulevard ( on whose paper tablecloths my kids and I drew faces with restaurant - provided crayons ) , and then a dizzying succession of restaurants whose names escape me , the bar chairs are carefully stored upside down on the bar and a " For Rent " sign is in the window ; and , on 77th , Ruby Foo's , a giant pan-Asian joint , described by Zagat 's as " Disneyfied , " has shut , too .
Only below 72nd street , where the neighborhood gets noticeably tonier , and the banks ( TD , HSBC , Capital One , Chase , Bank of America ) begin to breed and multiply , and the urban mall stores ( Pottery Barn , Barnes & Noble , The Gap , Bed Bath & Beyond ) proliferate , do the deaths end ( except for a Circuit City branch at the corner of 67th that went down with that bankrupt chain ) .
Here , stores are still clean , well - lighted places , though a remarkable number of them sport signs that say : " save up to 50 % , " " up to 70 % off "
9/11 , The Sequel
Let 's not exaggerate .
New York City is not downtown Elkhart , Indiana -- not yet anyway ( although the other night on Amsterdam Avenue , just east of Broadway , I noted a block of 12 tiny storefronts , nine of which had been emptied ) .
Yes , rents on avenues like Broadway remain sky - high and , these days , getting a bank loan if you 're a small start - up is bloody murder , and the city 's zoos are losing their state funding , the hospitals are getting rid of staff , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is having layoffs , the unemployment rate is rising fast , property values are sinking , mass transit riders are facing fare increases as well as major service cuts , and the Greater New York Orchid Society has canceled its annual show .
Nonetheless , this global financial capital is still surfing the final modest wavelets of the tsunami of money that flowed through its veins in the good times ( some of which continues to head " our " way , thanks to government bailout plans ) .
Still , as you walk past those patches of darkness , a thought almost can't help but form .
For the last seven years , we 've been waiting for 9/11 , The Sequel , to arrive from Afghanistan or some similar place .
The media has regularly featured fantasy scenarios in which Islamic terrorists sneak atomic bombs or " dirty bombs " into cities like New York and set them off .
ABC's Charles Gibson even highlighted such a possibility in a Democratic presidential debate .
( " I want to go to another question ...
The next president of the United States may have to deal with a nuclear attack on an American city .
I 've read a lot about this in recent days .
The best nuclear experts in the world say there 's a 30 percent chance in the next 10 years ... " )
And the Bush administration claimed as one of its great accomplishments the prevention of a repeat of 9/11 .
And yet , in a sense , as on September 11 , 2001 , maybe we were just looking the wrong way .
After all , you might say that an economic dirty bomb did go off in downtown New York and this city ( not to say , the nation and the world ) has been experiencing a second 9/11 ever since , even if in slow motion .
In my neighborhood , back in those fateful September days in 2001 , you could hear the sirens , see the jets streak overhead , catch the acrid smell of the towers and everything chemical in them burning , and like the rest of America , watch those apocalyptic - looking scenes of the towers collapsing in clouds of ash and smoke again and again .
But if the look then was apocalyptic , the damage , however grim , was limited .
This time around there 's no dust , no ash , no acrid smell , no sirens , no jets , and no brave rescuers either .
And yet the effect might , sooner or later , be far more apocalyptic and the lives swallowed up far greater .
This time , of course , the fanatical extremists were homegrown .
Their " caves " were on Wall Street .
They hijacked our economy and did their level best to take down our world .
And they may have come closer than most of us imagine .
Alpine Sound and Oppenheimer , Tokyo Pop and Planet Kids , Docks and Ruby Foo's have all gone down ( and more are surely headed that way ) .
For the people who owned , or ran , or worked in them , unlike the survivors of the original 9/11 , there will be no moving bios in the local papers , no talk of compensation , and no majestic memorials to argue about .
For the perpetrators , who have , at worst , gone home pocketing their millions , there will be no retribution .
No invasions will be launched , no missiles shot into homes or hideouts .
None of them will be pursued to their lairs , or kidnapped off the streets of New York , or from their palatial mansions , or apartments , or estates .
None will be spirited to foreign lands to be imprisoned and tortured .
None will be labeled " enemy combatants . "
Quite the opposite , in 9/11 , The Sequel , the U.S. government is willing to pay many of them and their institutions in the multi-billions for their time and further efforts .
In the second 9/11 , all the pain and torture is in the neighborhood .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Nine in 10 people expect their Internet service providers to offer open and unrestricted access to the Web , a survey showed on Wednesday .
The survey , commissioned by Google , Yahoo and Web telephone company Skype , came as the European Parliament and EU states hold talks on a joint deal to reform the bloc ’s telecoms rules to boost competition .
“ EU lawmakers should make sure that national authorities have the powers they need to act in cases where traffic management by telecommunication companies constitute unnecessary , discriminatory and / or anti-competitive behavior , ” the companies said in a joint statement .
The survey by market researcher Synovate was conducted among 944 consumers in France , Germany and the United Kingdom .
“ Consumers clearly think that they should have access to all legitimate sites and services online .
They do not want their access blocked or limited , ” said Synovate head Nigel Jackson .
He said most Internet users were not aware that their Internet service providers might be restricting access to these services in any way .
One in 10 of those polled in the survey in the UK said they were willing to fork out more for another Internet service provider if their company blocked or limited their service .
The percentage was higher , at 15 percent for German consumers in the poll .
The European Parliament and EU governments have joint say over the telecoms measures which were authored by EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding and include the setting up of a new EU telecoms regulatory body .
Yesterday it emerged that a senior British army officer , Colonel Owen McNally , had been arrested under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly passing classified information to a human rights worker in Afghanistan .
Unnamed sources suggested he had become " close " to the campaigner Rachel Reid .
Here , for the first time , she responds to what she says is a " vicious slur "
According to news reports , Colonel Owen McNally has been flown back to Britain , where he will reportedly be interviewed by military police .
The Ministry of Defence has told media that I was the recipient of these secrets as a researcher for Human Rights Watch .
Whatever the MoD has whispered into the ear of the Sun , Col McNally and I met only twice , both times in a purely professional capacity , both times at the Nato military HQ in Kabul .
Both times we met to talk about civilian casualties from US and Nato air strikes .
What has happened in the last couple of days has been bewildering .
I do not understand how these two meetings might have led the British government to accuse McNally of a serious crime that could lead to a hefty jail sentence , and why my government might want to see my reputation dragged through the mud , when I live in a country where a woman 's reputation can mean her life .
The meetings seemed unexceptional .
A QC retained by Human Rights Watch has confirmed that the kind of information I received is not covered by the Official Secrets Act .
If the ministry had been seriously concerned that one of their officers was leaking information , why leak it to the media ?
Why was my name released to the media by the MoD , with a ( nudge , nudge , wink , wink ) libel that our relationship was " close " ?
They would know exactly what impression they were creating , and presumably decided that my reputation was expendable in order to ensure coverage of their " story " .
Why did journalists from the Sun , the Times and the Mail write this as a story focusing on the MoD 's entirely bogus suggestion that I had some kind of " relationship " with McNally ?
Why is it that my photograph was published ?
Why have journalists not been asking questions about why the MoD has been encouraging them to publish a vicious , false slur about me in order stop me from doing my job for Human Rights Watch in asking for information from the Nato official in charge of monitoring civilian casualties ?
Clancy Chassay reports on the impact of civilian casualties on the Afghan population guardian .co.uk
Living in Afghanistan , where democracy , a free media , freedom of information and freedom of expression are still a faraway dream , I have developed a deep appreciation of the freedoms I grew up believing I had in Britain .
I expect better from my own government and from the British media that I used to be a part of .
I am proud of the work I do in Afghanistan .
I care deeply about civilian casualties , as should the Ministry of Defence .
This is what they should be focusing their energies on , not impugning the reputation of a human rights worker or charging one of their officers for trying to explain to me the precautions that international military forces were taking to avoid killing Afghans .
I talk to Afghans in the south and east of the country where the conflict rages .
They tend not to begin with the horrors of the Taliban and other insurgents .
What they want me to hear first are their stories about the women and children bombed at a wedding party , the Qu'ran that was ripped up by foreign soldiers in a night raid , or the family shot dead in their car because they did n't understand orders in English to stop at a checkpoint .
They are outraged and bewildered by the killings , in particular the air strikes .
By UN estimates , more than 500 civilians were killed in air strikes in Afghanistan last year .
The insurgents may have killed more than 1,000 , but Afghans expect little from the Taliban .
The worst civilian casualty incident of last year took place in Azizabad , in a district called Shindand in the west of Afghanistan .
In August 2008 the US launched a " kill / capture " operation , targeting a mid-ranking Taliban commander .
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission says that at least 76 civilians were killed , 59 of whom were children .
The UN put the civilian death toll above 90 .
Among the many photographs of the dead , one in particular has always stuck in my mind .
It is of a young girl who looks as though she could be sleeping .
But beneath the long lashes of her closed eyes is a line of shrapnel wounds .
She was five years old , and she was called Kubra .
And in that photograph you can glimpse how the last moments of Kubra 's life must have passed .
The US military , whose forces carried out the air strike , was cold and dismissive about the reports of civilian dead .
Initially they denied any casualties , later admitting five to seven civilian deaths .
It was only weeks later , after video evidence emerged that they were forced to investigate again and revised the civilian death toll up to 33 .
Whatever the final figure , the death toll from this incident was shocking .
The subsequent military denials compounded the fury that Afghans already felt about these deaths .
In a letter to US Secretary of Defence Robert Gates on January 15 , Human Rights Watch sharply criticised the Pentagon investigation .
I do n't know what the McNally case is really about .
If I had to guess I would say senior US and UK defence officials are angry about our forensic dissection of the Pentagon 's investigation , which exposed reassurances about US and Nato commitments to avoid further civilian casualties as at least partially hollow .
If the military would hold its people to account for these terrible mistakes then human rights organisations would leave them alone .
In the meantime , they should remember that this has nothing to do with individuals like me , and everything to do with little girls like Kubra .

Wow .
Thanks to all of you who have helped get the word out about the Ruby on Rails Hosting 2009 Survey .
We just passed 900 people and we have about five more days left to hit the 1500 milestone that I set for myself .
If you can spare five minutes to help us reach this goal , we ’d really appreciate it .
Here is a quick sample of the questions that we ’re asking the community .
Where is your source code hosted ?
Which database do you typically use in production ?
which performance monitoring tool do you use ?
How much of your monthly budget is allocated for deployment and hosting expenses ?
So , can Rails scale ? ;)
Do n’t hesitate … we only have a few days left !
For more information , read the original post , Take the Ruby on Rails Hosting in 2009 Survey .
CALGARY , Alberta ( Reuters ) - Environmental groups took the first step on Wednesday to convince a court to charge Canada ’s largest oil sands producer with the deaths of 500 ducks , an incident that brought worldwide attention to the ecological impact of the huge energy resource .
Ecojustice , the Sierra Club and Forest Ethics want Syncrude Canada Ltd charged under the country ’s migratory birds act for the incident last April , in which the ducks were killed when they landed on a toxic tailings pond .
The green groups said they initiated the rare legal move after becoming frustrated with delays by the federal and Alberta governments , which launched investigations last year .
“ We just think it should be prosecuted in a timely manner , especially given that three months from now we ’ll be into migration season and ducks will be flying back , ” Ecojustice lawyer Barry Robinson said .
“ If nothing has changed we could be risking the same thing . ”
Northern Alberta ’s oil sands are the largest deposits of crude oil outside the Middle East , and are seen as an important , safe supply source for the United States .
But development is far more expensive , complicated and has much more environmental impact than conventional oil .
Syncrude mines the tar - laden sands in huge open pits and separates out the heavy crude using hot water and chemicals .
The toxic waste residue gets pumped into the tailings ponds .
The company , a joint venture of Canadian Oil Sands Trust , Imperial Oil Ltd and five other partners , deters birds from the ponds with noise guns that simulate cannon blasts .
Syncrude said a late - winter storm delayed deployment of the sound cannons last April , and the ducks set down on the poisonous body of water .
Deaths of waterfowl at such rates had never happened in three decades of operations , it said .
Under their legal action , Ecojustice and its allies have advised Alberta ’s provincial court in Edmonton of the charge they believe Syncrude should face under the Migratory Birds Convention
Act along with some basic evidence .
The groups will present their evidence at a hearing on February 19 , where they hope a judge will lay a charge , Robinson said .
The maximum penalty is C$ 300,000 ( $ 250,000 ) , he said .
Syncrude spokesman Alain Moore said the company had not seen the documents , so could not comment on the legal matter .
“ But this flock of waterfowl landing and drowning on our tailings pond last spring was an unacceptable incident and everyone in our organization feels horrible that it happened , ” Moore said .
“ There ’s tremendous resolve within Syncrude right now to make the appropriate changes to prevent this from happening again . ”
Last spring , the company took out full - page newspaper advertisements to apologize to Canadians .
But the incident only served to embolden environmental critics , who had already mounted global campaigns to highlight the impact of massive oil sands development on land , air , water and communities .
At the time , more than $ 100 billion of oil sands projects were either being constructed or planned , but oil companies have since delayed numerous plans as oil prices have tumbled .
Syncrude , located north of Fort McMurray , Alberta , is the world ’s largest oil sands producer , capable of pumping as much as 350,000 barrels of synthetic oil a day .
Its other partners are Petro - Canada , ConocoPhillips , Nexen Inc , Nippon Oil Corp unit Mocal Energy Ltd and Murphy Oil Corp .

Though the girl , identified as " S.M. " in court documents , denied to police that he was her manager , by his own account Epps is a new kind of pimp – a web - savvy exploiter who uses sites like myRedBook and Craigslist to broker his women .
" I do n't put girls on the blade , " he wrote an associate in a chat log recovered by police .
" It 's Y2 K pimpin ' . "
" Get some professional , beautiful , elegant , glamor shots , put 'em on these escort websites , and her phone gone slap , " Epps wrote .
Epps ' indictment highlights what experts say is an alarming trend of sexual traffickers using the internet to fill both the supply and demand sides of their business , recruiting troubled teenagers over online chat systems and social networking sites , then renting them out through adult ads on websites .

" We have a bunch of fake MySpace accounts that we go after pimps with , " says Shaun King , an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department 's Juvenile Prostitution unit .
" Pretty quickly , if they get a vibe that you 're open to such things , they 'll draw you in ....
We 've had pimps buy us bus tickets . "
Police and child protection agencies do n't track recruitment sources , so there are no hard figures on the number of child sex - trafficking cases like these .
But there 's broad consensus among law enforcement and child - protection groups that incidents of online recruitment are growing .
" We 're seeing kids who are getting into this stuff that do not match society 's stereotype , " says Ernie Allen , president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , or NCMEC .
" These are not just kids in poor families who have no other options .
We 're seeing kids from the full spectrum of society , and a lot of that is due to recruitment over the internet . "
That does n't mean , Allen and others say , that online recruitment can turn a happy kid into a prostitute by magic .
But the internet is providing pimps with access to a vastly larger pool of troubled minors than they 've had access to before .
Last June , a 14 - year - old Ohio girl ran away with a 30 - year - old Florida pimp named Alan Townsend , after meeting him on the social networking site Urbanchat.com .
According to court records , Townsend used his senior prostitute , 27 - year - old Courtney Shine , to gain the victim 's trust and convince her that a career in modeling awaited if she drove with them to Florida .
Once they were on the road , Townsend let the teenager in on his plans to turn her into a prostitute .
When she protested , he slapped her .
After a tense drive to Orlando , the girl eventually slipped away and called her mother and the police using a borrowed cell phone .
Townsend and Shine pleaded guilty to federal child sex - trafficking charges in
December .
" This happens , and it happens a lot more than people realize , " says Parry Aftab , founder and director of WiredSafety , which advises children on internet risks .
" We do n't want to terrify parents .
But if their kids are at risk , they 're at more risk online . "
A photo from S.M. 's MySpace profile shows her getting a tattoo with Marvin Epps ' street name , shortly before she was caught with the self - described pimp in a prostitution stakeout .
MySpaceEven when children are recruited into a prostitution ring offline , they invariably wind up on the internet , thanks to a crop of websites that run advertisements for erotic services .
Specialty adult sites like myRedBook and Eros.com have popped up in some cases , but the most common online outlet for underage prostitution appears to have been Craigslist , which played a prominent role in at least eight federal child sex - trafficking prosecutions filed in the last 12 months .
Responding to pressure from the NCMEC and the attorneys general of 40 states , Craigslist placed new limits on its adult ads last November .
Among other reforms , the site now charges $ 5 for the formerly free postings , allowing it to collect and store the poster 's credit card number and name , making it available to law enforcement subpoenas in any future criminal investigation .
" Posting volume in our ' erotic services ' category is down 85 - 90 percent " as a result of the measures , says CEO Jim Buckmaster in an e-mail .
" Those ads that remain are much more compliant with our terms of use . "
Nevertheless , a month after the measure was adopted , an underage girl missing from New Jersey turned up in a prostitution post on Craigslist .
Police spotted her nude photo in an ad offering in - call services in Miami , 1,200 miles away from her home .
She was rescued , and her alleged pimp , Ali Hakim , was indicted last month on sex trafficking and related charges .
As pimps get wired , law enforcement is adapting .
Police now routinely obtain search warrants for suspects ' computers , digital cameras and cellphones , and search for their presence on social networking websites .
Sometimes they get lucky .
When federal agents in Detroit located the MySpace profile of suspected Craigslist pimp Dennis " Detroit Slim " Paige , they found his friendslist loaded with links to his alleged prostitutes and his embedded music player cued to a track in which Paige sings about the pleasures of life as a pimp .
Paige 's alleged associate Robert " Motor City Mink " Daniels even had a MySpace page promoting his " escort " service , and a page on the social networking site BlackPlanet.com " looking for girls who want to make money !!!! "
Both pages live on , even after a federal jury convicted
Daniels in October of running a prostitution ring with 90 women , including nine juveniles .
He faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison when he 's sentenced in March .
In December , a task force commissioned by 49 state attorneys general concluded that the danger to kids from online predators is not very high .
WiredSafety 's Aftab worked on the report , which was overseen by Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society .
She stands by the commission 's findings , and says offline dangers to children are still much greater than online threats .
But Aftab adds that children who are already at risk of recruitment into prostitution face increased danger on the web , which offers a megaphone through which kids unwittingly announce their vulnerability to the world .
" They may post sexual images , " she says .
" They may indicate that they 're up for anything .
They may indicate that they 're more mature , and know a lot more things than anybody around them appreciates ....
And like a weak fish broadcasting to a shark , they broadcast their vulnerability to sexual predators , pimps and sexual traffickers . "
A review of S.M. 's MySpace profile , which lists her age as 19 , suggests she fits that description to a T .
When she set up the account last July , the Stockton , California , girl immediately blogged that she was looking for someone to sell her pot and MDMA .
A couple of months later , she shared that she 'd just been arrested on drug possession charges .
" I 'm a lot more hood than you think , " she wrote one of her 1,000 MySpace friends .
Her profile picture shows her smiling sweetly in a composite of four studio head shots that look they 're from a junior high yearbook shoot .
But inside her public photo gallery , she 's seen in a variety of provocative poses , and it's as hard to find a smile as it is clothing .
In early October , Epps friended S.M. and began posting flattering comments about her pictures .
She moved him to the top of her friends lists and joined him in Sacramento .
On Oct. 7 , she began appearing on adult escort websites , with photos , measurements and a menu of sexual services .
A slew of reviews on the escort site myRedBook are all positive .
( The site did not respond to a request for comment . )
The Northern California man who had the misfortune to inherit one of her old cellphone numbers says it never stops ringing .
" People call for this woman off the hook , " says the man .
Epps ' lawyer says she cannot comment on the case .
Like her MySpace profile , S.M.'s ads claim that she 's an adult .
When a federal vice task force working a sting spotted her and Epps outside the Super 8 motel on Oct. 22 , she definitely was n't dressed like a kid .
" She was wearing a tight red shirt , very short miniskirt and 4 - inch , high - heel shoes , " wrote Sacramento Police detective Jeff Morris , in a court affidavit .
But the police were n't fooled .
" The minor had acne which was consistent with a teenager 's acne . "
The police brought her and Epps in for questioning , then released them while the task force continued to investigate .
The girl took a hiatus from the online prostitution sites for a month , then showed up on myRedBook in December with a new cellphone number .
She has since vanished again , and could not be reached for comment .

The strong - arming by RailCorp , which invoked its copyright over timetable data , sparked a furore online and Rees was alerted to the issue over Twitter .
Last week , he promised he would " look into it " .
In a new Twitter message , Rees indicated he would override RailCorp 's decision and force the bureaucracy to meet the mobile software developers and work out a way they can use the timetable data .
" I 've asked [ Transport ] Minister [ David ] Campbell to speak to RailCorp .
They will meet with the app developers to negotiate how to use the info accurately , " Rees wrote .
Campbell this morning confirmed he had " asked RailCorp to meet with these developers and see if they can work together on a way forward " .
While the Victorian and Western Australian governments have had no issues with developers making programs to help commuters check train times , RailCorp has taken a hardline stance , saying the applications were providing " out - of - date " timetables .
The applications use timetable information sourced from the CityRail website but if CityRail updates those timetables , the developer must send out a new version of software for it to remain up - to - date .
Also , since the apps are based on fixed timetable information , they do not account for service delays , although the developers have said they want to add this feature into future versions .
" The Government is committed to providing information to our commuters in a fast and convenient way but we need to make sure it's accurate , " said Campbell .
" The concern is that these applications include timetabled information only , but do not include updates such as trackwork , special event services or service interruptions .
It 's important that our frontline workers do n't cop abuse from people because they are using an iPhone with out - of - date information . "
Nick Maher , who stopped selling his TrainView and TripView applications for the iPhone and other mobiles after RailCorp 's threats , said he had not yet been contacted by RailCorp to arrange a meeting but the news that Rees and Campbell had stepped in was " fantastic " .
" My feeling is that all you really need is a disclaimer on the front of these apps saying that RailCorp does n't take responsibility for the data in it , " Maher said .
" People have common sense and they know that the times in these applications are not endorsed by RailCorp , so they 're not going to hold RailCorp responsible .
They 're going to hold the application 's developers responsible and they 're going to send negative feedback and reviews to the app developers if the times are not accurate - you 'd think it should be self regulating like that . "
Maher said he was hoping to come to an agreement with RailCorp on how he could incorporate service delays and other updates into his applications .
Alvin Singh , who created the Transit Sydney application , said the Premier 's response was " exactly what was needed " .
" From my perspective the data should be open so people like Google and other app developers can develop on other platforms as well - because CityRail can't cover every single platform , " he said .
Google Maps offers transport timetables for Adelaide and Perth , but Google has not yet been able to secure the rights to provide the feature for other cities .
Sydney data may now be easier for Google to obtain following Rees 's instructions .

Cusco , Peru : A Photographic Journey
Editor ’s Note :
This feature includes a combination of photos by Bella Hobbel and Gennaro Salamone .
Cusco was the historic capital of the Inca Empire .
Peruvians continue to proudly point out the remaining aspects of the culture including a durable Inca stone wall .
Even today , Cusco has maintained a level of grandeur .
That and its close proximity to Machu Picchu make Cusco one of the most popular cities for travelers to South American continent .
Follow this photographic journey through the historical capital of the Incas :
Cathedral of Cusco , Peru © Gennaro Salamone
The Plaza de Armas of Cusco is filled with beautiful architecture .
This gathering place is the location of the city ’s cathedral .
As with most Peruvian cities , the influence of the Spanish Empire is visually apparent .
Procession , Cusco © Bella Hobbel
Catholicism has a substantial influence on local culture .
Processions to honor patron saints or Jesus Christ are regular occurrences .
These processions are a great way to observe locals spending time with their families .
Indigenous Textiles and Food Markets © Gennaro Salamone
Indigenous textile markets provide travelers with plenty of warm clothing options for the trip to Machu Picchu .
Together with the textiles , Cusco has a sizable food market with fresh produce , cheeses , and meats .
It ’s also a fun place to observe the haggling between locals .
Architecture , Cusco © Gennaro Salamone
Cusco ’s architecture shows both Incan and Spanish influences .
It is , perhaps , the best place in Peru to view this combination .
A bonus to travelers is viewing the majestic hills around the city along with the stunning blue skies .
Perfect for photographers .
Local Kids , Cusco © Gennaro Salamone
Cusco is filled with local kids trying to pass the day .
It ’s a good idea to spend time observing their joy , as you sit in the Plaza de Armas , trying to avoid overexertion and altitude sickness .

On Chas Freeman ’s withdrawal
As you might expect , I have a few thoughts on Charles Freeman ’s decision to withdraw from consideration as chair of the National Intelligence Committee .
( For Freeman ’s own reaction , see FP‘s The Cable here ; for other reactions , see Glenn Greenwald , Andrew Sullivan , Phil Weiss , and MJ Rosenberg .
First , for all of you out there who may have questioned whether there was a powerful “ Israel lobby , ” or who admitted that it existed but did n’t think it had much influence , or who thought that the real problem was some supposedly all - powerful “ Saudi lobby , ” think again .
Second , this incident does not speak well for Barack Obama ’s principles , or even his political instincts .
It is one thing to pander to various special interest groups while you ’re running for office — everyone expects that sort of thing — but it ’s another thing to let a group of bullies push you around in the first fifty days of your administration .
But as Ben Smith noted in Politico , it ’s entirely consistent with most of Obama ’s behavior on this issue .
The decision to toss Freeman over the side tells the lobby ( and others ) that it does n’t have to worry about Barack getting tough with Netanyahu , or even that he ’s willing to fight hard for his own people .
Although AIPAC has issued a pro forma denial that it had anything to do with it , well - placed friends in Washington have told me that it leaned hard on some key senators behind - the - scenes and is now bragging that Obama is a “ pushover . ”
Bottom line : Caving on Freeman was a blunder that could come back to haunt any subsequent effort to address the deteriorating situation in the region .
Third , and related to my second point , this incident reinforces my suspicion that the Democratic Party is in fact a party of wimps .
I ’m not talking about Congress , which has been in thrall to the lobby for decades , but about the new team in the Executive Branch .
Do n’t they understand that you have to start your term in office by making it clear that people will pay a price if they cross you ?
Barack Obama won an historic election and has a clear mandate for change — and that includes rethinking our failed Middle East policy — and yet he would n’t defend an appointment that did n’t even require Senate confirmation .
Why ?
See point No.1 above .
Of course , it ’s possible that I ’m wrong here , and that Obama ’s team was actually being clever .
Freeman ’s critics had to expend a lot of ammunition to kill a single appointment to what is ultimately not a direct policy - making position , and they undoubtedly ticked off a lot of people by doing so .
When the real policy fights begin — over the actual content of the NIEs , over attacking Iran , and over the peace process itself — they are n’t likely to get much sympathy from DNI Blair and it is least conceivable that Obama will turn to them and say , “ look , I gave you one early on , but now I ’m going to do what ’s right for America . ”
I do n’t really believe that will happen , but I ’ll be delighted if Obama proves me wrong .
Fourth , the worst aspect of the Freeman affair is the likelihood of a chilling effect on discourse in Washington , at precisely the time when we badly need a more open and wide - ranging discussion of our Middle East policy .
As I noted earlier , this was one of the main reasons why the lobby went after Freeman so vehemently ; in an era where more and more people are questioning Israel ’s behavior and questioning the merits of unconditional U.S. support , its hardline defenders felt they simply had to reinforce the de facto ban on honest discourse inside the Beltway .
After forty - plus years of occupation , two wars in Lebanon , and the latest pummeling of Gaza , ( not to mention Ehud Olmert ’s own comparison of Israel with South Africa ) , defenders of the “ special relationship ” ca n’t win on facts and logic anymore .
So they have to rely on raw political muscle and the silencing or marginalization of those with whom they disagree .
In the short term , Freeman ’s fate is intended to send the message that if you want to move up in Washington , you had better make damn sure that nobody even suspects you might be an independent thinker on these issues .
This outcome is bad for everyone , including Israel .
It means that policy debates in the United States will continue to be narrower than in other countries ( including Israel itself ) , public discourse will be equally biased , and a lot of self - censorship will go on .
America ’s Middle East policy will remain stuck in the same familiar rut , and even a well - intentioned individual like George Mitchell wo n’t be able to bring the full weight of our influence to bear .
At a time when Israel badly needs honest advice , nobody in Washington is going to offer it , lest they face the wrath of the same foolish ideologues who targeted Freeman .
The likely result is further erosion in America ’s position in the Middle East , and more troubles for Israel as well .
Yet to those who defended Freeman ’s appointment and challenged the lobby ’s smear campaign , I offer a fifth observation : do not lose heart .
The silver lining in this sorry episode is that it was abundantly clear to everyone what was going on and who was behind it .
In the past , the lobby was able to derail appointments quietly — even pre-emptively — but this fight took place in broad daylight .
And Steve Rosen , one of Freeman ’s chief tormentors , once admitted : “ a lobby is like a night flower .
It thrives in the dark and dies in the sun . ”
Slowly , the light is dawning and the lobby ’s negative influence is becoming more and more apparent , even if relatively few people have the guts to say so out loud .
But history will not be kind to the likes of Charles Schumer , Jonathan Chait , Steve Rosen et al , whose hidebound views are unintentionally undermining both U.S. and Israeli security .
Last but not least , I cannot help but be struck by how little confidence Freeman ’s critics seem to have in Israel itself .
Apparently they believe that a country that recently celebrated its 60th birthday , whose per capita income ranks 29th in the world , that has several hundred nuclear weapons , and a military that is able to inflict more than 1,300 deaths on helpless Palestinians in a couple of weeks without much effort will nonetheless be at risk if someone who has criticized some Israeli policies ( while defending its existence ) were to chair the National Intelligence Council .
The sad truth is that these individuals are deathly afraid of honest discourse here in the United States because deep down , they believe Israel cannot survive if it is n’t umbilically attached to the United States .
The irony is that people like me have more confidence in Israel than they do : I think Israel can survive and prosper if it has a normal relationship with the United States instead of “ special ” one .
Indeed , I think a more normal relationship would be better for both countries .
It appears they are n’t so sure , and that is why they went after Charles Freeman .

A " prolific offender " who was stopped by a police officer , made his getaway in a patrol car , a court heard today .
Robert David Norris left the constable embarrassed after he locked him out of his Volvo and drove off with the blue lights still flashing .
The 28 - year - old from Neath Road , Plasmarl , Swansea , pleaded guilty to taking a vehicle without consent during a hearing at Cardiff magistrates ' court today .

Norris also admitted stealing the officer 's satellite navigation system so he could find his way to the nearest train station after abandoning the patrol car .
He was subsequently sentenced to a total of 84 days in prison .
Paul Hewitt , prosecuting , said Norris was driving along the A470 Manor Way in Cardiff at around 2.30 am on November 22 when he was stopped by PC Liam Buttle of South Wales Police who was concerned at the speed at which he was driving his Vauxhall Corsa .
Mr Hewitt said once Norris was put into the back of the patrol car for questioning , he activated the central locking , leaving PC Buttle unable to get back in .
" He then climbed into the front of the car and drove off with the police lights still flashing , " said Mr Hewitt .
PC Buttle obtained Norris 's details from a passenger in his Corsa .
The court heard the police car was recovered a short distance away soon after it was taken but when PC Buttle checked it over , he noticed the satellite navigation system he bought for it was missing .
Norris , who the prosecutor said had a " substantial record going back ten years , " was not apprehended until Saturday at a house in Swansea .
Mr Hewitt said in police interview , Norris told officers " sorry about the ' sat - nav ' but I had to find my way back to the train station . "

Giles Hayes , defending , said the incident was an " impulsive action . "
" Mr Norris ended up in Cardiff with a friend , " said Mr Hayes .
" They got lost and the officer felt he was travelling too fast .
" Mr Norris panicked and got into the car and drove away .
The vehicle was only driven a short distance and it was secured and left there by Mr Norris .
" There was no damage to the car at all .
The only reason why Mr Norris took the sat nav was because he was in an area of Cardiff he did n't know and had to find his way to the train station . "
Mr Hayes added : " Despite the fact that he is a prolific offender in the past , the most recent conviction for dishonesty was for interfering with a vehicle in September of last year . "
The court heard Norris would lose his employment if he was to be sent to prison .
The magistrates ' chairwoman , Wendy Ashton , told Norris he was going to be locked up because of his extensive criminal record , a failure to respond to " non-custodial penalties " in the past and the seriousness of taking a police car .
For taking the vehicle without consent , Norris was sentenced to 84 days custody and for stealing the satellite navigation system , he was given a concurrent 56 day jail term .
He was also disqualified from driving for six months and ordered to pay compensation of £ 130 to cover the cost of the satellite navigation system .
With such an emphasis on savings these days , it is almost impossible to not be exposed to the savings options that are now available thanks to technology .
Specifically speaking about online savings accounts , this option for savings can be one of the best you can implement into your financial planning .
Here are 5 reasons why you need to have an online savings account :
Bank Interest Rates Not So Good
Check the interest rates with your banking institution and then check around with other local banks .
Chances are good the APY will be really low when compared to online accounts .
Do a search for high - yield savings accounts and you can probably find several with2 % APY and above .
While the interest will not make your filthy rich all on its own , it definitely will earn you more money that you will find at traditional banks .
Automate Your Savings Plan
With an online savings account , you can most likely set up an automatic deposit electronically from any other linked account you have online .
If you anticipate your paydays as every other Friday , you can set you savings account to automatically pull over a deposit each time your paycheck is deposited .
Once you automate your deposits , you no longer have the chance to spend the money before tucking it away .
Plus with the automation , you can essentially set it and forget it .
You do n’t have to try hard to keep up with our savings account , making you more likely to actually save .
Not Too Accessible
When you have a traditional savings or checking account , you can easily access the ATM on both accounts using your debit card .
Not true with an online savings account .
Because you can easily pop over to an ATM to get at your money , you may be more inclined to leave it where it is , earning interest .
Set Up Bill Pay
Many online accounts allow you to pay your bills directly from the site .
While you can do this also with traditional checking accounts , the money you keep in there for monthly expenses does n’t earn as much as your online accounts .
By setting up online bill pay , you can help avoid missed or overdue payments which rack up late fees and interest charges , costing you more money that necessary .
Establish Multiple Accounts
There are some online savings accounts that allow you to set up several accounts under one account number .
You can designate these additional accounts for specific purposes , such as vacation , car purchase , or emergency savings accounts .
You can redirect deposits into each account automatically , giving you more incentive to save more often .
The Russian government is planning to build a new operating system ( if you are fluent , here ’s the original ) , most likely to be derived from Linux , made especially for the country itself as a whole .
This is being done to reduce Russia ’s reliance on foreign license agreements , particularly those of Microsoft it seems .
The OS is expected to be open source and distributed at little or no cost , but it ’s uncertain just how successful this nationwide operating system will be , if indeed it ever comes to fruition .
If it ’s anything like that Chinese Red Flag enforcement fiasco , count me out .
Mac users are largely immune to the world of virus and trojans , but it ’s not uncommon for you to be a Mac user in a LAN sea of Windows PC’s .
The Conficker Virus is Windows only but it ’s garnering a lot of attention , so if you ’re on a Windows LAN at home , work , or school , you may want to check if the Windows machines are vulnerable or infected with Conficker .
You can do this from your immune Mac OS X machine pretty easily with a cool command line utility called nmap .
Here are the steps :
How to Scan Windows Networks for Conficker from Mac OS
1 ) First you need to install the command line tool nmap on Mac , you can download the OS X install package from the official nmap site here .
I recommend downloading the latest beta version to have the most up - to - date scanning scripts .
2 ) Use nmap to search your LAN for vulnerabilities to Conficker by using the following command :
nmap -PN - T4 - p139,445 -n -v --script=smb-check-vulns --script-args safe=1 192.168.0.1-254
Note :
Be sure to substitute the IP range for your LAN , so this may be something other than the IP range above , like 10.1.1.10 - 100
3 ) Examine the output of nmap , you are looking for something like this to tell if you have a problem :
Host script results :
| smb-check - vulns :
| MS08-067 : FIXED
| Conficker : Likely INFECTED
|_ regsvc DoS : VULNERABLE
If you find a Windows PC that is likely infected , you can follow the following two Microsoft knowledge - base articles to help you out : Protection from Conficker for Consumers and Conficker Protection for IT Professionals – we wo n’t cover the details here because this is a Mac site .
Nobody really knows if Conficker is dangerous or not , but we ’ll all likely find out soon as April 1st is some mystery execution date – it could be a joke or the Windows world could explode into calamity , we ’ll see .
You can read more about the nmap Conficker scan script we reference above here .
It ’s worth mentioning that you can install nmap with MacPorts , but the version included in MacPorts is nmap 4.60 and does not contain the script we want to use for this scan , which is why I recommend installing the latest beta version ( as of now , nmap 4.85b5 ) .

The origin of the 140 character limit is the 160 character limit for SMS , which leaves some space for a name in addition to a 140 character message .
There are a series of commands that can only be used via mobile phone that are explained in our glossary .
To get help with any phone - related Twitter questions , visit Twitter ’s extensive FAQ on the subject .
In order to enable updates from your phone , first check with your mobile provider to make sure that you have a plan that allows you to update Twitter via text message at a reasonable cost – some Canadian customers may run into issues here .
US customers can send their Twitter messages to 40404 .
While Twitter does n’t charge , the standard text messaging rates from your provider still apply , so be careful .

How to get more followers
The first quest of a new Twitter user is to add followers who are interested in the same topics as they are .
Once you ’ve exhausted your personal and professional contacts , where do you go from there ?
The way most people take is the one described above , where you search Twitter for your interests and add people based on those interests .
There has been a lot written about this topic and we ’ve included links to some more high - profile articles by Darren Rowse at ProBlogger .
Here are some tips from the pros :
Tweet From the Heart
While keeping in mind that everything you do on Twitter is public , make sure that your tweets are always coming from a place of honesty and transparency .
Put real emotion in your tweets and your followers will stay with you .
If you do n’t treat Twitter as a more personal experience and spam it with sales messages , you will get unfollowed very quickly .
Give Your Followers Value
Answer questions that your followers have if you know the answer .
Share helpful tips for your industry that do n’t have to do with your followers buying your product .
Tell a joke .
Always give your followers something that they can take away from the conversation and use .
They will recommend you to your friends and you will generate tweets that will encourage new people to follow you .
Tweet in Peak Times
Peak times are basically during the day throughout the work week .
If you want to account for time differences in North America , aim for morning to early afternoon .
Tweet Regularly
Tweet often , but only if you have something of value to say .
You should aim for a few tweets a day .
Do not install a bot program to Tweet for you – your followers will figure it out and unfollow you .
If you are taking off for a few days use a service like TweetLater to schedule your tweets .
Leverage your Other Online Properties
If you have something of value to offer online , like a blog or a website , share updates that you make to it or new postings that you have written .
If you do n’t yet have an online profile to speak of , consider building a blog or website so that you can offer your followers more value .
If you complete a new website for a client , share it with your followers to get some great real time feedback and make them feel like they are part of the process .
Create a Custom Profile Page Background
This tells your potential followers that you care about your Twitter presence and will probably be a good person to follow .
Give Out Free Stuff
Sitepoint grew their followers by 10,000 in a week .
All they did was give away a free e-book that was usually only for sale as a paper book to anyone who followed them on Twitter or gave them their e-mail address .
Obey the Law of Reciprocity
Retweet other user ’s tweets when you think they are relevant or you can help them out .
Do unto others as you would have done to you and you ’ll be a valued member of the community .

5 Tips to Grow Your Twitter Presence

Twitter History
Twitter was founded in San Francisco in 2006 by Jack Dorsey , Noah Glass , Biz Stone , and Evan Williams .
The four were participants in an R&D project with Odeo , a podcasting company .
In October of 2006 the company was purchased by the senior management and the company Obvious was started by former Odeo employees to operate Odeo and Twitter .
Twitter rapidly gained popularity until April 2007 , when Obvious spun the company off into Twitter , Inc .
Since then the question has been how Twitter will make money .
Founder Evan Williams is “ encouraged by ” the fact that there is a lot of commercial use of the service already , some of which they may be able to charge for .
He also states in the interview linked below with Charlie Rose that they have n’t really figured out how to monetize Twitter yet , but the service wo n’t die because there is no immediate way to monetize .
There is too much interest in Twitter .
Twitter did start experimenting with text advertising as of March 2009 , according to Techcrunch .
Twitter Etiquette
Remember that Twitter is Public
The first rule of Twitter is that it is more permanent than the internet .
When you post something , at least one person is going to read it and have a memory of that event .
Unless you lock your profile , all of your tweets are public record and searchable , forever .
While Twitter is all about honesty and just being yourself , you have to act like you are writing something that your parents will eventually read .
Read this story if you think your direct messages are safe from prying eyes .
Avoid Banal Food Updates
Unless you narrowly avoided death by eating a puffer fish , nobody really wants to know about what you are eating today .
If you ate at a cool restaurant and want to recommend it , that is fine .
Dissecting what you had for lunch if you just went to McDonalds is not .
Just ask yourself if this is interesting to your followers – if the answer is “ yes ” , then it ’s OK to tweet .
Tweet Accomplishments Sparingly
If you went live with a new site or posted an article on a blog , that is exactly what Twitter is for .
If you have over twenty new posts a day on your site , tweet only the more interesting ones .
Tweet Really Interesting Stuff Only
If you read an article that completely rocks your world , tweet it .
If articles are rocking your world a number of times a day , pick only the few that rock your world the most .
Do n’t Tweet Confidential Stuff
Tell someone that you ’ll go “ off - Twitter ” if you need to talk about something that you do n’t want the world to know about .
Remember that your tweets are searchable unless you have locked your account .
Even then , it is n’t a good idea as we all know privacy is never guaranteed online .
Snip Your URL’s
Use any one of the URL snipping services out there , like TinyURL , to shorten your links to something manageable .
Most Twitter users snip their URL ’s regardless of their size just to keep them readable .
You can also set up many of the Twitter clients available to automatically snip any URL that is entered .
Profanity
Just do n’t .
If you absolutely have to swear in the context of what you are saying , use $ # % % characters instead of the swear word .
Twitter is not an IM Client
The basic idea behind Twitter is to produce occasional status updates , not hold personal conversations .
Conversations with more than one person are exactly what Twitter is for and these should be encouraged , but if it is obvious that there is only one other participant take it off - Twitter to an IM client .
Try Not To Use Abbreviations
IM contractions like 4 U and the like are best left to IM ’s , although most people still use them .
For personal tweets , they ’re OK .
In business tweets , they are best left out .
Automatic Direct Messages
If you are going to use a service like TweetLater to send automatic direct messages to people who sign up to follow you , keep it short and not sales related .
If people like what they see of you on Twitter , they will go to your website and read up on you there .
Twitter is for relating , not for selling .
Unless you are woot.com – they seem to have broken the mold on that one .
They do it with a very specific business model , one that does n’t use sales language or any of the standard spam methods .
Twitter Glossary
Twitter has started posting definitions of common Twitter terms on your profile page , beneath your picture .
Note :
If a term is classed as a “ phone command ” , it will only work from your phone .
Your web tweets will go on functioning the same way .
For anything that is n’t on this list , you can go to Twittonary.com , type your term in , and get a definition instantly .
# sign
The hash sign is used to mark a word as a keyword , which denotes a “ hashtag ” .
More on hashtags further down the list .
@ reply
The @ sign is used to indicate that you are replying to a specific username .
For example , if DickCheney tweets a question about font tags , you will reply with @reply DickCheney “ nobody uses font tags anymore , try CSS ” or something of the sort .
Remember that when you use @reply it is visible to everyone – for private communications use a direct message .
140 character limit
Twitter messages are meant to be short .
Most people do n’t even go up to the 140 character limit when posting a tweet .
This is the reason for utilities like URL snippers , which we ’ll get to .
Block
The act of blocking a particular user name from following your tweets .
You block someone by clicking on their profile and choosing “ Block ” on the right sidebar .
d USERNAME
Updating Tweets from a Mobile Device :
You can send tweets from any mobile device using text messaging .
Text “ d YOURUSERNAME ” and your tweet and send it to 40404 , Twitter ’s text message number .
Direct Messages
Direct Messages are sent from twitter by entering d RECIPIENTUSERNAME Text of Message .
DM
This stands for direct message , which is the Twitter equivalent to e-mail .
You may only send direct messages to those following you .
To do so , click on “ Direct Message ” on their profile and type out your message , again only up to 140 characters .
Automatic direct messages can be set up to thank someone for following you using a free service such as TweetLater .
Keep in mind that you cannot send Direct Messages to people that are not following you , even if you are following them .
This is Twitter ’s built - in spam protection .

In a recent column about a UC Davis freshman who shot himself , I included a statistic from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention : Boys commit 86 percent of all adolescent suicides .
Eighty - six percent .
The number floored me , particularly as the mother of a son .
Yet not a single e-mail , phone call or letter about the column mentioned the striking statistic .
It occurred to me that if 86 percent of adolescent suicides were girls , there would be a national commission to find out why .
There 'd be front - page stories and Oprah shows and nonprofit foundations throwing money at sociologists and psychologists to study female self - destruction .
My feminist sisters and I would be asking , rightly , " What 's wrong with a culture that drives girls , much more than boys , to take their own lives ? "
So why are n't we asking what 's wrong with a culture that drives boys , much more than girls , to take their own lives ?
Even in academia , where you can find studies on the most obscure topics , there is little research explaining why boys are disproportionately killing themselves .
The Center for Adolescence at Stanford , a nationally recognized clearinghouse on teen behavior , has no one on its long roster of experts who can speak on the topic .
Neither does the American Association of Suicidology , an organization dedicated to suicide prevention since 1968 .
" As much as I would love to lead the charge ( in finding out why boys kill themselves ) , try to go out and get funding for it , " said Lanny Berman , the executive director of the association .
He is frustrated that funders are n't interested in studying boys and men .
" If there is no research money available , no academician is going to go that route , " he said .
" As executive director , I have to pay attention to fundable projects . "
So the association has an expert on female suicide but none on male suicide , even though suicide is an overwhelmingly male issue well beyond adolescence .
Of the 30,622 Americans of all ages who took their own lives in 2001 , 24,672 were men .
I have been thinking about the people I know who committed suicide .
My grandfather .
My Uncle Tommy .
Two of my of father 's closest friends .
And , most recently , the UC Davis freshman who is my friend 's son .
All men .
I had never noticed .
And it 's not just an American phenomenon .
Worldwide , men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women .
( China is the only country where men and women kill themselves in about equal numbers . )
Some will argue that these statistics do n't tell the whole story and are even misleading .
And to some extent , they would be right .
Girls and women attempt suicide at much higher rates than boys and men .
So there is good reason to be concerned about girls , too .
But most girls and women , fortunately , survive .
They live to tell about it .
They can get counseling and address the problems that made them suicidal .
They survive , in great part , because they choose methods -- taking pills or cutting themselves -- that allow for rescue or a change of heart , methods that often simply fall short of completing the job .
Boys and men tend to use guns or ropes , which result in a much higher " completion rate , " to use the experts ' language .
But to chalk up boys ' high suicide rate simply to a different choice of method is to ignore the reasons they make those choices .
They could , of course , choose methods that are not so immediately lethal .
They do n't , which means they do n't give anyone a chance to help them , and this seems to be the crucial factor in understanding the suicide disparity between males and females .
This is what Berman of the suicidology association found a few years ago when he put together the association 's one report on the topic , thanks to a small grant .
Women are socialized to feel little or no shame about being vulnerable or dependent .
But for men , seeking help suggests weakness and incompetence .
It is antithetical to the traditional male role .
Power and control are critically important to men , dating back surely to the days when a man 's job was to hunt dangerous prey .
In their minds , seeking help means ceding power and control to someone else .
It means allowing themselves to be vulnerable .
I am always surprised -- though I should n't be by now -- at how differently men and women connect with each other , particularly during a time of crisis .
My husband and his friends can spend the whole day together playing golf or watching a ball game and go home without having gleaned any personal information .
A guy can be going through a divorce and his friends might never know .
The topic might never come up , even if the guy is crushed by the split .
Women , or at least the women I know , would return home with the complete history of the relationship , the exact wording , setting and context of the key break - up conversation , the name and credentials of the therapist she 's seeing .
The feminist movement helped us recognize that we needed to be explicit in teaching girls that it was OK to be smart , competitive and independent .
Now we need to be explicit in teaching our boys that it is OK to be vulnerable and to ask for help .
We need to give them the emotional language that does not come naturally to them .
At home and at school , we need to teach boys -- and reinforce for girls -- that the brain needs tending just as the body does , and that when brains get sick , they need doctors to help them heal .
Just as we enlisted fathers to empower their daughters , we need them now to empower their sons .
We mothers can tell our sons to talk about their feelings , to teach them the signs of depression , to say it 's OK to ask for help .
But they learn how to be men from their fathers .
If fathers say openly and repeatedly that acknowledging depression and sadness is not a sign of personal weakness but of superior judgment , if they say that getting help is their obligation as men so they can be good partners and providers , then maybe we have a chance at changing the centuries of hard - wiring that makes boys and men so much more violent than women -- whether toward others or toward themselves .
And maybe more of our sons will live long enough to pass along those lessons to their sons .
As much as it needs to happen , we never expected President Obama to immediately reverse every one of President George W. Bush ’s misguided and dangerous policies on terrorism , prisoners , the rule of law and government secrecy .
Fixing this calamitous mess will take time and care  and Mr. Obama has taken important steps in that direction .
But we did not expect that Mr. Obama , who addressed these issues with such clarity during his campaign , would be sending such confused and mixed signals from the White House .
Some of what the public has heard from the Obama administration on issues like state secrets and detainees sounds a bit too close for comfort to the Bush team ’s benighted ideas .
There are times when the president seems to be making a clean and definitive break .
On his second day in office , he ordered the closing of the prison at Guantánamo Bay and directed his cabinet to formulate new policies on detaining and interrogating people suspected of terrorist acts or of supporting terrorists .
Last week , the administration notified a federal court hearing appeals by Guantánamo inmates that it was dropping Mr. Bush ’s absurd claim that he could declare anyone an “ enemy combatant ” and deprive that prisoner of judicial process .
The administration affirmed its commitment to the laws of war , the Geneva Conventions and long - standing military doctrine .
Leading female MPs are failing to inspire a " lost generation " of young women to become interested in politics , a damning report has revealed .
Girls and young women feel disenchanted with and disengaged from politics , the major study found .
More than 90 years after women won the right to vote , the survey of young females aged up to 25 concludes they are " outside politics " , with many feeling detached from local and national policies and decision - making .
The report , which has been highlighted to mark International Women 's Day by Girlguiding UK , the largest women - only organisation in the country , casts doubt on the ability of high - ranking female politicians to act as credible role models for girls .

Ruth Kelly , who resigned from the Cabinet last year to spend more time with her family , has left the impression that women cannot have both a high - flying career and children , one Guide leader said yesterday .
The study places the blame on a lack of information about how to take part in local and national politics , and the small proportion of female MPs – 19 per cent – in Westminster .
The report , Political Outsiders : We Care , But Will We Vote ? , is published in partnership with the Fawcett Society and the British Youth Council .
Its findings are all the more worrying because it is based on the views of Guides , traditionally more active in volunteering than others in their age group , suggesting disillusionment in the wider public is even greater .
Denise King , the chief executive of Girlguiding UK , said : " This report shows that greater efforts are needed to inspire the next generation of female policy - makers , empowering them to have a real say on issues affecting their daily lives and the communities they live in . "
More than a quarter of girls are put off by a lack of information about how they should take part , while 17 per cent believe it cannot make a difference .
Nearly half of young women say they would like to be more involved in volunteering , but when this comes to local or national politics , the figure drops to 28 per cent .
Domestic violence , gangs and knife crime , bullying and equality at work emerged as the most important issues for young women .
The report calls for a new Youth Green Paper , including a demand for one person under 25 to be on every parliamentary shortlist , and the ability to vote by text message or through social networking sites such as Facebook .

Katherine Rake , the director of the Fawcett Society , said : " The gap between Westminster and the daily lives of today 's young women is rapidly widening into a chasm as young women struggle to see the relevance of national politics . "
Jess Alcroft , 21 , a student at Leeds University and a Guide leader , said : " Ruth Kelly is my MP in Bolton West , and when she resigned to spend more time with her family it put across the perception that women cannot have a high - profile political career if they want a family as well .
" Deep down I really want to be in politics ...
But I get the impression that the majority of male MPs are sitting around just filling in their expenses forms . "
Asked whether she believed Harriet Harman was a good role model , Miss Alcroft said : " Any woman in a high - profile position is a good role model , but there is a sense that you have to hide your femininity to achieve things in politics , and be a person rather than a woman .
I would dispute that , because there are benefits to having a feminine side . "
Theresa
May , the most senior female member ofthe shadow cabinet , said : " Without sustained efforts by politicians from all parties these young women ... will become a lost generation politically , disengaged from the decisions that affect them . "
The Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson , the youngest member of the House of Commons , said : " When I was growing up I too felt that there was a lack of female role models in politics and a lack of young MPs who would champion the issues important to young people and inspire us to be active citizens . "
Harriet Harman
The frontrunner to succeed Gordon Brown , according to bookmakers , is criticised for not being ' feminine ' enough and does not cut through to ordinary young women .
Hazel Blears
The Communities Secretary admits 'we still have a long way to go ' to encourage more women to become involved in politics .
Guides say Blears is recognisable only inside Westminster .
Ruth Kelly
By resigning from the Cabinet to spend more time with her family , she ' left the impression ' that women cannot have both children and a high - flying political career .
International women 's day protest : Calls for official action against domestic violence as thousands march in central London
Thousands of women and children marched in central London yesterday to demonstrate against domestic violence .
The protest , organised by a coalition of women 's groups and volunteers called Million Women Rise , was held to mark International Women 's Day .
An estimated 5,000 women and children – including those who had suffered domestic abuse – gathered in Portman Square .
They then marched to Oxford Street and up Regent Street before arriving at a rally in Waterloo Place .
Ange Jones , one of the organisers , said : " We want the Government to implement a strategy on violence against women and for it to be fully resourced .
We also want the funding and acceptance of women 's services , because they are under threat . "
Sandra Horley , chief executive of Refuge , said : " Abused women and children should not have to depend on charity .
We are talking about the social infrastructure of our nation .
Domestic violence is undermining the social fabric of our country .
This is not only about women ; it is about our children , and about future generations .
And the Government has a duty to ensure that an infrastructure of services is in place and that women and children are given protection . "
Representatives of Million Women Rise have been invited to tomorrow's launch of the Home Office strategy for violence against women .

Would - be buyers are looking , but not yet buying , surveys suggest .
The average price of UK homes rose by 1.9 % in January from December 's figure , according to the Halifax .
However it warned that one month 's figures did not indicate an end to the downward trend in prices , which it says have dropped 17.2 % in the past year .
The average house price has now reached £ 163,966 , according to the Halifax .
Last week , a survey by Nationwide suggested house prices fell by 1.3 % in January , and they said job worries were putting off people buying homes .
Martin Ellis , chief economist at the Halifax , said his bank 's latest survey did not mean the property market had reached a turning point , after last year 's dramatic slump in mortgage lending , completed sales and prices .
" It 's far too early to make any conclusion , " he said .
" The figures are going against the trend and our survey shows that if you compare the last three months to the previous three [ months ] then prices are still down significantly , by about 5 % , " he added .
' Modest rise '
Market experts are still agreed that prices will keep falling this year , probably until the economy stops shrinking , with continued restrictions on credit reducing the number of people taking out mortgages .
However earlier this month , the Bank of England reported that the number of new mortgages approved for home buyers had picked up slightly in December .
House price surveys explained
What are your property plans ?
The 31,000 mortgage approvals were up from 27,000 in November , though they were still the second lowest figure on record .
Estate agents have also been reporting more would - be homebuyers registering with them , though so far these have not yet been converted into a consistent rise in sales .
" The Halifax report is consistent with the recent modest rise in activity as shown in our own surveys , " said Brigid O'Leary , a senior economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( Rics ) .
The Bank of England has been cutting the base rate sharply in recent months in an effort to stave off recession .
It trimmed the rate further on Thursday , from 1.5 % to 1 % .
Different surveys
One explanation for the Halifax survey recording a rise in prices in January , while the Nationwide reported a fall , is that they cover different time periods as well as just their own lending activity .
" We report prices for the full calendar month , while the Nationwide reports sales from the 20th of one month to the 20th of the next , so they may have include some sales that took place at the end of December , " Mr Ellis explained .
When simply comparing the average price in January with the average price a year ago , the Halifax survey suggests that prices are down by 16.8 % from £ 197,243 in January 2008 .
But the lender prefers to compare the average price for the past three months with the average price for the same period a year ago , which produces its current estimate of a 17.2 % annual fall .
All Halifax 's house price data is based on mortgage approvals .

This might be a tad morbid , but that ’s the way it goes sometimes …
A friend recently sent me an email containing a link to a news story about the death of a 1960s musician .
Well , he was probably a musician later in life as well , but was most famous during the ‘ 60s .
I cranked off a reply that was something along these lines : “ Huh .
Wonder how many of the original Woodstock performers are dead now ?
Forty percent ? ”
Turns out the musician in the article had n’t even performed at the festival .
I was mistaken , but still curious about the Woodstock Death Count .
I did some Google searches , and came up with nothing .
Nobody , it seemed , was keeping a running tally .
And so , once again , it ’s been left to me to crunch the numbers .
First it was Deadwood , and now Woodstock .
It ’s a heavy burden I carry , my friends .
Here are the results of my exhaustive research :
DAY ONE Friday , August 15 , 1969
Richie Havens : alive
Swami Satchidananda : dead

The first day has taken the biggest hit , percentage - wise .
There were only nineteen performers , since the festival did n’t start until Friday evening , but almost a third of them have passed through the big beaded curtain in the sky .
Sweetwater alone has three deceased members , and are tied with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band for the most by any band at Woodstock .

57 performers : 44 alive , 13 dead
Death percentage ( Day 2 ) : 23 %
Thirteen performers from the second day are now dead , the biggest number by far .
However , a whopping fifty - seven people took the stage on Saturday .
The Who have lost 50 % of their members , the highest of any band at the festival .
Canned Heat , the Grateful Dead , and the Jefferson Airplane are each down two , as well .
But all seven members of Sly and the Family Stone are still kicking .
And I find that to be fairly amazing , if you want to know the truth .
DAY THREE Sunday , August 17 , 1969
Joe Cocker : alive
Country Joe & The Fish : 5 alive
Country Joe McDonald : alive
Barry “ The Fish ” Melton : alive
Greg “ Duke ” Dewey : alive
Mark Kapner : alive
Doug Metzler : alive
Ten Years After : 4 alive
Alvin Lee : alive
Leo Lyons : alive
Chick Churchill : alive
Ric Lee : alive
The Band : 3 alive , 2 dead
Robbie Robertson : alive
Rick Danko : dead
Levon Helm : alive
Garth Hudson : alive
Richard Manuel : dead
Blood , Sweat , and Tears : 9 alive
David Clayton - Thomas : alive
Bobby Colomby : alive
Jim Fielder : alive
Dick Halligan : alive
Jerry Hyman : alive
Steve Katz : alive
Fred Lipsius : alive
Lew Soloff : alive
Chuck Winfield : alive
Johnny Winter : alive
Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young : 6 alive
David Crosby : alive
Graham Nash : alive
Stephen Stills : alive
Neil Young : alive
Greg Reeves : alive
Dallas Taylor : alive
Paul Butterfield Blues Band : 7 alive , 3 dead
Paul Butterfield : dead
Howard “ Buzzy ” Feiten : alive
Rod Hicks : alive
Ted Harris : alive
Phillip Wilson : dead
Steve Madaio : alive
Keith Johnson : alive
David Sanborn : alive
Trevor Lawrence : alive
Gene Dinwiddie : dead
Sha - Na-Na : 12 alive
Joe Witkin : alive
Jocko Marcellino : alive
Donald “ Donny ” York : alive
Rob Leonard : alive
Alan Cooper : alive
Frederick “ Dennis ” Greene : alive
Dave Garrett : alive
Richard “ Ritchie ” Joffe : alive
Scott Powell : alive
Henry Gross : alive
Bruce Clarke III : alive
Elliot Cahn : alive
Jimi Hendrix : dead
54 performers : 48 alive , 6 dead
Death percentage ( Day 3 ) : 11 %
Sha - Na -Na( ?! ) , Blood , Sweat , and Tears , and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band filled the stage with performers .
Why is it necessary to have a dozen people in your band ?
Does n’t that seem a bit excessive ?
In any case , the death percentage for the final day of Woodstock is probably lower than that of my high school graduating class — even though it included high profile artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Rick Danko .
Nicely done , Day Three !
And that brings us to the answer of my original question :
130 total performers : 105 alive , 25 dead
Total Woodstock death percentage : 19 %
My inner-sensors told me the final number would be much higher ; I would ’ve bet good money the bottom - line would be closer to 35 or 40 percent .
After all , it ’s been four decades since the festival took place , and these are … musicians we ’re talking about .
The fact that only 19 % of Woodstock performers have said “ Goodnight Tokyo ! , ” is a pleasant surprise .
I spent considerable time researching this information , and believe it to be accurate .
However , if you find an error , please let me know and I ’ll fix it .
I will attempt to keep a running tally , as well .
So , check the Big Pie Chart of Death often !

The following article contains several audio excerpts and transcripts from Vivek Kundra ’s first conference call as the newly appointed Federal CIO .
After weeks of speculation it was formally announced today that President Obama has appointed Kundra , who had previously been serving as the CTO for Washington D.C. .
In his previous position , Kundra pushed the boundaries of Information Technology and set the standard for transparency and accountability adopting Google Apps as a collaboration platform , video taping vendor interactions , and instituting a rigorous regime of metrics and accountability for government contracts .
In the following audio excerpts you ’ll hear about Kundra ’s plans to help push Federal IT towards more transparency and accountability .
You ’ll also get a sense that Kundra , through his interaction with the CIO council is going to start unifying the federal government ’s approach to procurement and planning .
In one of Kundra ’s answers , he suggests that President Obama will be announcing another appointment for a CTO position .
This conference call was recorded on Thursday morning , shortly after the Whitehouse published a press release naming Kundra as the newly appointed Federal Chief Information Officer ( CIO ) .
Kundra ’s Introductory Remarks
VK : Good morning , I want to first say how humbled and honored I am to
serve under the Obama administration and for the President in terms of
appointing me as the Federal CIO .
I ’m really excited about the
opportunity to fundamentally look at how we ’re deploying technology in
the federal government and rethinking what we could do in terms of
finding the innnovative path to lower the cost of government
operations [ while ] at the same time looking at how can we
fundamentally change the way the public sector interacts with the
public .
VK : How do we make sure that the government is about “ We the People ”
and that we engage citizens in terms of how their government functions
– holding government officials accountable in terms of making sure
they know where money is going throughout the public sector , ensuring
that we have the ability to run an open , transparent , participatory ,
and collaborative government .
At the same time be mindful that in
these tough economic times when we ’re facing two wars , we ’re looking
at an economic crisis and the energy and healthcare issues that this
country faces .
How can we leverage the power of technology to make
sure that the country is moving in the right direction .
We look at
federal IT spending , the federal government is the largest single
buyer of technology in the world at $ 71 billions dollars annually .
VK : Going through , as the president and director Orszag promised , going
through line item by line item looking at the budget and ensuring that
those resources are spent effectively and that we hold agencies
accountable for how that money is spent is going to be a big part of
my role here , and secondly , I ’m going to be working very closely with
all federal CIOs in terms of the agency level to ensure that they are
advancing an agenda that embraces open government , an agenda that
looks at how we can fundamentally revolutionize technology in the
public sector and reject the view that the public sector has to lag
behind the private sector .
That we need to embrace new technologies
that are going to change the way we serve our constituents and at the
same time ensure that the federal government operates in an efficient
way .
Kundra ’s Role as Federal CIO
VK : So I ’ll be serving in both capacities : both as the Federal CIO and
as the e-gov and IT administration , but in terms of the portfolio …
if you look at some of the innovations that have happened since 2002 ,
it is not just e-government , we also want to focus on how do we look
at the backend system , whether that is in the Department of Defense or
Health and Human Services , and ensure that we ’re having a wholistic
view of [ information technology ] and not just focusing on
e -government .
VK : So , the CTO will be named in due time by the President , but what I can
talk about is my role in terms of the Federal CIO role .
The Federal
CIO role is going to be largely focused on 1 . the operations of the
federal government , looking at the $ 71 billion and ensure that we’re
spending that money effectively , 2 . on driving a transparency and open
government agenda to ensure that the public has access to information ,
the public has access to government and we rethink how the federal
government interacts with the public in an information economy and 3 .
we want to look at the innovative path in terms of leveraging
innovations that are happening whether is it in the private sector or
in the NGO community and applying them to the federal government and
changing the velocity with which we adopt new technologies .
VK : Vivek Kundra on data.gov and the Imperative to Distribute Data
VK : One of the things we want to do is embark on launching data.gov
which would democratize data and give data access to the public and
based on that challenge whether it is citizens , NGOs the private
sector to help us think through how we address some of the toughest
problems in the public sector .
VK : Data.gov will publish data feeds , so we ’ll have a vast array of
data , and the way I like to think about this is that if you think of
two forms of data that have been published in the federal government
that have fundamentally transformed the economy .
One example is the
National Institute of Health working with other world bodies when they
published the Human Genome Project data online .
What that did is it
created an entire revolution in personalized medicine where you ended
up having over 500 drugs that were created and that are in the
pipeline coming into the FDA .
VK : Second , is what happened in the geospatial community when the
defense department decided to release data around satellites you
created this GPS revolution where now you could go to your local car
rental company and get a GPS device or your iPhone and get
directions .
VK : In the same way , in the same spirit , there is a lot of data that
the federal government has and what we need to do is , we need to make
sure that all that data that is not private that is not restricted for
national security reasons can be made public .
And the question we
should be thinking about even when it comes to FOIA is how do we begin
with the default assumption that we put information out in the public
domain then the second question is what needs to be private rather
than the other way around .
Vivek Kundra on the Need to Transform the Government : The Digital Economy
VK : One of the challenges that the government faces is , as we move more
and more information , in terms of published information or whether it
is [ online ] content , out in cyberspace .
What ’s really important is
that , on the back - end , the government is going to need to go through a
transformation to ensure that we have the right resources to be able
to respond to a new economy – to the digital economy .
VK : An example is what Facebook has been able to do in terms of
self - organizing and civic participation .
What they ’ve been able to do
is that they have over 140 million or so users and they ’ve been able
to self - organize on issues , on policy , on problems and create a
movement so that people can be heard .
That ’s one model .
The second
model is the two - way interaction between the federal government and
citizens .
And you are absolutely right on that end , it is going to
require massive transformation on the back - end to ensure that the
government is able to deal with this new reality .
And , frankly ,
those investments have n’t been historically made and that ’s one of the
things we are going to do – is ensure that we look at and rethink the
workforce for the 21st century .
VK : Third is making information available such as data feeds so
applications can be created in a context rich model .
If you look at
government what they ’ve done historically is they ’ve just put up a
website and they ’ll say this is Agency X . Unfortunately , if you look
at the traffic on those websites and you compare that traffic to a
facebook or a craigslist , it just pales in comparison and one of the
things we need to start thinking about is how do we put information in
the right context .
VK : And what I mean by that is , for example , if you look at April 15
or if you look at certain days that matter where the federal
government will “ fire ” certain actions , we need to make sure that the
federal government is putting that information in the right context .
Because , I may care about taxes around April 15th , or I may care
about another issue depending on what time of the day it is .
Government needs to move towards context rich information flows and
engagement .
Kundra on Open Source
VK : I think you look at open source , as a technology , whether it ’s
mediawiki , for example … with Wikipedia what we did in the District
of Columbia was that we had a wikipedia solution that allowed every
single employee to collaborate and have access to information .
I
think there is also a place for specialized software , you look at the
FAA or if you are looking at DHS , there are some mission critical
systems that you ca n’t apply an open source solution to .
We need
to have a very pragmatic , balanced approach in terms of software .
I
would argue that , whether it is open source or proprietary software
one of the biggest ticket items when it comes to information
technology on that $ 71 billion dollars is the money the federal
government spends on contracts and contracts that , frankly , some of
them have n’t performed very well and there have not been consequences .
And , we need to become serious and tough on those contractors that
are not going to deliver .
Eliminating those contracts and making sure
that we have consultants and contractors that are adding value to the
federal government .
Kundra ’s Example : Social Security Data Center
VK : A simple example would be the Social Security Administration that ’s
getting funding to build out a brand new data center and what we want
to make sure is , as the Social Security administration makes that
investment , that it is looked at in a much broader context than [ it
has traditionally received ] which has been in specific silos .
What
that has led to is massive proliferation of infrastructure that is
segmented and not interoperable .
What we want to do is look at the
entire portfolio to ensure that as we make this investment we ’re
looking at them across the federal government and saying , you know
what , if we ’re investing right now to build a whole new data center
how does that play into the larger vision of federal IT and how does
that play into leveraging that investment for other functions beyond
the Social Security Administration .
President Ronald Reagan signs Executive Order 12656 , assigning a wide range of emergency responsibilities to a number of executive departments .
The order calls for establishing emergency procedures that go far beyond the nation ’s standard disaster relief plans .
It offers a rare glimpse of the government ’s plans for maintaining “ continuity of government ” in times of extreme national emergency .
The order declares the national security of the country to be “ dependent upon our ability to assure continuity of government , at every level , in any national security emergency situation , ” which is defined as “ any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological emergency , or other emergency , that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . ”
The order instructs department leaders to establish various protocols for crisis situations , including rules for delegating authorities to emergency officials , establishing emergency operating facilities , protecting and allocating the nation ’s essential resources , and managing terrorist attacks and civil disturbances .
The plans are to be coordinated and managed by the National Security Council and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) .
The presidential order suggests certain laws may have to be altered or expanded to carry out the plans .
Although it encourages federal agencies to base the emergency protocols on “ existing authorities , organizations , resources , and systems , ” it also calls on government leaders to identify “ areas where additional legal authorities may be needed to assist management and , consistent with applicable executive orders , take appropriate measures toward acquiring those authorities . ”
According to the executive order , the plans “ will be designed and developed to provide maximum flexibility to the president . ”
Executive Order 12656 gives specific instructions to numerous federal departments :
The Department of Justice is ordered to coordinate emergency “ domestic law enforcement activities ” and plan for situations “ beyond the capabilities of state and local agencies . ”
The Justice Department is to establish plans for responding to “ civil disturbances ” and “ terrorism incidents ” within the US that “ may result in a national security emergency or that occur during such an emergency . ”
The attorney general is to establish emergency “ plans and procedures for the custody and protection of prisoners and the use of Federal penal and correctional institutions and resources . ”
The Department of Justice is also instructed to develop “ national security emergency plans for regulation of immigration , regulation of nationals of enemy countries , and plans to implement laws for the control of persons entering or leaving the United States . ”
The attorney general is additionally instructed to assist the “ heads of federal departments and agencies , state and local governments , and the private sector in the development of plans to physically protect essential resources and facilities . ”
The Department of Defense , acting through the Army , is to develop “ overall plans for the management , control , and allocation of all usable waters from all sources within the jurisdiction of the United States . ”
The secretary of defense is to arrange , “ through agreements with the heads of other federal departments and agencies , for the transfer of certain federal resources to the jurisdiction and / or operational control of the Department of Defense in national security emergencies . ”
The secretary of defense is also instructed to work with industry , government , and the private sector , to ensure “ reliable capabilities for the rapid increase of defense production . ”
The Department of Commerce is ordered to develop “ control systems for priorities , allocation , production , and distribution of materials and other resources that will be available to support both national defense and essential civilian programs . ”
The secretary of commerce is instructed to cooperate with the secretary of defense to “ perform industry analyses to assess capabilities of the commercial industrial base to support the national defense , and develop policy alternatives to improve the international competitiveness of specific domestic industries and their abilities to meet defense program needs . ”
The Commerce Department is also instructed to develop plans to “ regulate and control exports and imports in national security emergencies . ”
The Department of Agriculture is ordered to create plans to “ provide for the continuation of agricultural production , food processing , storage , and distribution through the wholesale level in national security emergencies , and to provide for the domestic distribution of seed , feed , fertilizer , and farm equipment to agricultural producers . ”
The secretary of agriculture is also instructed to “ assist the secretary of defense in formulating and carrying out plans for stockpiling strategic and critical agricultural materials . ”
The Department of Labor is ordered to develop plans to “ ensure effective use of civilian workforce resources during national security emergencies . ”
The Labor Department is to support “ planning by the secretary of defense and the private sector for the provision of human resources to critical defense industries . ”
The Selective Service System is ordered to develop plans to “ provide by induction , as authorized by law , personnel that would be required by the armed forces during national security emergencies . ”
The agency is also vaguely instructed to establish plans for “ implementing an alternative service program . ”
The Transportation Department is to create emergency plans to manage and control “ civil transportation resources and systems , including privately owned automobiles , urban mass transit , intermodal transportation systems , the National Railroad Passenger Corporation , and the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation . ”
The Transportation Department is also to establish plans for a “ smooth transition ” of the Coast Guard to the Navy during a national security emergency .
The Transportation Department is additionally instructed to establish plans for “ emergency management and control of the National Airspace System , including provision of war risk insurance and for transfer of the Federal Aviation Administration , in the event of war , to the Department of Defense . ”
The Department of the Treasury is ordered to develop plans to “ maintain stable economic conditions and a market economy during national security emergencies . ”
The Treasury Department is to provide for the “ preservation of , and facilitate emergency operations of , public and private financial institution systems , and provide for their restoration during or after national security emergencies . ”
The Department of Energy is to identify “ energy facilities essential to the mobilization , deployment , and sustainment of resources to support the national security and national welfare , and develop energy supply and demand strategies to ensure continued provision of minimum essential services in national security emergencies . ”
The Department of Health and Human Services is instructed to develop programs to “ reduce or eliminate adverse health and mental health effects produced by hazardous agents ( biological , chemical , or radiological ) , and , in coordination with appropriate federal agencies , develop programs to minimize property and environmental damage associated with national security emergencies . ”
The health secretary is also to assist state and local governments in the “ provision of emergency human services , including lodging , feeding , clothing , registration and inquiry , social services , family reunification , and mortuary services and interment . ”

Snapple
Snapple , once the “ official beverage of New York City , ” is being redesigned — inside and out — this year .
The popular iced teas are losing the high - fructose corn syrup and the dated font .
The bottles are becoming more svelte ( to better fit into cup holders , which became a force after Snapple iced teas were originally introduced ) .
The labels will also emphasize the green and black tea leaves used to make the drink .
The changes are rolling out over the first few months of the year , and they are expected to hit New York in early March , according to Dr Pepper Snapple Group , which is now the owner of the brand .
Snapple , which once defined the genre of specialty tea , now finds itself fading in an increasingly crowded field of competitors .
The brand , which passed through many hands before landing as part of Dr Pepper Snapple , went through a round of focus group testing over the last two years .
“ Through that work we really found that Snapple had lost of its luster and had been replaced in the minds of consumers by other beverages out there , ” said Jim Trebilcock , an executive vice president with Dr Pepper Snapple .
( For example , President Obama prefers ( the more lightly sweetened ) Honest Tea , and the White House is now stocked with his favorite flavors , Black Forest Berry and Green Dragon . )
Real sugar is replacing the corn syrup .
( Sugar vs. corn syrup , by the way , is the difference between Mexican and American Coca - Cola . )
In some cases , that has actually resulted in a decrease in calories .
The old ingredient list for Lemon Snapple Iced Tea : “ water , high fructose corn syrup , citric acid , tea , natural flavors . ”
Calories : 200 .
The new ingredient list : “ filtered water , sugar , citric acid , tea , natural flavors . ”
Calories : 160 .
The label is also being refreshed .
Gone is the print - block style sun , the handwritten fonts , and the red highlights .
Instead , they are putting more emphasis on “ All Natural ” and “ Made From Green & Black Tea Leaves . ”
The “ Snapple ” itself is going from a heavy - set typeface to a more elegant serifed typeface .
( Logo redesign seems to be in these days . )
Of course , Snapple ’s origins are rooted in selling juices to health food stores .
Originally , in 1972 , it was a partnership of three men that was named Unadulterated Food Products .
The five - year , $ 166 million “ official beverage ” agreement with New York is scheduled to expire this year , because it failed to live up to its potential , but the drink and the city are still tightly bound .
Not only was the original company founded in Brooklyn Queens in 1972 , but also , about 40 percent of Snapple sales today are concentrated in New York City — arguably the highest concentration of any nationally distributed beverage in the United States .
Mr. Trebilcock said that Dr Pepper had 30 percent of its sales concentrated in five southwestern states , but still that was 30 percent , and across five states .
“ The New York consumer has made Snapple what it is , ” he said .
While on the phone with the Snapple executives , this reporter took the opportunity to lodge a protest about the inability to find Mint Snapple Iced Tea , which apparently was discontinued despite protests and petitions .
( Others are trying to take steps to remedy the absence , too . )
Mint Snapple Iced Tea lovers , your voices have been heard .

Robin Hood and his men were said to be active in England A Scottish expert has uncovered a medieval document suggesting negative attitudes towards Robin Hood .
The story of how Robin and his men stole from the rich to give to the poor has long been part of English folklore .
However , Julian Luxford of St Andrews University found a dissenting voice in a Latin inscription from about 1460 in a manuscript owned by Eton College .
The previously unknown chronicle entry says Robin " infested " parts of England with " continuous robberies " .
Dr Luxford , an expert in medieval manuscript studies , said : " Rather than depicting the traditionally well - liked hero , the article suggests that Robin Hood and his merry men may not actually have been ' loved by the good ' .
" The new find contains a uniquely negative assessment of the outlaw , and provides rare evidence for monastic attitudes towards him . "
The pre-Reformation article is the only English chronicle entry to have been discovered which mentions Robin Hood .
Three Scottish medieval authors are also thought to have set Robin in a chronological context .
Partners - in crime Dr Luxford said : " The new find places Robin Hood in Edward I 's reign , thus supporting the belief that his legend is of 13th Century origin . "
A translation of the short inscription , which contains only 23 words in Latin , reads : " Around this time , according to popular opinion , a certain outlaw named Robin Hood , with his accomplices , infested Sherwood and other law - abiding areas of England with continuous robberies . "
Dr Luxford said , " While Little John is not mentioned here , Robin is assigned partners - in crime .
" And the inscription 's author does at least acknowledge that these men were active elsewhere in England .
" By mentioning Sherwood it buttresses the hitherto rather thin evidence for a medieval connection between Robin and the Nottinghamshire forest with which he has become so closely associated . "
An article on the discovery will be published later this month in the Journal of Medieval History .

Neil McAllister recently wrote a piece on InfoWorld entitled The Case Against Web Apps .
In it , he outlines “ Five reasons why Web - based development might not be the best choice for your enterprise . ”
Obviously , as an employee of a web application services and products company , I disagree strongly with that opinion .
Web applications are not a “ trend ” in enterprise software development .
They represent a fundamental shift in how software is developed , implemented and used in today ’s technological climate .
But to be specific , let ’s go point - by - point through the “ case against web apps . ”
“ It ’s client - server all over again ”
It certainly is .
The difference is , we ’re not living in a mainframe , dumb - terminal world anymore .
Server infrastructure is cheap and scalable , and as more enterprises push their IT infrastructure to the cloud ( see another article from InfoWorld : IT needs to get over its cloud denial , or management will get over IT ) the need for on - site datacenters will shrink and , for many companies , eventually disappear .
Web applications require no client deployment , no versioning , no installation and no machine - by - machine support .
There ’s no massive rollout procedure for a new version and no back - breaking process if there ’s a small but important glitch in a major release .
“ Web UIs are a mess ”
When each project has specific and individual user experience needs , is n’t it good to reinvent the wheel a little bit ?
Having a blank canvas means having the chance to build exactly what is right for this application , not shoehorning an application into pre-defined constraints .
Bad web sites and bad desktop application interfaces are equally impenetrable to the average user .
The success of the user experience lies not in the hands of the chosen deployment platform but in the hands of a developer with an eye for user experience .
I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to posit that the majority of such developers work either on web applications or for Apple .
When was the last time you saw a beautiful Visual Basic application interface ?
“ Browser technologies are too limiting . ”
“ User interface code written in such languages as C++ , Objective C , or Python can often be both more efficient and more maintainable than code written for the Web paradigm . ”
This statement rings false to me ; when was the last time you saw a graphic designer who could pop open his trusty Visual Studio 2008 and recompile a project to tweak the user interface ?
The fundamental advantage of HTML / CSS / Javascript based interface development is that is accessible to a wholly different set of people , people who understand how users think and want to behave but do n’t necessarily have the programming chops to implement the actual code .
The proliferation of Flash , Quicktime , and Silverlight can pretty much all be explained by one fact : HTML does n’t support embedded video .
Few web developers turn to Flash or other technologies for much outside of rich multimedia playing .
You also ca n’t consider such a tool a liability when it is available for more than 99 % of all web users .
This also brings up a fundamental flaw in “ the case against web apps ” : if this is an article talking about using web applications for enterprise business applications , how are any of the concerns about browser compatibility valid ?
Do n’t most enterprises have control over what browsers get used by their employees ?
The refusal of Internet Explorer 6 to kick the bucket certainly seems to indicate that companies have a great deal of control over how employees access the internet .
“ The big vendors call the shots . ”
Is this untrue of any development platform short of Linux ?
Companies are at the whim of Microsoft when they released an in - many - cases incompatible , largely disparaged upgrade to their operating system with Vista .
That ’s much more of a moving target than the web standards , which with the exception of Internet Explorer ( another Microsoft project ) make writing cross - browser , cross-operating system applications a relative ease .
“ Should every employee have a browser ? ”
You know what ?
Lots of people e-mail jokes to their families from their work accounts , let ’s not allow people to write e-mails anymore .
I heard that sometimes people make personal calls from the office , so let ’s get rid of the phones , too .
Not only is this point inherently distrustful of the work ethic and general competency of most employees , it does n’t even hold water : browsers can be used to access internal applications even if all outside internet access is restricted .
In the end , I may have spent too much time here refuting his arguments without making the real case for web applications .
So , very briefly , here ’s it is :
Massively Agile : Web applications can be built , deployed , and put into general use in a matter of weeks , not months or years .
New features can be rolled out on a continuous basis rather than waiting a year for a new “ point release . ”
Massively Accessible : Web applications can be accessed from any device that can access the internet , regardless of operating system or system requirements .
As mobile phones become more web capable this becomes even more apparent and necessary .
Desktop applications require completely separate development efforts .
The Local Data Problem :
There ’s no need for “ shared ” folders and collision control on documents in a web application .
Everything is on the server , everything is up - to - date as soon as it is accessed .
Web is the new Desktop : Technologies such as Adobe AIR and site - specific browsers have made it so that web applications are becoming more and more like desktop applications , bringing the ease of development and deployment with them .
Collaboration is King : Web applications , due to their centralized nature , can naturally encourage less isolated , more collaborative work between employees .
Web applications are n’t the solution to every problem a business faces .
If you need graphically intense 3D visualizations for your buciness , web applications probably are n’t the way to go for you .
But for most businesses , most of the time , web applications will be more cost - effective , more useful and more agile than the alternative .

WHEN BILL O’REILLY IS THE VOICE OF REASON ….
One of the right ’s more disgusting habits is exploiting violent tragedies for ideological gain .
After the shootings at Virginia Tech , Newt Gingrich blamed liberals ’ “ situation ethics ” for the tragedy .
After the shootings in Arvada , Colo. , the Family Research Council blamed the “ secular media ” for the rampage .
After Columbine , then - House Majority Leader Tom DeLay took to the floor to blame public school science classes for teaching young people that “ they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized [ sic ] out of some primordial soup . ”
Just 48 hours after 9/11 , Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell blamed liberals for “ helping this happen . ”
And on Tuesday , a man named Michael McLendon shot and killed 10 people in Alabama before turning the gun on himself .
It ’s unclear what , if anything , led to the rampage , but on Fox News yesterday , Glenn Beck and Bill O’Reilly tossed around an idea on the subject .
BECK : But as I ’m listening to [ the description of McLendon ] .
I ’m thinking about the American people that feel disenfranchised right now .
That feel like nobody ’s hearing their voice .
The government is n’t hearing their voice .
Even if you call , they do n’t listen to you on both sides .
If you ’re a conservative , you ’re called a racist .
You want to starve children .
O’REILLY : Sure .
BECK : Yada yada yada .
And every time they do speak out , they ’re shut down by political correctness .
How do you not have those people turn into that guy ?
O’REILLY : Well , look , nobody , even if they ’re frustrated , is going to hurt another human being unless they ’re mentally ill .
I think .
BECK : I think pushed to the wall , you do n’t think people get pushed to the wall ?
O’Reilly said he did n’t buy it .
Let ’s pause to appreciate how extraordinary it is to see Bill O’Reilly serve as the voice of reason .
As for Beck , just how deranged must one be to think ‘ political correctness ” pushed a madman to go on a shooting rampage and kill 10 people ?
For that matter , just how far gone does a cable network have to be to give a nut like Beck a platform to broadcast lunacy ?
NEW DELHI : A little less than 20 % of sexual - assault cases reported in and around Delhi are false , shows a five - year study .
In almost every fifth incident , or , in 18.3 % cases to be precise , rape is used as a weapon to malign and attempt revenge , found a group of psychologists who assist Delhi Police in investigating sexual assault allegations .
The conclusion was drawn from 113 cases in the last five years .
Anger towards the accused prompted allegations of rape in 25 % of the false charges .
An equal number of such cases were filed at the behest of family members .
Every fifth false allegation was made by a minor `coached ' to cry `rape ' as an attempt to settle family scores .
About 15 % were situations of panic after clear consent , while the remaining 15 % defied categorisation .
In September 2007 , the Supreme Court had alerted lower courts to attempts at misusing the rape law , noting " the courts should bear in mind that false charges of rape are not uncommon . ''
Rajat Mitra of Swanchetan , the NGO that conducted the study , says the false cases can be complicated at times .
He talks of a 16 - year - old girl from West Delhi's Dabri area who accused her father and another man of rape .
The girl claimed insanity post - assault , saying she would see faces of men all around her attacking her .
The girl broke down on being asked by counsellors whether the images were in black and white or in colour .
She confessed her brother had asked her to accuse their father .
With her father in jail , believed the girl , her brother would get the property and she would get to marry the person of her choice .
In the end , withdrew the case .
Another case was of a medically proven rape of a 13 - year - old in Dwarka .
The girl had accused three men but the police found their investigations did not show these men's involvement .
After a quiet talking - to by psychologists , the girl finally got the courage to speak the truth .
She said the three men who had raped her were family members who had threatened her .
To protect them , and out of fear , she had accused three others .
In this case , the chargesheet was filed against the real culprits .
In the face of such cases , the five - year study assumes significance .
Sexual assault is tricky to investigate and wrong convictions can harm the falsely accused and discredit the ordeal of real rape victims .
Zero tolerance to sexual crime has a flip side to it as a person 's testimony can be taken at face - value in the absence of evidence or corroboration .
It is important for investigators of sexual assault to be alert to the grey areas of such crime , says Mitra , a clinical psychologist .
" While 34 % of all cases showed acute PSTD in the immediate aftermath of the attack , almost 30 % displayed no obvious signs of trauma , " he said .
The no-sign cases can mislead because the average policeman identifies trauma with incessant cathartic bawling , and a silent person may be viewed as not being traumatized , he says , while the person may likely be numbed .
Collection of evidence is often difficult , as cases are frequently reported too late for physical examinations to yield conclusive results .
This is when counselling can help , as psychologists are skilled at reassuring victims and can get them to open up and recount incidents .
In cases of false allegations , it 's the structure of the stories that most often give the game away .
" The pre and post - sequence , the language used and the structure of events is obvious when it is coached , '' says the clinical psychologist .
Instead of recalling , a person making a false accusation reconstructs the incident , building in the details as it would gel with her interrogators .
Freeman was n’t the first
The mainstream media caught up with the Charles Freeman saga today .
It gets page 1 treatment in the New York Times and more detailed and extensive coverage in the Washington Post , with some solid reportage by Walter Pincus , a column supporting Freeman by David Broder , and an overwrought editorial attacking Freeman ’s defenders for advancing a " conspiracy theory . "
The ever - alert Glenn Greenwald dissects the latter ’s contradictions here .
This level of attention is probably not what Freeman ’s attackers wanted , because these stories demolish the claim that the fracas was about his views on Tibet and Tianenmen Square or even the fact that the think tank he headed had received a small portion of its funding from Saudis .
It is now clear that Freeman ’s " sin " was the fact that he had publicly said some critical things about Israeli policy , though his views were in fact no more critical than comments frequently made by more moderate Israelis .
Indeed , if Freeman were Israeli , he could write a regular column in Ha’retz and nobody would bat an eye .
The level of attention this case has now received stands in sharp contrast to several other examples where valuable public servants were denied key posts due to opposition from groups or individuals in the lobby .
Jimmy Carter reportedly wanted to make George W. Ball his secretary of state in 1976 , but he knew that groups in the lobby would oppose the appointment and so he went with Cyrus Vance instead .
The late Richard Marius , a long - time Harvard lecturer , recounted that he was offered a job as a speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore and then fired before he began work , after Martin Peretz falsely charged him with anti-Semitism , based on a book review Marius had written for Harvard Magazine .
And in 2001 , when Bruce Riedel was leaving his post handling Middle East issues at the NSC , Peretz ’s New Republic reported that the Pentagon had " held up the appointment of Riedel ’s designated successor , Alina Romanowski , whom Pentagon officials suspect of being insufficiently supportive of the Jewish state . "
Who got the job instead ?
Elliott Abrams .
The same litmus test operates on the Hill , of course .
As influential Congressman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) told an online chat group during the 2006 election : " there will be some Democratic congressman who may not share all my views or have as clear a perspective on Israel as I do , but they will not be chairing committees dealing with Israel and the Middle East . "
What is different about the Freeman case is that the campaign against him got waged out in the open , and many people figured out quickly what was going on and were willing to say so , mostly in the blogosphere .
At that point , even the mainstream media started paying attention .
It bears repeating the real issue here is whether U.S. interests are best served by making uncritical support for the " special relationship " a de facto criterion for public service in important foreign policy positions .
How about people who think the United States and Israel should have a normal relationship , one similar to our relations with other democracies , and who believe that this would be better for the United States and Israel alike ?
Is that really such a heretical view ?
One more thing : this case shows that discourse on this issue is changing and that is all to the good .
It did n’t move fast enough to save Freeman , but maybe it can move fast enough to rescue the United States from some of its past mistakes , and prevent it from making more .

Advertisement The Football Association ( FA ) is demanding " a full explanation " into how viewers missed a crucial FA Cup goal due to a technical hitch .
Everton 's winning strike in extra time happened as ITV1's coverage abruptly went to an advert break .
ITV boss Michael Grade has said the glitch , which has prompted 1,000 complaints , was " inexcusable " .
An automated system for screening adverts was still in place during the extended Liverpool v Everton match .
It is used when schedules are running normally , and fails to take overruns into account .
' Stringent procedures '
Dan Gosling celebrates after netting the crucial goal for Everton Viewers in some regions were still able to see substitute Dan Gosling 's goal , but others returned to the coverage during the players ' celebrations .
" Technically it came at a particularly bad time for us , " said host Steve Rider before saying sorry .
Grade said : " As a football fan myself , I was glued to the match and was as disappointed as anyone to miss the goal . "
He added : " We have years of experience in dealing with the changes in ad break patterns when games go into extra time and sometimes penalties .
" This we have done faultlessly through the Champions League , World Cup and European Championships .
" We are awaiting the results of our technical inquiry so we can put in place stringent and immediate procedures to address this , " he added .
In a statement , ITV called the occurrence an " unprecedented transmission error " .
As a football fan myself , I was glued to the match and was as disappointed as anyone to miss the goal
Michael Grade , ITV executive chairman
But the FA has called for a fuller explanation , saying the mistake was " very disappointing " .
" It is important that lessons are learned and that this does not happen again , " the FA said in a statement on its website .
Everton fan Robbie Hall said : " I was watching on Freeview and once the adverts got under way we had no idea what was going on .
" After about 10 seconds the game returned just as Gosling scored .
I saw the goal live but it was a mess . "
Paul Snowdon from Merseyside said : " ITV needs to start taking its football seriously .
This should never have happened . "

" Obama Sushi " made by an exceptionally creative sushi chef pays tribute to America 's 44th president in a most unusual - and dare I say , tasteful - manner .
There 's still room for more Obama mania ... if the room is the kitchen and you happen to be Kawasumi - sensei , a sushi chef who teaches at Tokyo University .
Kawasumi has whipped up a feast for both the eyes and stomach that looks so good , it had to be framed .
Kawasumi - sensei's masterpiece features , in addition to a startlingly realistic pair of Obama futomaki rolls , a variety of nigiri- zushi and futomaki that together must cost any purchaser a hefty chunk of change - we can believe that !
But while the cars and happy faces are undeniably cute , it 's the Obama sushi that are the highlights .
Creating the perfect Obama futomaki roll took considerable trial and error according to Kawasumi- sensei .
Careful selection of ingredients was just the start : brown rice for the skin , black sesame seeds for the hair , tiny shrimps for the lips and a gleaming fish - paste smile .
It appears that rich red Maguro tuna and white Ika ( squid ) were used to mold the stripes of the American flag , with cooked egg spelling out " USA " and , of course , a big " V " for Victory .

US house prices are falling fast
US house prices fell by a record 19 % in January compared with a year earlier , according to a closely - watched index .
The Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller Home Price index records prices in 20 of the largest cities in the US .
The index also showed a month - on - month fall as prices fell 2.8 % in January compared with December .
Earlier this month , figures showed home construction in February rose by a quarter year - on - year , raising hopes the US housing market may be bottoming out .
' Downward path '
" Home prices , which peaked in mid-2006 , continued their decline in 2009 , " said David Blitzer at S&P .
" There are very few bright spots .
Most of the nation appears to remain on a downward path , with all 20 metro areas reporting annual declines , " he explained .
Jim Awad at Zephyr Management said : " I think what this says is that the rally in the [ stock ] markets is based on a hope that the economy is bottoming and that the housing market is bottoming .
" This data is part of the reality check we 're going to get over the coming month . "
From their peak in the second quarter of 2006 , house prices have now fallen by 29.2 % , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller index .
The 19 % fall in January is the biggest drop since the index began in 1988 .
Prices in Phoenix fell the most ( 35 % ) , closely followed by Las Vegas ( 32.5 % ) and San Francisco ( 32.4 % ) .
The smallest fall was in Dallas , where house prices fell by 4.9 % .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Mutual fund investors in 2008 yanked more money out of actively managed stock - funds than they put in for only the third time ever , and index - fund rivals took the spoils .
The shift reflects a budding sentiment among many investors -- especially after a devastating 12 months -- that active fund management is n't always worth its higher fees .
Index funds track a market benchmark and so provide average performance , typically at a much lower cost than actively run counterparts that try to beat the market on the upside and cushion blows on the downside .
Most managers fail to outperform their benchmark in a given year , however , and this unforgiving bear market is no exception .
Average losses for stock - index funds last year were 39.1 % , while actively managed funds lost 40.5 % on average , according to investment researcher Morningstar Inc .
" Some people who get their hands burned by these market drops move from active to passive [ management ] , and every time some of them stay there , " said Morningstar analyst Scott Burns .
As well as pocketing lower returns , Burns said investors in actively run funds are more likely to chase performance and tend to be less focused on asset allocation .
As such , they are quicker to dispose of their holdings .
Index - fund investors , meanwhile , more often use those funds as part of a balanced allocation among stocks and bonds that can see them through tough times in the markets , Burns said .
" Passive investors already had a nice stockpile of fixed - income [ holdings ] , " he added .
Indexing , he added , " gains more converts " after each market downturn .
ETFs advance
Actively managed stock funds saw net outflows of $ 221.8 billion in 2008 , while index funds saw net inflows of $ 17.6 billion , according to data from fund - tracker Lipper Inc .
Index funds ' share of the marketplace rose 1.4 percentage points in 2008 to 13.2 % from 11.8 % a year earlier .
Total assets in index funds at year 's end were $ 490 billion ; actively managed stock funds held $ 3.2 trillion , according to Lipper .
The change in market share does n't include one growing player in the stock fund world : exchange - traded funds , which are indexed portfolios that trade on an exchange like stocks .
ETFs are enormously popular with institutional investors and financial advisers , and lately with individual investors as well .
Total assets in stock ETFs grew from $ 15.6 billion at the end of 1998 to $ 473.9 billion at the end of 2008 , according to the Investment Company Institute .
The ETF figures include bond funds , which stood at $ 57.2 billion on Dec. 31 , according to ICI .
When ETF assets are included in index funds ' market share , indexed investment strategies ' total slice of the pie grows to 21.4 % , and the challenge to actively managed funds becomes even clearer .
" ETFs offer a broad range of indexes for investors , " said Tom Roseen , senior analyst at Lipper .
" Investors now have access to indexed strategies that did n't exist with mutual funds . "
Other years in which stock funds saw net outflows were 1998 and 2002 .
And while investors subsequently returned , actively managed funds surrendered market share to index funds each time .
Index funds have steadily won over investors since Vanguard Group launched the first retail index fund , Vanguard 500 Index VFINX , - 0.46 % , in 1976 .
Figures from Lipper show that the share grew throughout the 1990s and spiked late in the decade as assets left actively managed funds .
In 1998 , actively managed stock - funds saw net outflows of $ 9.3 billion while index funds saw net inflows of $ 107 million .
The share of stock - fund assets held in index funds rose from 6.4 % to 7.9 % that year , and again in 1999 to 10.8 % .
Different funds , same results
Despite the shift to indexed offerings in times of trouble , the performance of both active and index funds is , on average , very similar -- as last year 's results show .
" You still have some very dour situations , " in index funds in 2008 , Roseen said .
In fact , in some cases , such as financials , index funds carried greater risk because the funds could n't dump the tanking stocks unless or until they were removed from indexes .
But despite this danger , it seems that one take away for investors may have been a loss of faith in active managers .
" It could be that some people are adopting [ Vanguard founder and indexing pioneer ]
Jack Bogle 's long held advice of not buying too many funds , staying well - diversified and keeping costs low , " Roseen said .
He added : " Perhaps they 've just said to themselves , ' We do know that actively managed funds can win , but not all the time , so let 's just shift to indexing . ' "
FBI raids office of D.C. CTO , Obama appointee
Federal agents this morning are searching the office Washington , D.C.'s Chief Technology Officer .
The search of the office at 1 Judiciary Square is part of " an ongoing investigation , " said a spokeswoman for the FBI 's D.C. Field Office , Lindsay Gotwin , said .
She said two men , Yusuf Acar and Sushil Bansal , had been arrested .
Acar is an information security officer who was also , according to online requests for proposals , responsible for contracting .
Bansal is listed on the city 's procurement website as the CEO of the Advanced Integrated Technologies Corporation , which was awarded two technology contracts last year worth a total of $ 350,000 .
The Washington Post and WTOP Radio report that the men are being held on bribery charges .
The outgoing Chief Technology Officer , Vivek Kundra , was appointed last week Chief Information Officer by the Obama administration .
His last day at the city government office was March 4 , a spokeswoman for D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty , Leslie Kershaw , said .
He was appointed to the Washington post in 2007 , and held it when Bansal 's contract was awarded .
" We know the FBI is over there but that 's all we know , " said a staffer in the D.C. CTO 's office , Mario Field , who was working from a separate location .
Another source familiar with the raid said the FBI had sent all staffers other than senior executives home for the day .
WTOP reported that agents are searching the 9th and 10th floors of the building .
A White House spokesman had no immediate comment .
D.C. mayor 's spokeswoman Kershaw said , " Our office has been alerted of FBI 's being at CTO office , but we cannot comment until it 's over and we get more details . "
No one answered a phone listed in Acar 's name .
UPDATE : NBC reports that Kundra himself is not a target .

While Left 4
Dead was the game of choice for demoing 3D technology at CES this year , one enterprising reader sent in a tip : you do n't need any expensive glasses or new technology to play the game in 3 D ... although getting the effect may take some doing .
You 'll need to be running either Vista or XP , you 'll need an Nvidia 8XXX series or higher , you 'll need a pair of those nifty 3D glasses from the Super Bowl promotions , and lastly you 'll need a copy of Left 4 Dead .
The rest you can find online .
The site gives you a list of what you 'll need to do , as well as what drivers you 'll need , to get the desired effect .
You will need to install some Nvidia drivers first .
What will this do ?
Enable you to play the game in 3D , changing the colors to those suited to the Super Bowl glasses .
This gives you a nifty — not to mention mostly free — 3D effect .
While going through all this madness is rather time - consuming ... hey , it 's 3D !
Sadly , I play Left 4 Dead on my Macbook Pro ( yes , yes , I know ) so I can't test this out , but the effect is apparently very convincing .
If anyone gives this a try , send in your experiences — we'd love to hear what you think .
Thanks to Dragon [ THC ] for the heads up .
We ca n’t tell you where or who , but pretty high up in AT&T ’s food chain , the following was reported to be said :
New iPhone announcement around mid-June ( duh )
New iPhone will be faster and have a more seamless experience unmatched by any device ( could be just talking about 3.0 , but we think it ’s also a new iPhone )
U - Verse iPhone application ; will allow control of your home DVR ( play , pause , rewind , etc . )
The annual iPhone launch is “ becoming a tradition . ”
Nothing official is being confirmed , but they said that people should prep for an exciting time this summer .
AT&T is said to be working with Apple to create a unified product with an unparalleled experience across all their products and services .
Apple ’s 3.0 software should tell us where the iPhone platform is going … uh , k ?
They said customers should n’t need to choose from AT&T ’s high - end devices because of features , they should choose based on preferences .
The gap in capability should be filled with the new iPhone .
Ok , bets on slide out QWERTY , autofocus camera , video sharing , blah blah ?
Seems like the higher speed HSDPA ( 7.2 Mbps ) is being hinted at too which should confirm the earlier rumors of the new Infineon chipset .
The $ 99 3G netbook will start selling this summer , and the first one wo n’t be a Windows OS .
For clarification , the above is 100 % confirmed .
Thanks , Stephanie !
It 's a insanely simple idea , but Amron Experimental really captured a lot of hearts , minds and minty - fresh mouths with its Brush & Rinse toothbrush concept .
Sporting the same boring bristles and molded plastic of every other toothbrush produced this century , the Brush & Rinse has a slightly indented back , which lets you redirect water and ... well , brush and rinse .
Unfortunately , the last time the thing was in the news , it was a prototype selling for $ 1,750 , so we 're happy to see it down to the much more reasonable pre-order price of $ 1.18 a pop -- though they need to presell 50,000 units before they can go into production .
Regular people will be able to pick one up for $ 5 once they get that minimum out of the way .
Exciting action video is after the break .

Aung San Suu Kyi has been in detention for most of the past 19 years
The UN has said the detention of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi violates both international legislation and the laws of Burma .
The UN working group on arbitrary detentions called for Ms Suu Kyi's immediate release .
Ms Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years under house arrest , and many of her democratic allies have been jailed .
Analysts said it is unusual for a UN body to accuse a member state of violating its own laws .
The panel said that under Burmese law only people who pose a security risk can be detained without charge .
It called for Ms Suu Kyi's immediate release without any condition , in a ruling issued in November but made public only this week .
' Illegal '
" The latest renewal ( 2008 ) of the order to place Ms Suu Kyi under house arrest not solely violates international law but also national domestic laws of Myanmar [ Burma ] , " said the UN working group .
The group - an arm of the UN Human Rights Council - said Ms Suu Kyi was being held under Burma 's 1975 State Protection Law , which only allows renewable arrest orders for a maximum of five years .

This five - year period ended in May 2008 .
The opinion also questioned whether Ms Suu Kyi represented a threat to the " security of the State or public peace and tranquillity " , the provision of the 1975 law that authorities have pointed to as the reason for her continued detention .
It quoted the country 's police chief saying in 2006 that Burma would be calm if she walked free .
The latest decision was the fifth time since 1992 that Ms Suu Kyi's detention was declared arbitrary and illegal under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , but marks the first time her detention is noted as illegal under Burma 's own laws .
No illusions Jared Genser , the Washington - based legal counsel to Ms Suu Kyi admitted that Burma 's ruling military junta was unlikely to bow to UN advice on its own laws .
" I 'm under no illusion that Aung San Suu Kyi will be immediately released because of this judgment .
But at the same time I do think it is an important small step forward , " he said .
" I do think that it will have an important impact on the United Nations ' ability to press particularly China , Russia and others who have been more protective of the junta , " he said .
Mr Genser said the panel should be seen as independent as it is comprised of five experts - from Chile , Pakistan , Russia , Senegal and Spain .
Last week a UN human rights investigator urged Burma to release more than 2,000 political prisoners and called for an urgent review of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi .
Burma has been under military rule since 1962 .

THE FACTS
Without a doubt , exercise at any time of the day beats no exercise at all .
But are there physiological advantages to working out in the morning versus evening , or vice versa ?
In various studies , scientists have found that subjects tend to do slightly better on measures of physical performance  including endurance , strength output , reaction time and aerobic capacity  between 4 and 7 p.m .
The explanations are numerous : the body ’s temperature and hormone levels peak in late afternoon , making muscles more flexible and producing the best ratio of testosterone ( the muscle - building hormone ) to cortisol ( the hormone that does the reverse ) .

But these variations have only small effects .
And much as one can adjust to waking up at the same time daily , studies have shown that the body can adapt to the time of day that you train .
In several long - term studies , for example , scientists randomly split people into groups and instructed them to train only in the morning or only in the early evening .
In the end , the morning exercisers generally did better on tests of physical performance early in the day , while the evening exercisers did better when tested later .
The police officers who stopped Oklahoma City motorist Chip Harrison and confiscated a sign from his car told him he has a right to his beliefs , but the Secret Service " could construe this as a threat against President Obama , " according to the incident report released this morning .
The sign , which read " Abort Obama Not the Unborn , " was returned to Harrison later that day , the report said .
Police spokesman Steve McCool said this morning that the sign was taken in error , and Oklahoma City residents should not be worried that their First Amendment rights will be violated .
Harrison told the officers that in his opinion the words " Abort Obama " meant to impeach him .
He told the officers he does not believe in abortion because he is a Christian .
Harrison was stopped on westbound Interstate 240 at 8:45 a.m. on Feb. 12 , according to the police report .
Harrison said he later received a call from a person who said he was a lieutenant supervisor for the Internal Investigations Department and wanted to know his location and return his sign to him .
According to Harrison , the supervisor said the Secret Service had been contacted on the matter and had told them the sign was not a threat to the president .
Harrison was asked if he would like to file a complaint .
He said he was not sure but would take the paperwork , just in case .
But his run-in with the law was n't over yet .
'' The Secret Service called and said they were at my house , " Harrison said .
After talking to his attorney , Harrison went home where he met the Secret Service .
'' When I was on my way there , the Secret Service called me and said they were n't going to ransack my house or anything ... they just wanted to ( walk through the house ) and make sure I was n't a part of any hate groups . "
Harrison said he invited the Secret Service agents into the house and they were " very cordial . "
'' We walked through the house and my wife and 2 - year - old were in the house , " Harrison said .
He said they interviewed him for about 30 minutes and then left , not finding any evidence Harrison was a threat to the president .
'' I 'm still in contact with a lawyer right now , " Harrison said .
" I do n't know what I 'm going to do . "
Harrison said he feels his First Amendment rights were violated .
McCool said the officer who pulled over Harrison misinterpreted the sign .
'' We had an officer that his interpretation of the sign was different than what was meant , " McCool said .
" You 've got an officer who had a different thought on what the word ' abort ' meant . "
McCool said the sign basically meant Obama should be impeached and it was not a threat .
''( The officer ) should n't have taken the sign , " McCool said .
" That was ( Harrison's ) First Amendment right to voice his concern . "
McCool said although the sign should not have been confiscated , the situation was made right in the end .
'' We always try to do the right thing and in the end we believe we did the right thing by returning the sign , " McCool said .
Cable and internet service providers Rogers and Shaw told a CRTC hearing Tuesday they were strongly against proposals to impose levies on ISPs to support Canadian content online .
The two companies , however , presented very different views on how to meet the needs of Canadian content providers in promoting their programming in a wide open internet or wireless world .
Rogers proposed an online video platform similar to Hulu in the U.S. as a means of ensuring Canadian broadcasting content has a home on the internet , a move it says would eliminate the need for the CRTC to impose regulations on new media in Canada .
Rogers ' proposed service for broadband video would n't require that a consumer have Rogers as an internet service provider , the company told a Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission panel Tuesday looking into whether to regulate new media broadcasting over the internet and wireless .
It would , however , require the consumer to be a Rogers ' cable subscriber , although Rogers ' head of regulatory affairs , Ken Engelhart , said the company was open to partnering with other cable providers on the service .
In that sense , the service might resemble the video site Hulu , which is backed by News Corp. and NBC Universal and consists mainly of network - produced shows , such as NBC's The Office and Fox 's The Simpsons .
" This would solve many of the problems addressed during these hearings , " said Rogers vice - chairman Philip B. Lind .
CRTC commissioner Leonard Katz questioned whether such a service would be legal under provisions in Canada designed to restrict " tied selling , " or making one service available only if another service is purchased .
Engelhart said online services tied to other broadcasting services " is not an uncommon model , " citing Sirius Radio 's online services available only to Sirius satellite radio customers as an example .
But Shaw Communications Inc. president Jim Shaw told the CRTC panel Tuesday he did n't believe Rogers ' plan of a specialized site would work as a business model in the wide open internet .
Shaw said he was fundamentally opposed to the idea of setting aside funding for Canadian content providers , either through a levy or any other tax .
" The internet is about the World Wide Web , not the Canadian Wide Web , " Shaw told the hearing .
Courts to decide legality of ISP levy : CRTC commissioner
The CRTC panel has for eight days heard a number of proposals on how to ensure Canadian content is given a prominent place on new media platforms , including imposing a levy on internet service providers and forcing ISPs to give preference to Canadian content .
Rogers , Shaw and Cogeco Cable Inc. all told the commission on Tuesday that these measures are impractical .
" The barriers to broadcasting on the internet cannot be remedied by an ISP levy , " said Rogers vice - chairman Lind in his opening remarks .
" Our position is the imposition of an ISP levy would be harmful to the growth of the internet . "
The company said any extra costs to ISPs would cost consumers as well .
Rogers also argued an ISP levy was unlawful under the Broadcasting Act , but CRTC chair Konrad von Finckenstein disagreed , and said settling that issue , should the CRTC decide to impose a levy , would be up to the courts to decide .
Engelhart argued that ISPs function as telecommunications providers and are not broadcasters , and therefore should n't be subject to broadcasting regulations .
" ISPs are pipes , not broadcasters , " Engelhart told the commission .
He likened their role to that of a Telesat satellite that transmits satellite signals .
A company like Starchoice is the broadcaster in this case , he said , not Telesat .
Shaw agreed , saying his company does n't look at the content .
" Internet traffic is doubling every 14 months , but we have no idea what it is people are watching , " he said .
Tracking Cancon difficult , Rogers says
As for other measures designed to track and give prominence to Canadian content , Rogers said such measures were either beyond the ability of the company or impractical .
Engelhart said it is technically possible for an ISP like Rogers to give prominence to certain websites using a " white list , " in much the same way pornography filters are used to block websites that are blacklisted .
The challenge , he says , is coming up with a list of which sites represent " Canadian " content .
But University of Ottawa professor Michael Geist pointed out in his blog Tuesday that a " .ca " domain makes " a very poor metric for identifying Canadian content " as foreign companies can obtain a .ca website as long as they acquire a Canadian trademark , while many Canadian companies choose to use " .com " domains .
Rogers ' chief strategy officer Mike Lee also told the commission that tracking Canadian content by server is also impractical , as content Rogers packages for broadcasters such as the CBC can come to Canada via U.S. servers .
With measures designed to regulate ISPs lacking or beyond the scope of the Broadcasting Act , Rogers told the commission it feels the best way to address concerns is through its role as a broadcaster .
While Rogers had previously outlined its opposition to a levy on ISPs , it 's the first time it proposed its planned broadband video streaming service as an alternative solution to the issue of how to get Canadian content on the internet .
The company also dismissed claims made Monday that wireless carriers were creating " walled gardens " for mobile devices that prevented real competition in the wireless arena .
' Big wide - open pipe '
Score Media Inc. and Pelmorex Media Inc. , which owns
The Weather Network , both expressed concerns about carriers giving programs preferential treatment to some services over others on mobile devices .
But Engelhart said closed mobile devices are becoming an obsolete business model .
" It has all been a flop , " he said .
" We 're not gatekeepers keeping them out , we 're standing at the gate begging people to come through the gate and they 're not coming .
" We 're moving away from the thing Pelmorex was concerned about and moving to a big wide - open pipe , so a lot of these things people are complaining about wo n't be a problem , " he said .
In an earlier presentation , advertiser Astral Media Inc. called for the new media exemption to remain , arguing new regulations would hinder progress in accessing Canadian content .

On Monday , the Dow Jones industrial average nose - dived another 300 points .
So , what advice did the perky money manager quoted in my local newspaper the next morning have to offer ?
“ I think we ’re going to look back and see that this was the best buying opportunity we ’ve seen in years , ” the man said .
“ When General Electric is selling for less than the cost of a light bulb , that ’s an opportunity . ”
The best buying opportunity in years is now 14 months old .
Financial advisors started touting it about the time the Dow hit 11,000 , and they have grown increasingly enthusiastic as it has worked its way down past the 7,000 level .
As the Dow has tumbled deeper into the abyss , money managers , stock analysts and even well - meaning journalists have consistently warned laymen about the risks of throwing in the towel .
Over and over , investors have been told not to panic because no one has really lost any money until they ’ve sold their stocks .
Meanwhile , the market has surrendered more than half its value and seems perfectly prepared to continue its merry toboggan ride south .
So even if you have n’t actually lost any money yet , it may seem as if you ’ve lost money .
It may seem , in fact , as if you ’ve lost half your life ’s savings .
About a year ago , I began collecting hilarious articles warning the public not to make the mistake of panicking .
My favorite is “ The Economy is Fine ( Really ) , ” which ran in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 28 , 2008 .
In it , Brian Wesbury , chief economist for First Trust Portfolios , opined : “ It is hard to imagine any time in history when such rampant pessimism about the economy has existed with so little evidence of serious trouble . ”
Wesbury also noted that “ initial unemployment claims , a very consistent canary in the coal mine for recessions , are nowhere near a level of concern . ”
He concluded : “ Dow 15,000 looks more likely than Dow 10,000 .
Keep the faith and stay invested .
It ’s a wonderful buying opportunity . ”
“ Are you ready for Dow 20,000 ? ” was the headline of a March 24 , 2008 , Barron ’s article , in which the very fine journalist Jonathan Laing allowed “ veteran strategist ” James Finucane to hang himself .
Finucane believed that “ months of stock liquidation and cash buildup , horrible sentiment and a bailout that could alter investor psychology have lit the fuse for an explosive rally . ”
In the last year or so , there have been hundreds , if not thousands , of articles warning investors about the idiocy of panic selling .
One ceaselessly regurgitated bromide warns investors that if they missed out on just a handful of the top - performing days during the 1982-2007 bull market , they would have ended up with a 25 % smaller return .
No one , not even Warren Buffett , can time the market , laymen are warned , and those who duck in and out do so at their peril .
So stay the course .
Buckle up for a bumpy ride .
And whatever you do , do n’t panic .
A few months ago , I decided that the time had come to panic , so I started to move a portion of my emaciated 401 ( k ) into cash .
I felt like a jerk at the time , knowing only too well that the man who is bearish on the United States of America will end up a pauper , and that if I got out now , I risked missing out on that massive , once - in - a - lifetime rally .
But I was willing to take that chance , as half a loaf is better than none , and my 401 ( k ) is now about half the loaf it once was .
That first time I panicked , the Dow was trading at 9,500 .
Afew weeks ago , I panicked again and moved another hefty chunk out of the market .
The Dow was then trading at 7,500 ; now it is approaching 6,500 .
I fully expect to panic again at 6,000 , probably at 5,000 , and might even get in a bit of late - in - the - day panicking at 4,000 .
Tentatively , I am drawing a line in the sand at the crucial watershed of Dow 3,000 , because any hysterical selling beyond that point would be anti-American and counterproductive .
But even that hideous benchmark is subject to revision .
I realize that I have come late to the panic mode , but as my father always said :
No matter how bad you have been burned , it is never too late to try dousing yourself with water .
Remember that , son .
One thing that encourages me to panic is the steady cascade of admonitions from luminaries urging me not to panic .
Last week , professional cheerleader and Wharton School professor Jeremy J. Siegel wrote an Op - Ed article in the Wall Street Journal arguing that stocks are significantly undervalued because the S&P calculates its earnings incorrectly .
I could n’t understand all of his reasoning , but basically he said that stocks were cheap .
The next day , Jason Zweig , author of the Journal ’s “ The Intelligent Investor ” column , fired back : “ The belief that stocks become virtually riskless if you just hold them long enough -- popularized a decade ago in books like Jeremy Siegel ’s ‘ Stocks for the Long Run ’ and James Glassman and Kevin Hassett ’s ‘ Dow 36,000 ' -- has been shattered by reality . ”
Hassett , by the way , was one of John McCain ’s top advisors .
Talk about dodging a bullet .
The lower the Dow goes , the more adamantly some professionals insist that the worst is over .
In this week ’s Barron ’s , portfolio manager William D’Alonzo said : “ Whether it takes six months or several years for this crisis to bottom , we believe the market has largely discounted the economic downturns , and that it is essential to remain in the market to take part in its eventual recovery . ”
No thanks ; I ’m panicking .
Meanwhile , Tobias M. Levkovich , chief U.S. equity strategist for Citigroup Global Markets , wrote in his Feb. 26 report : “ Stock prices are showing up as attractive against other assets . ”
Since then , the Dow has dropped almost 700 points more .
Citigroup , it bears noting , is a banking colossus that may cease to exist as an independent entity soon , if rumors of impending nationalization are true .
In other words , the top analyst for a bank that has effectively imploded is telling investors to buy stock in the equity market that Citigroup helped to destroy .
This is a little bit like the chief petty officer on the Titanic offering up survival tips :
Whatever you do , do n’t abandon ship ; it ’s cold out there in the North Atlantic .
Well , with all due respect , sir , I know that your intentions are honorable and that you ’ve got loads of experience in this field .
But right now , I ’m no longer accepting advice from employees of the White Star Line .
There is a time for hysteria , and a time when cooler heads should prevail .
This is the time for hysteria .

Microsoft plans to make its Internet Explorer 8 browser available on Thursday , along with a company - commissioned report claiming IE8 is more secure against malware than rival browsers from Mozilla and Google .
Users will be able to download IE8 in 25 languages at 12:00 noon Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday from Microsoft's IE Web site and its online download center .
Microsoft has been preparing users for IE8 for a good year now , stressing performance improvements , better support for Internet technology standards , the addition of new features to help people keep track of most visited sites and favorite sources of information , and of course , security , as highlights of the new browser .
According to the report Microsoft released Thursday , based on research conducted by NSS Labs , IE8 's Release Candidate 1 was 69 percent effective at catching malware before it did damage to a user 's system .
Mozilla Firefox 3.07 came in second with a 30 percent effectiveness rate , with Apple Safari's 3 in third place with a 24 - percent rate and Google 's Chrome 1.0.154 in fourth place with 16 percent effectiveness rate
NSS Labs said in the report that the data was collected from tests conducted in just over 12 days from Feb. 26 through March 10 in its labs in Austin , Texas .
During the course of the test , the company said it monitored connectivity to ensure the browsers could access the live malware sites being tested , and performed 141 discrete tests .
The margin of error of the tests was 3.76 percent , according to NSS Labs .
Amy Barzdukas , a senior director at Microsoft , acknowledged that it might be a conflict of interest for Microsoft to sponsor a report in which IE8 came out on top in terms of security .
However , she encouraged people to " look closely at the results " before making a judgment call on the validity of the report .
IE8 will be included as part of the Windows 7 OS .
However , for the first time since adding browser technology to its operating system , Microsoft will give users the ability to turn off IE8 as a feature in the system .
This decision was outlined in a blog post on the Engineering Windows 7 blog .
Microsoft is under pressure from an ongoing antitrust case in the European Union to give users more browser choice in Windows .
There ’s a new mood : collapse .
Former President Reagan defined a recession as when your friend lost his job , and a depression as when you lost your job .
Collapse is when no one has a job ; in fact there are no longer any such things as jobs to be had .
Google Trends showing number of news references to “ collapse ” ( red ) and “ depression ” ( blue ) .
Doom and collapse are in the air .
We could think of the Long Doom as the opposite of the Long Boom .
The stock market has been falling steadily for a year and not even the usual optimists are claiming it has bottomed out .
Like a vicious circle bad news breeds more bad news , and so at the moment the prospect for the near future is for more of the same bad news .
How low could it go ?
That ’s the question on everyone ’s mind .
Once you start thinking about it , you can imagine it going very low : unemployment , massive layoffs , huge migrations , class warfare , classic war , and without much effort , you soon arrive at the collapse of civilization itself .
Surprisingly there are collapsitarians who are rooting for the quick arrival of the Long Doom .
Perhaps not surprisingly they come in all kinds of flavors .
Some hail from the hard wingnut left , some from the hard wingnut right , and some from next door .
As far as Google knows the term collapsitarian was coined by Jim Kunstler in a January 26 , 2009 New Yorker article on Dystopians .
There seem to be about six species of collapsitarians :
Luddites , anarchists , and anti-civilization activists ( see The Unabomber Was Right ) who are trying the hasten collapse as soon as possible .
Goldbugs , survivalists , Y2 K holdouts , and slightly right wingers who see collapse as the penalty for modern liberalism .
Conservationists and greenies who see collapse as the penalty for environmental sins .
Somewhat leftist anti-globalists who see collapse as the penalty for globalism .
Critics of American super - power who see the collapse of America as an inevitable imperial overreach .
Many are native academics , many reside outside of America , many are prominent historians .
Former financial employees who see nothing good in , but no escape from , this doom .
The idea of progress has been slowly dying .
I think progress lost its allure at the ignition of the first atom bomb at the end of WWII .
It has been losing luster since .
Even more recently the future has become boring and unfashionable .
No one wants to live in the future .
The jet packs do n’t work , and the Daily Me is full of spam .
No finds the Future attractive any longer .
The only thing left to believe in is collapse .
That ’s not boring !
The end of civilization would be terribly exciting , and unlike any future we could imagine , probably more likely .
Dystopias are a favorite science fiction destination now .
We all are collapsitarians these days .
SHANGHAI  China is taking advantage of the economic downturn to go on a major shopping spree , investing in energy and other natural resources that could give it an economic advantage it has never had before .
Some economic analysts say they believe that China ’s investments pose a threat to competitors like the United States .
In the last move , Beijing said on Friday that one of its big state - owned banks , the China Development Bank , would lend the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras $ 10 billion in exchange for a long - term commitment to send oil to China .
China signed similar deals this week with Russia and Venezuela , bringing Beijing ’s total oil investments this month to $ 41 billion .
They represent an important investment .
Supplies of commodities like oil are likely to tighten again once global growth picks up , and China will have a toehold it lacked during the recent boom , when it grew phenomenally even with limited access to resources .
But some analysts say China ’s recent investments are welcome because they will help finance much - needed development , increasing the global supply of oil and natural resources at a time when many of the world ’s biggest banks are reluctant to lend .
IDG announced today that it is dropping the slogan “ The start of a new era ” for Macworld 2010 , which Apple has announced it will not be attending , in favor of a new slogan .
IDG Vice President Paul Kent said “ The new slogan reflects what we were hearing people say over and over again to each other about their plans for next year . ”
“ Everyone wants to come , ” Kent said .
“ Someone just needs to be first .
C’mon , it ’s not like you people have anything better to do .
Good lord , look at yourselves . ”
Put this in the “ Wait , really ? ” category : Steve Wozniak , the computer programmer who co-founded Apple Inc. , Monday was named a contestant on the upcoming season of “ Dancing With the Stars . ”
The man known as the Woz created the original circuit board used for the Apple computer and teamed up with Steve Jobs in 1976 to sell it .
He quit working full time at Apple two decades ago and , after years working on various projects , reemerged last week as chief scientist at FusionIO , a data storage start - up .
Not only must his computer chops be pretty sharp still , but he must feel good about his dancing skills .
ABC announced late Sunday that Wozniak would face off against 12 other contestants -- singers , actors and athletes -- in the show ’s eighth season , which starts March 9 .

Perhaps Wozniak , who ’s 59 , has programmed an algorithm to calculate his odds of winning .
This wo n’t be his first appearance on reality television .
He was a regular on “ Kathy Griffin : My Life on the D - List ” because he was dating the comedian .

You can drive into this dusty fleck of a town near the Texas - Louisiana state line if you ’re African American , but you might not be able to drive out of it -- at least not with your car , your cash , your jewelry or other valuables .
That ’s because the police here allegedly have found a way to strip motorists , many of them black , of their property without ever charging them with a crime .
Instead they offer out - of - towners a grim choice : Sign over your belongings to the town , or face felony charges of money laundering or other serious crimes .
More than 140 people reluctantly accepted that deal from June 2006 to June 2008 , according to court records .
Among them were a black grandmother from Akron , Ohio , who surrendered $ 4,000 in cash after Tenaha police pulled her over , and an interracial couple from Houston , who gave up more than $ 6,000 after police threatened to seize their children and put them into foster care , the court documents show .
Neither the grandmother nor the couple were charged with or convicted of any crime .
Officials in Tenaha , along a heavily traveled state highway connecting Houston with several popular gambling destinations in Louisiana , say they are engaged in a battle against drug trafficking , and they call the search - and - seizure practice a legitimate use of the state ’s asset - forfeiture law .
That law permits local police agencies to keep drug money and other property used in the commission of a crime and add the proceeds to their budgets .

“ We try to enforce the law here , ” said George Bowers , mayor of the town of about 1,100 residents , where boarded - up businesses outnumber open ones and City Hall sports a broken window .
“ We ’re not doing this to raise money .
That ’s all I ’m going to say at this point . ”
But civil rights lawyers call Tenaha ’s practice something else : highway robbery .
The attorneys have filed a federal class - action lawsuit seeking unspecified damages and a halt to what they contend is an unconstitutional perversion of the law ’s intent , used primarily against African Americans who have done nothing wrong .
Tenaha officials “ have developed an illegal ‘ stop and seize ’ practice of targeting , stopping , detaining , searching , and often seizing property from apparently nonwhite citizens and those traveling with nonwhite citizens , ” asserts the lawsuit , which was filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas .
The property seizures are not happening just in Tenaha .
In southern parts of Texas near the Mexican border , for example , Latinos allege that they are being singled out .

According to a prominent Texas state legislator , police agencies across the state are wielding the asset - forfeiture law more aggressively to supplement their shrinking operating budgets .
“ If used properly , it ’s a good law - enforcement tool to see that crime does n’t pay , ” said Democratic state Sen.
John Whitmire , chairman of the Senate ’s Criminal Justice Committee .
“ But in this instance , where people are being pulled over and their property is taken with no charges filed and no convictions , I think that ’s theft . ”

Money , minorities

David Guillory , an attorney in nearby Nacogdoches who filed the federal lawsuit , said he combed through Shelby County court records from 2006 to 2008 and discovered nearly 200 cases in which Tenaha police seized cash and property from motorists .
In about 50 of the cases , suspects were charged with drug possession .
But in 147 others , Guillory said the court records showed , the police seized cash , jewelry , cellphones and sometimes even automobiles from motorists but never found any contraband or charged them with any crime .
Of those , Guillory said he managed to contact 40 of the motorists directly -- and discovered that all but one of them were black .
“ The whole thing is disproportionately targeted toward minorities , particularly African Americans , ” Guillory said .
“ Every one of these people is pulled over and told they did something , like , ‘ You drove too close to the white line . ’
That ’s not in the penal code , but it sounds plausible .
None of these people have been charged with a crime ; none were engaged in anything that looked criminal .
The sole factor is that they had something that looked valuable . ”
In some cases , police used the fact that motorists were carrying large amounts of cash as evidence that they must have been involved in laundering drug money , even though Guillory said each of the drivers he contacted could account for where the money had come from and why they were carrying it -- such as for a gambling trip to Shreveport , La. , or to purchase a used car from a private seller .
Advertisement
Once the motorists were detained , the police and the Shelby County district attorney quickly drew up legal papers presenting them with an option :
Waive their rights to their cash and property or face felony charges for crimes such as money laundering -- and the prospect of having to hire a lawyer and return to Shelby County multiple times to contest the charges in court .
--
Apparently routine
The process apparently is so routine in Tenaha that Guillory discovered pre-signed and pre-notarized police affidavits with blank spaces left for an officer to fill in a description of the property being seized .
Advertisement
Jennifer Boatright , her husband and two young children -- a mixed - race family -- were traveling from Houston to visit relatives in East Texas in April 2007 when Tenaha police pulled them over , alleging that they were driving in a left - turn lane .
After searching the car , the officers discovered what Boatright said was a gift for her sister : a small , unused glass pipe made for smoking marijuana .
Although they found no drugs or other contraband , the police seized $ 6,037 that Boatright said the family was carrying to purchase a used car -- and then threatened to turn their children , ages 10 and 1 , over to Child Protective Services if the couple did n’t agree to sign over their right to their cash .
“ It was give them the money or they were taking our kids , ” Boatright said .
“ They suggested that we never bring it up again .
We figured we better give them our cash and get the hell out of there . ”
Several months later , after Boatright and her husband contacted an attorney , Tenaha officials returned their money but offered no explanation or apology .
The couple remain plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit .
Advertisement
Except for Tenaha ’s mayor , none of the defendants in the federal lawsuit , including Shelby County Dist .
Atty .
Lynda Russell and two Tenaha police officers , responded to requests for comment about their search - and - seizure practices .
Lawyers for the defendants also declined to comment , as did several of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit .
But Whitmire says he does n’t need to await the suit ’s outcome to try to fix what he regards as a statewide problem .
On Monday , he introduced a bill in the state Legislature that would require police to go before a judge before attempting to seize property under the asset - forfeiture law -- and ultimately Whitmire hopes to tighten the law further so that law - enforcement officials will be allowed to seize property only after a suspect is charged and convicted in a court .
“ The law has gotten away from what was intended , which was to take the profits of a bad guy ’s crime spree and use it for additional crime fighting , ” Whitmire said .
“ Now it ’s largely being used to pay police salaries -- and it ’s being abused because you do n’t even have to be a bad guy to lose your property . ”

Why Are Jingles So Effective For Your Ads ?
Jingles are as American as Apple Pie – and everyone loves pie .

The organization and management of nuclear weapons research in nine countries — the United States , China , France , India , Israel , North Korea , Pakistan , Russia , and the United Kingdom — are examined in a new report from the Congressional Research Service obtained by Secrecy News .

A lawmaker in California wants to force Google Earth and similar services to blur images of so - called “ soft targets ” like schools , hospitals , churches and government buildings to protect them from terrorists .
Assemblyman Joel Anderson , a San Diego Republican , said he decided to introduce his bill after reading reports suggesting that terrorists used online map imagery to plan attacks in Mumbai and elsewhere .
The ban , if enacted , could face legal challenges , as the right to publish images taken in public places has generally been protected by American courts .
And of course , as an Associated Press article points out , images of many of the places Mr. Anderson is seeking to protect are easily available elsewhere .
That said , Google and Microsoft , and in some cases third - party imagery providers used by these companies , have voluntarily agreed to blur images of certain locations , ranging from the White House to shelters for victims of domestic violence .
Concerns that detailed satellite imagery and photographs available on Web services like Google Maps , Google Earth and Microsoft ’s Virtual Earth could help terrorists plan attacks are not new .
There have been reports that terrorists have used such imagery to carry out attacks in Iraq and Israel .
An Indian court is considering a ban on Google Earth following reports that its imagery played a part in the Mumbai terrorist attacks .
Such talk has drawn criticism from experts who note that while virtually all technologies can be used to cause harm , their benefits typically outweigh any downsides .
The security expert , Bruce Schneier recently wondered what other things legislators might consider banning to prevent terrorism :
Serge Foucher ( centre ) agreed to reconsider pay - off terms
The head of Sony France and his human resources manager have been freed after being held captive overnight by staff angry at their severance package .
Serge Foucher and Roland Bentz were released from the factory in south - west France after agreeing to restart talks on the terms of the redundancy .
The plant at Pontonx - sur - l ' Adour is due to shut on 17 April .
Representatives of the 311 workers said their action was the only way to make management listen to their concerns .
Talks were said to be under way on Friday afternoon .
" We hope that this time our voices will be heard , " unionist Patrick Achaguer told Reuters news agency .
Mr Foucher 's visit to the plant on Thursday was to be his last before its closure , the AFP news agency reports .
Workers , unhappy that their pay - off is less generous than for staff at other closed French Sony plants , decided to strike and barricaded the site to stop the company executives from leaving .
Police were outside the site but did not intervene .
There have been several incidents in the past of disgruntled French workers holding their bosses hostage , the French news agency reports .
Bacon lovers take note :
There 's a new meat in town .
Cured lamb belly is showing up on menus all over , cozying up to eggs at breakfast and standing in for its porcine counterpart in wintry dinners .
Because it has a lower fat , lamb bacon does n't crisp up as well as pork .
But chefs like its meaty texture and the rich , gamey flavor it adds to hearty winter dishes .
At the new Boqueria SoHo , chef Seamus Mullen cures lamb belly from Vermont 's Tamarack Hollow farm in house and uses it for every meal of the day :
At brunch , he pairs it with eggs and braised Tuscan kale ; at lunch , he creates an overloaded BLT ( pictured ) with roasted - garlic aioli and sheep 's - milk cheese ; and at dinner , he serves it with roasted butternut squash and braised mushrooms .
For a spicier application , head to Theater District favorite Toloache for chef Julian Medina 's lamb bacon with pickled garbanzo beans and guajillo - chile salsa .
And at Anthos , chef Michael Psilakis makes an updated Greek manti , a ravioli - like dumpling that he stuffs with caramelized onions , house - made lamb bacon , beet greens and manouri cheese .
A California teenager started to slit his wrists in front of a live web camera on Monday .
A man clear across the country may have saved his life .
Sacramento Police say they got a phone call from Jesse Coltrane of Camden , N.J. on Monday , alerting them that a teenager was trying to kill himself in front of a live web audience .
That was just before midnight , California time .
" He said I needed someone to talk to .
I feel like you 're the only one I can talk to , " Coltrane said the teen told him while they were instant messaging Monday night .
The teen then confessed that he planned on committing suicide .
Coltrane then asked the teen to turn on his webcam so they could talk face - to - face .
His hope was to calm his buddy down .
" All of a sudden , I see him clenching his teeth and closing his eyes real tight and he was cutting himself .
But I could n't see it .
I said what are you doing ?
But he would n’t tell me .
He kept shaking his head , " Coltrane said .
What happened next left Jesse feeling helpless over 3,000 miles away .
" What makes it upsetting is the last thing he said to me was ' You live your life and I 'll live my life .
I know already how to deal with my life . '
He took off his headphones and he logged off , " Coltrane said .
He then jumped into action calling Sacramento authorities with nothing more than a first name and cell phone number .
Three hours later , police had tracked down the 18 - year old guy .
They went to his house and found him hurt , but alive .
Coltrane met the California teen on MySpace about a month ago .
They both had a big interest in music .
The teen was taken to a mental health clinic , where he 's being evaluated for 72 hours .
In November , a Florida youth died in his bed of a drug overdose as others watched over the Internet .
In that case , authorities said some of the people watching actually encouraged the youth to take more drugs .
A good deal of time passed before anyone picked up the phone and called police to report the death .

Reports : Obama offers end of US missile shield for Kremlin 's help on Iran Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 2 , 2009
Print This Email This UPDATE ( at bottom ) : NYT reports ' secret letter ' posed deal , new way forward
Citing an unnamed White House official , Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Monday that President Obama has offered to scrap plans for a US missile shield in Europe if the Russian leadership will help restrain Iran 's alleged nuclear ambitions .
The offer was allegedly made in a letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
Moscow has reacted furiously to plans by the former administration of George W. Bush to place missile defence facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic , saying the move was directly aimed against Russia .
" I am counting on the new US administration behaving on this question in a more creative and friendly way , " Medvedev said Sunday in an interview with Spanish media , the transcript of which was published on the Kremlin website .
" We have already received positive signals from our American colleagues .
I am expecting that these signals will turn into concrete proposals , " he added .
Medvedev said he hoped that this issue would be discussed in his first meeting with Obama , expected to take place on the sidelines of the meeting of G20 countries in London on April 2 .
" The first high - level Russia - U.S. meeting will take place later this week , when Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov meets with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Geneva , " reported Russian news agency Novosti .
" Moscow has not yet responded to the proposal by Obama , the paper said , adding that a decision was unlikely to be made during Lavrov and Clinton 's meeting . "
NYT : Obama 's ' secret letter ' sent last month
Late Monday , the New York Times apparently confirmed the Kommersant report .
" It s almost saying to them , put up or shut up , " an unnamed administration official told the paper .
" It s not that the Russians get to say , ' Well try and therefore you have to suspend . '
It says the threat has to go away . "
" Moscow has not responded , but a Russian official said Monday that Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov would have something to say on missile defense to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton when they meet Saturday in Geneva , " the Times reported .

Drupal is an out of the box , open source content management system and framework that allows the creation of high - end websites .
Among the most popular content management systems , Drupal requires the most expertise and knowledge , yet it is capable of producing the most advanced websites .
It ’s much more flexible than any other content management platform .
It is a developer friendly platform not a user friendly platform .
But it is easier to use with each new release .
Even those who have limited programming skills can learn to use it , but it will naturally serve as a more powerful tool in the hands of a web - developer .
Drupal has a very powerful taxonomy that allows you to tag , organize and categorize complex content according to your preference .
It lets you create a flexible content architecture through the Admin interface or through code .
You can make sure that only content appropriate for the context will be displayed .
You can easily connect sources of content , marketing technology tools and application functionality .
It also provides developers with a framework and the tools necessary for building a top notch website .
With Drupal , you can create personal or corporate websites , forums , e-commerce sites , portals , social networking sites and almost any kind of website you can imagine .
There are hundreds of plugins that enhance Drupal ’s capabilities in terms of scalability , stability , functionality and aesthetics as well .
It ’s best to use Drupal for more complex , and advanced websites that have to deal with a lot of content , but it ’s great for creating simple websites as well .
Drupal might not be a beginner friendly CMS , but if you keen to use a powerful system , you can learn Drupal in just a few days .
Learning a programming language is another story , but starting out with Drupal does not require much time .
How to Choose Hosting for Drupal ?
Hosting Drupal is very similar to hosting any other CMS or website , although it is important to mention that it can have more excessive requirements .
Required specs for hosting Drupal :
A full database access .
A command line access .
PHP 7 is required for it to run much faster .
MySQL 5.5.3
SQLLite 3.7.11
PostgreSQL 9.1.2
MariaDB 5.5.20
But you can skip looking through all the technical specs if a host simply states that it has full support for Drupal .
It ’s evident that they have the technical requirements for doing so .
While most web hosts support Drupal , you still have the task of finding one that works best for the website you have in mind .
It has to fit your budget well and has to be a host that outperforms the competition in the most perceivable way .
Two of the most important technical factors to look after are website loading speeds ( measured in milliseconds ) and the host ’s uptime ( measured in percentages ) .
In order for your website to load in less than 2 seconds , it ’s best if you look for a host that has at least a 700 ms loading speed .
Although if you find one that better fits your budget , yet has a bit slower ( like 800 - 900 ms ) loading speed , it wo n’t cause much of a problem .
But if you ’re running an e-commerce website , keep in mind that even a 1s delay in website loading speed has proven to decrease conversion rates by one percent .
A server ’s uptime should n’t go below 99 % so be sure you can check that on your list as well .
Be sure that your perspective host has a good customer service and has positive testimonials for users who have been with them for a long time .
There are a fix number of websites , MySQL databases and email addresses you get with each hosting plan , so be sure that those fit your requirements as well .
Some hosts wo n’t let you fall short of any of these , so they offer unlimited everything !
Also , see if the storage space and bandwidth they offer is truly unlimited as well , since it ’s natural that they impose some limitations in order to stop someone ’s website from eating up all the shared server ’s resources .
The more free services they offer the better .
You want web hosting service that fits your budget perfectly , so find a host that is generous in its offerings .
You can get your hands on some great deals and discounts if you have your eyes open .
Some hosts offer a free domain name and a free website migration if you have a website that is already hosted somewhere else .
Finally , look after your perspective hosting plan in detail , since some low commercial prices are only attainable if you sign a 3 year contract and they will go up if you choose a 12 month plan .

I do n’t think anyone would mind that .
What makes their service even more powerful is that they store all their data on SSD drives , which are able to read data 20 x faster .
InMotion also works hard to bring you the best possible customer support , that ’s always ready to handle the task at hand .
You wo n’t have to wait more than 20 minutes to get a response from them and start resolving the issue at hand .
Just about everything about InMotion is very compelling , as it even got very positive reviews on other websites as well .
The only downside is that they do n’t offer backups for websites that exceed 10GB .
While most websites are less than 100MB , this would be a problem only for a few huge sites .
But if your website is below that mark , you ’ll get free backups , which is something that most hosting companies charge a hefty fee for .
InMotion keeps their price tag in check as well .
They offer their first , very solid virtual private server plan , for $ 29.99 per month .
This gives you some top - notch specs , such as 8 GB RAM , 4TB bandwidth , unlimited websites , emails , domains , MySQL and 200 GB of storage space .
Their second VPS plan costs $ 34.99 per month , providing 150GB of storage space , an 5TB bandwidth , 6GB RAM , and 4 IP addresses .
Their final and most powerful plan boasts 8 GB of ram , 260 GB disk space , a 6TB bandwidth and 5 IP Addresses .
It ’s ideal for hosting Drupal and any kind of website you ’ve set forth to build .
3. BlueHost
BlueHost offers a lot of nice discounts and powerful support for Drupal , which makes its hosting service worthy of consideration .
It is WordPress.org ’s recommended hosting service and offers a very compelling deal for both WordPress users and fans of many websites out there .
So you can easily get your hands on a $ 2.95 / month hosting service and enjoy this cost effective solution .
BlueHost offers the horsepower necessary for running a Drupal based website .
They also provide a lot of security tools such as Spam Experts and Spam Assassin and CloudFlare to prevent any troublesome DDoS attacks from crashing your website .
They ’re pretty reliable with a solid uptime of 99.99 % and 99.85 % that was measured within a one year period .
If you ’re loading a “ light ” website , loading speeds will be pretty decent .
If you have a more excessive website , it might load a bit slower since BlueHost ’s servers have a 1000 ms loading time .
If you want to run an online store , where user satisfaction is one of the key aspects of making a sale , then you ’ll want to find a host with better loading speeds .
Otherwise , 1000 ms are perfectly fine if you ’re not a speed fanatic .
BlueHost ’s customer service is friendly and takes only about 30 minutes to respond when you have something to ask or some issue to resolve .
Their website also holds a huge FAQ database and a lot of written content to help their users with learning and controlling their server .
You can also look through their YouTube channel , which offers a lot of information on hosting and marketing technology .
The Standard VPS plan costs $ 19.99 , providing you with one domain name , 1 IP Address , 2 cores , 30 GB of SSD storage space , 2GB of RAM and unlimited bandwidth .
Their Enhanced VPS plan costs $ 29.99 , providing you with 60 GB of SSD storage , unlimited bandwidth , 4GB of RAM and 4 Cores and 2 IP addresses .
The Premium plan costs $ 44.99 , providing 3 cores , 90 GB of SSD storage space , 6 GB of RAM , Unlimited bandwidth , 1 included domain and 2 IP addresses .
Finally , the Ultimate plan is the best on the list , providing 4 Cores , 120 GB of SSD storage , 8GB RAM , unlimited bandwidth , 1 domain name and 2 IP addresses .
4. InterServer
InterServer is n’t the most popular hosting company out there but that does n’t mean that the service they ’re offering is n’t top notch .
It is a company that has been around for 18 years and has become well established in the industry , with a lot of satisfied clients .
They have a lot of positive testimonials from their users all over the Internet .
The hardware they use and the services they provide are speedy and reliable .
Websites hosted on InterServers ’ machines take about 400 ms - 500 ms to load .
Server uptimes are 100 % throughout the year and would only spike down to 99.99 % .
You can be absolutely sure that they have your back in every way .
InterServer ’s customer support has also received a lot of praise since they ’re very fast to respond , having no problems with resolving an issue .
What makes InterServer the most compelling hosting company in my opinion , is the fact that they are n’t greedy .
They have very reasonable offers both for their shared plans and their VPS plans .
They even offer discounts if you set up a contract for a longer period .
Other hosting companies use smoke and mirror pricing in their advertisements , only to let users find out that they can only get that low cost service if they sign a contract for 3 years .
So I ’m giving a big plus to InterServer for being absolutely straight forward and transparent in their pricing .
What makes them the best on this list , without any exaggeration , is that their VPS “ slice ” service starts at $ 6.00 , providing one core , 1TB of bandwidth , 25GB of storage space and 1GB of RAM .
While these are n’t many resources , their VPS plans include 16 levels .
You can always add a slice and add more resources for +$ 6.00 .
For example , if you buy 2 slices for $ 12.00 per month , you get 1 core , 2GB of RAM 25 GB storage and a 2TB of bandwidth .
InterServer provides an insanely good offer compared to other hosting companies , so it ’s really worth checking them out and buying their service !
You can always get your money back if you ’re not satisfied for some odd reason .
5. GreenGeeks
The huge datacenters used by hosting companies take up an insane amount of energy and a lot of that goes to waste .
GreenGeeks however does n’t let that happen .
They are an environmentally - friendly web host .
They do it by purchasing wind energy to power your website and thus support environment friendly energy production .
They have been in business for 8 years now , and have replaced more than 600,000 kilowatts each year .
But Green
Geeks are no activists ; they put all that green energy to good use by providing an immensely powerful and reliable hosting service .
They produce 99 % uptimes and 100 % customer satisfaction .
Their page loading speeds have an average of 700 miliseconds .
They also offer a free domain name that you can use .
If you are not satisfied , you can ask for a refund within a 30 day period .
When it comes to pricing , GreenGeeks follows the old pricing tricks and places a $ 3.96 price tag up front .
While that ’s a compelling offer , you ’ll have to sign up for a three year period to use it .
Otherwise , the price suddenly jumps up to $ 9.95 .
Account activation is straightforward and you can install content management systems in a single click .
Once you register and verify your order , you ’ll have your very own VPS server ready within 60 seconds .
If you ’re unsatisfied with their service , you can always use the risk free money back guarantee that lasts for 30 days after registration .
GreenGeeks offer a Linux VPS hosting , which is fast , reliable and scalable .
There are five different plans you can use and you ’ll get a cPanel and a Web Host Manager with each of them .
What makes their VPS service even better is that it is fully managed .
You ’ll have GreenGeeks full support in hosting and managing your website , which makes using their VPS server a piece of cake .
Their entry - level VPS plan provides 4 cores , 25 GB of SSD RAID - 10 storage , 1GB of RAM and costs $ 39.95 / mo .
Their second plan provides 50 GB of SSD RAID - 10 storage , 1500 GB of bandwidth , 2GB RAM and 4 CPU cores for $ 59.95 / mo .
The third plan provides 75 GB of SSD RAID - 10 storage , 2000 GB of bandwidth , 3GB RAM and 4 CPU cores for $ 79.95 / mo .
The fourth plan provides 100 GB of SSD RAID - 10 storage , 2500 GB of bandwidth , 4 GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores for $ 99.95 / mo .
The fifth and most powerful plan 125 GB of SSD RAID - 10 storage , 3000 GB of bandwidth , 8GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores for $ 159.95 / mo .

Haskell Performance : Array Creation
Ran into another interesting performance problem while converting a small test program over to Haskell .
Let ’s say that you want to walk through every line of a text file , collate character frequencies , and return anything that maps to a particular frequency .
For purposes of explanation we ’ll do something really silly like look for lines with 10 capital ‘ A’s .
{-# OPTIONS -XBangPatterns #-} import IO import System import Data .
Word import Data .
Array .
Unboxed import Control .Monad.ST import Data .
Array .ST import qualified Data .
ByteString as B import qualified Data.
ByteString .
Internal as BI import qualified Data.ByteString .
Char8 as C counts ' !
line = do arr <- newArray ( 0 , 255 ) 0 :: ST s ( STUArray s Word8 Int ) -- collate character counts here return arr counts !
line = runSTUArray ( counts ' line ) hit !
line = let freq = counts line in freq !
65 == 10 main = do args <- getArgs f <- openFile " wordlist " ReadMode text <- B .
hGetContents f print $ length $ filter hit ( C . lines text )
This is fast ( 0.07s on 300 K test file , compiled with - O2 on a Macbook Pro ) , but there ’s no actual collation going on .
It suddenly becomes two magnitudes slower as soon as you start to do anything based on the line :
-- version 1 : 9.5 seconds counts ' !
line = do arr <- newArray ( 0 , 255 ) 0 :: ST s ( STUArray s Word8 Int ) readArray arr ( B . head line ) >>= \ v -> writeArray arr ( B . head line ) ( v + 1 ) return arr counts !
line = runSTUArray ( counts ' line )
.. equals 9.54 seconds just when you collate the first character of the string , and led me to believe that ByteStrings were slow , especially since a constant change to the array was fast ( 0.07 seconds ) :
-- version 2 : 0.07 seconds counts ' !
line = do arr <- newArray ( 0 , 255 ) 0 :: ST s ( STUArray s Word8 Int ) readArray arr 0 >>= \ v -> writeArray arr 0 ( v + 1 ) return arr
( Here I ’ll elide the hours of me messing around with profiling and whatnot to try and figure out why B.head was so slow , or how to make B.foldl ’ update a state variable , or sprinkling strictness bangs all over the place , or the other tons of false trails that I went down . )
It turns out that the slow portion in all of this is the newArray , not the character collation itself , which can be seen in the profile if the array creation is moved into its own routine and we look at the profile :
-- version 3 -- compile with : ghc - package bytestring stuarray .hs - prof - auto - all - O2 -o stuarray .
out -- run with : ./stuarray.out +RTS -p initial_array = do arr <- newArray ( 0 , 255 ) 0 :: ST s ( STUArray s Word8 Int ) return arr counts ' !
line = do arr <- initial_array let ix = B . head line readArray arr ix >>= \ v -> writeArray arr ix ( v + 1 ) return arr counts !
line = runSTUArray ( counts ' line )
… and the relevant part of the profile :
MAIN MAIN 1 0 0.0 0.0 100.0 100.0 main Main 240 1 0.7 0.3 100.0 100.0 hit Main 242 335075 0.0 0.0 99.3 99.7 counts Main 243 335075 0.0 0.2 99.3 99.7 counts ' Main 244 335075 0.0 0.0 99.3 99.5 initial_array Main 245 335075 99.3 99.5 99.3 99.5
Which brings up two interesting points :
The Haskell optimizer was so smart that it was able to figure out that the code in version 2 built a constant array … and so only called the newArray once .
( Confirmed with a profile ) .
New array creation seems to be so slow that it dominates a benchmark that has file I/O .
The Ocaml version took about 0.720 seconds ( Ocaml version below ) , compared to Haskell time of about 8.5 seconds .
Reducing the array size to 128 in both cases reduced it to 0.112 seconds for Ocaml and 4.3 seconds in Haskell .
Array size Ocaml Haskell 128 0.112 4.3 255 0.184 8.5 256 0.720 8.5
Note the discontinuity in Ocaml between 255 and 256 elements , which I find interesting .
The nice people in #haskell suggested that I stop constructing / destructing the array and instead just null it out between each line , and it turned out that the best way to do that was just to thaw a starter array .
-- version 4 : 0.11 seconds initial_array = listArray ( 0 , 255 ) ( repeat 0 ) :: UArray Word8
Int counts ' !
line = do arr <- thaw initial_array let ix = B . head line readArray arr ix >>= \ v -> writeArray arr ix ( v + 1 ) return arr counts !
line = runSTUArray ( counts ' line )
This is still kind of strange to me ( because an object is still getting constructed / destructed – thaw guarantees a copy ) but you ca n’t argue with a performance increase .
( Interestingly , using Array.copy or Array. fill in Ocaml is slower than just using Array . make ) .
Final times ?
0.11 seconds in Haskell vs. the best of 0.720 second UPDATED : 0.12 seconds in Ocaml … and the Haskell version is just 50 % slower than a C implementation with a gratuitous calloc instead of a memset .
UPDATE : An pointed out that zeroing the Ocaml array with a for loop is much faster than Array .copy or Array. fill , bringing it to about the same speed as Haskell .
Lessons learned ?
Performance is a treacherous mistress
The Haskell optimizer is awesome but you have to be wary when trying to narrow down performance problems
#haskell is always full of useful suggestions
Array creation seems to be slow enough that alternatives should be explored .
open Char open String let all_lines fn filename = let chan = open_in filename in try while true do let line = input_line chan in fn line done with End_of_file -> close_in chan let initial_array = Array .
make 256 0 let count line = let freq = initial_array in let ix = int_of_char line . [ 0 ] in for i = 0 to 255 do freq . ( i ) <- 0 done ; freq . ( ix ) <- freq . ( ix ) + 1 ; freq let hit line = let freq = count line in freq . ( 65 ) = 10 let _ = let linecount = ref 0 in all_lines ( fun line -> if hit line then linecount := !
linecount + 1 else ( ) ) " wordlist " ; print_int !

Discussion
Comments are moderated whenever I remember that I have a blog .
Quietly in public , loudly in private , climate scientists everywhere are saying the same thing : it 's over .
The years in which more than 2C of global warming could have been prevented have passed , the opportunities squandered by denial and delay .
On current trajectories we 'll be lucky to get away with 4C .
Mitigation ( limiting greenhouse gas pollution ) has failed ; now we must adapt to what nature sends our way .
If we can .
This , at any rate , was the repeated whisper at the climate change conference in Copenhagen last week .
It 's more or less what Bob Watson , the environment department 's chief scientific adviser , has been telling the British government .
It is the obvious if unspoken conclusion of scores of scientific papers .
Recent work by scientists at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , for instance , suggests that even global cuts of 3 % a year , starting in 2020 , could leave us with 4C of warming by the end of the century .
At the moment , emissions are heading in the opposite direction at roughly the same rate .
If this continues , what does it mean ?
Six ?
Eight ?
Ten degrees ?
Who knows ?
Faced with such figures , I can't blame anyone for throwing up their hands .
But before you succumb to this fatalism , let me talk you through the options .
Yes , it is true that mitigation has so far failed .
Sabotaged by Clinton , abandoned by Bush , attended halfheartedly by the other rich nations , the global climate talks have so far been a total failure .
The targets they have set bear no relation to the science and are negated anyway by loopholes and false accounting .
Nations like the UK , which is meeting its obligations under the Kyoto protocol , have succeeded only by outsourcing their pollution to other countries .
And nations like Canada , which is flouting its obligations , face no meaningful sanctions .
Lord Stern made it too easy : he appears to have underestimated the costs of mitigation .
As the professor of energy policy Dieter Helm has shown , Stern 's assumption that our consumption can continue to grow while our emissions fall is implausible .
To have any hope of making substantial cuts we have both to reduce our consumption and transfer resources to countries like China to pay for the switch to low carbon technologies .
As Helm notes , " there is not much in the study of human nature - and indeed human biology - to give support to the optimist " .
But we cannot abandon mitigation unless we have a better option .
We do n't .
If you think our attempts to prevent emissions are futile , take a look at our efforts to adapt .
Where Stern appears to be correct is in proposing that the costs of stopping climate breakdown , great as they would be , are far lower than the costs of living with it .
Germany is spending € 600 m just on a new sea wall for Hamburg - and this money was committed before the news came through that sea - level rises this century could be two or three times as great as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted .
The Netherlands will spend € 2.2bn on dykes between now and 2015 ; again they are likely to be inadequate .
The UN suggests that rich countries should be transferring $ 50 to $ 75 bn a year to poor ones now to help them cope with climate change , with a massive increase later on .
But nothing like this is happening .
A Guardian investigation reveals that the rich nations have promised $ 18bn to help the poor nations adapt to climate change over the last seven years , but they have disbursed only 5 % of that money .
Much of it has been transferred from foreign aid budgets anyway : a net gain for the poor of nothing .
Oxfam has made a compelling case for how adaptation should be funded : nations should pay according to the amount of carbon they produce per capita , coupled with their position on the human development index .
On this basis , the US should supply more than 40 % of the money and the European Union over 30 % , with Japan , Canada , Australia and Korea making up the balance .
But what are the chances of getting them to cough up ?
There 's a limit to what this money could buy anyway .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that " global mean temperature changes greater than 4C above 1990 - 2000 levels " would " exceed ... the adaptive capacity of many systems " .
At this point there 's nothing you can do , for instance , to prevent the loss of ecosystems , the melting of glaciers and the disintegration of major ice sheets .
Elsewhere it spells out the consequences more starkly : global food production , it says , is " very likely to decrease above about 3C " .
Buy your way out of that .
And it does n't stop there .
The IPCC also finds that , above 3C of warming , the world 's vegetation will become " a net source of carbon " .
This is just one of the climate feedbacks triggered by a high level of warming .
Four degrees might take us inexorably to 5C or 6C : the end - for humans - of just about everything .
Until recently , scientists spoke of carbon concentrations - and temperatures - peaking and then falling back .
But a recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that " climate change ... is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop " .
Even if we were to cut carbon emissions to zero today , by the year 3000 our contribution to atmospheric concentrations would decline by just 40 % .
High temperatures would remain more or less constant until then .
If we produce it , we 're stuck with it .
In the rich nations we will muddle through , for a few generations , and spend nearly everything we have on coping .
But where the money is needed most there will be nothing .
The ecological debt the rich world owes to the poor will never be discharged , just as it has never accepted that it should offer reparations for the slave trade and for the pillage of gold , silver , rubber , sugar and all the other commodities taken without due payment from its colonies .
Finding the political will for crash cuts in carbon production is improbable .
But finding the political will - when the disasters have already begun - to spend adaptation money on poor nations rather than on ourselves will be impossible .
The world wo n't adapt and can't adapt : the only adaptive response to a global shortage of food is starvation .
Of the two strategies it is mitigation , not adaptation , which turns out to be the most feasible option , even if this stretches the concept of feasibility to the limits .
As Dieter Helm points out , the action required today is unlikely but " not impossible .
It is a matter ultimately of human wellbeing and ethics " .
Yes , it might already be too late - even if we reduced emissions to zero tomorrow - to prevent more than 2C of warming ; but we cannot behave as if it is , for in doing so we make the prediction come true .
Tough as this fight may be , improbable as success might seem , we cannot afford to surrender .

Environment ministers overcame seven years of obstacles today and committed to reducing the world 's mercury pollution .
In a sign of America 's return to a global leadership role , United Nations environment ministers meeting in Nairobi agreed to take immediate steps to limit exposure to mercury .
The White House said it would press hard for a legally binding treaty when negotiations get under way later this year .
" The United States will play a leading role in working with other nations to craft a global , legally binding agreement that will prevent the spread of mercury into the environment , " said Nancy Sutley , chair of the White House council on environmental quality .
The Bush administration had blocked international efforts to limit mercury - although such protections are in place in America .
Mercury , which can travel thousands of miles from its original source , damages the central nervous system , and is especially dangerous to pregnant women and babies .
The treaty will include measures to reduce the supply of mercury and its use in products , such as thermomenters , and processes , like paper making .
It will also seek to cut back on mercury emissions from coal - fired power plants , which are responsible for about half of the world 's mercury pollution .
The new - found consensus in Nairobi , which saw the US , India and China lifting their resistance to a binding global mercury treaty , raised hopes for progress later this year at the crucial UN meeting in Copenhagen on an international climate change deal .
" There was a seismic shift from the American government from its previous position , " said Nick Nuttall , the spokesman for the UN environment programme .
" It was clear from the beginning of this week that the US negotiators had been given a clear line from Washington , and indeed the White House , to come together with the rest of the world and do something . "
" The US has taken a leadership role that will chart a new course on mercury protections around the world .
We have set a strong example that is already influencing others to do the same , " said Susan Egan Keane , an analyst at the US National Resources Defence Council .
Barack Obama had earlier taken a number of steps at home to break with the George Bush legacy on the environment - most notably restoring the power of government agencies to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants .
The strong push from the US side in Nairobi this week evidently helped wear down resistance from governments such as China and India .
China is heavily dependent on coal - fired power plants , while Indian manufacturers still use many processes that depend on the metal .
The eight - point plan agreed on Friday calls for reduction in mercury emissions from power plants , and in its use in thermometers and other household products , as well as in plastics production and paper - making .
It would cut down on the use of mercury in gold panning , a process that results in huge quantities of the heavy metal being washed into streams .
Mercury is a naturally occurring element , but pollution has caused levels to rise sharply in many fish species , increasing the danger to humans that eat them .
" Today the world 's environment ministers , armed with the full facts and full choices , decided the time for talking was over - the time for action on this pollution is now , " said Unep 's director , Achim Steiner .
Formal treaty negotiations will get underway later this year , with a view to reaching a final agreement in 2013 .
COLOGNE , Germany ( CNN ) -- Rescuers in Germany reduced the number of people they were searching for in a building collapse from nine to two , a fire department spokesman said late Tuesday .
CNN iReporter Andreas Gress says he could n't get near the building after work on Tuesday .
Seven people who earlier had been reported missing contacted authorities to say they were safe , the spokesman explained .
The two remaining victims are men missing from a residential building heavily damaged when another building collapsed , said the spokesman .
The spokesman said it was too dangerous to enter the residential building and that the Cologne fire department was working on stabilizing the structure so rescuers could enter it later .
The building , which housed the city 's historical archive , collapsed , damaging two other buildings -- possibly because of nearby construction underground , CNN's Ben Brumfield reported from the scene .
The building itself was an unremarkable 20th century structure , but the archives it contained were very valuable , said Brumfield , who has done research there .
" Some of the earth underneath the building that collapsed slid into the construction space , which caused a hole under the building , " he explained .
" The building fell literally into that hole and fell forward into the street .
Firefighters were using dogs to help search the rubble , and police said heavy - lifting equipment was on the way , he said .
Rescuers do not know if anyone is alive in the rubble , he said .
As many as 100 emergency vehicles were on the scene , he added .
iReport.com :
See photos of the rescue scene
The collapse of the main building tore the facade off a neighboring structure , revealing the rooms inside , photos from the scene showed ,
Rescue efforts are ongoing and are expected to last until at least midnight local time ( 4 p.m. Eastern time ) , a fire department spokesman told CNN .
The spokesman did not identify himself .
Police are evacuating all the buildings in a 150 - meter ( yard ) radius around the scene of the incident , including two schools and a retirement home housing 76 people , Brumfield said .
There will be no classes at the school Wednesday , he added .
The building did not collapse quickly , said Carlo Schlender , a reporter for German TV station RTL , a CNN affiliate .
That gave people the chance to flee .
There were " a lot of noises before ( the collapse ) .
Most of the people could hear that something was wrong and escaped from the scene , " he told CNN International 's " iDesk " program .
The fire department confirmed that everyone in the archive managed to escape before the collapse of the building , but thought some people working and living in buildings next door were not able to escape .
The city is building a new subway line under the buildings that collapsed , Susanne Motter at the Cologne tourism bureau told CNN .
It is not clear if the underground construction played a role in the incident .
But Gudrun Meyer , a spokeswoman at the Cologne Transportation Department , denied construction was taking place below the collapsed structure .
" This construction is not happening directly under the building , nor am I aware of any construction which might have caused this , " she told RTL .
The main building which collapsed is the Historic Archive of the city of Cologne , which houses documents up to 1,000 years old .
Andreas Gress , a CNN iReporter who lives near the building and passes it every day on the way to work , said he saw nothing unusual Tuesday morning at 8 a.m .
" People were working like every day , " he said .
CNN 's Per Nyberg , Nadine Schmidt and Nicole Saidi contributed to this report .
I like the idea , not sure if its supposed to be a parody on the american culture , but i like it
I like the detailed background .
wish she didnt where glasses though .

from a Fox News poll :
Reagan , as a reminder , is the Republican Godhead of the Trickle Down Theory , which stated that cutting taxes on the rich would then trickle down to create more jobs for the not - as - rich .
It did n’t work .
At all .
Instead , it created the largest expansion in income inequality in history .
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer , the national deficit went through the fucking roof and about ten years after it was instituted ( along with some deregulation that led to such proud moments as the Savings & Loan Scandal and Bailout ) , it created a crazy deficit and recession that forced Reagan ’s Veep ( the guy who famously labeled the trickle down theory “ Voodoo Economics ” ) to raise taxes , which combined with a wide - eared billionaire with a hard on about the crazy deficit it created , led to said Veep ’s own dismissal from the Big Chair .
The next guy , Clinton , raised taxes on the rich , jump - starting government revenues and leading to a balanced budget and even a surplus , as well as growth throughout his presidency .
THEN , another family money Disciple of Reagan interested in increasing the bank accounts of his wealthy friends cut the hell out of taxes again and again , and just like the first time , income inequality soared , revenues dropped , deficits got out of hand and about 10 years later we are square in the heart of another recession .
But now it seems the tide is finally turning .
As the baby boomers ( who , let ’s not forget , were also the Yuppies ) are slowly fading from power , the bloom of Reagan ’s eight years are finally starting to come off the rose and more and more people are finally looking beyond the Gipper .
It ’s about fucking time .
Stephen Colbert interviewing astronaut Garrett Reisman on the International Space Station in 2008 .
I just voted for the name Colbert here as the new name for Node 3 .
I was wondering how long it would take for Stephen Colbert to notice that NASA was holding a contest to give a new name to its node on the International Space Station , and it did n't take long
Comedian Stephen Colbert , who could n't get his mock presidential campaign off the ground , is polling better by aiming higher .
He 's convinced his many fans to write in his name in NASA 's online public vote to name a new room to be added to the international space station .
So instead of NASA 's suggested choices -- Serenity , Legacy , Earthrise or Venture -- the space station 's new addition may wind up with the name " Colbert . "
The count by mid-Tuesday had votes for the comedian just shy of 115,000 and Serenity trailing at 98,641 .
More than 451,000 people have voted .
NASA has a legalistic out .
Its contest rules say voting results " are not binding on NASA and NASA reserves the right to ultimately select a name " in keeping with its best interests .
a lot
col - berh
surrenatee
Nevertheless it 's still doubtful that this name will be chosen because NASA is n't bound to accept the results :
It would be in the best interests of NASA to name the module Colbert if the name happens to win though , simply for all the free attention the ISS would receive from the show .
Colbert has already carried out an interview with ISS astronaut Garrett Reisman both when he was on the station and afterwards , often brings Neil DeGrasse Tyson on the show ( here and here ) , and has a ton of other features and interviews that have a lot to do with space and science .
That is , in spite of the satirical nature of the show the real Stephen Colbert doesfor the promotion of space and exploration in the national consciousness .
Each one of these interviews usually results in about 30 - 50,000 hits , which perhaps is n't much compared to the two talking cats or the dramatic chipmunk , but along with being broadcast on tv before being put online it 's still a fair amount of publicity .
Colbert has failed to get his name put on a number of other projects though and of course wo n't hold a grudge if this current attempt fails ( so we 'll still have interviews with DeGrasse Tyson and astronauts and physicists and all the rest ) , but just imagine the publicity the ISS will receive if the current Node 3 receives the name Colbert and he starts a feature on what 's going on now in " his " node of the ISS .
Plus , the name Colbert ( ) is French , so that makes it a name with more of an international outreach than something like Serenity ( a French loanword but still pronounced in an English fashion -) .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - A Canadian filmmaker plans to have a mini camera installed in his prosthetic eye to make documentaries and raise awareness about surveillance in society .
Rob Spence , 36 , who lost an eye in an accident as a teen - ager , said his so - called Project Eyeborg is to have the camera , a battery and a wireless transmitter mounted on a tiny circuit board .
www.eyeborgblog.com/
“ Originally the whole idea was to do a documentary about surveillance .
I thought I would become a sort of super hero ... fighting for justice against surveillance , ” Spence said .
“ In Toronto there are 12,000 cameras .
But the strange thing I discovered was that people do n’t care about the surveillance cameras , they were more concerned about me and my secret camera eye because they feel that is a worse invasion of their privacy . ”
Spence , in Brussels to appear at a media conference , said no part of the camera would be connected to his nerves or brain .
He does not intend to create a reality TV show and the camera will be switched off when not needed , he said .
“ I do n’t want to go into a locker room .
I do n’t want to show the world me going to the bathroom either ...
I ’m not a life - caster and I do n’t plan to be one , ” he said .
Bill Maher and Ann Coulter take part in an event at Radio City Music Hall in New York .
Coulter , Maher spar at Radio City
NEW YORK — Bill Maher could n’t have asked for a better act to follow .
Maher took the stage at the Radio City Music Hall Monday after Ann Coulter – with whom he ’d spend the rest of the night debating – had held forth for 15 minutes on the sins of liberals .
The applause for Maher was huge – exactly as one might expect in not -exactly - blood - red midtown Manhattan .

“ If we were having this debate in Springfield , Mo. , it would be different , ” Maher said .
But even in mostly hostile territory , Coulter was no shrinking violet .
When moderate Mark Halperin brought up Meghan McCain ’s swipes of Coulter on The Daily Beast from earlier in the day — the daughter of the would - be president called her “ offensive , radical , insulting , and confusing all at the same time " —
Coulter said it did n’t bother her .
And Coulter dealt with the occasional boos while debating with Maher over stem cell research , Iraq and of course , the 44th president – all while delivering her own blows on everyone from Timothy Geithner to Nancy Reagan .
Coulter began her remarks by noting that it was once OK for the media to mock a candidate ’s middle name — as when James Danforth Quayle was the GOP ’s VP candidate in 1988 .
“ Does n’t the middle name ‘ Hussein ’ in a Democrat reinforce the impression of the Democrats being soft on Islamic terrorism ? ”
Coulter said , adding that she finds it “ hilarious ” when Republicans toss it around .
Coulter talked said liberals are always first to be offended — and are “ masters of finger - waving indignation . ”
She did n’t hold back on the media , either .
“ Overnight , the media went from being watchdogs for the people to guard dogs for the government .
That ’s with the exception of Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann , who are lapdogs of the government , ” she said .
“ Time magazine got the ball rolling by comparing Obama to Jesus Christ , ” Coulter said moments later .
“ So I lost a bet : They do know who Jesus Christ is . ”
Coulter riffed on the media ’s comparisons of Obama not only to Jesus , but also to Lincoln , asking : “ Did Lincoln do blow mostly in high school or did he wait until college ? ”
That ’s where Maher picked up when he got his 15 - minute shot .
“ To start off , George Bush did a lot more blow than Obama ever did , ” Maher said .
“ Please do n’t ruin the only thing I like about him . ”
Maher , the host of HBO ’s “ Real Time , ” aimed at the other side — such as congressional Republican indignation about debt .
“ Who put two wars on a credit card ? ” Maher asked .
“ There is this debt because George Bush spent money like a pimp with a week to live . ”
Maher got applause for any shots at Bush , as when he mentioned Obama ’s quoting of Voltaire — “ no George W. Bush , that ’s not a Harry Potter character . ”
He used the term “ bimbo ” to describe Bush , Quayle and Sarah Palin .
And Maher attacked those who consider themselves “ real Americans , ” by claiming that “ if it was n’t for the two coasts , this country would have been sold off to China thirty years ago . ”
While Coulter criticized the MSNBC hosts , Maher took on Rush Limbaugh .
“ We all say crazy s--t when we ’re high , ” Maher said .
“ I think it ’s interesting that he is now the undisputed leader of the Republican Party .
It shows how clueless they are .
They went looking for the future and they found radio . ”
Following the opening statement and remarks , Halperin sat down with both Coulter and Maher and began asking about Monday ’s news that Obama had ended the Bush - imposed limits on embryonic stem cell research .
That led to the two battling over Nancy Reagan , who has come out in support for Obama ’s decision .
“ Nancy Reagan was so madly in love with Ronald Reagan , ” Coulter said , “ if you told her that we could bring Ronald Reagan back to life , cure Alzheimer ’s by disemboweling everyone in this audience , she would say ‘ do it . ’ ”
Maher : “ So you ’re saying Nancy Reagan , the patron saint of the Republican party ... ”
Coulter : “ She ’s not the patron saint of the Republican party . ”
Maher : “ She ’s somebody you revere .
...
You ’ve just said she ’s bats - -t crazy . ”
Coulter responded that it ’s funny to see liberals — who once chided Reagan for following astrology — now trying to bring her into a science debate .
“ I never saw her as a seer of technology , ” she added .
The two went on to debate evolution , Iraq and whether Wall Street is full of liberal Democrats , as Coulter claimed .
But even the two political opposites had something in common — that is , in addition to enjoying talking in front of a big audience and getting publicity .
At one point , Halperin asked if the debaters thought Obama regretted any of Obama ’s personnel appointments .
Maher said he regrets Obama ’s choice of Geithner , because , he said , the treasury secretary “ sounds like he ’s sh-- ting in his pants . ”
“ Do you think he inspires confidence , or you more in the pants thing ? ” Halperin asked Coulter .
“ No , I agree with Bill 100 percent on this , ” she said .
“ We ’ve reached consensus here , ” Halperin declared .
“ You both think Tim Geithner ’s doing a bad job .
If you were Tim Geithner , and heard that Bill Maher and Ann Coulter both thought you were doing a bad job , would you say , ' Oh good ’ or ‘ That ’s a bad thing ’ ? ”
And on that , there was one more point of agreement : Both Maher and Coulter said that a Cabinet secretary would n’t want their support .

Our brains — or worse , children 's brains — could be rewired from the fast pace of modern social networking sites , TV shows , and video games , says Oxford University neuroscientist Susan Greenfield .
The researcher said this week that kids seem to have more trouble understanding each other ( in real life , that is ) and focusing in school , and that it could be due to the proliferation of short , bite - sized clips of information in the online world that is causing their brains to physically change .
Greenfield said that sites like Facebook , MySpace , Bebo , and Twitter may be forcing kids ' brains back into an infant - like state , as infants need constant stimulation to remind them that they exist .
She added that she worries that " real " conversation will eventually give way to these little snippets of text dialogue , indicating that our normal language might eventually turn into pokes , wall shout - outs , and 140 - character snark fests .
" My fear is that these technologies are infantilising the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights , who have a small attention span and who live for the moment , " she told the Daily Mail in an interview this week .
" It is hard to see how living this way on a daily basis will not result in brains , or rather minds , different from those of previous generations . "
In fact , Greenfield went so far as to suggest that a recent increase in autism diagnoses could possibly be related to kids spending more time on the computer or the video game console .
" Of course , we do not know whether the current increase in autism is due more to increased awareness and diagnosis of autism , or whether it can — if there is a true increase — be in any way linked to an increased prevalence among people of spending time in screen relationships .
Surely it is a point worth considering , " said Greenfield .
As some critics have already noted , Greenfield did n't cite any specific research when making these comments .
Facebook spokesperson Larry Yu told the Wall Street Journal that , while Greenfield was entitled to her opinion , " we have not seen anything to really back up that worry . "
March 27 , 2009  -- Luzerne County sits in the heart of northeastern Pennsylvania ; Wilkes - Barre is the county seat , a hardscrabble , blue - collar city struggling in this latest recession .
People there were shocked in January when federal prosecutors announced that respected county judges Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan had pleaded guilty to tax evasion and honest services fraud , the result of a lengthy investigation by the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI .
Yesterday the Pa. State Supreme Court overturned hundreds of convictions of low - level offenders , ruling that all juveniles who had appeared in Ciavarella 's courtroom without lawyers between 2003 and 2008 had not been adequately informed when they waived their right to counsel .
It 's not over , however , for all of the other kids Ciavarella sent to jail .
Chief Justice Ronald Castille said in a statement that Thursday 's decision was n't intended to be " a quick fix . "
" It 's going to take some time , but the Supreme Court is committed to righting whatever wrong was perpetrated on Luzerne 's juveniles and their families , " he said .
" They sold their oath of offices to the highest bidders and engaged in ongoing schemes to defraud the public of honest services that were expected from them , " Deron Roberts , chief of the FBI 's Scranton office , said at a late January news conference announcing the charges .
The arrests shed light on a mystery in Luzerne County :
Why were so many kids getting sent directly to juvenile detention after seeing Judge Ciavarella in his Wilkes - Barre juvenile court ?
And why were those kids sent away in such a rush ?
' I Had No Clue What to Say '
Eric Stefanski had never been in trouble before he found himself in front of Ciavarella , who took office in 1996 .
" I was 12 years old when I got locked up .
I had no clue what to say when he asked me how do I plead , " Eric told " 20/20 " correspondent Jim Avila .
" I was 12 years old .
I did n't know too much about the court system . "
His offense ?
He went joyriding with his mom's car and ran over a barrier , smashing the undercarriage .
No one was hurt , not even Eric , but in order get her insurance to pay for the damage , his mom , Linda Donovan , had to file a police report .
Donovan even thought an appearance before a judge would be good for her son , give him a little scare .
She was n't prepared for what happened when Eric came before Ciavarella .
" He read me my charges and said , ' How do you plead ? '
And I did n't know what to say , so I looked at my mom , and I guess she did n't know I was looking , and I said , ' Guilty , ' " Eric said .
" That 's when I turned around , I looked at my mom and she started crying . "
' The Most Egregious Abuse of Power '
Eric was locked up for two years .
He was not represented by an attorney , his mom said , because she did n't think he needed one .
" His first offense , he 's so young , I just did n't think that it was necessary , " Donovan said .
It 's not supposed to be like this in juvenile court , where incarceration is considered the last resort , legal experts said .
But Marsha Levick , deputy director of the Juvenile Law Center , a public - interest law firm in Philadelphia , said she noticed a frightening pattern in Ciaravella 's courtroom .
" I think what we have here in Luzerne County is probably the most egregious abuse of power in the history of the American legal system , " Levick said .
And she had the evidence to back it up .
" The numbers of children going into placement in Luzerne County tended to be two to three times higher than in other counties , " she said .
Levick said kids were being locked up for minor infractions .
" A child who shoplifted a $ 4 bottle of nutmeg , " she said .
" A child who was charged with conspiracy to shoplift because he was present when his friend was shoplifting .
A child who put up a MySpace page , taunting her school administrator . "
Levick turned her findings over to the FBI , and the outcome rocked the Pennsylvania justice system .
Ciavarella and Conahan , who face up to 7 years in prison , had devised a plot to use their positions as judges to pad their pockets .
They shut down the old county - run juvenile detention center by first refusing to send kids there and , then , by cutting off funds , choking it out of existence .
They then replaced the facility with a cash cow -- a privately owned lockup built by the judges ' cronies -- and forged a deal for the county to pay $ 58 million for a 10 - year period for its use .
At the time Conahan was serving as president judge of the Luzerne County Common Pleas Court , a position that allowed him to control the county - court budget .
Ciavarella was the Luzerne County juvenile court judge .
The judges entered plea agreements in federal court in Scranton in February admitting that they took more than $ 2.6 million in payoffs from the private youth detention center between 2003 and 2006 .
Prosecutors said the judges attempted to hide their income from the scheme by creating false records and routing payments through intermediaries .
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court removed them from their duties after federal prosecutors filed charges Jan. 26 .
The investigation is ongoing .
" The defendants engaged in fraud by taking millions of dollars in connection with the construction , operation and expansion of juvenile detention facilities here in Luzerne County , " U.S. Attorney Martin Carlson said .
And , according to state statistics , Ciavarella 's incarceration rates of juveniles jumped after the privately owned juvenile detention center opened .
" The information alleges that the judges ordered juveniles into these detention facilities , the facilities in which they had a financial interest , and on occasion that those orders were done despite the recommendation of juvenile probation officers that the child not be detained , not be imprisoned , " Carlson said .
Ciavarella denies having sentenced kids for cash .
" We came to a plea agreement because we would never agree that [ the kids ' sentencing ] was improper .
And that 's why in the plea agreement you do n't see any of the language , " Ciavarella said .
" I 'm not pleading guilty to anything relative to cash for kids , embezzlement , extortion , quid pro quo .
Absolutely not . "
Losing Faith in the Justice System
Dave Janoski , projects editor of the Citizens Voice newspaper of Wilkes - Barre , said , " You could see that at the very moment , when they could make the most money , that 's when the number of kids spiked . "
Wilkes - Barre residents exploded with anger when they heard that men they elected , and trusted to judge their children , had profited from their incarceration .
" There 's been a lot of outrage , " said Terrie Morgan - Besecker , staff writer for the Times Leader newspaper in Wilkes - Barre .
" I think a lot of them have lost faith in the system of justice ... that they went in there blindly thinking that they were going to talk to the judge , he was going to listen to them and hand down an appropriate punishment ... and they 're just yanked away from their parents and put in shackles , " she said .
" It just left them absolutely stunned and not believing that this could happen . "
Many people wanted to know who was looking out for the kids as they worked their way through the judicial system .
" I think that we had a conspiracy of silence going on in Luzerne County , " Levick of the Juvenile Law Center said .
" There were officers of the court , there were members of the district attorney 's office , members of probation , private lawyers , public defenders , who were in the courtroom every day .
And they had to know what was happening and whether it was by virtue of intimidation or an unwillingness to get involved .
The fact remains that nobody stood up . "
When Ciavarella was asked about families ' complaints of his rapid - fire brand of justice and trials that lasted only minutes with even first - time offenders sent to detention centers , he told " 20/20 . "
" You take a look at their file and you look to see if this was the first time they had a run-in with the law .
It might have been the first time they 're in front of me .
You may be surprised that it 's not going to be as clear - cut as they would like you to think . "
' The Judge is Incorrect '
But Arthur Grim , a Pennsylvania juvenile judge himself , who was assigned to review Ciavarella 's cases , said Ciavarella is wrong .
" Kids were in there for relatively minor first - time offenses and ended up being placed , " Grim said .
" The judge is incorrect .
" I 'm seeing cases which seem to take in the neighborhood of a minute and a half to three minutes .
...
That simply is not the way to do business . "
Chief Justice Ronald Castille of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court asked Grim to examine the juvenile cases , which could mean expunging the records of as many as 2,500 children sent into detention by Ciavarella .
" We have told Judge Grim , take it wherever it goes , " Castille said .
" And I think my court would be willing to expunge the record of every one of those juveniles if we can't eliminate the specter of taint from what Judge Ciavarella did in treating them . "

Note :
This article has been edited from a previously published version to correct statistical information about Punjabi spoken in Canada .
Saturday is Hockey Night in Punjab at the Sonds ' Malton home .
A half - hour before the first game of the night begins , Navdeep Sonds , 27 , switches on the TV and stacks pop and munchies on a table next to the couch .
As the game begins and the two Punjabi hosts start announcing , his parents also join him .
" I watched hockey regularly but since this started , I do n't think I 've missed a day , " said Navdeep , a software developer .
" I wish they could announce more games , " he said .
Navdeep will soon get his wish .
Hockey Night in Canada 's weekly Punjabi broadcast started in October when the CBC , picking up on a brief experiment from last season 's Stanley Cup , brought Parminder Singh of Toronto and Calgary 's Harnarayan Singh to call the game online and on some channels .
It has been so well received in the Punjabi community that Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment is considering Punjabi broadcasts of Leafs games two to three times a week , and even the Raptors .
And on Feb. 21 , when the Leafs play the Canucks at the Air Canada Centre – Mats Sundin 's first game against his former team – the morning practice will be opened to the Punjabi community and the two hosts will announce from the arena for the first time .
" CBC has been working on this for a while and we are extending it to other Leafs games and we are excited about it , " said Tom Anselmi , executive vice - president and COO of Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment .
" It 's all about extending hockey to a variety of different communities and engaging kids in a variety of different ways .
We 'll see how it goes . "
The logistics of additional Leafs or Raptors games are still to be worked out , said Shannon Hosford , senior director of marketing , Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment .
" But we are thrilled the hosts want to do it .
Toronto is changing and people are not from the traditional hockey backgrounds .
But they like hockey and we want them to connect with the Leafs in their own language . "
Punjabi , spoken by immigrants from north India , is the fourth most - spoken non-official language in Canada ( after English and French ) , according to a Statistics Canada 2006 census .
" I knew there is a huge Punjabi - speaking population but never thought the response would be so good , " said host Parminder Singh , 27 .
" We were surprised , too . "
A day after they announced the first game in Punjabi , a Facebook group dedicated to Hockey Night in Canada in Punjabi sprang up and within hours had a few hundred members .
After the first two games , Rogers and Bell picked it up in Toronto and Shaw did in Vancouver , and the Punjabi broadcast got its own channel .
That 's when the two hosts realized they had stumbled onto something really big .
The viewership has since multiplied many times over .
" I would say we have close to a hundred thousand viewers in Canada , " said Parminder , adding the Punjabi diaspora is one of the largest in the world .

" We 've been getting amazing feedback , " said host Harnarayan Singh , 24 , a reporter for CBC Radio in Calgary .
He 's heard how families , including grandparents , now watch the game together .
" Many parents and grandparents would earlier watch the game but they mute it because they do n't understand what the commentators are saying .
Now , they are much more involved . "
But before they could engage the community , they had to come up with a proper lexicon .
Some terms are easily translatable from field hockey , so " stick " is " soti . "
" He shoots , he scores " became " mahriaa shot , keeta goal . "
The real challenge was to find a word for " puck . "
The two settled on " tikki " based on a puck - shaped potato appetizer .
But they started calling it puck after a few games when viewers told them they understood what it was .
Another term they struggled with was icing .
Ice in Punjabi is " barf . " " Barfed " the puck sounded ridiculous and so they stuck to the English term .
The pair announce two games back - to - back , analyze and interact with viewers on a Facebook group .
They also ask game - related questions and give out prizes .
The idea is to get the community as involved in hockey as it is in basketball .
" Leafs have not been ( as ) able to tap into the ( South - Asian ) market as Raptors , " said Parminder .
" We want to change that .
Having more games in Punjabi will definitely help connect people to the game , and especially the Leafs . "
In four months , the two hosts have also become celebrities of sorts .
When they go to the gurdwara ( Sikh temple ) , children surround them , asking about their favourite players .
" It feels good to have brought hockey closer to these children , " said Parminder , a part - time host for Omni TV and a graduate student at the University of Toronto .
" We 've been told how this has made them feel more Canadian than ever before . "
The two are always looking to introduce new elements into the show – one segment may be a Punjabi take on Don Cherry 's Coach 's Corner .
" We 'll have our own Don Cherry with colourful turbans and kurtas , " the traditional long shirts worn in parts of South Asia .
For Toronto's Harminder Kaur , 23 , watching the Punjabi broadcast unites the family .
" My parents were never hockey fans but now they wo n't leave the room while the Punjabi show is on , " she said .

Everyone would be a heck of a lot better off if these people were shown the door rather than hugged and handed $ 1 million plus .
Even now they continue to suggest that if they do n’t pay millions to retain these valuable people , they will leave .
Excuse me , but who the hell lost the $ 34 billion ?
Let . Them .
Go. Now . ( h/t Carlton )
American International Group Inc. , the insurer saved from collapse by government money after losses on credit - default swaps , offered about $ 450 million in retention pay to employees of the unit that sold the derivatives , according to two people familiar with the situation .
About 400 workers at the financial products unit may get the money in two installments , said the people , who declined to be named because details of the payments were confidential .
The business was responsible for about $ 34 billion in writedowns since 2007 as the market value of swaps AIG sold to banks plunged amid the subprime mortgage market collapse .
The payments bring to more than $ 1 billion the amount AIG has committed to keep its employees from leaving .
The New York - based insurer in September took a federal bailout to avoid bankruptcy and is selling subsidiaries to repay the government .
AIG said the program was disclosed before the government rescue , which is now valued at $ 150 billion .
This is another tired excuse , much like the Citi jet for $ 50 million .
I do n’t think anyone really cares whether or not this decision was made before , during or after the government bailout .
The fact is the bailout changed everything so all bets are off .
Had the government not stepped in , every one of these people would have nothing , so I do n’t even want to hear about this excuse .

$ 4 Saved for Every $ 1 Invested ; Expanding Medicaid Services to More Low - Income Women Would More Than Pay for Itself
By providing millions of young and low - income women access to voluntary contraceptive services , the national family planning program prevents 1.94 million unintended pregnancies , including almost 400,000 teen pregnancies , each year .
These pregnancies would result in 860,000 unintended births , 810,000 abortions and 270,000 miscarriages , according to a new Guttmacher Institute report .
Absent publicly funded family planning services , the U.S. abortion rate would be nearly two - thirds higher than it currently is , and nearly twice as high among poor women .
Publicly funded family planning services are highly cost - effective .
More than nine in 10 women receiving them would be eligible for Medicaid - funded prenatal , delivery and postpartum care services if they became pregnant .
Avoiding the significant costs associated with these unintended births saves taxpayers $ 4 for every $ 1 spent on family planning .
“ The national family planning program is smart government at its best , ” says Rachel Benson Gold , the study ’s lead author .
“ Publicly funded family planning is basic health care that empowers disadvantaged women to decide for themselves when to become pregnant and how many children to have .
It reduces recourse to abortion .
And it saves significant amounts of taxpayer money . ”
More than nine million women received publicly funded contraceptive services in 2006 .
Most ( 7.2 million ) received their care from the national network of family planning centers .
Another two million women received Medicaid - funded family planning care from private doctors .
Six in 10 women who get care at a family planning center , including three out of four who are poor , consider the center to be their usual source of health care , according to the report .
“ Many low - income women get their basic health care for the year during an annual visit to a family planning center , ” says Gold .
“ The package of services they receive not only includes contraceptive counseling and the provision of a contraceptive method .
It also includes pelvic and breast exams , tests for HIV and other STIs , screenings for reproductive cancers , high blood pressure and diabetes , and referrals to other health providers when necessary .
This is essential , preventive health care for disadvantaged women . ”
Public expenditures for family planning in 2006 totaled $ 1.85 billion , with 71 % of those funds coming from the joint federal - state Medicaid program .
The role of Medicaid in funding family planning has risen dramatically since the 1980s .
The increase was driven by efforts in 21 states to expand eligibility specifically for family planning for low - income women who otherwise would not qualify for Medicaid .
“ States as varied as Texas , New York , South Carolina and Missouri have decided to undergo the cumbersome and time - consuming process to seek federal permission , known as a waiver , to expand family planning services to more women who need them , ” says Gold .
“ It ’s a popular policy because it helps women while saving public dollars .
It more than pays for itself . ”
The report recommends that Congress eliminate the waiver requirement .
Instead , states should be allowed to use the same income criteria to determine eligibility for family planning under Medicaid that they use to determine eligibility for pregnancy - related care .
“ Cutting through the red tape and doing away with the waiver is a crucial first step that should be a high priority for policymakers , ” says Gold .
“ Our report recommends other policy changes to help the national family planning program maintain and increase its effectiveness .
These include increased funding for the federal Title X program , which provides critical support to the national family planning provider infrastructure .
Policymakers also need to take a more comprehensive look at how Medicaid and Title X can best complement and strengthen each other . ”

Advertisement Residents in northern Australia have been warned to beware large crocodiles and snakes as floods sweep the area .
Three sightings of a large crocodile have been reported near Normanton , Queensland .
Officials suggested the floods have swept the animals out of rivers and into urban areas .
About two - thirds of the state has been declared a disaster zone , 17 rivers are in flood and scores of homes inundated and there is havoc on many roads .
Severe weather warnings remain in place for north Queensland .
Deputy Premier Paul Lucas said " it 's like pouring water over a wet towel " adding the state cannot take much more heavy weather .
Crocs alert Local media said huge crocodiles in the centre of some towns around the Gulf of Carpentaria have hampered rescue efforts and large numbers have reportedly been seen swimming towards the 60 km - wide ( 37 - mile ) mouth of the flooded Norman River .
Manager of the Albion Hotel in Normanton , Donna Smith , said a four - metre ( 13ft ) crocodile had been seen stalking residents and dogs in the flooded main street .
She also warned the town was expected to run out of beer in two days .
" We can put up with a lot of drama , no fruit and veggies , but nobody wants a pub with no beer , " Ms Smith told Brisbane 's Courier - Mail newspaper .
A crocodile measuring 1.6 metres ( 5.2 ft ) long was run over by a car on a street in the city of Townsville on Tuesday , wildlife rangers said .
The croc lost a few teeth and suffered bruising but was receiving medical attention , they said .
Supply barges
Some towns are virtually underwater and others will be isolated for weeks by floodwaters , officials said .
Queensland officials say the state cannot take much more water " Unrelenting rain and flooding has battered North Queensland over recent weeks and the Queensland government is working hard to ensure residents are receiving the financial assistance and support they need , " Communities Minister Lindy Nelson - Carr said in a statement on Wednesday .
The flooding started last December , at one point closing major inland mines , and has continued , fed by a series of rain depressions and a cyclone .
Some of the worst flooding was in the coastal sugar town of Ingham with residents forced to use boats to move around ; 3,000 homes were damaged by flooding .
Normanton in northwest Queensland has been isolated for four weeks .
Barges loaded with essential supplies have been supplying the area from Cairns on the northeast coast .

As shares in many companies reel from the economic crisis , a few are beginning to reassess their entire set of risks to regain the trust of investors .
Water waste has risen as a concern amid the 2007 drought in the U.S. Southeast , the current California water crisis and concerns that rising temperatures will eliminate mountain glaciers in China , India and other countries , leading to greatly reduced summer river flows .
“ Where will the water come from if not from these glaciers ? ” said Jason Morrison , an expert at the Pacific Institute and lead author of “ Water Scarcity and Climate Change , ” a report commissioned by Ceres released Thursday .
“ Climate experts understand that water will become one of the most significantly affected resources as the result of climate change , but most in the private sector have n’t appreciated that , ” he said .
The investors want companies to measure not only their direct use of water , like that used directly to make products , but also water used deeper down the supply chain .
WATER FOOTPRINTS
Some companies have started to drill down the supply chain to measure their water footprints , much like a wave of companies before them have measured their carbon emissions .
Late last year , companies such as PepsiCo , Coca - Cola Co , SABMiller Plc and Unilever partnered with environmental and governmental groups to form the Dutch - based Water Footprint Network which helps companies measure their thirst .
The network estimates , for example , that producing 2.2 pounds of beef ( 1 kg ) takes an average of 4,230 gallons of water ( 16,000 liters ) for the irrigation of feed crops and other inputs .
A cup of coffee takes about 37 gallons of water .
Much water is replaced through natural cycles , but as water is siphoned off for agriculture , businesses and home use , aquifers are drained faster than they are being recharged .
Companies face risk not only from losing immediate supply but also from toughening regulations , Morrison said .
The sectors most at risk are agriculture , high - tech components such as semiconductors , and beverages .
In 2004 a Coca - Cola plant was forced to shut in India after locals said the company was depleting water supplies .
Potential shutdowns across the range of businesses could damage corporate reputations , Morrison said .
Companies that have been polluting water supplies with factories in developing countries like China could face the risk of rising regulatory costs as governments adopt tougher environmental laws .
To be sure , the sheer volume of water a company uses is not always a good indicator of its impact on supplies .
Water used in a dry region is different than that used in a wet one .
For that reason the Water Footprint Network is also starting to measure the impacts of heavy use in the most water - stressed regions .
Derk Kuiper , the director of the network , said the group should make progress on that issue before the year ends .
Once companies measure and understand their water intake they can begin to cut their use or invest in offsets like efficient irrigation projects .
Still , not many are taking part .
“ A preponderance of companies are not looking at the risks , ” said Lubber .
Over the past week , an extraordinary wave of “ Tea Party ” protests has erupted across America .
Citizens around the country have expressed outrage at the government ’s mishandling of the financial crisis .
And one of the most intriguing developments has been a resurgence in interest in Ayn Rand ’s classic novel Atlas Shrugged .
Denver ’s Tea Party protest opened with a reading from Atlas Shrugged .
A sign at the New York City protest read , “ Ayn Rand Was Right . ”
One banner at the Atlanta Tea Party said , “ Read Atlas Shrugged Before It Happens . ”
The Ayn Rand Institute reports that sales of Atlas Shrugged have nearly tripled compared to last year due to Americans ’ concerns about the economic crisis .
So why has there been such a renewed interest in Ayn Rand ?
Stephen Moore identified one reason in his Wall Street Journal column , “ Atlas Shrugged : From Fiction to Fact in 52 Years . ”
Atlas Shrugged depicted a future in which America descends into economic chaos due to ever - increasing government regulations .
Each new problem spawns new government controls that merely deepen the crisis .
The result is a downward spiral that nearly destroys America .
Many Americans are finding Rand ’s predictions uncomfortably close to real - life events .
Another reason for Rand ’s appeal is her emphasis on the moral dimension .
One of her themes was that no country can survive when its government constantly punishes good men for their virtues and rewards bad men for their vices .
Americans correctly recognize that it is unjust for the government to take money from those who have lived frugally to bail out those who have lived beyond their means .
Honest men should not be forced to pay for the irresponsibility of others .
Finally , Atlas Shrugged resonates with many Americans because they recognize that our current crisis is not just about bailouts and budget deficits .
It ’s also about a more fundamental issue — the proper scope of government .
Ayn Rand was a tireless defender of the principle that the only proper function of government was to protect individual rights .
As she wrote in Atlas Shrugged : “ If man is to live on earth , it is right for him to use his mind , it is right to act on his own free judgment , it is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his work .
If life on earth is his purpose , he has a right to live as a rational being . ”
Hence , men require a government that protects their rights to life .
All other rights — such as our rights to free speech , property , and contract — flow from that basic right .
Only physical force or fraud can violate our rights .
Hence , the government protects our rights by protecting us from criminals who steal , murder , rape , etc. , as well as from foreign aggressors .
Otherwise , the government should leave honest people alone to live peacefully .
In particular , the government should protect our right to enjoy the fruits of our labors , not rob us to bail out failing businesses or to fund massive welfare - state programs such as “ universal health care . ”
America was founded on the principle of individual rights .
The Founding Fathers understood this when they declared that all men possessed the rights to “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ”
Ayn Rand understood this when she wrote Atlas Shrugged .
But unless today ’s Tea Party protesters rediscover and reaffirm this principle of individual rights , their movement will fizzle , just as similar protests fizzled after an initial burst of outrage following the 2005 Supreme Court Kelo decision allowing the government to take away a person ’s home via “ eminent domain . ”
America ’s future is at stake .
Do we want to enlarge an already - bloated welfare state that tramples on our rights and strangles the economy ?
Or do we want a limited government that protects our rights and allows individuals to prosper and thrive ?
If Americans wish to save America , we must couple our outrage at the government bailouts with a positive vision of a properly limited government .
Fortunately , Atlas Shrugged offers us such a vision .
Americans should demand a government that respects our rights to “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ”
Now that would be change I could believe in .
“ If we do n’t act swiftly and boldly , ” declared President - elect Barack Obama in his latest weekly address , “ we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double - digit unemployment . ”
If you ask me , he was understating the case .
The fact is that recent economic numbers have been terrifying , not just in the United States but around the world .
Manufacturing , in particular , is plunging everywhere .
Banks are n’t lending ; businesses and consumers are n’t spending .
Let ’s not mince words :
This looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second Great Depression .
So will we “ act swiftly and boldly ” enough to stop that from happening ?
We ’ll soon find out .
We were n’t supposed to find ourselves in this situation .
For many years most economists believed that preventing another Great Depression would be easy .
In 2003 , Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago , in his presidential address to the American Economic Association , declared that the “ central problem of depression - prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . ”
Milton Friedman , in particular , persuaded many economists that the Federal Reserve could have stopped the Depression in its tracks simply by providing banks with more liquidity , which would have prevented a sharp fall in the money supply .
Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , famously apologized to Friedman on his institution ’s behalf : “ You ’re right .
We did it .
We ’re very sorry .
But thanks to you , we wo n’t do it again . ”
CAIRO , Feb 8 ( Reuters ) -
An Egyptian boy has contracted the bird flu virus , the state - run news agency quoted the Health Ministry saying on Sunday , in the second such case in the last week and the 55th case since the virus reached Egypt in 2006 .
The eighteen - month - old boy -- Abu al - Wafa Suleiman Abu Omar , from the province of Minia in central Egypt -- first showed symptoms on Friday after coming into contact with dead birds and was admitted to hospital on Saturday .
He was administered the antiviral drug Tamiflu and is now in a stable condition , the health ministry said .
On Wednesday , the ministry reported a two - year - old boy in the Suez province was in hospital after contracting the virus .
Egypt is one of the only countries affected by bird flu that does not offer compensation for farmers when poultry is destroyed , which many experts say is the best way to ensure rapid detection of new outbreaks .
Some 5 million Egyptian households depend on poultry as a main source of food and income .
Since 2003 , the virus has infected 404 people in 15 countries and killed 254 of them .
It has killed or forced the destruction of more than 300 million birds .
Egypt has had the most cases outside of Asia .

Natasha Gray posed for a modelling website
A PE teacher faces disciplinary action after pictures of her in a range of " completely inappropriate " poses appeared on a modelling website .
In one photograph , Natasha Gray was shown wearing a thong and lying on her front on a bed .
Ben Slade , head teacher of Manor Community College in Cambridge , said the head of PE should not have posed for these pictures .
" They were completely inappropriate for somebody who is a teacher , " he said .
" They were absolutely not pornographic but do you want to see your teacher in that way ?
Probably not . "
' Inappropriate behaviour '
Mr Slade said he had ordered the immediate removal of the portfolio of " about eight " photographs from the website iModel.com after he became aware of them .
He said they featured Miss Gray in a range of poses , including one " lying on a bed on her front in a thong " .
Ben Slade said Miss Gray 's actions were inappropriate
" The school has clearly defined policies on how staff should present themselves both in and out of school , " said Mr Slade .
" These include the standards of behaviour expected of them at school and in their personal lives .
" Neither the school nor the governing body will tolerate anything - from staff or pupils - which may bring the school 's name into disrepute .
" I'm in consultation with our personnel department and with the local authority in relation to further action . "
He said Miss Gray had not been suspended but he said he felt " let down " by her actions .
" We 're trying to improve things here , " said Mr Slade .
" Results have gone up considerably in the last two years - from 32 % achieving 5 A - C grades at GCSE to 50 % .
" I 'm extremely disappointed that this member of staff has let us down . "
Miss Gray was not available for media interviews .
What do you mean with the phrase , “ Every Knee Shall Bow ? ”
Interestingly , the strongest hints in the Bible of the possibility of extra-terrestrial entities are found in the first and last books – Genesis and Revelation .
Genesis 2:1 says , “ Thus the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them . ”
After the “ war in heaven ” described in Revelation Chapter 12 , the 12th verse reads “ Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them .
Woe to the inhabitors of the earth … ” Clearly a distinction is made that there are those that live on the earth , and those that do not .
Checking the original languages , heavens refers to both the seeming metaphysical “ abode of God ” ( Strong ’s 3774 Greek ) and “ the realm above the clouds , where celestial bodies revolve ” ( 8064 Hebrew ) .
The honest Bible scholar will admit that these references could refer to angelic beings .
It is clear from the scriptures however that only Adam was made in God ’s image , created to exercise dominion on this planet ( Gen 1:26 - 28 ) .
No other living being (s ) have authority to speak for God or rule on earth .
After The Fall however , the Bible teaches that “ Adam begat a son in his image ( fallen ) , in his own likeness … ” ( Gen 5:3 ) .
Now we are born into this world separated from God , without His authority or dominion .
Enter the God-man .
Referred to in scripture as “ the last Adam , ” God became flesh and dwelt among us .
“ He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not ” ( John 1:10 ) .
The creator of the universe walked on the earth in the form of the man , Jesus Christ – “ Who is the image of the invisible God …
For by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth … all things were created by him … and having made peace through the blood of his cross to reconcile all things to himself , whether they be things on earth or things in heaven … ” ( Colossians 1:15 - 20 ) .
The astounding claim of the Bible is both that there are beings that do not live or exist on earth , and that Jesus Christ is credited with their creation .
Jesus ’ death and resurrection offers redemption from the curse of Adam , as the sin that separated humanity from God was atoned for at the cross .
Now each of us has a choice to make – whether to be reconciled to God by faith in this redemption .
The Bible teaches that all intelligent life – whether on earth or the outermost heavenly realms – will one day confess that Jesus Christ is the true Lord of ALL creation .
“ God has given him a name which is above every name – that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord … ” Philippians 2:9-11 .
Modern channelers and contactees sometimes report that Jesus is actually with or directing the aliens they speak to , but it is not Jesus of the Bible they are speaking of , or even authentic aliens they are found to be speaking to .
Put them to the tests described in 1 John 4:1 and 1 Cor 12:3 – they will flee or become extremely irritated with you !
We are told in the Bible to have communications only with “ spirits ” that will confess the fleshly incarnation of God in Jesus Christ .
Good angels will confess that God came to Earth in the flesh , as Jesus of Nazareth .
But according to all modern accounts , the so - called “ aliens ” being reported today teach doctrines that are in 180 degree opposition to the Bible – just as false gods and fallen angels always have .
Would intelligent beings travel the cosmos solely to discredit one religion ?
The angelic understanding of Eph 6 combined with the fact that abductions are stopped in Jesus ’ name ( below ) places a new burden on the ufologist to PROVE that these are authentic beings from other worlds , rather than fallen angels .
The “ extra - terrestrial hypothesis ” simply does not hold up to scrutiny .
In search for the truth of what ’s out there , know that wherever one is from ( Earth , or the Pleadian star system ) , it ’s not a matter of IF one chooses to confess Jesus as Lord and bow before him , only WHEN .
So choose your allegiances carefully , as many seek to lead us away from the truth : “ Then shall he say to them , Depart from me into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels ” ( Matt 25:41 ) .
Every knee of every creature in all creation shall bow before Jesus one day , and every tongue confess that He is the Lord of All .
Our purpose is to exalt Him , offering you that choice today .
“ To all who believed in his name , he gave the right to become children of God … ” John 1:12
What is meant by the phrase “ Resistance is Fertile ? ”
However , the church is authorized to war only “ in the Spirit , ” ie , by prayer , fasting , and proclamation of God ’s Word .
Today , “… our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms . ”
Ephesians 6:12
This is what Alien Resistance does – offer freedom .
Despite the reputation “ greys ” and others may have , they are not unstoppable .
“ Submit yourselves therefore to God ; resist the devil , and he will flee … ”
James 4:7 .
MANY case histories are listed on our website of people terminating abductions by using the authority of Jesus Christ .
This serves to help prove the hypothesis that the “ alien ” phenomenon is merely a deceptive guise , interpreted over history in many forms ( such as medieval fairies , sirens of the sea , and the man - gods of world mythology ) .
Deception is involved , but the beings are real , and dangerous to all humanity – seeking worship , sacrifice , and some even claiming to be our creators , according to most UFO cults .
However , these deceptions are being openly challenged , and the numbers of people being set free from the lie grows daily .
People are finding freedom in Christ .
Resistance is Fertile !
This is one of several shortened indices into the Quantum Physics Sequence .
It is intended for students who are having trouble grasping the meaning of quantum math ; or for people who want to learn the simple math of everything and are getting around to quantum mechanics .
There 's a widespread belief that quantum mechanics is supposed to be confusing .
This is not a good frame of mind for either a teacher or a student .
Complicated math can be difficult but it is never , ever allowed to be confusing .
And I find that legendarily " confusing " subjects often are not really all that complicated as math , particularly if you just want a very basic - but still mathematical - grasp on what goes on down there .
This series takes you as far into quantum mechanics as you can go with only algebra .
Any further and you should get a real physics textbook - once you know what all the math means .
" I am not entirely sure what it entails , but I am very smart , a quick learner and flexible .
I am also able to recognize an opportunity as it presents itself and take advantage of it , even if it arrives disguised as a photo of a sheet cake . "

Employment minister Tony McNulty has said he did nothing wrong by claiming second - home expenses on a London house where his parents live .
He received allowances worth thousands of pounds for the property in his Harrow East constituency , which is eight miles from his main home .
He said he made " considerable " use of the home and it allowed it him to do his job more effectively .
But he said " anomalies " in the expenses system did need to be looked at .
' Constituency base ' Details of Mr McNulty 's expense claims , the latest to be made about a leading MP , appeared in the Mail on Sunday newspaper .
The MPs ' Additional Costs Allowance of up to £ 24,000 a year goes to MPs from outside inner London to cover the cost of staying away from their main home when carrying out parliamentary duties .
I have said these things need to be looked at
Tony McNulty , employment minister Mr McNulty told Sky News that he had been claiming money for the home when he had been working there two or three days a week .
He stopped claiming the allowance in January because interest rates had fallen so much that he could afford to pay the mortgage from his MP 's salary .
However , he said that he still used the house regularly , especially on weekends .
" I think I can do my job more effectively having my base in the constituency , " he said .
Mr McNulty said he had complied with the rules on second homes for MPs from outside inner London but that the system did need reviewing in light of recent allegations .
" I have said these things need to be looked at , " he said .
" There are anomalies . "
" If transparency is not quite there in terms of the additional costs allowance then perhaps we need to look at them again . "
Mr McNulty said every MP had to clear their own arrangements with the Commons authorities but the idea that all MPs were " at it " in trying to manipulate the system was simply wrong .
The BBC 's political correspondent Ross Hawkins said Mr McNulty believed he had stayed both within the letter and the spirit of the regulations on second home expenses .
But he added that some people might question where these arrangements provided value for money .
New home
The MP lived in the house in Harrow with his parents before he got married to his second wife , Christine , in 2002 .
Mr McNulty then moved into her home about eight miles away in Hammersmith , west London .
Under parliamentary rules
Mr McNulty can claim an allowance for a second home in his constituency even though it is only 11 miles from Westminster .
Mr McNulty 's spokesman earlier told the Press Association that the MP was " completely compliant with all the regulations around the allowances for second homes " .
" There is absolutely nothing irregular in Tony 's situation , " he said .
Earlier this year Home Secretary Jacqui Smith had to defend her actions after it emerged she had claimed about £ 116,000 in expenses for her family home in the West Midlands after declaring her sister 's property in London - where she stayed four days a week - as her main residence .
Ms Smith said the Commons authorities had approved her conduct while the parliamentary standards watchdog said there was no need for an investigation .
MPs ' allowances became the subject of controversy when it emerged last year that Conservative Derek Conway had paid his sons to act as researchers while both were students .
The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee found he had overpaid them and ordered him to repay some of the money .
In February this year , Parliament 's Committee on Standards in Public Life decided against launching an inquiry into MPs ' allowances .
The committee felt new arrangements for auditing their expenses were " a significant step forward " on their own .

Guest blogger Paul Spinrad first wrote about meme warfare in Adbusters # 11 .
In politics , I think there are two competing motivations for voters to support a cause publicly .
One is to influence the majority to agree , to make changes that you believe in , and the other is to distinguish your opinions as superior to most other peoples ' .
These two motivations generally cause people to act in similar ways , but I 've found some " tells " that reveal the underlying elitist motivation :
Leaving up losing campaign stickers and signs long after the election is over .
( I passed a Ron Paul window sign today … )
Dressing and behaving at political demonstrations in a non-respectful way ( partying , trying to " shock people out of their complacency , " etc. ) .
Saying that it requires superior knowledge or compassion to arrive at the views you hold .
Saying that it makes you " uncomfortable " or " scared " that a group you do n't identify with actually agrees with your view .
Under a democracy , the elitist motivation is self - defeating :
If your true aim is to distinguish yourself from the masses , you really do n't want your side to win– your aim is better served when more people vote the other way , and then you can be disgusted with most peoples ' stupidity and wash your hands of responsibility .
With religion , I think atheists have the same dissonance going on .
If they really think the world would be better off without religion , they should n't hate religion and call believers fools .
Any successful new belief system must appreciate the beauty of what it 's replacing and strive for backwards - compatibility .
If Matthew 1:1 - 16 had n't explained how Jesus ' lineage fulfills the prophecy in Isaiah 1:1 - 5 , it would n't have gotten where it is today .
So I put it to declared atheists – the ones who fly the flag about it , not the ones who are quiet or closeted :
Do you think that most of humanity is A ) hopeless and doomed to kill each other because of their stupid religious beliefs , or B ) capable of coming to and benefiting from your views ?
I think closeted atheists who participate in other religious activities are the future of atheism .
They know that prayer feels good without a needing brain scientist to tell them , and they know you do n't need God to want to feed the hungry , heal the sick , and provide homes for the orphaned .
What if they simply stopped reciting the words that they did n't agree with during religious services , without calling attention to it ?
In many places I do n't think they would be kicked out or turned upon and beaten just for that .
An atheism that 's well - designed for broad appeal would n't need miracles .
What miracles do for a belief system is ensure greater investment on the part of the adherent .
If something 's easily believable , it 's easy to take or leave , but doubtful claims require a leap and then ongoing mental maintenance .
If a group subscribes to some miraculous claim , it demands shared support , repetition , declarations , indoctrination , etc. – all of which bind the group together .
For a new atheism , the miracle - we - believe function would be served by the question of whether the whole scheme could actually succeed .
If the " us " people say yes and are excited at the prospect while the " them " people view it as absurd , that 's the identical , effective dynamic .
Meanwhile , I 'm putting The Crooked Letter on my reading list– it sounds great !
Qasab is alleged to have opened fire on commuters Indian police have charged the man identified as the sole surviving gunman from the Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks with " waging war " against the country .
Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab , a Pakistani , was not in court for security reasons .
Two Indians did appear and were charged with being accomplices .
The charge sheet relating to November 's attacks runs to more than 11,000 pages .
Nine gunmen were shot dead in the attacks on the financial capital .
In all , more than 170 people died .
India accused Pakistan - based militants from the banned group Lashkar - e - Taiba of carrying out the attacks .
Pakistan has admitted they were partly planned on its soil .
' Confident ' Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab was arrested on 26 November - Indian law required charges to be laid in court within 90 days of detention .
KEY NAMES AMONG 35 WANTED Hafiz Mohammad Saeed@Hafiz Saab Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi Abu Hamza Abu al - Kama@Amjad Abu Kaahfa Mujamiil@Yusuf Zarar Shah Abu Bashir Two Indian nationals - Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed - were present in the Mumbai court along with their lawyers on Wednesday .
They are accused of scouting for the attacks .
" Ajmal Qasab , Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed have been charged under various acts , including murder , attempt to murder and damaging public property , " special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told reporters as he left court .
He said the trial would be held in the maximum - security Arthur Road jail .
All three men could face the death penalty if found guilty .
Mr Nikam said 35 others were named as wanted in the charge sheet .

Mr Nikam said : " The charge sheet contains details of evidence pertaining to how the conspiracy was hatched , how the gunmen entered Mumbai and the training in Pakistan .
" It does not establish any connection to the underworld of Mumbai nor does it mention any Inter - Services Intelligence ( Pakistan intelligence agency ) or Pakistani army officials . "
Mumbai joint police commissioner Rakesh Maria told reporters : " We 're very confident of our case ... there 's a lot of evidence . "

The charge sheet is the result of painstaking investigations by Mumbai police , says the BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Mumbai .
OTHER MAIN QASAB CHARGES
Firing at CST station Firing inside and outside Cama Hospital Hijacking of Skoda vehicle Murder of MV Kuber boatman Firing at Girgaum Chowpatty beach Relations between India and Pakistan have worsened considerably since the November attacks .
As well as accusing Lashkar - e - Taiba of being behind them , India suggested that " state actors " in Pakistan were also involved .
Delhi has submitted a list of suspects to Pakistan and demanded they be handed over .
Both Pakistan and Lashkar have denied involvement .
However , Pakistan 's investigation this month found that at least nine suspected attackers had sailed from Karachi to Mumbai in three boats in November .
Pakistan says it has indicted eight people , six of whom have already been arrested , and that any trials will take place on its soil .

Have you ever heard of E - Prime ?
Critical thinkers use it as a tool to write , speak and think more clearly and accurately .
Learn how you can use it to sharpen your critical thinking abilities , avoid mental traps and become a better thinker .
An E - Prime Primer
The term E - Prime ( short for English Prime ) refers to a dialect that completely removes the verb ‘ to be ’ in all its forms from the English language .
It turns out that the use of the verb to be alone may respond for a great deal of faulty reasoning we commonly find .
Intentionally or not , people tend to abuse that verb , perpetuating a way of thinking that hinders proper critical thinking .
E - Prime helps bring awareness to how we use language and how it impacts thinking .
It serves as a practical starting point for a less dogmatic way of thinking , and it goes much further than merely finding word substitutions for the missing ‘ to be’s .
Now , consider for a minute how much you use the verb to be .
Eliminating it from language means you ca n’t say sentences such as “ The sky is blue ” , “ John is smart ” or even the simplest “ I ’m hungry ” .
In fact , by my own reckoning , I estimate that about half of the phrases we say contain to be in some form .
Although we can easily reword “ I ’m hungry ” as “ I feel hungry ” , in many cases the E - Prime conversion shows itself far from trivial .
Before jumping right into using E - Prime , we must ponder the reasons to learn it and the benefits we may gain from not using the verb to be .
Why bother with E - Prime at all ?
9 Ways E - Prime Can Help You Become a Better Thinker
1. It Exposes Opinions Disguised as Facts
Consider “ Beethoven is the best composer ever ” , or “ This is a stupid idea ” .
These sentences illustrate how we express opinions as if they represented established facts .
Getting rid of to be helps us remember that much of what we say represents , as a matter of fact , just opinions .
Consider the E - Prime alternatives for those sentences : “ I like Beethoven ’s compositions best ” , and “ I utterly dislike this idea ! ” .
2. It Promotes Higher Accuracy and Exposes Hidden Assumptions
Refraining from using the verb to be may require you provide much more detail than usual .
For instance , when rewording “ Jack is smart ” , you could end up with “ Jack scored 140 on his IQ test ” or maybe “ Jack earns money without working ” — depending on your definition of ‘ smart ’ .
E - Prime encourages you to detail ambiguous words ( such as ‘ smart ’ ) , helping expose any hidden assumptions behind them .
3 . It Reveals the ( Fallible ) Observer
Consider the statement “ The Earth is round ” .
Notice how the verb to be carries with it an intellectual momentum of completeness , finality , and time - independence .
It sounds like an absolute , immutable truth , does n’t it ?
Yes , it does … exactly like the statement “ The Earth is flat ” just a few hundred years ago .
The alternative E - Prime construct “ The Earth looks round ” shows that an observer exists — an observer that simply perceives the Earth as round — and that this observer may have flaws in perception .
E - Prime brings back a certain ‘ humbleness ’ in language , getting rid of the “ God Mode ” in speech and reminding us we make mistakes .
4. It Avoids Premature Judging and Labeling
E - Prime discourages abstractions that lead to labeling and prejudice .
Contrast “ Mary is Christian ” with “ Mary believes in the existence of Christ ” .
While these two sentences have the same meaning , the E - prime version avoids any prejudices associated with the label ‘ Christian ’ .
As a side note , labeling happens not only when dealing with other people , but with ourselves .
If you find yourself saying “ I ’m a pig ! ” , try the E - Prime “ I eat like a pig ” , or , going further , “ I ate twice as much as I usually do at dinner ” .
5 . It Brings the Role Players Back
When using E - Prime , you ’ll soon notice that using passive voice can get very hard .
Although this looks limiting at first , I can tell that you ’ll hardly miss passive voice once you get used to it .
When you ca n’t resort to uncompromising statements such as “ Mistakes were made ” , you ’ll have to rephrase it as , say , “ Steve made a mistake ” .
Or , if you really do n’t know ( or do n’t want to expose ) the doer , you could use “ Someone in this room made a mistake ” .
This latter statement still rises as a superior alternative to the former , since at least you explicitly point out that exists a doer behind the action .
6. It Makes Language More Colorful
Before using it , I believed that E - Prime would make language more convoluted , duller and less personal .
Granted , your language may suffer if you have just taken your first steps in E - Prime ( like me ) .
However , with a little bit of practice , you ’ll notice that E - Prime provides an excellent opportunity for a much more vibrant and vigorous way of writing .
( Or do you think I did n’t consider the verb to be before choosing provides in the previous sentence ? )
E - Prime promotes not only richer verb diversity but also improvements in style , too .
If forced to rewrite common sentences such as “ Sarah is wealthy ” , one can come up with many stylistically superior variations instead , such as “ Sarah possesses many riches ” .
7. It Stimulates Debate
“ You ’re wrong ” !
In E - Prime , this easily turns into “ I do n’t see it that way ” .
This style of communication immediately opens the possibility for debate , without the need to overturn the other person ’s statements first .
Declarations such as “ I liked the movie ” invite healthy discussion and the sharing of different opinions — much more enticingly than the usual “ The movie was good ” .
In E - Prime , we deal with perceptions , not absolute truths .
And perceptions never override each other , and thus can never clash .
8 . It Improves Creativity
E - Prime can also help in the realm of creativity and problem solving .
Firstly , it dissolves notions such as “ There is no solution ! ” , turning them into superior choices such as “ I have n’t found any solutions ( yet ) ” .
More than that , E - Prime helps you overcome generalizations and get to the facts more objectively , enabling you to find solutions initially overlooked .
After some E - Prime reframing , “ The customer is stupid ! ” could become “ The customer wo n’t buy our product even though it costs less ” .
The latter makes a much better starting point for coming up with solutions than the former .
9 . It Exercises Your Brain
If for nothing else , try E - Prime for an excellent brain workout !
Trust me , you ’ll never know how challenging it gets if you do n’t try it .
Learning E - Prime feels exactly like learning a new language , except that instead of learning new constructs , you must ‘ unlearn ’ part of what you already know .
It will fire up your neurons !
Parting Words
Before I finish this , let me say that E - Prime does not come without its imperfections .
Many people expressed valid criticism , which I agree with in many ways .
Granted , E - Prime does not immunize you from falling into the traps of thinking I described .
You can still state opinions as facts in E - Prime .
You can still lie , deceive and express prejudice .
Worse yet , you can still continue using to be implicitly , hiding the actual words but keeping it in spirit .
Also , for many people , E - Prime goes too far in eliminating to be altogether .
In fact , many instances of to be do n’t present any problems .
For that reason , some have decided to adopt ‘ lighter ’ versions of E - Prime that allow some particular usages of to be .
For me , E - Prime symbolizes more a way of thinking than a mere grammar restriction .
Its main goal consists of bringing a higher awareness on how language affects our thoughts — and not of enforcing a strict , blind limitation to language .
It has more to do with developing new habits of thinking than with adhering to it rigidly .
Although I do n’t plan to abandon regular English in favor of E - Prime , I still believe that everyone can benefit from trying it , if only for a while .
Make a short trial and see for yourself how it affects your thinking and your awareness of your and other people ’s language .
Additional Resources
I barely scratched the surface when it comes to E - Prime .
If you want to get practical tips on forming sentences in E - Prime , or if you want to understand E - Prime implications more deeply , the Internet has many resources for you .
Let me point out some of the best I ’ve found :
What Do You Think ?
This article comes as my first attempt to publish an article in E - Prime .
As I took my first steps in E - Prime only a couple of weeks ago , let me know if the article sounds too awkward .
Thank you !
P.S. : How about leaving your comments in E - Prime ?

Out of his depth : a Garda operation foils the suspected car thief , who finally realises the game 's up when a detective draws his gun
A man appeared in a Dublin court yesterday following an incident involving a high speed chase which ended when a car was driven into Dublin Bay .
John Redmond ( 32 ) , of North Clarence St , Dublin , was before Dublin District Court charged with the unauthorised taking of a car .
The court heard that Redmond was arrested on Greenfield Road in Sutton on Saturday and brought to Clontarf Garda Station .
Mr Redmond was handed a copy of the charge sheet and said “ I apologise ” after caution , the court was told .
His solicitor , Tony Collier , said there would be no application for bail .
He said that his client had “ psychiatric difficulties ” and “ very much needs to see a doctor ” .
Mr Redmond made no comment during the brief appearance .
The court also heard that there was a Circuit Court warrant in existence for the accused who is charged under Section 112 of the Road Traffic Act .
Mr Redmond was remanded in custody to Cloverhill Court to appear again on April 6 .
It was directed that he receive the appropriate psychiatric and medical attention while in custody .
The car chase ended when the car was driven into the sea into Dublin Bay at Sutton Strand .
Mr Redmond was arrested by detectives after he abandoned his car and waded further out to sea .

Linux kernel advances
An introduction to what 's new in versions 2.6.28 and 2.6.29
At the end of 2008 , the 2.6.28 kernel surfaced .
Subsequently , the merge window for the next release — 2.6.29 — opened .
As the Linux kernel uses a distributed development process , it 's not always clear what 's coming ( or will be integrated ) into a given kernel release , but the last two have been interesting from both a short - and long - term perspective .
One interesting milestone for 2.6.28 is that it's the first time Linux has exceeded 10 million lines of source code ( see Figure 1 , which uses source line count data from Heise Online ) .
Figure 1 . Lines of source code in recent 2.6 kernels
These releases have introduced new file systems ( one stable , one experimental ) , new support for graphics and virtualization , and new enterprise storage features .
I start with a review of some of the major new features in 2.6.28 , then I explore what you might expect from 2.6.29 .
What 's new in 2.6.28 ?
Linux kernel 2.6.28 was released on December 24 , 2008 ( at release 5 as of early February , 2009 ) .
This first release of 2.6.28 includes a large number of changes — so large that the change - log text file is itself almost 6MB in size .
This release is viewed as so stable that it's the kernel of the next Ubuntu distribution , version 9.04 , Jaunty Jackalope .
The fourth extended file system
The fourth extended file system ( ext4 ) file system was renamed from ext4dev to ext4 , which means that it 's stable enough for regular use .
Ext4 is the successor to the standard third extended file system ( ext3 ) available today , but with better performance , features , and reliability .
Ext4 permits exabyte file systems that can support larger numbers of files , larger files , and deeper directory structures .
It also includes extents with multi-block and delayed block allocation for performance .
Ext4 is both forward and backward compatible ( meaning that you can mount an ext4 file system on an ext3 disk format and vice versa , depending upon the features used ) .
You can also gradually migrate a file system from ext3 to ext4 online with a mass change .
For links to more information about the ext4 file system , see Related topics .
And although ext4 will be the new standard Linux file system for some time to come , other file systems are coming that offer even better scalability and features .
One such file system , Btrfs , is available in an experimental form in the 2.6.29 kernel .
Btrfs is a Linux - compatible file system ( read GNU Public License [ GPL ] ) that competes in features with the well - known ZFS .
Graphics Execution Manager memory management
One of the areas that has seen solid improvements over the past year is the Linux graphics stack .
Not surprisingly , it 's also an area where graphics processor units ( GPUs ) provide useful assists for rendering .
In many cases , GPUs are more powerful than the central processing units ( CPUs ) they assist .
To support the GPUs of today and tomorrow , one area of the Linux graphics stack that needed improvement was memory management , including buffer management , page mapping , placement , and caching .
This was necessary because graphics applications — particularly three - dimensional applications — can consume a vast amount of memory .
The Graphics Execution Manager ( GEM ) helps here by providing ways to manage graphics data that blends into the kernel using the existing kernel subsystems ( such as using the shared memory file system , or shmfs , to manage graphic objects ) .
Boot tracer
Although the time required to boot Linux has shrunk over time , expectations are still that it takes too long .
For that reason , boot times remain under scrutiny .
This kernel includes a new feature to measure and record the timings of init calls .
The timings can be used later to visualize the flow and performance of the boot process .
This process is configurable ( it requires enabling to collect the data ) , but once collected , the data can be analyzed using offline scripts ( including graphical depictions ) , which will ultimately lead to better boot times and a more optimized boot process .
This update incorporates the process identifier ( PID ) of the calling thread so that the parallelism of the boot process can be viewed .
Freezer
Based conceptually on the idea of suspending an operating system for the purpose of migrating it to a new host ( for example , virtual machine , or VM , migration ) , a new capability called freezing ( and thawing ) has been committed .
This new feature allows either a group of tasks or a file system to be frozen and kept in its freeze - time state , later to be thawed to reintroduce the task group or file system .
You freeze tasks in the context of a container , which is a scheme that virtualizes operating systems at the user - space level ( a single kernel supports multiple user spaces ) .
This new functionality is a step in the direction of migrating a set of processes between hosts , which can be very useful for load balancing .
You can also freeze file systems to support snapshots for file system backup .
Currently , file system freezing is achieved through an ioctl with an argument of FIFREEZE or FITHAW .
Outside of containers , this new freeze / thaw scheme can find uses in checkpointing .
In this application , you could freeze a collection of related processes at specific intervals ( checkpoints ) , then thaw a particular epoch as a way to roll back to a known good state .
Improved virtual memory scalability
As Linux finds increasing use in virtualized systems — particularly those with many processors and vast amounts of memory — the ability to scale memory usage becomes critical to performance .
Kernel 2.6.28 includes a number of scalability enhancements related to memory .
For example , this kernel maintains separate Least Recently Used ( LRU ) lists , one for pages backed by files and another for pages backed by swap .
This allows the kernel to focus on swap - backed pages , which are more likely to be written to disk , and pay less attention to file - backed pages .
Another change separates the evictable pages from the unevictable pages ( such as those that were locked through mlock ) .
In this way , the pageout code does not need to iterate unevictable pages in the LRU list , leading to improved performance in systems with very large numbers of pages .
Disk improvements
The 2.6.28 kernel includes a number of advancements for disks .
In particular , improved use of solid state drives ( SSDs ) and protection for ATA devices are detailed in this section .
Improvements for SSD support
SSDs are a fantastic way to improve disk performance over traditional drives with rotating media .
SSDs provide reduced latency and better random reads with less power and noise .
But SSDs are fundamentally different from hard disk drives ( HDDs ) , so changes to Linux are necessary to exploit them .
A fundamental problem with SSDs is that they must wear - level the blocks in their internal flash , and wear - leveling can reduce the lifetime of the SSD .
One way to reduce this effect is by telling the SSD when a block is no longer valid ( perhaps because of a file deletion ) .
When a block is freed in the SSD , it is no longer a target of wear - leveling and therefore can minimize the overall wear on the device .
But to support this operation , the file system must be able to communicate this information to the drive .
The T13 standards committee has created a new ATA protocol extension to support this communication in the context of the trim command .
When the SSD receives this new command , it can add the blocks defined to its free list and no longer worry about moving them around as part of wear - leveling .
The Linux block layer component of this is called a discard request , which results from a higher - level file system file deletion .
A discard request is part of the block layer and provides the means to discard blocks , eventually resulting in a trim command to a supporting ATA drive .
Further enhancements include scheduling discard requests intelligently so that they can be coalesced with other requests as well as performing reorder operations on the block request queue to better deal with related discard and write requests .
Improvements for ATA HDDs
One very interesting reliability improvement for ATA HDDs is protection against shock , sudden jolts that can destroy HDDs in laptop computers .
The ATAPI specification defines a command called IDLE IMMEDIATE that idles the HDD and retracts the disk heads to prevent them from hitting the platters .
The kernel makes this command available through a proc file called / sys / block /*/ device / unload_heads .
After a value is written to this file and the subsequent ATA command is written to the respective disk , the heads are retracted and all input / output ( I/O ) is deferred for a small amount of time based on a timer .
When the timer expires , I /O resumes normally .
This feature was implemented previously for IBM laptops using access to an accelerometer to measure acceleration ( to determine whether the laptop is falling ) .
The generic process is shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . Generic process of ATA hard disk protection
What 's next for 2.6.29 ?
Where 2.6.28 includes a number of useful new features , 2.6.29 improves even further .
Btrfs
One of the most important advances in 2.6.29 is the addition of the Btrfs ( or B - tree FS ) , originally developed by Oracle .
The Btrfs was developed as a response to Sun's ZFS , used to build a massively scalable file system with on - disk integrity assurance .
In addition to many of the advanced features of ext4 , Btrfs supports object - level mirroring and striping , copy - on - write functionality , snapshots ( and snapshots of snapshots ) , integrity , and internal compression .
It supports volumes and files up to 16 exabytes in size and up to 264 files in a given volume .
To aid in conversion , you can upgrade a file system from ext3 to Btrfs ( and also back , but only to the point at which conversion was done ) .
Btrfs could define a new standard for massive enterprise file systems that include fault tolerance with online repair and simplified administration .
Although still experimental ( and not suitable for anything other than review ) , Btrfs includes a feature set that makes it ideal for future scalable Linux storage .
Networking changes
In addition to a large number of updates to various networking drivers , several enhancements are worth noting .
The first is the Generic Receive Offload infrastructure , which offloads network sends ( similar to Large Receive Offload , but protocol independent ) .
You 'll also find support for backward congestion notification ( BCN ) , which improves congestion management by actively tightening the control loop through messaging .
This feature is a staple in new data center Ethernet deployments .
Last but not least , 2.6.29 introduces a WiMAX wireless broadband networking stack into Linux ( currently based on the i2400 m USB driver ) .
Note that this is different from so - called Wi-Fi , as WiMAX uses licensed spectrum for point - to - point connection and offers improved quality of service .
Kernel mode setting
An interesting cosmetic change to the kernel boot process and graphics mode is called the kernel - based mode setting ( KMS ) .
This feature allows the kernel to control the graphics hardware after the required components are initialized ( such as the PCI bus and graphics card ) .
In this way , the kernel can enter the desired screen resolution much earlier in the boot process , which reduces some issues with flicker and display absence ( because of a graphics chip reset ) and allows the display to be properly set up before the X server is started .
The other advantage to KMS is improved re-initialization after suspend : because the initialization is done in the kernel , it 's much more efficient .
Finally , because the kernel manages the graphics chip , the X server may not be required to run with root privileges , hardening the operating system by removing another set of potential exploits .
Going further
At the time of this writing , 2.6.29 is in the stabilization process .
But work continues , looking forward to 2.6.30 .
Other things that you 'll find in 2.6.29 include Squashfs ( a read - only file system ) finally making its way to the mainline kernel , as well as the inclusion of a set of security hooks for path name - based mandatory access control .
A new protocol , Fibre Channel over Ethernet ( FCoE ) , has also found its way into the kernel , in addition to on - disk integrity checking using the standard Data Integrity Field ( T10 - DIF ) , which is understood by certain drives for end - to - end and at - rest integrity checking .
So , as Linux moves forward , we find new functionality , improved scalability , and increasing security .
Like single - malt scotch , Linux continues to improve with age .

The latest issue of MaxPlanckForschung , the flagship journal of the Max Planck Institute , has China as its focus .
To honor the theme of the issue , the editors asked one of the journalists who worked for the magazine to find an elegant Chinese poem to grace the cover .
This was the result :
No sooner had the journal fallen into the hands of Chinese readers than it set off a frenzy of indignation , uproarious laughter , and animated discussion .
This is a rough translation of what the text says :
With high salaries , we have cordially invited for an extended series of matinées KK and Jiamei as directors , who will personally lead jade - like girls in the spring of youth , Beauties from the north who have a distinguished air of elegance and allure , Young housewives having figures that will turn you on ;
Their enchanting and coquettish performance will begin within the next few days .
It is not my intention to provide a complete explication de texte .
In truth , such shabby doggerel is not worth the effort !
It is notable , however , that at the beginning of the second line ( from the right — some Chinese readers unaccustomed to the traditional right - to - left top - to - bottom orientation initially read the " poem " from left to right ) the author has forced four graphs into the space that should normally be occupied only by one .
We know this to be the case because all of the other lines in the text have eight characters ( an unusual number for a piece of Chinese verse , if that is what this text aspires to be ! ) .
Furthermore , judging from reactions on the Chinese Internet , readers are uncertain and confused about the meaning of these four graphs and how to read them .
Some of them interpret the quadripartite graph as " KK 加美 , " while others understand them as " 加K美K , " with most netizens seeming to adhere to the latter orientation .
JIA1 加 usually means " add " and MEI3 美 usually means " beautiful , " but one creative theory is that 加K stands for JIA1NA2DA4 K 加拿大K ( " Canadian K " ) and MEI3 美K stands for MEI3GUO2K 美 國K ( " American K " ) .
Regardless of how we interpret the quadripartite character , we can tell from context that it indicates the two individuals who are in charge of the girls in the show .
Clearly this is an advertisement for some kind of burlesque business .
I did find quite a few references on the Web to a " KK Juggy " from a group called " Machine Gun Fellatio , " and apparently the KK in her name stands for " Knickers " and " Knockers . "
Perhaps KK in the sense of " Knickers and Knockers " is an Australian expression , since KK Juggy ( Christa Hughes ) is from Sydney .
I doubt seriously that the KK in the Chinese text on the cover of MaxPlanckForschung has anything to do with the online expression " KK " = " [ O ] K , kewl , " for which see here .
The expression that I have rendered as " turn you on " is actually more graphic : RE3HUO3惹火 ( " stir up [ sexual ] heat " ) .
That 's about all the time or stomach I have for commenting on this immortal Chinese text .
What I still need to do , however , is point out that — when the powers that be at MPI found out what the characters on the front of their journal actually said — they immediately issued the following heartfelt apology :
Dear Colleagues ,
The cover of the most recent German - language edition of MaxPlanckForschung ( 3/2008 ) depicts a Chinese text which had been chosen by our editorial office in order to symbolically illustrate the magazine 's focus on " China " .
Unfortunately , it has now transpired that this text contains inappropriate content of a suggestive nature .
Prior to publication , the editorial office had consulted a German sinologist for a translation of the relevant text .
The sinologist concluded that the text in question depicted classical Chinese characters in a non-controversial context .
To our sincere regret , however , it has now emerged that the text contains deeper levels of meaning , which are not immediately accessible to a non-native speaker .
By publishing this text we did in no way intend to cause any offence or embarrassment to our Chinese readers .
The editors of MaxPlanckResearch sincerely regret this unfortunate error and would like to offer an unreserved apology to all of their Chinese readers for any upset or distress they may have caused .
The cover title has already been substituted in the online edition , and the English version of MaxPlanckForschung ( MaxPlanckResearch , 4/2008 ) will be published with a different title .
We would ask you to forward this information to all Chinese scientists at your Institute .
Please find attached the new version of the title .
Perhaps you can distribute this print - out within your institute .
Here is the replacement cover :
This is a safe and suitable design to have on the cover of MaxPlanckForschung , since it is the title of a book by the Swiss Jesuit , Johannes Schreck ( Chinese name Deng Yuhan 鄧玉函 , 1576 – 1630 ) , Qiqi tushuo 奇器圖說 ( Illustrated Explanations of Strange Devices ) , with information about the publication of the particular edition in question .
For those who are interested , additional bibliographical information may be found here .
The moral of this story is that , if one is not deeply versed in Classical Chinese , one would be well advised to refrain from commenting on anything written in it , especially if the text in question is likely to be distributed all over the world by a renowned institute of scientific research .
With thanks to Ying Zhou , Gianni Wan , Wicky Tse , and Zhang Liqing .

A young man allegedly involved in a fight aboard a BART train was shot to death by a BART police officer on the platform of the Fruitvale Station early New Year 's Day , in the midst of a brawl between two groups of young train passengers .
Oscar Grant , 22 , was shot once while on the platform after a BART officer drew his gun during what officials called a volatile and chaotic scene .
A gravely wounded Grant was taken to Highland Hospital , where he died Thursday morning , the Alameda County coroner 's office said .
While witness accounts reported by news organizations indicate Grant was on the platform and handcuffed when he was shot , BART spokesman Jim Allison said the victim was not restrained when the gun discharged .
BART officials would n't comment on whether the shooting was accidental or deliberate .
" Any incident with that many people , you 're going to have different perceptions of what happened , " Allison said .
Officials said no weapon was recovered from Grant or others involved in the altercation .
Witnesses ' account
Allison and witnesses gave this account of the events leading up to Grant 's death :
Apparently , two groups of young men were fighting on the train , which had come from San Francisco .
Sometime while the train was en route to Dublin / Pleasanton , BART 's operations control center learned of the disturbance and dispatched five BART police officers to the Fruitvale Station about 2 a .m .
The train was ordered to stop and hold at Fruitvale so the police could deal with the situation .
The train arrived at Fruitvale , and police began trying to isolate the young men as they fought .
Officers believe the group included Grant .
As officers attempted to control the situation , the two groups apparently continued to scuffle on the platform .
At one point , three or four individuals on the platform were handcuffed , Allison said .
Two people involved in the scuffle were detained , questioned by police and later released .
On Thursday afternoon , BART officials held a news conference and confirmed the officer had drawn his weapon during the incident .
In describing the incident , however , they chose their wording very carefully , repeatedly referring to the shooting as a weapon " discharge , " without specifically saying that the officer shot Grant .
Grant lived in Hayward , where family and friends gathered Thursday evening , too distraught to talk about the incident .
They would only say that he leaves behind a 4 - year - old daughter .
At a park around the corner from his home , dozens of his friends gathered to share stories and express sadness over his sudden death .
" I knew Oscar for 19 years , " said friend Robert Johnson .
" He was everything .
He was the world . "
When a Chronicle reporter tried to interview other friends of Grant , a grief - stricken relative asked the group not to talk to reporters .
At the news conference , BART Patrol Cmdr.
Travis Gibson said officers are trained to pull their guns when a BART patron or an officer is in danger .
" You use what force is reasonable to neutralize the situation without the person losing their life or the officer their life , " he said .
Gibson said New Year 's Eve had been a chaotic night for the officers on duty , with one gun recovered in San Francisco and another in West Oakland .
Officer tested , put on leave
The officer involved in the shooting was not identified , but Allison said he had been on the force nearly two years .
The officer was given an alcohol and drug test , per department policy , and placed on administrative leave .
Results of the alcohol and drug test are pending .
" It 's too early to go into the specifics of the officer 's record , " Allison said .
Officials said the officer was carrying a baton in addition to his gun , but they were unsure whether he also carried a stun gun .
BART police have launched an internal investigation as well as a criminal investigation into the incident .
The Alameda County district attorney 's office has opened its own investigation , Allison said .
The Fruitvale Station has cameras , but BART officials said they are used only for monitoring and are not capable of recording .
Some BART stations do have cameras that can record events , but not all of them .
Oakland attorney John Burris , who has handled several high - profile cases involving police shootings , said the incident prompts several questions to determine whether the shooting was justified .
Burris said he would want to know why the officer believed deadly force was required and whether the victim had a weapon or posed an immediate threat , or , if the shooting was accidental , why the officer 's gun was drawn .
" The question is whether the person 's civil rights have been violated , " he said .
BART police ask anyone with information about the incident to call ( 877 ) 679-7000 , extension 7040 .
The BART police force has 206 sworn officers , many of whom were patrolling the system on New Year 's Eve .
The trains were running on extended service until 3 a.m. to accommodate late - night partygoers .
Another neighbour , Jeremy Dennison , 25 , added : " I think as a village we are all 100 per cent behind Heston , and I for one will continue to eat there – as often as my wallet allows , that is . "
Rockstar games is best known for the Grand Theft Auto series , but the company has a strong stable of other franchises as well .
One such game is Red Dead Revolver , a third - person Western shooter that was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox back in 2004 .
The game received mixed reviews but was a commercial success — selling upwards of 1.5 million units — and as such , Rockstar has announced that a sequel is in the works .
Dubbed Red Dead Redemption , the new game is being developed by Rockstar San Diego , whose most recent release was last year 's Midnight Club Los Angeles .
Like that game , as well as GTAIV and Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis , Redemption will use Rockstar 's RAGE engine .
The sequel will be an open - world game , allowing gamers to explore the American frontier and experience the harshness of that environment .
" The team at San Diego have massively exceeded our expectations with the sheer depth of experiences in Red Dead Redemption , " Rockstar founder Sam Houser said .
" The seamless combination of breathtaking beauty and intense action , all woven together with strong plotlines in a massive vibrant , rural environment is mind - blowing .
We think this game helps to push the limits of what an open - world gaming experience can be . "
The Western is one of the few genres that has n't been used ad nauseam in gaming , so this sequel could be a refreshing change of pace from the glut of shooters currently on the market .
While the original had its problems , we 're still holding out hope that Rockstar can put together a truly great Western game .
Red Dead Redemption will be coming to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this Fall .

Top 10 Harmless Geek Pranks
Situation wanted : High - performance type with dashed hopes , loads of law school debt and mortgage acquired at peak of housing boom seeking self - esteem and lost identity following recent layoff from law firm .
Willing to adjust once - lofty career aspirations in exchange for doing anything remotely related to the practice of law .
The ad may be fiction , but the scenario has become a reality for hundreds of attorneys who started law school just a few years ago with prospects of six - figure salaries and their pick of where to practice .
Last month alone , an estimated 1,100 attorneys lost their jobs at major law firms , which means that the market is choked with highly educated former associates whose severance is running out and whose bills are piling up .
For the first time in their lives , many of these lawyers are struggling with a profound feeling of failure .
And while they acknowledge that their troubles are just a part of the jobless scene nationwide , such perspective provides little comfort for these high achievers who are grappling with a loss of purpose and direction .
“ I feel really lost right now , ” said Aviva Tiegerman , a former attorney at Kaye Scholer who was laid off in May .
As a second - year associate , Tiegerman , 29 , worked in the New York law firm ’s real estate practice group , a job she liked very much , she said .
The amount of work in her department had slowed dramatically , so she was not surprised when her boss came into her office and delivered the bad news .
But what she did n’t anticipate was the continued implosion of the real estate sector across the country and the difficulty she would face in finding another job .
“ I do n’t think it registered , ” said the 2006 cum laude graduate of Hofstra University School of Law .
“ I do n’t think I knew how bad the market was . ”
Tiegerman said that she called job recruiters “ within five minutes of getting laid off . ”
They told her that the employment market was slow but that she could expect to find a job in three to six months .
When the economy was strong , she ’d receive two or three calls a day from recruiters , she said .
“ I used to hang up on them . ”
Under her severance arrangement with Kaye Scholer , Tiegerman continued to go into the office , a situation that became increasingly painful , she said .
“ I would show up every day and not know what to do , ” she said .
A spokesman for Kaye Scholer said that the firm could not comment on a former employee but added that it wished Tiegerman well .
In September , she was close to landing a job at another law firm — she ’d interviewed with 12 people at the firm — but just before the final decision , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed .
It was one of the biggest clients for the firm , which decided to freeze hiring .
These days , Tiegerman is working temporary jobs when she can find them .
Before she was let go , she and her husband had just completed renovations to their apartment in midtown Manhattan .
They have “ blown through ” their savings , she said .
“ I keep finding jobs just in the nick of time . ”
Part of what makes layoffs particularly difficult for many young associates is that they come from a generation with a “ trophy mentality , ” said Larry Richard , a psychologist and consultant with Hildebrandt International .
His work focuses on lawyer personality types and management issues .
Not only do today ’s associates have the typical lawyer traits — risk aversion , skepticism and impatience — but they also are part of a generation raised on plenty of affirmation and rewards .
And for people accustomed to earning gold stars , the pink slip hurts all the more .
Even if the law firm assures its associates that the layoffs are a consequence of the economy and not the lawyers ’ performance , most people will struggle with what they might have done differently , Richard said .
The “ what ifs ” in turn , can undermine self - confidence , he said .
Laid - off attorneys also tend to remain isolated from others , which also can take its toll on their self - esteem , Rich said .
Commiserating with others who have lost jobs , however , is not something Scott Chait is interested in doing .
“ I do n’t particularly care to network with people who have been laid off , ” he said .
“ It can be really unhealthy . ”
In October , Chait was let go from New York ’s Wagner Davis , where his work focused on real estate transactions .
A 2006 graduate of Brooklyn Law School , he is collecting unemployment and has moved in with his parents in New Jersey .
Without providing specific numbers , Chait , 31 , said he is burdened with “ a full debt load . ”
Rigorous workouts help keep his spirits up , he said .
“ It feeds the need inside me . ”
He describes himself as competitive , with a “ Type A ” personality , and said that critical to his daily routine is not sleeping in .
He spends much of his day looking for jobs on employment Web sites .
He also goes to his synagogue every morning .
“ I get a lot of positive enforcement , ” he said .
The uncertainty of joblessness is a “ corrosive acid ” that raises the threat mechanism , or a sense of danger , among those who are laid off , Richard said .
When the threat mechanism increases , people take a fight - or - flight approach , which means that they tend to make rash decisions and to think in all - or - nothing terms .
Laid - off lawyers may believe that they will never find employment again or that they performed badly at their previous job , Richard said , and he recommends that people make contact with other laid - off attorneys .
“ There ’s safety in numbers , ” he said .
It ’s not just laid - off workers feeling the emotional impact , Richard said .
The uncertainty for those remaining at law firms also can create problems .
Supervising attorneys must learn to be “ better psychologists ” in dealing with workers who are feeling unsettled .
Acting - out behavior , he said , can include nit-picking , inattentiveness , work - hoarding and a generally cantankerous attitude , he said .
“ A lot of people are in survival mode , ” he said .
Megan Logsdon is n’t sure how to describe her situation .
She was an associate at Thacher Proffitt & Wood , which closed its doors in December .
“ Can you be laid off if your firm dissolved ? ” she said .
A 2008 graduate of Georgetown University Law Center , Logsdon worked in the corporate practice group at Thacher Proffitt for just two months before she learned that the 160 - year - old law firm was going out of business .
She knew that it was troubled when it decided to delay her start date , but since she had already committed to a full - time position and had given up options at other law firms , she pushed ahead , only to get cut loose eight weeks after she started .
Many of the attorneys in her practice group got jobs at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal , but they did n’t take new associates , she said .
Her pay ran out on Feb. 20 .
“ It ’s super stressful , ” said Logsdon , 28 .
“ Right now , I ’m looking for any kind of paid legal work , and I ’m going to start looking for volunteer work . ”
She has sent out dozens of résumés and is willing to relocate for a legal job , she said .
She applied for one position in Bethel , Alaska , population 6,000 .
“ I would work anywhere , ” she said .
Right now , Logsdon and her boyfriend , also an unemployed attorney , are living in a small apartment in Queens , N.Y. , she said .
She has about $ 120,000 in student loan debt .
Logsdon said that she is still surprised that , as a graduate from Georgetown law school with good grades and the ability to speak Spanish , she is unable to find work .
Adding to her worry is the fresh crop of graduates coming out of law schools in the spring , who will intensify the competition for associate jobs .
She does n’t have the benefit of having any full - time work experience to speak of , and that scares her .
“ A lot of jobs I ’m qualified for are really geared toward those new graduates , ” she said .
She , too , finds solace in exercise , but she feels isolated , she said , and would enjoy connecting with others in the same situation .
A former English teacher , Logsdon considered “ running away ” and returning to teaching .
“ But there ’s no way , ” she said .
“ I spent a lot of money and have done a ton of hard work , and I ’m not giving up . ”

The Cost of Living During the Cold War
In 1951 , Steve Czekalinski posed with his wife and two boys in the midst of all of the food products that a " typical " family would have bought that year .
All of that food weighed 2 ½ tons and cost the $ 1,300 .
The list included 699 bottles of milk , 578 pounds of meat , 131 dozen eggs , 1.190 pounds of vegetables and 440 pounds of fresh fruit , plus sugar flour , bread and cereal .
You can see what some of the items from Czekalinski's food cart cost in 1951 and today  as well as what the item would have cost if food had gone up by the same inflation rate as other products  by rolling your mouse over various parts of the picture below .
Czekalinski worked for Du Pont corporation , and he was probably earning more than the average family because his food bill was higher than the average family .
Here 's why we assume that 
In 1951 , the average family income was only $ 3,700 .
That year , the average family spent 22 percent of their disposable income on food .
So , the " average " family would have spent a maximum of $ 814 on food ( $ 3,700 x 22 % ) .
If the Czekalinski family spent $ 1,300 on all of the food in the picture , and that represented 22 percent of their total income , his family would have been earning a total of $ 5,910  much more than the $ 3,700 the " average " family earned .
Yet , the photograph is a good example of what food cost a family in the early 50s and today , and what those prices meant to farmers who were trying to make money .
For instance , round steak was one of the single most expensive items in the 1951 grocery basket at $ 1.09 per pound .
Today ( in January 2007 ) the average price for round steak was $ 4.16 .
However , if the price of steak had kept with the inflation as a whole  measured by the CPI or consumer price index  the price would be $ 8.61 per pound .
Pork chops in 1951 cost 79 ¢ per pound .
Today they cost $ 3.17 , but would cost $ 6.24 if pork prices had kept up with the inflation in other products .
Whole chickens cost 60 ¢ a pound .
Now , they cost $ 1.03  if you want a whole chicken instead of a boneless chicken breast .
But whole chickens would have cost $ 4.74 if they followed inflation of other prices .
Some food prices are actually higher than CPI adjusted prices would have been .
For instance , potatoes cost around 5 ¢ a pound in 1951 .
The CPI - adjusted price today would have been 39 ¢ a pound , but in fact the price is 52 ¢ a pound .
As mentioned above , roughly 22 percent of the average family 's disposable income was spent on food in 1951 .
Over the years , that proportion had come down to the point that the average family of today spends just 7 percent .
By this rough measure , food is relatively cheaper now than then .
However , some economists will argue that real wages for consumers have risen while agricultural technology has kept food production costs down .
If you chart the real prices  in dollars adjusted for inflation  paid by consumers for food for home consumption and the prices paid to farmers for their raw materials , you see that there were large fluctuations in farm prices and much smaller fluctuations in retail food prices ( see chart at left ) .
You can also see that there were drastic declines in food prices and farm prices beginning in 1950 .
We should note that the chart might seem misleading in the sense that it shows an index where both price lines start at the same 100 percent mark in 1992 .
Retail food prices , of course , are 60 to 75 percent higher than the prices paid to farmers .
But the chart shows how farmers have faced wide swings in prices for their products while consumers have been insulated from the worst swings .
One of the reasons for the smaller fluctuations in retail food prices is that prices paid to farmers make up only a fraction of that retail price .
During the last half of the 20th century , the cost to process , package , transport , advertise and sell food products  relative to the cost of the raw materials  has increased .
For instance , consider the loaf of bread that cost 16 ¢ per pound in 1951 .
The farmer 's share of bread in 1967  the oldest figures we were able to document  amounted to just 17 percent of the cost of that loaf for their part of the bread  farmers got less than 2.7¢ for their part of the bread .
Today , bread averages $ 1.15 per pound and farmers get only 7 percent  8 ¢  of that .
The farmer 's share of meat products in 1967 was 56 percent and dropped to 36 percent today .
Dairy products went from 47 percent to 32 percent for the farmer 's share .
Eggs went from 59 percent to 46 percent .
Fresh Fruit went from 31 percent to 18 percent .
Poultry products went from 49 percent to 41 percent .
Overall , the farmer 's share of the food dollar for all products hovered around 40 percent from 1920 to 1970 and then declined rapidly to about 25 percent today .
With so little of the food dollar actually going into the pockets of farmers , it 's no surprise that the income of farmers lagged behind their urban colleagues in the past .
In 1960 , average farm income was $ 3,228 .
City dwellers earned $ 5,940 and suburbanites earned $ 7,114 .
But , this is a very rough estimation of the relative standard of living for either group .
In the 50s , for example , many farm families still ate mostly the food their grew and not food purchased at groceries .
According to the USDA , if all the factors affecting standards of living are figured in , farm families began to catch up with their urban brethren beginning in the 1960s .
By the 1990s , farm households equaled and in some years exceeded the average incomes of urban families .
Don Freeman ( right ) believes that farmers are an important part of the economy as a whole .
" Every community is dependent upon agriculture , " he says , " because we all eat .
We all use fiber that the farm produces Anybody who says they are n't affected by agriculture has got blinders on . "

The Kitchen Debate
There 's a lot of talk about how the bailouts are creating moral hazard and rewarding bad behavior .
But those are pretty abstract ideas , the kind of things people wonder whether or not we can afford to worry about while the economy is tanking .
Sure we 'll pay a long run price for screwing up the market 's discipline but in the long run we 're all dead .
So forget " moral hazard " and just look at Warren Buffett 's description of what is happening to his home construction business , Clayton Homes .
Clayton , which makes pre-fab homes , also has a lending business .
Surprisingly , Clayton has n't been crushed by the markets because it maintained high lending standards and does n't have a balance sheet overflowing with defaulting loans .
But it is getting crushed anyway .
But the crushing agent is the government not the markets .
You see , the government has extended loan guarantees of various sorts to troubled financial companies .
This means that a bank or a financial company able to borrow under a government backed facility will be able to raise capital at low prices .
Clayton gets crowded out of the market as would - be lenders flock to the safety of the government backed facilities .
What 's more , Clayton must then attempt to compete with these borrowers despite it 's higher borrowing costs .
Here 's the news from Buffett 's letter :
Clayton 's lending operations , though not damaged by the performance of its borrowers is nevertheless threatened by an element of the credit crisis .
Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee -- banks with FDIC - insured deposits , large entities with commercial paper backed by the Federal Reserve , and others who are using imaginitive methods ( or lobbying skills ) to come under the government 's umbrella -- have money costs that are minimal .
Conversely , highly - rated companies , such as Berkshire , are experiencing borrowing costs that , in relation to treasury rates , are at record levels .
Moreover , funds are abundant for the government - guaranteed borrower , but often scarce for others no matter how creditworthy they are .
This unprecedented " spread " in the cost of money makes it unprofitable for any lender who does n't enjoy government - guaranteed funds to go up against those with favored status .
Government is determining the " haves " and the " have nots . "
That is why companies are rushing to convert to bank holding companies , not a course feasible for Berkshire .
Though Berkshire 's credit rating is pristine -- we are one of only seven AAA corporations in the country -- our cost of borrowing is now far higher than competitors with shaky balance sheets but government backing .
At the moment it is far better to be a financial cripple with a government guarantee than a Gibraltar without one .
People who do n't speak Swedish are missing almost all the interest of the Pirate Bay trial , which is supplied by the frankly unsavoury nature of the defendants .
The money man , Carl Lundström , on whose servers The Pirate Bay was housed , is straight out of the crime novels of Stieg Larsson .
He inherited a fortune built on crispbread , and has a long history of involvement with extreme rightwing politics .
In the 1980s , he was a member of " Keep Sweden Swedish " , an anti-immigrant fringe group ; he has financially backed the Sweden Democrats , a would - be populist and anti-immigrant party ; and only this month the managing director of one of his companies was charged with a robbery in a small west - coast town , part of a feud within a neo -Nazi group .
Lundström told the Metro news­paper ( http://bit.ly/metro) after he sacked the man that he had known he was a party member , but not that he had gone to collect another member 's computer with a submachine gun .
Gottfrid Svartholm Varg and Frederik Neij , the nerds who run The Pirate Bay itself , have also been accused by the prosecutor of tax evasion , but deny that they were making any money from their business .
Their attitude of sneering entitlement towards the government is all of a piece with their attitude towards the big content companies .
But I ca n't see The Pirate Bay as morally superior to the Disney corporation .
Both are out to grab everything they can get away with , and so , of course , are the majority of their users .
Yes , there are legitimate uses for the Bit­Torrent protocol , but the demand for free as in beer far outstrips that for free as in speech .
What 's odd in a historical perspective is that all this should be going on in Sweden , which was within living memory a social democratic country with a genuinely leftwing orthodoxy .
I know that a little bit of the rhetoric around The Pirate Bay sounds leftwing – the idea that it is wrong for " international capital " to push Sweden around – but that 's just populist , and could be found in the rhetoric of the kind of parties that Carl Lundström has supported too .
The overwhelming impression is of a clash between two rightwing views , one that says it is all right to steal from the state , and one which says it is sinful to steal from corporations .
You do n't find people arguing that there might be such a thing as soc­iety that is larger than both the owners and the consumers of copyrighted material .
On the contrary , it is a more or less explicit assumption that in a borderless digital world there is n't any legitimate global authority .
Yet the overwhelming fact about Swedish society , when I lived there , was exactly this belief that authority was , and had to be , legitimate .
Perhaps this goes back to the country 's Lutheran past as a militaristic superpower : " Fear God and honour the King " says the inscription on one of the churches in Stockholm Old Town .
But wherever it came from , the conformism , and the stifling respect for authority that it produced , were the characteristics that most distinguished Sweden from most of the rest of Europe .
That may have been a bad thing – I certainly thought so when I lived there – but looking at the modern country you realise that it 's possible to have too little of a bad thing .
The Pirate Bay trial is part of a global problem in which we all are implicated .
One of the reasons we got into this mess was the absence of any kind of government that could stand above the immediate economic interests of the players involved .
In the US the copyright laws were repeatedly extended not because any benevolent ruler sat down and asked what arrangement was best for society , but because it is easy to rent politicians in the US .
Hardly anyone who pirates material asks themselves whether they are plundering the system that ensures that some people at least are paid for their creative labours .
The pressing question , when you sit at a keyboard , is hardly ever " should I ? " , but " can I ? "
But you can't build a society – you can't even build a market – unless almost everyone in it asks themselves " should I ? "
In its clumsy way , that 's what the Pirate Bay trial is trying to remind us .

1 Sgt. Stubby : America ’s first war dog hero
America ’s first war dog , Stubby , served for 18 months and participated in seventeen battles on the Western Front .
In February of 1918 he saved his regiment from surprise mustard gas attacks .
This pit bull terrier dog was the most decorated war dog of World War I and the only dog to be promoted to sergeant through combat .
He also located and comforted wounded , carried messages under fire and even once caught a German spy by the seat of his pants after hearing a noise coming from a small patch of brush .
He went to investigate and found a German spy .
Stubby put his ears back and began to bark .
The German began to run and Stubby took off after him , biting the soldier on his legs causing him to trip and fall .
Then he attacked the soldier ’s arms and finally bit and held onto his rear end .
By this time some of the Allied soldiers had come to see what all the noise was .
When they saw that the dog had captured a spy they cheered .
He became the first dog to be given rank in the U.S. Armed Forces .
After the war , Stubby became Georgetown University ’s mascot when his owner , Robert Conroy was headed to law school and took the dog along .
Old age finally caught up with the small warrior on April 4th , 1926 , as he took ill and died in Conroy ’s arms .
2 Swansea Jack : The Baywatch dog who saved 27 people
Born in Newfoundland , Swansea Jack lived in the North Dock area of Swansea with his master , William Thomas .
He would always respond to cries for help from the water , diving into the water and pulling whoever was in difficulty to safety at the dockside .
His first rescue , in June 1931 , when he saved a 12 - year - old boy , went unreported .
A few weeks later , this time in front of a crowd , Jack rescued a swimmer from the docks .
Legend has it that in his lifetime he saved 27 people from the Docks / River Tawe .
Swansea Jack died in October 1937 after eating rat poison .
He was named ‘ Dog of the Century ’ by NewFound Friends of Bristol .
He received a silver cup from the Lord Mayor of London and he is still the only dog to have been awarded two bronze medals by the National Canine Defence League ( now known as Dogs Trust ) .
3 Jim : the “ Wonder Dog ” who could predict the future
Born in Louisiana in 1925 , Jim displayed signs of extremely high intelligence .
He was able to pick out colors a person was wearing , although dogs are apparently color - blind .
He could pick out a car by its owner , color , make , or license plate number .
Jim became a hunting dog who knew which fields contained birds and which ones did n’t .
Mr. VanArsdale would let Jim choose the field in which to hunt and he was never disappointed .
Jim was examined at the University of Missouri by a group of veterinarians and scientists .
Results of the examination were normal .
He responded to their requests given in Italian , French , German and Spanish .
He was taken before a Greek class and given several requests in Greek which he successfully answered .
Jim picked the winner in the 1936 World Series .
He correctly predicted that Roosevelt would be re-elected in 1936 .
He also correctly picked the winner in the Kentucky Derby for seven years .
And most amazingly , he could predict accurately the sex of an unborn infant .
The Wonder Dog died on March 18 , 1937 and was buried in a cemetery in Marshall .
A small white stone was erected over his grave bearing the inscription “ Jim , the Wonder Dog . ”
4 Appollo : A 9/11 hero
A search and rescue dog who served with the K - 9 unit of the NYPD , Appollo was awarded the Dickin Medal , the animals ’ equivalent of the Victoria Cross , in recognition of the work done by all search and rescue dogs following the September 11 attacks .
A German Shepherd born around 1992 , he and his handler , Peter Davies , were called in to assist with the rescue operations after the September 11 terror attacks .
They arrived at the World Trade Center site fifteen minutes after the attack , making Appollo the first search and rescue dog to arrive at the site after the collapse of the World Trade Center .
At one point , Appollo was almost killed by flames and falling debris .
However , he survived , having been drenched after falling into a pool of water just before this incident .
Appollo started working again as soon as Davies had brushed the debris off him .
He died in November 2006 .
5 Faith :
The bipedal dog
Faith Stringfellow is an amazing little dog who suffered from a birth defect .
The mother dog was actually trying to terminate Faith ’s life when she was rescued from a teenager boy .
She only had one front leg and it had to be removed when she was 7 months because it was starting to atrophy .
Faith has learned to stand and walk on her two back legs like a human .
It ’s not all that unusual to see a dog stand up to greet their loved ones , but Faith remains upright and actually gets around this way .
She may be the worlds first and only biped canine .
Faith is now a therapy dog and makes public appearance to encourage others to live to their full potential .
6 The Sheepherder Dog : Kept a sheep ranch by himself for 2 years
In the 1870s , a sheep rancher in New Mexico died alone in his remote home .
Two years later , his death was discovered by visitors .
Yet his flock of sheep were doing just fine , and had actually increased in number !
His dog had been tending the flocks in his absence .
The rancher had trained his dog to drive the flocks to their pasture in the morning , guard them all day , and return them to their fold at night , and he ’d continued these duties when the rancher disappeared , killing some sheep as necessary for food but faithfully tending the rest .
In 1879 , the New Mexico legislature voted to award a pension to the hard - working ( but nameless ) sheep dog .
There are no pictures of this dog .
7 Greyfriars Bobby : Guarded his owner ’s grave for 14 years
Greyfriars Bobby became famous as a symbol of loyalty in Britain .
He was a Skye terrier devoted to his owner , John Gray .
When Gray died in 1858 , he was buried without a gravestone .
Still , Bobby found the spot and stayed there , guarding the grave and leaving only for food , for 14 years .
Greyfriars Bobby himself died in 1872 .
A granite fountain was erected in 1873 to honor his loyalty , commissioned by a countess and paid for by the RSPCA .
John Gray eventually got a headstone , paid for by Bobby ’s fans .
And Bobby received a headstone for his grave in 1981 .
8 Max :
The collie who sniffed out his owner ’s cancer
Maureen Burns in Rugby , England has a 10 - year - old mixed breed collie named Max who probably saved her life .
The 64 - year - old realized something was wrong when Max started acting strangely .
He would keep sniffing Maureen ’s breath and nudging her right breast .
Max ’s odd behavior prompted Maureen to check her breasts and she discovered a small lump in the right one .
But the growth did not show up on a hospital mammogram .
Still convinced that something was wrong , she persuaded surgeons to do a biopsy .
And Maureen ’s hunch was proved right when the results confirmed there was a lump – and it was malignant .
She ’s had surgery to remove the lump , followed by radiation treatment , and her prognosis is excellent .
Mrs. Burns is convinced that she is alive today because of her dog ’s keen sense of smell .
9 Bobbie : Traveled 2.800 miles to return to this family
In 1923 , while on a family road trip in Indiana , Bobbie — a two - year old Scotch Collie / English Shepherd mix — was separated from his owners and lost .
After an exhaustive search the broken - hearted family returned to their home in Oregon never expecting to see their beloved dog again .
Six months later , Bobbie appeared on their doorstep mangy and scrawny with feet worn to the bone ; he showed all the signs of having walked the entire way back alone .
During his ordeal he crossed 2,800 miles of plain , desert and mountains in the dead of winter to return home .
He received hundreds of letters from people around the world and was honored with a jewel - studded harness and collar , ribbons and keys to cities .
Bobbie ’s demonstration of loyalty is celebrated during Silverton ’s annual children ’s pet parade that serves as a reminder of the special place animals and pets have in people ’s lives .
10 Coal : World ’s first dog with a bionic leg
Here ’s the story of Coal , an eight - and - a - half year old hound had his left paw amputated because of cancer .
He faced being put down because his other legs would be too weak to carry him .
Instead of that , his owner Reg Walker spent £ 10,000 to fit him with a sophisticated bionic leg , which was designed to be compatible with Coal ’s own tissue .
The titanium alloy used mimics animal hide , allowing the skin and the bone from above to seal the metal implant below without it being rejected by the body .
Coal is a very special dog , he goes on tour with his owner ( who is a music industry security guard ) and he ’s the only dog to have allowed into Live 8 and the only dog that has ever been backstage at the Royal Albert Hall .
Now he has an absolutely normal quality of life , which he would n’t have had before .

A Royal Navy nuclear submarine has collided with a French nuclear submarine in the middle of the Atlantic .
The vessels , HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant , were both badly damaged but officials say no radioactivity was released .
Ben Geoghegan reports .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers who tried to use mouse , cow and rabbit eggs to make human clones said on Monday the effort failed to produce workable embryos but added that they showed human cloning should work in principle .

Mixing human and animal cells does not appear to program the egg properly , said Dr. Robert Lanza of Massachusetts - based Advanced Cell Technology .
But using human cells did reprogram the egg cell or oocyte and activate the genes needed to make a viable embryo , Lanza and colleagues reported in the journal Cloning and Stem Cells .
Several teams have tried to make animal - human hybrids as a source of embryonic stem cells , the master cells of the body .
Because human eggs are scarce -- it requires a surgical procedure to get them from a woman -- some scientists came up with the idea of using animal egg cells .
The cloning technique is called somatic cell nuclear transfer .
The nucleus is removed from an egg cell and replaced with the nucleus from another type of cell from the donor animal or person who is to be cloned .
Done right , the process starts the egg growing and dividing as if it had been fertilized by a sperm , but the resulting embryo carries mostly the DNA of the donor .
“ The idea was to simply to plunk a patient ’s DNA into an empty cow or rabbit egg -- and presto -- you reprogram the DNA back into a stem cell , ” Lanza said in a telephone interview .
But teams that have tried to do this have always ended up with what looks like a cell dividing over and over to become an embryo , but which eventually fizzles out .
“ For the last decade , we ’ve carried out literally hundreds of experiments trying to create patient - specific stem cells using animal eggs , ” Lanza said .
BEAUTIFUL HYBRIDS
“ We got beautiful little hybrid embryos , but it did n’t work no matter how hard we tried . ”
A mouse - human hybrid petered out after just one division .
The cow and rabbit human hybrids went further , but stopped at the point when maternal DNA is supposed to kick in and turn the ball of cells into a proper embryo , Lanza said .
Lanza ’s team used a new method called global gene expression analysis to see which genes were turned on and off as the eggs grew .
“ We never had the tools before to actually look inside the cell and see what ’s going on , ” Lanza said .
It appears that using the egg of another species turns off the genes needed to make an embryo instead of turning them on , he said .
But the human - human clone did turn on the right genes , although it , too stopped dividing before it could produce stem cells , Lanza said .
“ We see exactly the same genes turned on in a normal embryo are actually turned on in a human clone , ” he said .
Ian Wilmut of the University of Edinburgh , one of the scientists who cloned the first mammal , Dolly the sheep , and editor of the journal , called the results disappointing .
“ This very important paper suggests that livestock oocytes are extremely unlikely to be suitable as recipients for use in human nuclear transfer , ” Wilmut said in a statement .
But Lanza said it might be possible to use other methods to create “ banks ” of stem cells that match the several hundred tissue types found among humans .
This could include cloning humans , using a single cell from growing embryos used for fertility treatment , or a new method called induced pluripotent stem cells , made by taking a sample of skin and reprogramming the cells to act like embryonic stem cells , Lanza said .

How about a stroll down a city street buck naked ?
Most people would flinch at that .
But one couple did n’t and sauntered past a restaurant as folks stared and could n’t believe what they saw .
The original article about the incident did n’t come with pictures , although there were plenty it was said because the customers in the restaurant had a full fifteen minute treat .
Some applauded , and some were just embarrassed .
But it created a stir , nonetheless .
The restaurant manger , Terence Chia said that he saw the couple undress Saturday night at a stair well nearby , then take the clothes in their hands and proceed to walk down the street wearing only their flip - flops .
They had barely got started when a crowd of about 200 people gathered to take pictures of the event .
The naked man was Caucasian and the woman an ethnic Chinese described as in their 20’s .
They were arrested and face a fine of about $ 1,330 or up to 3 months in jail , or both .
The bloggers have been out full boar on this one , with pictures of the event taken by the various people who had been there who have been put them up for public view without restrictions .
“ They stopped at one of the tables to chat with a group of people and were still naked !
Even when a crowd gathered and some people started taking photos , they did n’t bother to cover their private parts or run away . ”
After revealing several pictures , he said , " They looked really comfortable walking down the street , which led to many curious stares , " Singapore is getting more and more exciting . "
Guess so .
Maybe they ’ll be strolling in another city somewhere or someone like them will , so it ’s proof positive that those cell phone cameras are critical equipment for citizen journalists or voyeurs everywhere .
In any part of the world such an act would create consternation .
In Singapore , the conservative city of the East , it certainly did create surprise , but some delight as well , as reported recently in the news .
The original article about the incident did n’t come with pictures , although there were plenty it was said because the customers in the restaurant had a full fifteen minute treat .
Some applauded , and some were just embarrassed .
But it created a stir , nonetheless .
The restaurant manger , Terence Chia said that he saw the couple undress Saturday night at a stair well nearby , then take the clothes in their hands and proceed to walk down the street wearing only their flip - flops .
They had barely got started when a crowd of about 200 people gathered to take pictures of the event .
The naked man was Caucasian and the woman an ethnic Chinese described as in their 20’s .
They were arrested and face a fine of about $ 1,330 or up to 3 months in jail , or both .
The incident was particularly curious for a country where even posing nude for artists is frowned upon .
The bloggers have been out full boar on this one , with pictures of the event taken by the various people who had been there who have been put them up for public view without restrictions .
Leonard Tran , who snapped one of the pictures that has been floating and edited by other bloggers on the Internet , said this about the incident , Guess so .
Maybe they ’ll be strolling in another city somewhere or someone like them will , so it ’s proof positive that those cell phone cameras are critical equipment for citizen journalists or voyeurs everywhere .

Spoilers for tonight's
" Lost "
coming up just as soon as I get my reel - to - reel going ...
" LaFleur " was n't a mind - blowing episode of " Lost , " nor one where we can spend a lot of time picking over it for clues about the larger mythology .
But boy , was it fun .
Having shown us Dan in the ' 70s in the season premiere , and having shown Jin driving the magic bus and wearing a Dharma jumpsuit at the end of " 316 , " the writers did n't have much of a surprise left in showing that the rest of Sawyer 's motley band also wound up hanging with Horace Goodpseed and company .
But that 's fine , because the the storytelling model of the last few seasons means that every now and then we need a filling - in - the - blanks episode , and this was one of the more entertaining ones they 've ever done .
Sometimes it 's nice to have an hour of " Lost " that 's relatively straightforward ( even with the frequent Three Years Later / Earlier jumps ) , that does n't require an advanced degree from the Dr. Sam Beckett Fan Correspondence School for Quantum
Theory to make sense of , that 's simply about the pleasure of watching a great character like James Ford doing his thing -- and , for that matter , the pleasure of watching Juliet Burke do her thing right beside him .
I 've always enjoyed Sawyer , but separating him from Jack ( both during season three and this season ) has been good for the character .
It forces him into a leadership role , and he 's even more appealing as a reluctant hero than he is as a charming irritant .
The very nature of " Lost " allows the show to explore lots of genres -- sci-fi , horror , action - adventure , espionage , soap opera , personal drama -- and their archetypes , and Sawyer the con man fits well into so many of them .
Here , we got to see him be all Steve McQueen ( with Juliet , I suppose , as Yul Brynner ) in his confrontation with the two Hostiles ( the looks they trade are pure McQueen / Brynner in " Magnificent Seven " ) , but also to see him as the crusty but benign boss in an off - beat period workplace drama ( " The Dharma Years ? " ) .
The look of pure joy on his face as Juliet told him about the successful delivery ( see above ) was matched only by the look of relief on Juliet 's face .
Josh Holloway and Elizabeth Mitchell played so well off each other throughout the episode , and sold all of the emotions as the two of them slowly assimilated into life with the Dharma Initiative .
Though I like Sawyer with Kate ( especially if the alternative is Jack with Kate ) , Sawyer and Juliet fit so well together that it was almost disappointing to see him set eyes on Freckles again at the end .
( Now that Sawyer 's been with Juliet , who used to be with Jack , who 's been with Kate , who used to be with Sawyer , we 've finally got a legitimate love quadrangle .
Quick : can anyone name an interesting love quadrangle in TV , movies or literature ?
Comic books ?
Cave paintings ? )
" LaFleur " gave us a Sawyer who was finally at peace after three years of waiting for Locke to show up , and it also gave us a Sawyer who had gradually learned to let go of lying .
Sure , he 's still using the name Jim LaFleur , and he still has Jin searching various quadrants of the island for Locke and the others , but he 's content , and he 's found love , and he manages to save the day -- and win a job as Dharma 's new security chief -- by telling Richard Alpert the complete and unvarnished truth .
( Is n't it funny how good things can happen when people on this island share information with one another ? )
I just had a great time throughout even as I wondered , like Juliet , what the point is of the Oceanic Six coming back .
Locke re-aligned the wheel , the jumps stopped , the nosebleeds stopped , everyone other than Charlotte is more or less okay , if stuck 30 years in the past , so what am I missing here ?
What plans does the island have for the Six ( and for Desmond , and , hopefully , Walt ) that have nothing to do with the needle - skip problem ?
And how mad are Jack , Kate and Hurley going to be once they realize that they apparently did n't need to come back to save everybody ?
I look forward to finding all that out , especially if upcoming episodes are as strong as this one .
Some other thoughts :
• The fine folks at the " Lost " Easter Eggs site wasted little time in getting up
a screen capture of the four - toed statue
in all its original glory , albeit from behind .
It 's probably a higher - quality than the one I made , but feel free to start analyzing either version for clues about just what this thing is .
It looks Egyptian to me , particularly the things in its hands , which look sort of like ankhs .
But Cuselof definitely lived up to their promise to show us the statue again , even if they did n't explain it or show us its face .
• Though this was primarily a Sawyer episode , with a generous serving of Juliet , I do n't want to overlook Jeremy Davies continuing to knock it of the park as poor , grieving Dan Faraday .
The look on his face as he recognized little girl Charlotte in the ' 70s was heartbreaking .
• Speaking of Charlotte , interesting that her body did n't go with them ( or stay with them ) on the last jump .
I guess whatever force was moving the rest of Sawyer 's group ( or holding them in place ) has no power over ( or interest in ) the dead , unless maybe they 're being touched by the living .
• After four and a half seasons of " Lost , " Daniel Dae Kim finally gets to stop speaking in pidgin English .
In our brief glimpses of him in the Three Years Later scenes , it 's clear his time among the Dharma - ites has done wonders for his language proficiency .
• I'm a little confused about the marital status of Horace Goodspeed .
When he was first introduced in season three 's " The Man Behind the Curtain , " he was traveling with Olivia , the character played by Samantha Mathis , and it was at least implied ( enough to convince the folks at Lostpedia ) that she was Mrs. Goodspeed .
And Olivia was seen again as a Dharma schoolteacher when Ben arrived on the island as a little boy .
Yet here , Horace is free to marry Amy as her rebound guy , so either we all misread the Olivia situation , plans changed for that character , or something more complicated is going on there .
• Speaking of " The Man Behind the Curtain , " did it establish whether there were fertility problems in the Dharma days , or only after the Hostiles overthrew them ?
Clearly , it was n't an issue back in the ' 70s , so whatever caused all the miscarriages has yet to take place .
• A good week for Hey , It 's That Guy / Girl !s on " Lost . "
In addition to the return of Doug Hutchison as Horace , we got Reiko Aylesworth from " 24 " as Amy , Patrick Fischler ( recently seen as comedian Jimmy Barrett on " Mad Men " ) as Phil and Kevin Rankin ( Herc on " Friday Night Lights , " and the only good thing about the " Bionic Woman " remake ) as Jerry .
• Still waiting for Rose , Bernard and Vincent to send up a signal flair .
Are we to assume that they 're also somewhere in the Dharma village , and we just did n't get to see them this week ?
And , as usual , what about Cindy and the kids ?
Or are they supposed to be immune to the jumps somehow like the native Others ?
• Note that Sawyer refers to Richard as " your buddy out there with the eyeliner . "
I guess they had to reference it sooner or later within the show , even if Lindelof and Cuse insist that Nestor Carbonell is n't wearing any eye makeup .
What did everybody else think ?
What 's so romantic about Valentine 's day ?
Or should I call it Hallmark day ?
It 's just another excuse to go out and buy a pile of shit for someone you supposedly care about .
I once saw a show where a guy bought his girlfriend a dozen roses and some chocolates , and then she said " oh Charles .. how romantic " and they started making out .
I hate Charles .
If he bought me a dozen roses and some chocolates , I 'd kick his ass ( but I 'd eat the chocolates ) .
I do n't hate Valentine 's day just because I do n't have a date ( but it does n't help ) .
Possibly the worst thing about Valentine 's day are those damned cupids .
I see them everywhere .
Little bastards .
They annoy the hell out of me .
Sometimes I can't sleep at night because stay up thinking about how much I hate Cupids .
Then I realize that it 's not cupids that I hate so much , but really mimes .
This leads me to the question : if a mime fell in a forest , would it make a sound ?
If I ever see a mime in a forest , I 'm going to trip it to find out .
We 're in the midst of a price war folks , and at a time when the global economy is looking a little shaky this actually works very well for us .
Let 's recap what 's happened .
AMD launched its first truly competitive CPUs in over two years in January : the Phenom II X4 940 and 920 .
Priced at $ 275 and $ 235 respectively , these two chips beat out the equivalently priced Intel CPUs , the Q9400 and the Q8200 .
If you have n't already , I would strongly suggest reading that article in order to get the background information necessary about what was changed in Phenom II to make it so competitive .
Less than two weeks later Intel responded by cutting its quad core prices .
The table below shows what happened :
Processor Dec '08 Price Jan '09 Price % Decrease Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 ( 3.00GHz ) $ 530 $ 316 40 % Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 ( 2.83GHz ) $ 316 $ 266 16 % Intel Core 2 Quad Q9400 ( 2.66GHz ) $ 266 $ 213 20 % Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 ( 2.50 GHz ) $ 224 $ 183 18 % Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 ( 2.33GHz ) $ 193 $ 163 16 %
AMD responded immediately , cutting its Phenom II prices to match :
Processor Launch Price New Price % Decrease AMD Phenom II X4 940 ( 3.0GHz ) $ 275 $ 225 18 % AMD Phenom II X4 920 ( 2.8GHz ) $ 235 $ 195 17 %
We really have to applaud both companies here .
Intel for responding so quickly and effectively ; the 40 % price drop on the Q9650 just made sense and now you can have a chip with 12 MB of L2 cache for under $ 300 thanks to the Q9550 .
And we have to thank AMD for keeping the pressure on and making this possible .
The Phenom II X4 940 is once more priced similar to the Core 2 Quad Q9400 , while the 920 is sort of in between a Q8300 and a Q9400 .
Based on last month 's article we know that the Phenom II X4 940 is a better buy than the Core 2 Quad Q9400 , but the 920 is a tougher sell compared to the Q8300 / Q9400 .
Phenom II : Now in Three Flavors
Things get more complicated with today 's announcement ; AMD is launching no less than five new Phenom II CPUs .
Their specs and model numbers are below :
Processor Clock Speed un-core Clock L2 Cache L3 Cache TDP Price AMD Phenom II X4 940 3.0GHz 1.8GHz 2MB 6MB 125W $ 225 AMD Phenom II X4 920 2.8GHz 1.8GHz 2MB 6MB 125W $ 195 AMD Phenom II X4 910 2.6GHz 2.0GHz 2MB 6MB 95 W $ ???
AMD Phenom II X4 810 2.6GHz 2.0GHz 2MB 4MB 95W $ 175 AMD Phenom II X4 805 2.5GHz 2.0GHz 2MB 4MB 95 W $ ???
AMD Phenom II X3 720 BE 2.8GHz 2.0GHz 1.5MB 6MB 95W $ 145 AMD Phenom II X3 710 2.6GHz 2.0GHz 1.5MB 6MB 95 W $ ???
AMD Phenom 9950 2.6GHz 2.0GHz 2MB 2MB 140W $ 173
The Phenom II X4 910 is just a lower clocked version of the CPUs we reviewed last month .
The 800 series is a bit more unique , albeit not in a good way .
The 900 series all have 2MB of L2 cache on die and a 6MB L3 ; the 800 shrinks the L3 down to 4MB .
If you remember back to our original Phenom II article I argued that a big reason for the original Phenom 's failure was that it did n't have a large - enough L3 cache .
With a 6MB L3 the 900 series seemed like a good balance between L2 and L3 cache size , but going any smaller than 6MB could prove to be overly detrimental to performance .
Also keep in mind that Intel 's Ronak Singhal was adament that Nehalem should n't have any less than an 8 MB L3 ( or 2 MB per core ) , even the mainstream Core i7 derivatives are slated to have 2MB of L3 cache per core ( 4MB for the dual - core versions ) .
A Phenom II X4 900 series die : 258 mm2 , 4 - cores and a 6MB L3 cache
The 800 series is simply an example of die harvesting .
Some of the die have too many defects in the L3 cache , but fully functional cores .
Instead of throwing away these CPUs AMD turns them into the Phenom II X4 800 series .
While physically the same die size and transistor count of the 900 series , these chips simply have some of the L3 cache disabled :
A Phenom II X4 800 series die : 258 mm2 , 4 - cores and a 4MB L3 cache
We 've also got the Phenom II X3 720 and 710 .
These are both triple - core derivatives , once again they are physically the same die as the Phenom II X4 900 series , but this time with only 3 cores enabled .
These are further harvested parts used simply to improve yields .
I suspect that between the Phenom II 900 , 800 and 700 series AMD is able to use as much of a single wafer as possible , all through harvesting and by targeting different price points .
Note that this is a smart strategy to compete with Intel because Intel 's 45 nm yields are already quite mature , thanks to a year - long head start .
A Phenom II X3 700 series die : 258 mm2 , 3 - cores and a 6MB L3 cache
As yields improve over time you can expect some of these parts to go away .
But for now , AMD basically has a single Phenom II die that it 's selling three different ways .
The 700 series is arguably one of the best harvested Phenom II parts AMD has since it retains the 6MB L3 cache of the 900 series .
With 2MB of L3 cache per core , this bests even the 900 series .
When AMD produces a Phenom II die if part of the L3 is bad , it gets disabled and is sold as an 800 series chip .
If one of the cores is bad , it gets disabled and is sold as a 700 series chip .
If everything is in working order , then we 've got a 900 .
This is part of an Erlang sample - code review built around a tic - tac - toe program .
The program is stuffed into one file , called tic.erl and available here .
The source code and this tutorial are organized into these sections :
Introduction
I recently programmed tic - tac - toe using Erlang , and I thought I ’d offer to anyone looking for sample code .
Here ’s the source .
Tic - tac - toe is a good choice for an example program .
It ’s a simple yet still non-trivial game , so it ’s interesting .
Everyone knows the rules , which makes it easy to understand the architecture and code design .
Deciding the next move involves some analysis and decision making .
And it touches on a lot of features .
This version of tic - tac - toe has a standard - IO text interface , which means it reads and displays to the console .
That ’s right : no graphics , no windows , no mouse .
It prints the board using fixed - width scrolling text , and it asks for keyboard commands .
State of the art — in 1970 .
It would n’t be hard to kick together a GS ( Erlang Graphic System module ) interface .
Maybe I ’ll do that sometime .
Running the program
To run this program first you have to install Erlang on your computer .
You might also want to look at the tutorial .
When you can get an Erlang shell started you can run tic - tac - toe .
Assuming I ’ve saved tic.erl at c:/ examples / erlang /tic.erl , here ’s what it looks like to load the module ( tic ) and start the game .
Erlang ( BEAM ) emulator version 5.6.5 [ smp:2 ] [ async - threads:0 ] Eshell V5.6.5 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > c( 'c:/examples/erlang/tic' ). {ok , tic} 2 > tic:play ( ) .

What do you want to do ( h=help , q=quit ) ?
At this point the game stops , waiting for me to type something and hit return .
I ’ll ask for help .
What do you want to do ( h=help , q=quit ) ?
h
Please enter one of the following : q - quit h - help , show this message g - start a new game b - show a simple board n - show the board with open spots numbered p - show a board with predicted outcomes 1 - 9 ( a single digit ) - choose X's next move a - automatically choose X's next move s - skip X's next move
What do you want to do ( h=help , q=quit ) ?
There are three generic commands : quit , help , and start a new new game .
And then there are three options that affect how the board is printed .
And finally there are 3 ways to make a move .
Let ’s let the computer move first .
We type ‘ a ’ and hit return .

As you can see , this is n’t just simple tic - tac - toe .
The computer is predicting the outcome of each of the possible next moves for ‘ O ’ .
If ‘ O ’ plays in the center ( position 5 ) and neither ‘ X ’ nor ‘ O ’ make any mistakes , this will end up a cat game .
But if ‘ O ’ plays position 2 ( just above the center ) then ‘ X ’ can win in three more moves .

Pretty brilliant , eh ? OK , maybe not .
I know tic - tac - toe is n’t exactly cutting - edge game theory , but I enjoyed programming it , and I hope you enjoy it too .
Thanks for reading !

Take a flexible chain of uniform linear mass density .
Suspend it from the two ends .
What is the curve formed by the chain ?
Galileo Galilei said that it was a parabola , and perhaps you made the same guess .
This time Galileo was not correct .
The curve is called a catenary .
However , it is easy to see how he could arrive at this answer through casual observation and incomplete deduction .
Look at the similarities between a parabola and the curve of the chain .
For this comparison , assume that the parabola is concave upward .
Both curves have a single low point .
They both have a vertical line of symmetry .
They at least appear to be continuous and differentiable throughout .
The slope is steeper as we move away from the low point , but it never becomes vertical .
We can get back to the chain solution later .
First consider this extension .
What about the curve formed by the cables of a suspension bridge ?
Is it too a catenary ?
No , it is a parabola .
So , what gives ?
How can this be a parabola while the other one is not ?
The Parabola
It may be more easy to understand these curves if we determine what it is that makes them different .
What makes them curve in the first place ?
In the case of the chain , it is curving because of its own weight .
But here is where the bridge cable is different .
It too curves under its own weight , but a much greater influence is the weight of the bridge deck .
The source and magnitude of the weight is not important , but its distribution makes a big difference .
Look at this sketch , and consider the distribution of the mass on a suspension bridge .
The road deck hangs on vertical cables suspended from the main cables .
The cables themselves may be large , but their mass is insignificant when compared with that of the deck , so disregard the mass of the cable .
Suppose that the deck is horizontal , and suppose that its cross section is uniform throughout the length of the bridge .
Also , the vertical cables are so close together that we can assume that the weight of any part of the deck is transferred to the part of the main cable directly above it .
These conditions are reasonably close to the real thing .
Rather than compute the height of the cable at a given point , let us try to determine the slope of the cable at that point .
Naturally , the cable will align itself with the direction of the forces pulling on it .
There is one point on this cable where that direction is easy to see .
At the lowest point , the vertex , the cable is horizontal .
Label that point O and let that be the origin of a set of coordinate axes .
Now pick an arbitrary point , P , on the cable , somewhere to the right of O .
What is the direction of the tension at point P ?
How do we determine that ?
Consider only that part of the cable in the interval between O and P .
It is motionless .
More importantly , it is not accelerating .
That means that the net force on it is zero .
In the study of physics , forces may be modeled with a free body diagram .
Each force is identified with a vector arrow .
The direction of the arrow is parallel to the direction of the force , and the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the force .
There are three forces acting on the cable interval OP .
One force is the tension from the cable to the left .
Call this force .
It acts in a horizontal direction to the left .
There is also a force from the cable on the right , exerted at point P .
This force will be called .
Its direction is what we need to determine , because that will tell us the slope of the cable at P .
The third force is the weight on the cable , .
Since this is a gravitational force , its direction can only be vertical and downward .
The net force can be determined by adding the vectors .
Graphically , this is accomplished by aligning the vectors point to tail .
We already know that the net force is zero , so the last vector must end where the first one began .
By doing this in the illustration on the right , we can see the direction of , which gives us the slope at P .
In this equation W and T are magnitudes only , not vectors .
But what are W and T ?
Well , T is clearly a constant .
It is the tension at point O , which is the same no matter what point is chosen for P . W is the weight on the cable between O and P .
This is the weight of the roadway directly below that length of cable .
How can it be determined ?
Remember that one of our conditions was that the deck has a uniform cross section throughout .
That means that one meter of road on one part of the bridge would have to weigh the same as one meter of road on any other part of the bridge .
Let μ represent the linear weight density of the deck .
That is , multiplying μ by the length of any interval on the deck will give the weight of that interval .
So what is the length of the road from O to P ?
It is not the distance between those two points .
The cable is curved , but the road below it runs horizontally .
The length of that stretch of road is simply the difference in the x-coordinates of those points .
Point O is the origin , so all we need is the x-coordinate of point P. W = μx
This is where the calculus begins .
Let y be the height of the cable .
The slope of the cable then must be the first derivative of y .
So y is an antiderivative of the function μx / T. , for some constant C
We know that the origin is on the curve .
Substituting zero for x and y and solving for C , we find that C = 0 .
Since μ/( 2T ) is a constant , this is a quadratic equation , a parabola .
The Catenary So why does this not work for the chain , which carries no load ?
Well , this turns out to be more complicated .
We can define points O and P on the chain , just as we did with the bridge cable .
We can even use the same free body diagram , and we get the same slope formula : ( slope at P ) = W/T .
The trouble starts when we try to compute the weight , W . Unlike the bridge cable , the chain carries only its own weight .
That weight is proportional to the length of the chain between O and P .
It can not be computed by simply multiplying the horizontal distance by a constant .
We need some way to find the length of the chain between O and P .
As before , let the low point of the chain be the origin .
Let y be the height of the chain .
Again , μ will represent linear weight density .
This time it is weight per length of chain .
Let s be the length of the chain between O and P .
This means that the weight of the chain between O and P must be μs .
You may recall this formula for the length of a curve on the interval ( a , b ) :
We can use it to find s , the curve length on the interval ( 0 , x ) :
The derivative , dy / dx , is itself a function of s .
Make this substitution for s in the integration equation above .
Differentiate both sides with respect to x .
We need to define y as a function of x , so that it satisfies this equation and the condition y( 0 ) =
0 . See if this one fits :
In case you are unfamiliar with hyperbolic trigonometry , the hyperbolic cosine is defined by this formula :
Dont take my word for it .
Confirm that this catenary equation works .
Even if you have never worked with hyperbolic trigonometry , you can apply elementary differential calculus skills to find the first and second derivatives of the function .
This solution was not actually derived here but there is enough information to verify it .
One question remains unanswered .
Why did Galileo believe that the catenary was a parabola ?
Mathematics aside , it would have been quite simple to test it experimentally .
Plot a parabola and try to make a hanging chain fit the curve .
It will not work .
Try it .
Click the image below to see a camparison of four curves .
The red one is a geometric construction of a hanging chain based on the forces that were described above .
The slope of each link has a linear relationship with the number of links between there and the center .
The blue curve is a catenary .
The green curve is a parabola .
Finally , we have the real thing , a photograph of my watch chain .
The corresponding sliders control the length of the red links , the weight of the links , and the parameters for the parabola and catenary .
At the vertex of each curve is a point that allows it to be dragged .
Lay them over the photo and over each other .
The parabola will not fit with anything , but the other three fit quite well .
The image below is dynamic .
Drag the points to see the relationships .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
In his latest mug shot , Charles Manson 's wild - eyed stare is gone , as is most of his hair .
Except for the swastika he carved into his brow during his murder trial , he could be any gray - bearded senior citizen .
A new photo of Charles Manson shows his gray beard and the swastika tattooed into his forehead .
If the photo authorities released early this week is any indication , the leader of a murderous band called " The Family , " has mellowed some after almost 40 years in a California state prison .
He has had a lot of alone time .
Manson , 74 , is locked away in protective custody , according to Sabrina Johnson , a spokeswoman at Corcoran State Prison in Corcoran , about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles .
Manson has his own cell .
His exposure to prison neighbors that include mass killer Juan Corona and Robert F. Kennedy 's assassin , Sirhan Sirhan , is very limited , Johnson said .
Manson and four others -- Susan Atkins , Patricia Krenwinkel , Charles " Tex " Watson and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two - night rampage that left pregnant actress Sharon Tate and seven others dead .
Manson and the four " family " members ' death sentences were overturned during the 1970s , when the death penalty laws were ruled unconsitutional .
He is quietly serving out his life sentence .
Although he once frequently gave bombastic rants on national television , he has n't granted a media interview in years .

New mug shot shows aging Manson
Manson receives a lot of mail , and many requests from people who want to visit him , Johnson said .
He still occasionally sees a few people .
" Over the years , he 's taken some people off the visitor list and put them back on , " Johnson said .
" He has the same rights as any other prisoner . "
Manson has been disciplined in the past , losing privileges , but he 's now in good standing and good health , Johnson added .
All members of the " Manson family " have been up for parole multiple times over the past four decades , but it has never been granted .
Manson 's next parole hearing is in 2010 .
He did not show up for the last one in 2007 .
His mug shot , which instantly made its way around the world over the Internet , was taken as part of a regular update of inmate images at the prison .
Its release comes ahead of the 40th anniversary of the " Manson family " killings in August 1969 .
Van Houten , who was 19 at the time of the killings , was convicted in the murders of Leno LaBianca , a wealthy grocery store owner , and his wife , Rosemary .
Van Houten was accused of stabbing Rosemary LaBianca 14 to 16 times in the back .
Van Houten was also convicted of conspiracy in Tate 's death and four others at the actress ' Beverly Hills home .
Tate was about eight - and - a - half months pregnant , and her baby also died in the attack .
Manson , Atkins and Krenwinkel also were convicted for those murders .
Atkins , who has been declared terminally ill , was denied a compassionate release from prison in July 2008 .
She is believed to have been one of the people who stabbed Tate and scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski .
In May 2008 , authorities dug for bodies at the Inyo County , California , ranch where Manson and his followers once lived , after police learned that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there .
According to authorities , nothing was found .

進一個公司是因為公司本身，而離開他是因為自己的老闆...
在一本書上面看到了這一句話，感覺非常的經典，也隨手把他發送到plurk上面，立即就得到不少人的迴響，大家的回覆都表示心有戚戚焉；這一本書是一個真實發生在職場上的一些故事，故事的男主角在離職之前，已經為了公事連續熬夜了幾天，然而就因為一件發生在飯局之後的不愉快事件，隔天就提出了辭呈；這種情結似乎一直在職場上不斷的上演...
這篇文章的內容是比較消極面的，主要是描寫不少公司的小部份不為人知或者大家都默默承受的一面，不喜歡的人建議跳過不看，我認為我們還是應該正面一點來面對職場上的一些不愉快或者不如意，但是最近看了一篇老同學轉寄來的文章《閱讀空氣》，不知是哪一期《商業周刊》裡面的文章，講的就是人要懂得察言觀色，了解週遭(尤其是客戶、老闆)的情緒或者是當下對你的觀感，那做起事來絕對會事半功倍；因此我想把一些公司內常見老板與員工之間的一些微妙的生態形容一下...
其一，很多的老闆都會對員工們說一句話 ， 「 不要以為我不知道你們一天到晚在做些什麼」，很有意思，聽到這句話，一些資淺的員工會被唬的一愣一愣的，然後對老板唯命是從，覺得老闆好神，然而如果是一些較為資深的員工，則會心想，「呵呵，你知道什麼，只不過是一些表象的東西而已」，其實不管是那種員工的想法，其實都對，但也都不對，因為老闆之所以是老闆正因為他真的有他的高人之處，善於觀察人心，也確實有攏絡人心以及拉攏人心的方法，而很多事情確實是有很多面，也經常老闆看到的確實有他的先入為主的觀念，或者說成見，畢竟老闆也是人，而人都是經常以偏概全的...
其二，如果你只是想找一個公司然後就希望能夠一直待到退休，那就應該要了解這個公司生態內的各種人物角色，尤其是哪些人是所謂國王的人馬，或許這麼說非常的八卦，然而尤其針對只想在公司內「安養天年」的小員工來說卻非常重要，因為我們經常會看到一些人就經常發言不當，而搞出一些好笑又耽誤自己「大好前程」的事件，而這只是對於員工而言，而對於公司而言，經常老闆也會故意的安排幾個所謂自己的心腹或者人馬，其一不只是對於自己的政策或者交辦事項發揮一個帶頭執行、帶頭響應的效應，其二就是所謂幫老闆了解員工們對於公司的想法以及對於公司政策的態度，而這也正響應了上述的第一點...
可以這麼說，老闆經常是精明的，但也會經常的會有糊塗的一面，尤其是所謂公司內部所謂國王的人馬，因為在公司做大的過程中，畢竟老闆也只是一個正常人，並沒有三頭六臂，也需要建立自己的人馬來協助自己，而這些人馬中堪用的有執行力的就會各自擁有自己的山頭，成為一方霸主...
而國王的人馬中也有不少是庸才的，可能做一些簡單的工作還行，但是就因為沒有本事，所以只能在公司中幫老闆們多多留意底層員工的心思，而如果這些人馬接收到的信息是有所偏頗的那很可能影響老闆的判斷，同時對於公司內的員工來說，這些國王的人馬也就如同帶著尚方寶劍一般，如朕親臨且不能怠漫...
而這些事情其實是對於有自視之人來說，更多是把辦公室生態或者辦公室政治「視如糞土」，而且覺得噁心，面對這種局面，他們會有兩條路，一是自行離開，選擇另一片淨土，或者一直誤踩地雷，終身抑鬱不得志，二是真的學會了所謂的「閱讀空氣」，了解所謂的辦公室生態，應該說有益無害...
The following two tabs change content below .
A policy governing the interrogation of terrorism suspects in Pakistan that led to British citizens and residents being tortured was devised by MI5 lawyers and figures in government , according to evidence heard in court .
A number of British terrorism suspects who have been detained without trial in Pakistan say they were tortured by Pakistani intelligence agents before being questioned by MI5 .
In some cases their accusations are supported by medical evidence .
The existence of an official interrogation policy emerged during cross-examination in the high court in London of an MI5 officer who had questioned one of the detainees , Binyam Mohamed , the British resident currently held in Guantánamo Bay .
The officer , who can be identified only as Witness B , admitted that although Mohamed had been in Pakistani custody for five weeks , and he knew the country to have a poor human rights record , he did not ask whether he had been tortured or mistreated , did not inquire why he had lost weight , and did not consider whether his detention without trial was illegal .
Mohamed is expected to return to Britain soon after ending a five - week hunger strike at Guantánamo Bay , where he was being force - fed .
After he was seen by British officials and a doctor over the weekend , the Foreign Office said he was medically fit to travel .
Cross -examined in the high court last year , Witness B acknowledged that Mohamed was in " an extremely vulnerable position " when he questioned him in Karachi in 2002 .
The MI5 officer admitted telling him that " he would get more lenient treatment if he cooperated " , and said that he knew he was to be transferred to US custody .
Witness B was asked by Dinah Rose QC , for Mohamed : " Was it your understanding that it was lawful for Mr Mohamed to be transferred to the US authorities in this way ? "
Witness B replied : " I consider that to be a matter for the security service top management and for government . "
Asked then whether the transfer concerned him , Witness B replied : " I was aware that the general question of interviewing detainees had been discussed at length by security service management legal advisers and government , and I acted in this case , as in others , under the strong impression that it was considered to be proper and lawful . "
He denied that he had threatened Mohamed and said the prisoner appeared well enough to be questioned .
Mohamed was eventually able to tell lawyers that before being questioned by MI5 he had been hung from leather straps , beaten and threatened with a firearm by Pakistani intelligence officers .
After the meeting with MI5 he was " rendered " to Morocco where he endured 18 months of even more brutal torture , including having his genitals slashed with a scalpel .
Some of the questions put to him under torture in Morocco were based on information passed by MI5 to the US .
The Guardian has learned from other sources that the interrogation policy was directed at a high level within Whitehall and that it has been further developed since Mohamed 's detention in Pakistan .
Evidence of this might emerge from 42 undisclosed US documents seen by the high court and sent to the MPs and peers on the intelligence and security committee ( ISC ) .
Lawyers representing Mohamed went to the high court in an attempt to secure the disclosure of the documents , but the court reluctantly refused earlier this month after David Miliband , the foreign secretary , said such a move would damage national security and UK - US relations .
Miliband 's position in the affair came under renewed attack yesterday after it emerged that his officials solicited a letter from the US state department to back up his claim that if the evidence was disclosed , Washington might stop sharing intelligence with Britain .
The claim persuaded the high court judges to suppress what they called " powerful evidence " relating to Mohamed 's ill - treatment .
Edward Davey , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , today described the move as possibly " one of the most outrageous deceptions of parliament , the judiciary and the British people .
There must be an immediate investigation , with all related correspondence made public . "
The FCO said it asked the US to make its position clear in writing " to inform both us and the court " .
It said it was " both perfectly sensible and the correct thing to do " .
The high court said it was now up to the ISC to " hold those in charge of the secret intelligence service and security service and her majesty 's government to account " .
In a letter to the committee , Clive Stafford Smith , the director of Reprieve , says : " The ISC would want to know whether the intelligence services brought the issue of Mr Mohamed 's abuse to the attention of the prime minister ( then Mr Blair ) – and , if not , why not . "
He said if the evidence had been brought to Blair 's attention , " the ISC would want to know what , if anything , was done about it .
If nothing was done , that would raise serious questions about the respect that the UK government has for its obligations under the convention against torture . "
Evidence heard by the court in - camera – once the public and the media had been excluded – resulted in Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , asking the attorney general , Lady Scotland , to investigate " possible criminal wrongdoing " by both American and British security and intelligence officers .
Witness B's testimony is expected to be considered by MPs and peers on parliament 's joint committee on human rights , which has begun an inquiry into allegations of British collusion in the torture of detainees in Pakistan , and is asking Miliband and Smith to give evidence .
A number of British terrorism suspects have been questioned by British intelligence officials , including MI5 officers , after periods of alleged torture by Pakistani interrogators .
Last year Manchester crown court heard that MI5 and Greater Manchester police passed questions to Pakistani interrogators so they could be put to Rangzieb Ahmed , 35 , from Rochdale .
MI5 officers also interviewed him while he was in custody , although the head of the consular division at the British high commission was not informed about his detention for nine months .
By the time Ahmed was deported to the UK 13 months later , and successfully prosecuted for terrorism offences , three of his fingernails had disappeared from his left hand .
He says they were removed with pliers while he was being questioned about his associates in Pakistan , the July 2005 terrorist attacks in London , and an alleged plot against the United States .
While other detainees have also subsequently been prosecuted or deported to the UK and made subject to control orders , one vanished in bizarre circumstances and was subsequently said to have been killed in a US missile attack , although his family has not been given his body .
A number have been released without charge .
A medical student from London who was held for almost two months in a building opposite the offices of the British deputy high commission in Karachi says he was tortured while being questioned about the 2005 London bombings before being questioned by British intelligence officers .
He was released without charge and is now working at a hospital on the south coast of England , but is thought to remain deeply traumatised .
Secularism seems to be on the march in America .
This week , a new study from the Program on Public Values at Trinity College found that the number of Americans claiming no religion now stands at 15 % , up from 8 % in 1990 and 2 % in 1962 .
The secular tide appears to be running strongest among young Americans .
Religious attendance among those 21 to 45 years old is at its lowest level in decades , according to Princeton sociologist Robert Wuthnow .
Only 25 % of young adults now attend services regularly , compared with about one - third ...
The best students in our program find our " economics with attitude " contagious and many have gone on to stellar careers in research and teaching .
The one defining characteristic of our program is the open invitation to inquiry that we offer to all who are serious about using economics to study human beings in all walks of life .

The .append ( ) method is perhaps the most misused of all jQuery methods .
While an extremely useful and easy method to work with , it dramatically affects the performance of your page .
When misused , the .append ( ) method can cripple your JavaScript code 's performance .
When used well , it 'll keep your script humming along .
Here is a typical example of append misuse :
[ js ] var arr = really LongArray ; $ .each ( arr , function ( count , item ) { var newTd = $ ( '' ) .html( item ) .
attr ( ' name ' , ' pieTD ' ) ; var newTr = $ ( '' ) ; newTr.append(newTd ) ; $ ( 'table ' ) .append( newTr ) ; } ) ;[/ js ]
Ran Once : Profile ( 308.697ms , 17861 calls , Firefox 3.06 )
Ran in a for loop 100 times : Profile ( 51782.295ms , 1805100 calls )
If you 're coming from Prototype to jQuery , chances are this looks quite natural to you .
It 's the way that Prototype does node creation / insertion , but with a little bit of jQuery chaining thrown in .
Let 's see how we can improve this .
' + item + '
[ js ] var arr = really LongArray ; $ .each ( arr , function ( count , item ) { var newTr = '' ; $ ( ' table ' ) .append( newTr ) ; } ) ;[/ js ]
Ran Once : Profile ( 107.458ms , 3991 calls , Firefox 3.06 )
Loop of 100 : Profile ( 21641.336ms , 399100 calls )
Whoa !
Nearly a 3 x difference , and much simpler to look at .
jQuery can take more then one node at a time and create them all at once .
You also do n't need to wrap it in $ ( ) before appending it .
jQuery knows what to do .
But wait , there 's more !
' + item + '
[ js ] var arr = really LongArray ; var textToInsert = '' ; $ .each ( arr , function ( count , item ) { textToInsert += '' ; } ) ; $ ( 'table ' ) .append(textToInsert ) ; [/ js ]
Ran Once : Profile ( 30.792ms , 778 calls , Firefox 3.06 )
Loop of 100 : Profile ( 8505.37ms , 77800 calls )
Taking full advantage of the ability of jQuery to insert a chunk of html in a string means only having to call insert once .
It 's much quicker , with an approximately 9 - 10 x speed increase from the initial algorithm !
This will be fast enough for 95 % of cases , but for strings with lots of string concatenation …
Wait , there 's more !
' ; textToInsert [ i++] = item ; textToInsert [ i++ ] = '
[ js ] var arr = really LongArray ; var textToInsert = [ ] ; var i = 0 ; $ .each ( arr , function ( count , item ) { textToInsert [ i++] = '' ; } ) ; $ ( 'table ' ) .append(textToInsert.join ( ' ' ) ) ; [ / js ]
Credit for this one goes to Michael Geary
Ran Once : Profile ( 29.724ms , 778 calls , Firefox 3.06 )
Loop of 100 : Profile ( 8298.699ms , 77800 calls )
This version is a bit harder to understand , as the html is not in an easy to read format , and the results vary by browser * ( see below for further analysis ) , but in most current and next generation browsers , adding to an array and joining it into a string at the end is quicker then doing string concatenations .
So , if you are looping through a large number of string concatenation and need some more speed , you should consider this method .
So , now we 're done , right ?
This is as blazingly fast as we can get it ?
Not quite .
[ js ] var arr = really LongArray ; var textToInsert = [ ] ; var i = 0 ; var length = arr.length ; for ( var a = 0 ; a < length ; a += 1 ) { textToInsert [ i++ ] = '
FLAGSTAFF - Drivers busted by photo - enforcement cameras along state highways in northern Arizona 's Coconino County will have to pay to challenge speeding tickets .
Coconino County Justice Courts will charge $ 20 extra when drivers challenge or ignore their tickets .
The only way for drivers to avoid the extra fee is to pay the ticket without question .
The court has yet to process any citations , but two mobile speed - enforcement cameras are being placed on major highways in the area , including Intestates 17 and 40 .
Last year , the court processed 12,300 traffic - related tickets in Coconino County .
The new fee comes as state lawmakers weigh whether to toss out Arizona 's controversial new statewide photo - enforcement program .
A witness and firefighter give their accounts of the jump and rescue operation AP
A man who apparently tried to kill himself by jumping off the top of Niagara falls yesterday became only the second person in history to survive the 54 metre ( 180 ft ) plunge unattached and with no protective device .
The man , believed to be in his late 30s , survived after leaping into the rapids above the Horseshoe falls , one of Niagara 's three waterfalls .
He then desperately resisted rescue attempts , swimming away from rescuers who tried to pull him from the near - freezing waters and climbing out of a sling dropped by a helicopter , police said .
A witness alerted police after seeing the man jump into the Canadian side of the falls .
He emerged near the base of the falls a short time later , but as specially trained rescue crews tried to save his life , he swam away from them towards the middle of the river , according to Doug Kane , the Niagara Parks police chief .
A private helicopter was called and the pilot used wind from the blades to generate a current which pushed him closer to shore where rescuers could reach him .
" He was n't co-operative , " the pilot , Ruedi Hafen , told the Associated Press .
" He did n't try to be helpful .
We had a sling on him and he got out of it . "
After about 30 minutes in the icy waters , much of that spent resisting rescue attempts , the man was hauled to dry land by a firefighter and a rescue worker .
He was taken to Niagara Falls hospital suffering from hypothermia and a head injury .
" He was on a suicide mission , I assume , " Hafen said .
" I 've never , in my career , seen someone so tough , swimming between the ice . "
The last person known to survive a plunge over the falls was Kirk Jones , a former auto parts salesman from Michigan who climbed down a small embankment and jumped into the Niagara river on 20 October 2003 .
Jones said he had been depressed and drinking when he went over the famous falls .
At least 17 people , not including those trying to kill themselves , are known to have gone over the falls .
Niagara falls consists of three waterfalls : the American falls , Horseshoe falls and Bridal Veil falls .
The Horseshoe falls on the border of Canada and the US sends 110,000 - 168,000 cubic metres of water over its edge every minute and is one of the world 's most popular tourist attractions .
Ubuntu 9.04 , codenamed Jaunty Jackalope , has reached the beta testing stage .
The beta release , which was made available for download last week , provides users with an opportunity to get an early look at the features that will be included in the new version of the popular Linux distribution .
Ubuntu 9.04 includes GNOME 2.26 , the latest version of the open source GNOME desktop environment .
We did some hands - on testing with the new GNOME release when it arrived earlier this month .
GNOME typically represents a large chunk of the user - visible improvements in new Ubuntu releases , but there is n't really anything particularly exciting for Ubuntu users in GNOME 2.26 .
Two noteworthy GNOME 2.26 features in Ubuntu 9.04 that come to mind are UPnP support in the Totem video player and MAPI support in the Evolution mail client .
The only major new piece of software added to the desktop environment is the Brasero disc burning program , which has already been included in Ubuntu for several versions .
Ubuntu 9.04 is built on version 2.6.28 of the Linux kernel , which was released in December .
This kernel version is the first in which the new Ext4 filesystem has officially been declared stable .
Ubuntu 9.04 still uses Ext3 by default , but will provides optional Ext4 support .
The practical reliability of Ext4 in a production desktop environment is still somewhat questionable and there are potential problems with data loss .
I personally do n't recommend using it yet in Ubuntu .
Ubuntu 9.04 also adds Xorg 1.6 , which brings some improvements to open source graphics drivers , particularly for ATI video cards .
In the beta release , I ran into some trouble with Xorg 's input hotplugging functionality , but I was able to find a simple workaround .
Canonical 's new notification system and messaging indicator are also included in 9.04 .
I 've already modified one of my own projects to make it take advantage of the new notification features ; I 'll have more details about that in an upcoming article .
The new notification system is a nice improvement over the previous notification daemon .
It leverages the desktop 's compositing capabilities to support transparency .
The only problem that I have encountered with it is that in a dual - head environment , the messages are displayed on my secondary screen instead of my primary screen .
All things considered , Ubuntu 9.04 is shaping up to be a pretty good release , albeit a bit light on new features .
I 've been running the it since the beginning of the month , when I installed it from a daily CD image .
I 've only had a few minor problems with it and it 's definitely on track to be much more robust than the last two versions .
I 'm having significantly fewer problems with Compiz and PulseAudio .
I 've also noticed that boot performance in 9.04 is excellent , as my system starts up much faster .
In our Linux forum , some of our community members have started the traditional Ubuntu release quality thread to discuss potential issues with the new version .
So far , the consensus seems to be that 9.04 is a positive improvement .
There is some concern about a problem relating to ssh- agent and there are also the usual hardware - specific complaints about video driver breakage .
For more details , refer to the official release notes .
The beta is available for download from the Ubuntu web site .
Today Google launched its behavioral targeting ad program , which it calls " interest - based advertising . "
This move has been widely expected once Google completed its $ 3.1 billion acquisition of DoubleClick one year ago today .
The issues with behavioral advertising have been with us for over a decade ( DoubleClick was founded in 1996 , and privacy issues soon followed ) , and have grown as more people use more services online and more information has become available about your online behavior .
Many , including EFF , are concerned about behavioral targeting because it means that information about how you use the web is collected , stored and associated with a cookie on your browser , which can track you across different websites and online services .
One way to help protect your privacy is to clear cookies regularly .
However , this is insufficient , because a new cookie would be written the next time your browser loaded a banner ad .
The most privacy protective solution would be to have behavioral targeting systems be based on the user 's opt-in .
To no one 's surprise , Google has not gone down that road ( " ' Offering advertising on an opt - in basis goes against the economic model of the Internet , ' Google spokesperson Christine Chen told the IDG News Service " ) , and we are not aware of any major player in online advertising that has an opt - in targeting system .
Google has , however , done some things that make opt - out quite a bit better .
Google contacted us about behavioral targeting early on in their development process , and solicited our feedback .
One issue we discussed was a persistent problem with opting - out of targeted online advertising -- the use of cookies to opt - out of tracking cookies .
The problem is that the very users who care most about privacy are the ones most likely to delete cookies .
Yet , if a user deleted all their cookies , they would also delete the cookie that had opted them out of the targeting .
So we worked with Google to seek a new solution .
Google accepted the technical challenge , and the result is the Advertising Cookie Opt - Out Plug - in , which allows users to keep their opt - out status for a particular browser even when they clear all cookies .
We appreciate that Google was responsive to the opt - out cookie concerns , and especially pleased that the plug - in is available as an open source project .
We look forward to it being available for Safari , Chrome and other browsers , not just IE and Firefox .
Google also introduced its Ad Preferences Manager tool .
While using this tool does not stop Google from tracking users , it allows users to express preferences about what sort of advertisements will result from that tracking .
We prefer to opt - out , but this is an improvement to transparency .
If you are a user who shares our concerns about privacy , we encourage you to opt - out of tracking and keep regularly deleting your cookies .
Just as critically , we encourage Google to promote the opt - out options prominently , and make it simple and easy for an average person to use .
After all , these tools are not useful if no one uses them .
Keep in mind that the plug - in works only on particular browsers , so you will need to install it on every browser you use .
This may not be the end of the story .
Last month , the FTC revised its Online Behavioral Advertising Principles .
Last year , the House Energy and Commerce Committee looked at online advertising practices , and Rep. Markey said " he and his colleagues plan to introduce legislation next year [ i.e. 2009 ] , a sort of online - privacy Bill of Rights , that would require that consumers must opt in to the tracking of their online behavior and the collection and sharing of their personal data . "

In November of 1982 my best friend had a Sony TCS - 310 Stereo Cassette Recorder .
Audio cassette tape was the affordable recording medium at the time and one wintery day while on our way to the arcade ' Just Fun ' in Ithaca , NY , we came up with the idea to record video game sounds in the arcades .
We recorded our video game experiences from 1982 until 1988 in a variety of locations on the east coast .
Most of the recordings come from Ithaca , NY , Albany , NY and Ocean City , MD .
Other locations include Lancaster , PA , Falmouth , MA , Rehoboth Beach , DE and Key West , FL .
Luckily I stored all fourteen audio tapes in a safe place and rediscovered them when I moved the rest of my stuff out of my parents house in 1997 .
In the last several years I digitized these nostalgic recordings to preserve and share them .
Experience the magic and the wonder of the early years of coin - op video games .
Hear the classic arcade ambiance like you have n't heard it in over a quarter of a century !
The blend of several video games being played simultaneously , the kids yelling and the quarters clanking .
We will never hear such beautiful chaos quite the same way again ....
Shares of Citigroup have dropped as low as 98 cents a share , and were lately at 99 cents , an all - time low for the stock , as banks continue to get hammered in the wake of warnings of more ratings downgrades on banks and expectations that the government , one way or another , will have to put a large institution in receivership when it goes through its round of stress tests to determine the financial health of the nation 's banks .
Citi's drop mirrors a decline in other iconic American companies , including General Motors , which ...

My latest discovery of a behavior bug in Python earned me some negative comments .
I have to admit that the way I blogged about it and how I reported the bug was not that fair .
It was just one bug in a million and I was surprised how late it was discovered .
I was really puzzled because of that .
Anyhow .
That 's not what I want to blog about here ; more about my bad experiences with the standard library in general .
Everybody who knows me know that I hate things quickly and that I 'm crazy about beautiful code .
Especially in the Python land there are some guys like Christopher Lenz and the trac team or Georg Brandl who write beautiful code just as I like it :)
The Python Standard Library
But why am I especially mad about the standard library ?
The reason for this is that the standard library has some problems ( caused by the fact that it's the standard library ) .
A lot of stuff ended up in Python a long , long time ago .
And that was fine for the time .
I can't blame anyone for the state of the standard library .
A lot of stuff was added to it long before I even knew what a computer was .
Let 's take cgi as an excellent example .
cgi was , when it was created , CGI a nice little protocol that just worked .
And I really have to give kudos to the developers of this library for doing tons of stuff right .
It may sound awkward if you know the library in detail , but believe me , the fact alone that it nearly worked flawlessly with WSGI is noteworthy .
It 's incredible if you think that WSGI was added years after the library was written .
So some forward thinking in terms of “ decoupling ” it from CGI did the library very well .
However the age of cgi shines through .
I just recently discovered that the infamous cgi .
FieldStorage provides multipart / mixed support .
This is incredible .
While it 's specified as part of HTML4 it was never implemented in a browser people actually used on the world - wide web .
The downside is that , like many other libraries in the stdlib , it mixes a high - level API with low - level parsing features .
For example if you access a key in a field storage you can't trust that key .
It could either be a string , a FieldStorage or a list or strings or FieldStorage`s or both at the time thanks to the `multipart / mixed support ..
Hardly anyone knows that because he trusts the data in that it returns the correct value .
I guess there are enough Python scripts out there that would die with an internal server error if you pass input data via form that changes from a string into a FieldStorage .
The days when you could trust your user to submit the data you expect are long gone .
And security and browser bugs are things that change on a nearly on a monthly basis .
To savely use FieldStorage you have to un-magicify it by walking it and unpacking the data into something you can trust .
Moving all files into one dict , all strings into another one etc .
So in older Werkzeug versions and in current Paste / Webob versions the field storage is traversed and preprocessed before the data is handled to the developer .
And the cgi module is one of those I had the least problems with .
Besides having an archaic API it also features some serious fuckups like accessing sys.argv when you least expect it , undocumented logging code and years of backwards compatibility .
Thanks to the magic API it was also impossible to select the upload storage based on the content length or stop parsing if resources are exhausted ( someone trying to submit a gigabyte of form data to the server , which is always stored in memory ) .
The Cookie module is one of my “ favourites ” .
It comes with backwards compatible code that can be used to let an attacker execute arbitrary code on the server and has an API that is so weird and magical that few in the history of Python frameworks exposed that API to the user .
On parsing errors it drops all the cookie values and it does not very well with real - world cookies which means that you can have a lost cookie very fast .
The morsel stuff it uses internally is written in a way that you can only add support for stuff like HttpOnly by subclassing it and overriding builtin and undocumented attributes .
Until recently urllib did n't had proper timeout support making it practically impossible to safely use it in a web application .
The socket.setdefaulttimeout ( ) hacks have so many problems , do n't even get me started .
And I 'm not mad that there was no timeout support .
My problem solely is that the library was written in a way that it 's impossible to add such missing features by hand without rewriting the library .
BaseHTTPServer is another library that has magic built - in .
Without copy / paste of undocumented code you can't write a web server that listens for all HTTP methods .
( Not true , there is a way .
You could override __getattr__ , look for do_* attributes and forwarding that to a proxy method but …)
Do you know the codeop module ?
It 's used to implement the Python- version of the Python interactive shell .
It works like this : compile the code , compile the code with a newline at the end , compile the code with two newlines at the end and compare the string value of exceptions raised to figure out if we are at the end of the input -.- Until Python 2.6 there was no documented way to load a file from the Zip file as a file descriptor , rather than a complete string .
Do you know imaplib ?
In the real world it 's nearly unusable because it stops half way and returns values in a half - parsed and undocumented format making it impossible to actually do anything useful it with except for the very basics .
And I 'm not talking about stuff that was now finally deprecated like dircache , sv or god knows what is in the stdlib nobody knows about or locale which is not process - safe and so useless that the Babel guys see no way except reimplementing everything from it as separate new library .
Why is it in that Sad State ?
How does stuff go into the standard library ?
Maybe we should go there .
I 'm not sure how that happens .
Some stuff went into the standard library I 'm very happy about .
Modules like threading , multiprocessing , urllib , json etc .
These modules have one thing in common :
They either implement something that is heavily platform dependent , essential or standardized and stable .
Other stuff went into the standard library just to decay there .
For example we have the cgi module , the webbrowser module ( which should be part of the GUI libraries , not a Programming language 's standard library ) etc .
What is a standard libary for anyways ?
A standard library is shipped as part of the language and should make it possible to make applications platform independent .
To provide often used features and implement them in a way that everybody can use it , from any context .
Not just single - threaded command line applications .
A cool standard library would provide IO access , filesystem and platform introspection helpers , access to the programming language internals ( a interface for debuggers , access to the AST / compiler / bytecode / garbage collector etc. ) , support for package distribution , ways to extend the import system etc .
There would be kick - ass unicode support , regular expressions , datetime objects , collections and other data structures etc .
Not standard library worthy is stuff like any kind of web development support .
These things change quicker than you can sing the Spam song .
Also a UI toolkit like
Tk is something that 's not standard library worthy ( especially because it 's rendering widgets like it 's 1985 ) .
Why is there support for wave files ?
Especially in such a useful way .
Why are there 5 or more file - system databases like bsddb ?
Why is there an SQLite adapter shipped ?
Why do we have parsers for robot .
txt files ?
plist ?
asyncore ?
commands / popen2 and tons of other redundant ways to invoke external applications and get the output ?
The builtin XML support is in such a bad state due to the fact that XML and the technologies that make it worthwhile are so complex that they require more bugfixes / releases of the libraries that implement it or change so quickly that the standard library can't keep up .
Minidom is annoying , the standard etree does n't even support printing of XML documents with custom namespaces without falling back to unreadable names .
( remember that XML was sold to use as human readable ? ) .
Your area of expertise !=
Our area of expertise I 'm one of those developers that really likes to write library with a nice API and that reads through tons of RFCs , blog posts to similar topics etc. to deliver a nearly - perfect library in the end .
Of course I fail in delivering perfect libraries .
Far from it .
However I try to improve the stuff I write over time , learning of my mistakes and improving them .
From nearly two years of Jinja developing , the feedback I 've got , studying of similar code and more I was able to collect some knowledge to know how template engines in Python may work and what can be changed in the language to improve the experience .
I just recently started diving into the gory details of HTTP , browser bugs and everything else .
I had a look at earlier code I 've written and had to notice that I was stupid and solved problems in a way that they seem to work , without seeing the bigger picture .
This experience comes over time and it takes a couple of releases to really come up with an implementation that works like it should .
I 've seen from other project that I 'm not alone with that .
Compare older Django versions with more recent ones .
Earlier Django versions monkey patched modules to move models into other modules , Cherry Py started as a standalone server in the pre-WSGI days that even went as far as implementing a Python - inspired language for the application code that compiles down to Python ( I 'm not exactly sure how that worked .
I just remember something like that .
Correct me if I 'm wrong ) .
Zope is in it 's third iteration as well , Ian seems to have learned from mistakes as well and fixes them in WebOb now , Genshi took over Kid and is its unofficial successor fixing problems learned from there etc .
This is something you can't do in the standard library .
Once code is there , it sticks .
So nobody can be blamed for problems in the standard library .
This is what happens if code ends up there .
This is the effect a standard library has on code .
So far I have just contributed two modules to the standard library .
One is the ast module which provides compiler .ast like access to the new Python AST , incorporating experiences I 've got when working on Jinja and Genshi .
The other one is the ordered dict which is n't yet there , but where I suppose it will be accepted in one way or another .
The experience for those two libraries was interesting .
The intentions I had with the AST module seem to clash with Guido 's believes in Python a bit .
When Google launched the AppEngine I and Christopher Lenz had a discussion with Guido via mail why the _ast ( the internal module used by ast ) module was unavailable there .
Between the lines you could hear that he was not very happy with giving Python modules the access to the compiler : IMO it 's more that because it was available people flocked to it as a timesaver .
As the compiler package has turned out to be a ridiculous maintenance nightmare , nobody really wants to support that any more .
Hopefully the pgen2 package ( which is more flexible and more limited ) is easier to use .
I can highly recommend it .
pgen2 , if you do n't know it , is the library working in the 2to3 tool and Sphinx which is a ( slowish ) Python parser written in Python .
I noticed Guido 's dislike in Python code generating and compiling Python code last djangocon as well .
He started his keynote by joking about how the Django template engine is superior to anything else out there .
( Of course I do n't know if he means the implementation or philosophy , but something inside me told me he was happy that it was evaluating a custom AST and not compiling down to Python ) I suppose that 's fine .
Python is his brain child , but I was hoping he could see that for quite a few situations it would be helpful to have an AST to play around and compile it down to Python bytecode .
So what does this have to do with the standard library ?
A lot if you think about it .
It basically means that a library in the standard library is no longer the library of the person who wrote it .
It 's part of a bigger plan .
Suddenly different rules apply .
Updated are distributed with Python as I 've said earlier already .
But that 's not the only thing that changes .
The philosophy changes as well .
Normally if I notice that something does not work as expected , I consider changing it with a deprecating warning or starting a separate library that is backwards incompatible but fixes those problems ( like I did with Jinja 2 ) .
In the standard library you are forced to live with some bugs if they are not fixable in a backwards compatible way .
Someone else will suddenly decide that changes wo n't go into a library because it would break code , something the Python team can't allow .
And this is a great thing .
It means that updating from one Python version to another is in general very painless .
It just has negative implications on libraries that ended up there too early or have to be changed to stay up with latest developments .
On the other hand stuff that does belong into the standard library should get some more love .
Why is there no function yielding file names in a directory instead of returning a list ?
Why do n't we have a module that gives us colors for the terminal in a platform - independent way ?
What about adding unicode support to Python 's regular expressions ?
Or implement some more UTRs for the unicodedata module ?
Platform independent file locking and file change notifications ?
That would be honking great !

Since their introduction at the beginning of 2008 , so - called netbooks have had a sudden , meteoric rise ; sales have surpassed all projections , and new launches have dominated much of the gadget press .
How did this happen all of the sudden , and why ?
Can the netbook growth phenomenon possibly continue unabated ?
In the second installment of this series , Ars explores the past , present , and future of the netbook form factor .
Part I , entitled “ WEee have lived before , ” explored the surprisingly long history of netbook - style computers , from their origins in the early days of x86 to the long hiatus before the rennaissance that created the modern netbook .
This second article will explore the netbook ’s resurrection over the last few years , through the OLPC , Classmate , Nanobook , Eee , and Menlow platforms and devices .
WEee have lived before : the TL ; DR version
In Part I , we explored three distinct approaches to the netbook , exemplified by the HP 200LX series palmtop , Psion ’s 5 series palmtop and 7 series “ Netbook , ” and Toshiba ’s celebrated Libretto .
The LX used 80186 hardware , the Psion devices used ARM and a custom OS , and the Libretto used laptop hardware and some very fancy engineering , to achieve somewhat the same ends .
For a combination of reasons involving undesirable spots on the continuous tradeoff between performance , size , and price , all three approaches substantially failed .
Netbooks would have to wait for their own platform , and the form factor quieted for a number of years , from 2000 to 2007 .
Intel , meanwhile , took note of the engineering success achieved by OQO ’s Model 01 computer , which ran Windows XP on a 14 - ounce brick with a five - inch screen and a slide - up keyboard .
Although the Model 01 accomplished this feat for $ 2000 using a Transmeta processor , Intel seemingly reasoned it could do better , and along with Microsoft , produced the UMPC , its first attempt at an x86 ultraportable form factor .
The result was underwhelming , partially because the process technology was n’t quite there , but more because of the unfortunate decision to go without a keyboard , which constrained the use - case considerably .
Intel had chosen the wrong role model for its platform , and tried to do too much , too soon .
Clearly , something different needed to happen for low - cost , ultraportable x86 computing to really take off .
OLPC : technoevangelism brings the netbook to the world 's poor
The OLPC X0
The answer came very indirectly , and from an unlikely source : a nonprofit with big dreams called One Laptop Per Child .
Its founder , Nicholas Negroponte , also the founder of the Media Labs at MIT , had a vision of a world in which laptops would be cheap enough to bring the advantages of modern education to the world 's poorer schoolchildren .
In service to this vision , at the World Economic Forum in January 2005 Negroponte 's project announced a new laptop called the XO developed specifically for children in the developing world .
The XO sported minimal hardware that was considered obsolete for PCs in the first world : an AMD Geode processor , 1GB of flash , a tiny LCD touchscreen , USB , and WiFi .
It ran a custom Linux variant and sported a battery which the designers envisioned recharging with a hand crank .
The XO was intended to be manufactured in fantastic quantities , to allow economies of scale to reduce its price to the staggeringly low sum of $ 100 .
With the cost of laptops reduced to a single Benjamin , developing countries with little infrastructure could deploy them rapidly and extend the digital revolution to all their children .
Brazil 's entire child population could be supplied with laptops on a continuing basis , one per child on entering school , with the proceeds of an endowment typical for a single top - flight university in the USA .
These laptops could replace much of the more expensive books - and - chalkboards infrastructure of traditional education , allowing countries to turn out whole generations of well - educated , computer - literate youngsters and make the quantum leap to developed status in one fell swoop .
To Negroponte , the project was nothing less than the key to developing humanity 's potential for the majority of its members .
Model OLPC XO - 1 Screen 7.5 " 1200*900 dual mode color / grayscale Processor AMD Geode 500 Mhz Storage 1GB Flash Memory 256MB Battery Life Disputed , about 4 hours with color screen Weight 3.5 pounds OS Fedora Linux with " Sugar " UI Price $ 188 cost to build , available to consumers for $ 399
Direct sales to first - world consumers did n't fit with Negroponte 's altruistic vision .
While some first - worlders would probably have been interested in buying one , Negroponte and the OLPC project initially dismissed such an option as a dilution of the project 's duties to children in poorer nations and a compromise of its nonprofit philosophy .
The OLPC was an education project , not a technology project .
While OLPC later relented and introduced the barely functional " Give One Get One " program , this was more a reaction to the project 's floundering finances and practical failure to distribute computers .
The project was a bright flame , to be sure .
Within nine months of its first announcement , the laptop was being touted by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , and had the sponsorship of Google , AMD , Red Hat , and others .
The UN jumped onboard officially in less than a year , and countries like China , India , Brazil , Argentina , Egypt , Nigeria , and Thailand began to show interest .
Negroponte 's initial goal of producing 100 million laptops in the project 's first two years of production started to sound like a possibility .
Then , reality set in .
Working prototypes of the XO did n't emerge until May 2006 , by which time the expected price had risen , first to $ 130 and then to $ 188 , robbing the project of its shockingly low price tag and sapping much of its third - world appeal .
The beginning of volume production , which was predicated on firm orders for five or six million units , some billion dollars in initial commitments from host governments , was delayed until 2007 .
Worst of all , the hand crank proved to be unrealistic , and , after being replaced with an external foot pedal , was scrapped altogether .
Meanwhile , criticism on pedagogical grounds of OLPC 's general idea of better education through laptops accumulated , as did some embarrassing stories of failed of trial projects .
Classmate : Intel ’s answer to OLPC was a repackaged UMPC
Intel 's Classmate PC
Intel ’s watchful eye took notice of the OLPC project .
While Santa Clara initially dismissed the XO as a " gadget " without the capability to run the PC applications users would need to improve their lives , the CPU giant quickly decided to start a competing project in early 2006 .
It will probably never be clear what Intel ’s true intentions were in starting such an initiative .
While a genuine concern for education is not out of the question , it ’s more likely the decision stemmed from a desire to bring cheap computers to poorer nations in volume , to scuttle the OLPC ’s vision by sapping its energy , or both .
It is , however , unlikely that Intel intended its competing project to be a trial run for a netbook form factor in the first world .
We 've followed plenty of controversies around drug trials , from ghostwriting to keeping quiet about unflattering results .
But the latest news is particularly eye - popping : A prominent Massachusetts anesthesiologist allegedly fabricated 21 medical studies involving major drugs .
Yikes .

The hospital says its former chief of acute pain , Scott S. Reuben , faked data ...

There is much discussion these days about bailouts .
Are they needed ?
Are they just ?
I say no on both counts .
Yet many economists , politicians , and businessmen tell us that bailouts are needed to prevent catastrophic economic collapse .
Without commenting on the justice of bailouts , they warn that we are facing massive economic pain if we stand aside and let markets run their course .
Bailouts can staunch this pain , they claim , and restore order and calm to the economy .
I do n't buy the probailout folks ' predictions of impending economic chaos .
But what if they 're right ?
What if the short - run pain in store is just too terrible to endure if we do n't start bailing out key industries ?
After all , we 're talking massive unemployment , a new wave of foreclosures , a shrinking economy — in a word , recession .
If the dire forecasts of the bailouters are correct , we'd be stupid not to do it ; we'd be like a beaver caught in a trap : slowly dying , yet too timid to chew off his own foot to escape .
Capitalism depends on three highly complementary , yet distinct , institutions : prices , property , and " profit and loss . "
Classical - liberal economists have demonstrated the essential role of these pillars of prosperity for centuries .
These fundamental institutions of the market economy are like legs of a stool .
If we gradually weaken one leg , we will eventually bring the stool toppling down — economic collapse .
In this light , the implications of bailout are clear .
Bailouts are designed to insulate people from the effects of bad decisions .
When market prices change dramatically , exposing yesterday 's poor investment choices , bailouts come " to the rescue , " promising those left holding the bag that they wo n't have to endure the full cost of their errors .
But we should realize , as the fine print always says , that prices are subject to change .
Change is a defining feature of markets .
Entrepreneurs make money by casting about for " wrong " prices and making bets on what direction particular prices will move in the future .
Successful entrepreneurs , who correctly anticipate price changes , are rewarded with profits .
Erroneous entrepreneurs , who do a poor job of estimating price movements , are penalized with losses .
This is the essence of the market process .
Bailouts , then , attempt to erase the effects of losses , or economic failure .
But such efforts inevitably undermine the loss aspect of " profit and loss . "
Profit and loss go together — like up and down , left and right , good and bad .
If we try to do away with losses , we 'll wind up diluting the meaning of profits .
After all , why strive for profits if Uncle Sam will cover your losses with a bailout ?
Why bust your butt to compete and succeed if you can just clamor for a handout instead ?
Bailouts destroy the profit motive — and all the benefits of a competitive economy .
There 's a great irony in bailouts , too .
The only reason we can afford to even talk about bailouts is because of the accumulated wealth brought about by centuries of capitalism .
$ 8 $ 5 " If we try to do away with losses , we 'll wind up diluting the meaning of profits . "
Long ago , bailouts were unheard of ; failure meant starvation , perhaps death .
Consider the caveman :
Ug 's tribal chief could n't afford to say , " It OK Ug no kill deer this week .
It not Ug 's fault .
Tribe will bail out Ug . "
If he wants his tribe to stick around , the chief must say , " Ug no kill deer : Ug family starve . "
But modern man lives in a world of comparative abundance .
If Doug is laid off because of recession , he 'll have to find a new job and maybe tighten his belt .
But Doug does n't face starvation in our economy , and there are ample opportunities for him to adjust to economic changes .
Yes , Doug will suffer somewhat during the transition , but the short - term pain of economic failure will guide him toward more productive , successful choices .
Failure is no fun , but it does teach essential lessons .
We should n't miss out on those lessons simply because we think we can afford to bail people out .
Instead of trying to abolish failure via bailouts , we should let markets work , let failure run its course , and be so much the wiser for it .
' Darling , I 've just had an accident ' :
The amazing calm of the airline pilot who landed on the Hudson River
The man who saved 155 lives in the Miracle on the Hudson has been revealed as a master not only of flying , but also of understatement .
A passenger who shared a life raft with Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger III told how he emotionally thanked the pilot on behalf of all the survivors .
The reply was simply : ' You 're welcome . '
So proud : Lorraine Sullenberger , flanked by daughters Kate , right , and Kelly , left , fights back tears of pride for her husband as she spoke to the media yesterday
Escape : Passengers had no option but to stand on the plane 's wings in the immediate aftermath of the crash
Once ashore , the captain , a father of two teenage daughters , phoned his wife Lorraine at home in California to tell her : ' There 's been an accident , darling . '
The 57 - year - old former fighter pilot received plaudits from around the world yesterday after landing his stricken U.S. Airways Airbus intact on New York 's Hudson River .
It was the first time in half a century of commercial jet flights that an airliner had been successfully landed on water without any fatalities .
Only by executing a perfect textbook ' bellyflop ' did the pilot prevent the 100 - ton fuselage from disintegrating on impact .
The captain , who has been flying for nearly 40 years and also runs a safety consulting firm , walked through the aisle of the partially - submerged plane twice to make sure it was empty before being the last to leave on Thursday night .
More Clark Kent than Superman : Chesley B. Sullenberger III , otherwise known as Sully , the pilot who save 155 lives - pictured left at the U.S. Air Force Academy in in 1973 , the year he joined ; and right , more recently as a US Airways pilot
After his 150 passengers and four crew were ferried to shore from the sinking jet , he remained as calm as he had been from the moment a flock of geese knocked out both of his engines moments after take - off .
' He was sitting there in the ferry terminal , wearing his hat and sipping his coffee and acting like nothing happened , ' said one rescuer .
' He looked absolutely immaculate - like David Niven in an airplane uniform .
He looked unruffled .
His uniform was sharp . '

Passenger Billy Campbell said he was on a rescue raft with Captain Sullenberger which took the last of those from the plane to shore .
' I leaned over and grabbed his arm , and I said I just want to thank you on behalf of all of us , ' said Mr Campbell .
' I was nearly in tears with relief , but he was so calm .
He just looked at me and nodded and said , " You 're welcome " . '
Back home in Danville , California , Mrs Sullenberger thought her husband must have been involved in only a trivial accident from his unruffled manner when he phoned her .
' It was a shock to find out what happened , ' she said .
' I just thought it was something minor when he first told me .
He is a pilot 's pilot - very controlled and very professional .
Passers - by in Manhattan peer curiously at the plane today - still submerged in the Hudson and now surrounded by chunks of ice that , thankfully , were not floating in the river during the miracle landing
' I 've heard Sully say to people that it 's rare for an airline pilot to have an incident in their career so I was not afraid .
It never crosses my mind . '
Flanked by her daughters Kate , 15 , and Kelly , 14 , she added : ' We are very proud of dad .
We are just grateful that everybody got off safely .
That was what my husband would have said . '
The shy hero remained out of sight as the plaudits poured in yesterday , with officials saying he was unable to comment until the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration investigation into the crash was completed .
Investigators brought in a giant crane and a barge yesterday to pull the airliner from the river .
They will now focus on examining its black box and interviewing the crew .
Slowly sinking : Survivors huddle on the wing and an escape slide minutes after the crash in this photo taken on a mobile phone by a ferry passenger
New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said he would be presenting the captain with a ceremonial key to the city .
' Hemingway defined heroism once as grace under pressure and I think it 's fair to say that Captain Sullenberger certainly displayed that yesterday , ' he said .
Within hours of the incident , a page dedicated to praising the pilot had been set up on the internet site Facebook .
Among thousands of messages were some demanding he be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Honour .
George Worthington , from New Jersey , said : ' Not only did you land the plane safely , you walked the plane twice to make sure there was no one left on board .
You are a true hero . '
Passengers were standing on the plane 's wings in the immediate aftermath of the crash , which was broadcast on WNBC -TV
Another visitor asked : ' How do I book on your next flight ? ' while one said : ' Well done captain , great job .
Now can you pick up next week 's Powerball numbers for me ?'
The emergency chutes were used as rafts to take passengers onto the bigger tourists boats that were standing by to help .
Although several people fell into the frigid water , they were pulled out by divers and a US Airways spokesman confirmed early today that there were no fatalities .
Hypothermia took up to just eight minutes to set in with the water temperature just above freezing .
Several survivors were treated for hypothermia and one stewardess broke her collarbone , but all - included a nine - month - old baby and a toddler - survived .
New York Governor David Paterson said : ‘ This is really a potential tragedy that may have become one of the most spectacular days in the history of New York City .
Did anyone see that ?:
The wake made by the landing can still be seen in the water as passengers crawl out on the wings to wait for help

We have had the Miracle On 34th Street .
Now we have the miracle on the Hudson , ’ he said .
' The pilot did a masterful job , ’ added New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
' I have spoken to him and he said he walked up and down the plane after everyone was off and he was confident there was n’t anyone left on board . ’
The flight left New York ’s La Guardia Airport bound for Charlotte , North Carolina , at about 3.20 pm yesterday afternoon .
But both engines were wrecked within seconds and the plane was in the air just six minutes before crash landing on the river .
A dual bird strike that kills both powerplants , if confirmed by federal transportation investigators , is virtually unheard of in U.S. aviation .
Going down :
The hulk of the plane sinks into the Hudson
Witnesses said the captain pulled the nose of the plane up just as it hit the water , helping to keep the fuselage intact .
Experts said the pilot did ‘ absolutely everything right ’ with a ‘ textbook ditching ' .
' If you know you are facing a ditching , the crash - landing of an aircraft on water , it is crucial that you land the plane absolutely level , ’ said David Learmount , operations and safety officer of Flight Global .
' You must not try to keep the plane airborne and if you land it too slowly you will drop out of the sky , ’ he added .
Mr Learmount said that the pilot had to land the plane perfectly straight - otherwise it would have broken up on impact .
Survivor Fred Burretta , added : ‘ I 've flown in a lot of planes and let me tell you that was a phenomenal landing . ’
Some survivors of the crash laugh in relief , others phone loved ones , and still others merely look shocked as they wait for a bus to take them from a First Aid centre in New Jersey

The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has cut its key interest rate to 1.5 % from 2.0 % , the lowest since it started setting euro rates in January 1999 .
It followed a cut in UK rates by the Bank of England .
US and Japanese rates are , in effect , already at zero .
At a news conference , ECB president Jean - Claude Trichet slashed his forecasts for eurozone growth .
The ECB is now predicting GDP this year in the 16 - nation bloc will shrink by between 2.2 % and 3.2 % .
Its last prediction , made in December , was that growth would be between no change and a fall of 1 % in 2009 .
For 2010 it was predicting growth of between 0.5 % and 1.5 % .
It is now forecasting growth of between 0.7 % and minus 0.7 % .
Non-standard measures
The revisions reflect Mr Trichet 's view that the global economy has " weakened substantially in recent months " but that it will " gradually recover " in 2010 .
Overall inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2 % over 2009 and 2010
Jean - Claude Trichet , President , ECB
But there were no new measures announced to help stimulate the eurozone economy , with Mr Trichet stressing that he was already using various " non-standard measures " and saying that the ECB 's rate - setters were considering various others .
Slowing growth was confirmed by revised economic growth figures issued earlier on Thursday .
GDP for the last three months of 2008 was down 1.3 % from the same quarter of the previous year , worse than the initial estimate of 1.2 % .
The figure for the previous quarter was left unchanged at a 1.5 % fall .
Thursday 's decision was the ECB 's fifth rate cut since October 2008 , which has brought eurozone rates down from 4.25 % .
Mr Trichet said that interest rates could still fall further from their current level , although he pointed out that they are already at a very low level .
He also said that inflation would stay below the ECB 's target of below , but close to , 2 % .
" Overall inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2 % over 2009 and 2010 , " he said .

( This story is part of a Reuters series on infrastructure )
CHICAGO , March 23 ( Reuters ) -
There is a gaping hole where one of the world ’s tallest buildings is supposed to go up .
The planned 150 - story Chicago Spire would be 2,000 feet tall ( 610 m ) if it gets built atop its completed foundation , ranking the tower the tallest in the Western Hemisphere and the sixth - tallest among the world ’s planned skyscrapers .
The Spire was supposed to be finished by 2012 and the Irish developer staged a global marketing campaign .
Buyers snapped up a third of its 1,194 luxury condominiums priced between $ 750,000 and $ 40 million .
Ty Warner , creator of the Beanie Baby toys , opted for the top - priced penthouse .
But after digging a 76 - foot - deep ( 23 m ) hole and sinking caissons , construction on the twisting Spire -- inspired , its famed architect Santiago Calatrava said , by swirling smoke from a Native American campfire -- was stalled in January by the credit crisis that is stifling construction worldwide .
Chicago has long been a showcase for tall towers since the steel - framed skyscraper was invented , its history full of developers whose ambitions sometimes crashed on the rocks of economic slowdowns , said John Norquist , president of non-profit group The Congress for the New Urbanism .
For people living in the hundreds of new condominiums near the planned Spire , the unbuilt site “ starts to look like a blight , ” Norquist said .
“ When everybody ’s feeling buoyant and they all think they ’re going to be billionaires overnight , that ’s when these ‘ biggest ’ plans come about .
If you get them going before the bust hits , they get built right away .
Otherwise you ’ve got to wait and sometimes they do n’t get built at all , ” he said .
Globally , work has been halted on 142 , or 11 percent , of 1,324 skyscraper projects , including 29 of 301 U.S. projects , according to Emporis GmbH , a German company that tracks development .
Work is stalled on the five tallest buildings on five continents , including the Spire -- Emporis refers to these landmark buildings as “ Babel ” projects .
Work was stopped on the kilometer - tall ( .6 mile ) Nakheel Tower in Dubai , one of scores of construction projects idled in the former Gulf Arab boom town .
A January HSBC report said $ 75 billion worth of projects in the United Arab Emirates were suspended or canceled .
Contractors complain of not being paid .
Other tall towers on hold are Moscow ’s Russia Tower and the Gran Torre Costanera office building in Santiago , Chile .
MASSIVE JOB LOSSES
The U.S. economic downturn has probably been felt most acutely in the construction industry .
Some 2 million American construction workers are unemployed and the industry ’s 21.4 percent jobless rate is the highest of any sector .
“ Every month we see massive job loss in the construction industry and every month it gets worse ...
The construction industry is in a near depression , ” said Terry O’Sullivan , head of the Laborers ’ International Union of North America .
The recently passed U.S. economic stimulus bill was expected to funnel $ 150 billion into building and repairing infrastructure , which the union said would employ 700,000 workers , for a while .
The stimulus funding is viewed as only a downpayment on the $ 2.2 trillion engineers say is needed to rebuild the nation ’s infrastructure .
Fewer workers are needed to perform maintenance than build from scratch , laborers say .
“ If there ’s no buildings going up , what do you do ? ” said James Connolly , a Laborers ’ union manager .
“ Prepare yourself because it ’s going to get worse before it gets better . ”
Construction workers are accustomed to boom - and - bust cycles but this downturn appears deeper and longer .
The impact of lost wages of $ 35 to $ 40 an hour ripples through the economy .
“ People out of work , people lose their homes , people lose their hospitalization , people lose all their benefits , ” said Tom Villanova , president of the Chicago and Cook County Building Trades , which covers 100,000 construction workers .
“ It ’s as bad as I ’ve ever seen it , and I ’ve been around for 30 years , ” he said .
Dublin - based Shelbourne Development Group has so far failed to get financing for the $ 1 billion Chicago Spire .
Now , construction unions are negotiating to invest their pension funds to kickstart the project .
The Spire would provide 1 million paydays for ironworkers , carpenters and others .
But construction loans are hard to come by .
Delinquency rates in Chicago on such loans have risen for 10 consecutive quarters to 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Many projects never got off the ground , while other developers have scaled back or suspended work altogether .
The residential market has a glut of unsold and foreclosed homes -- at least 7,000 in the Chicago area alone , Villanova said .
In downtown Chicago , canceled contracts on condominiums in the latest quarter outnumbered meager sales , which were off sharply from nearly 3,800 sales in all of 2007 , according to Appraisal Research Counselors , a real estate firm .
Prospective buyers surrendered downpayments of $ 10,000 or more , scared off by falling prices and the bleak job market .
“ I ’ve been out of work since December , ” with few prospects , said sprinkler system installer Jeff Switalski , 40 .
He said the number of unionized installers in Chicago has tripled to around 1,500 since he started in 1995 , when the city began a building boom .
Locally , all eyes are on whether Chicago wins the 2016 Summer Olympics , which would be a huge construction project .
“ Maybe if every town , every city , in the United States had an Olympics , that would be the only thing that would save us , ” Switalski said .
The Roma ( " Gypsies " ) of Europe were registered , sterilized , ghettoized , and then deported to concentration and death camps by the Nazis before and during World War II .
Approximately 250,000 to 500,000 Roma people were murdered during the Holocaust — an event they call the Porajmos ( the " Devouring . " )
A Brief History of the European Roma
Approximately 1,000 years ago , several groups of people migrated from northern India , dispersing throughout Europe over the next several centuries .
Though these people were part of several tribes ( the largest of which are the Sinti and Roma ) , the settled peoples called them by a collective name , " Gypsies , " which stemmed from the ( false ) belief that they had come from Egypt .
This name carries negative connotations and is today considered an ethnic slur .
Nomadic , dark - skinned , non-Christian , speaking a foreign language ( Romani ) , and not tied to the land , the Roma were very different from the settled peoples of Europe .
Misunderstandings of Roma culture created suspicions and fears , which in turn led to rampant speculation , stereotypes , and biased stories .
Many of these stereotypes and stories are still readily believed .
Throughout the following centuries , non-Roma ( Gaje ) continually tried to either assimilate the Roma people or kill them .
Attempts to assimilate Roma involved stealing their children and placing them with other families ; giving them cattle and feed , expecting them to become farmers ; outlawing their customs , language , and clothing ; and forcing them to attend school and church .
Decrees , laws , and mandates often allowed the killing of Roma people .
In 1725 , King Frederick William I of Prussia ordered all Romas over 18 years old to be hanged .
A practice of " Gypsy hunting " was common — a game hunt similar to fox hunting .
Even as late as 1835 , a " Gypsy hunt " in Jutland ( Denmark ) " brought in a bag of over 260 men , women , and children , " writes Donald Kenrick and Grattan Puxon .
Though the Roma had undergone centuries of such persecution , it remained relatively random and sporadic until the 20th century when the negative stereotypes became intrinsically molded into a racial identity , and the Roma were systematically slaughtered .
Genocide of the Roma People in the Holocaust
The persecution of the Roma started at the very beginning of the Third Reich .
Roma were arrested and interned in concentration camps as well as sterilized under the July 1933 law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring .
In the beginning , Roma were not specifically named as a group that threatened the Aryan , German people .
This was because , under Nazi racial ideology , Roma were Aryans .
The Nazis had a problem :
How could they persecute a group enveloped in negative stereotypes but supposedly part of the Aryan super race ?
Nazi racial researchers eventually came upon a so - called " scientific " reason to persecute most of the Roma .
They found their answer in Professor Hans F. K. Günther 's book " Rassenkunde Europas " ( " Anthropology of Europe " ) where he wrote :
The Gypsies have indeed retained some elements from their Nordic home , but they are descended from the lowest classes of the population in that region .
In the course of their migrations , they have absorbed the blood of the surrounding peoples , and have thus become an Oriental , western - Asiatic racial mixture , with an addition of Indian , mid-Asiatic , and European strains .
Their nomadic mode of living is a result of this mixture .
The Gypsies will generally affect Europe as aliens .
With this belief , the Nazis needed to determine who was " pure " Roma and who was " mixed . "
Thus , in 1936 , the Nazis established the Racial Hygiene and Population Biology Research Unit , with Dr. Robert Ritter at its head , to study the Roma " problem " and to make recommendations for Nazi policy .
As with the Jews , the Nazis needed to determine who was to be considered a " Gypsy . "
Dr. Ritter decided that someone could be considered a Gypsy if they had " one or two Gypsies among his grandparents " or if " two or more of his grandparents are part - Gypsies . "
Kenrick and Puxon blame Dr. Ritter for the additional 18,000 German Roma who were killed because of this more inclusive designation , rather than if the same rules had been followed as were applied to Jews , who needed three or four Jewish grandparents to be considered Jews .
To study Roma , Dr. Ritter , his assistant Eva Justin , and his research team visited the Roma concentration camps ( Zigeunerlagers ) and examined thousands of Roma — documenting , registering , interviewing , photographing , and finally categorizing them .
It was from this research that Dr. Ritter formulated that 90 % of Roma were of mixed blood , and thus dangerous .
Having established a " scientific " reason to persecute 90 % of the Roma , the Nazis needed to decide what to do with the other 10 % — the ones who were nomadic and appeared to have the least number of " Aryan " qualities .
At times , Interior Minister Heinrich Himmler discussed letting the " pure " Roma roam relatively freely and also suggested a special reservation for them .
Assumably as part of one of these possibilities , nine Roma representatives were selected in October 1942 and told to create lists of Sinti and Lalleri to be saved .
However , there must have been confusion within the Nazi leadership .
Many wanted all Roma killed , with no exceptions .
On December 3 , 1942 , Martin Bormann wrote in a letter to Himmler :
" ... special treatment would mean a fundamental deviation from the simultaneous measures for fighting the Gypsy menace and would not be understood at all by the population and lower leaders of the party .
Also the Führer would not agree to giving one section of the Gypsies their old freedom . "
Though the Nazis did not discover a " scientific " reason to kill the 10 % of Roma categorized as " pure , " no distinctions made when Roma were ordered to Auschwitz or deported to the other death camps .
By the end of the war , an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 Roma were murdered in the Porajmos — killing approximately three - fourths of the German Roma and half of the Austrian Roma .

An indication to this effect was given here today by New and Renewable Energy Minister Farooq Abdullah while addressing the India Carbon Market Conclave , organised by FICCI in partnership with The World Bank and the German Environment Ministry .
" The provision for inclusion of these incentives have been discussed with the Planning Commission and I have requested the planners to offer these for a larger period of eight years rather than five that was given during 11th Plan , " Abdullah said .
The Minister expressed confidence that the National Development Council which is to meet soon would put its stamp of approval to the Ministry 's proposals for the 12th Plan ( 2012 - 17 ) .
Abdullah also said that a Group of Ministers ( GoM ) will decide on the modalities for increasing the ethanol : petrol mix from the present 3 per cent to 5 per cent .
The decisions of the GoM will be posed to the Union Cabinet soon .
The Minister cautioned the domestic industry against the import of cheap , low quality technology while underlining the need to acquire the state - of - the - art equipment and technology from the US and Europe and also urged the Indian industry to beef up their manufacturing capabilities and capacities .
Asked whether India would be able to offer power to Pakistan as was being talked about in recent India - Pakistan peace parleys , Abdullah said , " Although India is deficient in power and our needs are growing at a rapid pace , sometimes in the interest of building and maintaining good neighbourly relations , such gestures have to be made . "
Arbind Prasad , Director General of FICCI , stated that the challenge before India in the renewable energy sector is to reduce the per -unit cost of renewable energy .
He said that there is a continuous need to innovate , increase efficiencies and bring down costs .
V Saibaba , Chairman , FICCI Solar Energy Task Force and CEO Lanco Solar , mentioned that the interest cost is the major component of renewable energy cost in India today .
In this regard , Saibaba stressed on the need to lower the interest rates in India since these were very high ( 13 per cent ) as compared to 3 per cent in Germany .
Reader Dan Albanese sent us photographs of the anonymous - looking exterior of 175 Water Street .
The building formerly had " American International Group " prominently over the front doors , along with " AIG " etched in the windows and doors .
According to the Post , AIG spokespeople explained that " the company had decided to replace the large AIG sign -- outside the entrance to its property - casualty offices -- as part of its plan to change that operation 's name to AIU Holdings Ltd " — to " distinguish these well - capitalized businesses from AIG . "
Is the subtext , then , that the employees here are not the ones protesters should be harassing ?
AIG is trying to sell two other offices — and apparently a labor union is interested in the 72 Wall Street location !
In an October 23 , 2001 , Office of Legal Counsel memo released today , the Bush Administration concluded that " the Fourth Amendment does not apply to domestic military operations , " including " intercepting electronic or wireless communications " by " employing surveillance methods more powerful and sophisticated than those available to law enforcement agencies . "
See Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States at pp. 4 , 18 , and 25 ( emphasis original ) .
When news of this memo first surfaced in a footnote to another memo , we wondered if it meant that the Administration 's lawyers advised that the National Security Agency ( a component of the military ) could spy on Americans with impunity and face no Fourth Amendment claim .
Turns out that the Bush Administration did think it could spy on Americans in the U.S. without regard to the Constitution .
We had suspected as much , but the confirmation is still chilling .
Our suspicions were raised back in 2006 when the DOJ asserted that " that warrantless communications intelligence targeted at the enemy in time of armed conflict is a traditional and fundamental incident of the use of military force authorized by the AUMF " and that " the NSA activities fit squarely within the sweeping terms of the AUMF .
The use of signals intelligence to identify and pinpoint the enemy is a traditional component of wartime military operations . "
As the DOJ saw it , " In the present conflict , unlike in the Korean War , the battlefield was brought to the United States ... "
Thus , we were deeply concerned that the " domestic military operations " authorized by the OLC memo included domestic surveillance of Americans , without regard to their constitutional rights .
Now we know .
The recently released October 23 , 2001 Memo confirms a disregard for the Constitution that was only hinted at before .
In finding the Bill of Rights over - ridden by the President 's authority to use military force , it also asserts that the " use of force ... might include ... employing surveillance methods more powerful and sophisticated than those available to law enforcement agencies . " ( p. 4 ) and that domestic " [ m ] ilitary action might encompass ... intercepting electronic or wireless communications . " ( p. 18 ) .
The opinion 's sweeping scope was not limited to terrorists , asserting the " Government 's ability to ' search ' and ' seize ' even innocent United States persons , " ( p. 31 , emphasis added ) , and that it was not " necessary that the military forces on our soil be foreign . " ( p. 27 , emphasis original ) .
The October 23 , 2001 Memo did not limit itself to the Fourth Amendment , asserting that the President 's war powers superseded the " takings " clause of the Fifth Amendment ( p. 33 ) , and that " First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage a war successfully . " ( p. 24 ) .
This legal opinion , written by John Yoo and Robert Delahunty , remained in effect until October 6 , 2008 , when the OLC issued a memo recommending that " caution be exercised before relying in any respect on the 10/23/01 memorandum . "
Thus , between October 23 , 2001 , and October 6 , 2008 , resting on legal analysis that they now admit was " doubtful , " the OLC took the unqualified position that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to domestic wiretapping conducted by a military entity , such as the NSA .
Chilling indeed .
Testifying on Capitol Hill , eight Wall Street CEOs offer little contrition .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Banking CEOs offer few apologies
It would seem Wall Street still does n’t get it .
After hours of testimony and grilling before a House panel Wednesday , there were few apologies and little contrition offered by the eight Wall Street CEOs and recipients of taxpayer bailout money .
Advertisement
Only Citigroup CEO
Vikram Pandit offered an unprompted apology , saying the decision to press on with a purchase of a $ 50 million corporate jet after receiving a bailout was wrongheaded .
“ We understand that the old model no longer works , and the old rules no longer apply .
...
We did not adjust quickly enough to this new world , and I take personal responsibility for that mistake .
In the end , I canceled delivery , ” Pandit told members on the House Financial Services Committee .
“ I get the new reality , and I will make sure Citi gets it , as well . ”
Pandit also said he ’ll take a mere $ 1 annual salary until his firm , which has received $ 45 billion from the bailout fund , returns to profitability .
Score one for Citi .
Most of the CEOs , who combined have taken $ 165 billion in taxpayer money , focused instead on touting the lending they are doing and the foreclosures they are preventing .
Several — including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein , JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis — stressed that they only took money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the urging of federal officials .
House Finance Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) seemed willing to give them a pass .
“ I ’m more focused on the future than the past , ” he said in an interview , explaining that he ’s not interested in the “ psychodrama ” of the issue .
But many Americans — and quite a few of their congressional representatives — are not so forgiving .
In the January NBC / Wall Street Journal poll , Wall Street actually ranked below Congress and the national news media in public confidence .
And those kinds of numbers are an invitation for vitriol on Capitol Hill .
“ I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed some of your banks , and they said the same thing :
They ’re sorry , they did n’t mean it , they wo n’t do it again , ” said Rep. Michael E. Capuano ( D - Mass. ) , mocking the CEOs ’ claims that they ’ve done so much good for the economy .
“ Do you understand that it is a little difficult for most of my constituents to take , that you learned your lesson ? ” he asked .
“ None of us — America does n’t trust you anymore , ” Capuano said .
Indeed , it was only in the hearing ’s third hour , at the prodding of lawmakers , that the chief executives offered any broad - based mea culpa for helping get the economy into its current mess — a sentiment their British counterparts offered freely during a similar public appearance .
“ Do you feel that the industry has anything to apologize to the American people for so that we can try to have some reconciliation moving forward ? ” asked Rep. Gregory W. Meeks ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ It ’s a tough question , ” replied Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack .
After that less - than - auspicious start , Mack did say that the industry clearly made mistakes from its use of leverage to making bad loans to the designing of complex instruments .
If Morgan Stanley could go back and do it differently , it would , he said .
“ I ’m especially sorry for what ’s happened to shareholders and ... the American people , ” he said .
“ Clearly , as an industry , we have accountability and a responsibility .
It is much broader than just this group of people , but we all have responsibility , and I will take that responsibility for my firm . ”
Republicans also jumped into the diatribe .
Rep. Leonard Lance ( R - N.J. ) told Lewis that he was “ disturbed ” by the reports that Merrill Lynch secretly accelerated billions worth of bonuses to executives before Bank of America ’s purchase was completed Jan .
1 .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sent Frank a letter Wednesday detailing how Merrill Lynch doled out about $ 3.6 billion in early bonuses at the same time senior executives knew earnings were disastrous .
“ Things got changed .
We ’re in charge now , ” Lewis assured Lance .
Lewis testified earlier that Bank of America discouraged Merrill ’s excessive bonuses but did not have control over them .
The topic of Wednesday ’s hearing was for the CEOs to tell Congress what they ’ve done with the bailout money they ’ve received so far amid reports that lending is still tight .
They testified that they have increased lending — despite heavy criticism from lawmakers that banks are merely sitting on the bailout money .
Goldman Sachs has committed more than $ 13 billion in new financing since receiving $ 10 billion from the government in October , Blankfein said , with some of that going to a mixed - use housing project in New Orleans and major American corporations such as Verizon and Pfizer .
The CEOs also testified that they did n’t use taxpayer dollars to fund bonuses to employees , another source of public ire .
But few were buying that one .
“ Gentlemen , money is fungible .
Do n’t insult our intelligence , ” said Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Calif. ) , arguing that there ’s no difference between directly handing tax dollars out as bonuses and using depositor money for bonuses , then replacing the missing deposits with bailout funds .
“ The issue is , what dividends and bonuses did you pay and will you pay while you ’re holding taxpayer money ?
...
You had extra money , and instead of loaning it to the economy , instead of repaying it to taxpayers , as you should have done , you sent it as dividends , ” he said .
When each CEO was asked if he had instituted policies against paying dividends while holding bailout money , only Citigroup ’s Pandit and Bank of America ’s Lewis raised their hands .
Citigroup agreed to limit its dividend payments to 1 cent as a result of its most recent deal with federal officials for bailout money .
Frank said he was encouraged by Wednesday ’s testimony because the CEOs demonstrated they understand that they need to increase lending , curtail excessive compensation and address foreclosures .
But Wall Street has more work to do to regain the public trust necessary for Congress to take the steps needed to get the financial system working again , he added .
“ Words are n’t going to do it , ” he said .
“ They have to follow through . ”

Advertisement The Czech Republic 's centre - right minority government has lost a vote of no -confidence midway through the country 's six - month EU presidency .
Four rebel MPs voted with the opposition Social Democrats and Communists against PM Mirek Topolanek .
Mr Topolanek said he would step down , but correspondents say it is unclear how long he will remain in the post .
The European Commission said it was confident the Czech Republic could continue its EU role effectively .
Social Democrat leader Jiri Paroubek said ahead of the vote that the government could " complete the Czech EU presidency or its substantial part " .
However , Mr Topolanek has ruled out the idea of a caretaker government until June , when the EU presidency passes to Sweden .
According to the constitution , Czech President Vaclav Klaus must decide who to choose to form a new administration .
If three attempts to do so fail , early elections will be called .
' Surprise result '
Tuesday 's no-confidence vote in the lower house followed accusations that one of Mr Topolanek 's advisers had attempted to pressure the country 's public TV channel into dropping a programme critical of a former Social Democratic MP who had decided to back the coalition .
The government got what it deserved
Jiri Paroubek
Social Democrat leader
It was passed by a majority of one vote after four former members of Mr Topolanek 's minority coalition , who had become independents , sided with the opposition .
Together they garnered 101 votes in the 200 - seat chamber , the minimum required .
" The government got what it deserved , " Mr Paroubek said afterwards .
The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says this surprise result , which threw observers completely off guard , could have far - reaching consequences beyond the country 's borders .
In addition to chairing the European Council , the Czech Republic is also in the middle of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty and is in talks with the United States on placing a radar base on Czech soil .
All these important foreign policy initiatives are now thrown into doubt , our correspondent adds .
After losing the vote , Mr Topolanek said he believed the country 's position in Europe would inevitably be weakened .
" I believe it can complicate our negotiating power ... partners in Europe have grown used to us negotiating hard , " he told reporters .
Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek 's cabinet must resign following the vote However , the European Commission issued a statement expressing confidence that the Czech EU presidency would not be affected .
" The Commission has full trust that the national constitutional law allows for the Czech Republic to continue conducting the Council Presidency as effectively as it has done until now , " it said .

Many , many times in a notes session with an executive I ’ll hear , “ Your character is so unlikable .
He ’s so mean at times .
Why is that ?
What ’s making him act that way ? ”
Studio people love to give a motivation as to why a movie character is an asshole .
I say , leave my asshole alone !
There always has to be a reason why one of your characters acts the way he does .
Even if your character is a villain they still want some sort of backstory about WHY he is so villainous ( I always want to reply to this with , “ Does knowing why Hitler nearly eviscerated an entire race of humans make what he did any better ?
Are you going to be okay with the Holocaust now ? ” ) .
They ca n’t just be mean or act selfish because they are human .
No , there always has to be an event that happened earlier in his life that makes him act that way : * If he ’s greedy , it ’s because he grew up poor and money has become very important to him .
* If he ’s a male chauvinist , it ’s because his first love left him for someone else .
* If he has anger issues , it ’s because he was raped in prison .
The problem is that it just does n’t matter .
There are a lot of d-bags on this big blue marble and not once have I ever wondered what makes them so d-baggy .
They just are .
And even if there was a “ legitimist ” reason for why they are such pricks I still would n’t fucking care .
I ’d still hate them regardless .
Knowing someone ’s motivation for being a fuckhole does n’t make me all of the sudden like them or have sympathy for them – I just want them to stop acting like fuckholes .
Perfect example :
If someone cuts you off in traffic do you think , “ You know , that guy almost killed me but I ’m sure he had a very good explanation for cutting me off . ”
Hell no !
You think , “ Jesus fucking Christ !
If I had a lead pipe I would take it to that guy ’s skullcap right goddamn now ! ”
And you would honk you horn .
And conversely , when you honk your horn the guy who cut you off is n’t thinking , “ Wow , that guy sure is honking loud .
I must have done something wrong . ”
No , that guy is now thinking , “ Fuck you , dick teeth !
I ’ll kill you with a butter knife ! ”
What ’s really interesting is that once you take the note ( and you always do , cause you ’re just a writer ) and give a reason for why a character is so awful , the execs get so excited .
“ Yes ! ” the say , “ Now we know that your character fucked his wife ’s sister and beat up his brother - in - law because he was lonely as a child !
Excellent work ! ”
Which I guess sums up Hollywood pretty well :
It ’s okay to be a douchebag as long as you ’ve got an explanation for it .
The Housing Cost Calculator , updated in June 2007 , compares the cost of owning a home relative to renting for a potential new homeowner .
It reports the " Net Cost of Owning " — the expected amount of additional cash available to a renter compared to the amount available to a homebuyer who buys a home today and sells the home at a specified time in the future .
The calculator takes into account the unprecedented run-up in real home prices since 1997 .

In a comment by Scott Schimmel to the recommended books list from earlier this week , he expresses some disagreement with me regarding my opinions of Neal Stephenson ’s writing .
There seems to be a very common dividing line between two types of Stephenson fans : in one corner are those who like Anathem and do n’t have any problem with the way Stephenson went about building an alternate world , complete with new vocabulary , and many of whom list the Baroque Cycle ( which I have yet to read ) among their favorite Stephenson books ; in the other corner are those who take issue specifically with the passel of “ made - up words ” in Anathem , tend to find the whole book kind of pretentious and overwrought , and almost universally think Snow Crash is his best book .
Another correlated difference , it seems to me , is that the fans who dislike the “ made - up words ” in Anathem seem to like Neal Stephenson ’s books in direct proportion to how closely they adhere to the superficial trappings common to the mainstream of what we call speculative fiction , with a near - future science fiction bent that offers significant focus on the new technologies that do not yet exist .
As Stephenson strays from that , their opinion of his writing seems to drop , though I would not be comfortable suggesting that this correlation implies any causation at this point .
By contrast , the bunch of people that do n’t seem to have any problem with Stephenson ’s presentation of the story in Anathem seem to like his books the further they get from anything like mainstream science fiction .
This means that , while they tend to really like Anathem , it does n’t tend to be their favorite Stephenson book , as most of them seem to favor the Baroque Cycle , which seems to offer the same dichotomous focus on both present fiction and historical fiction events intertwined to provide a single , overarching story of two plots , judging by the descriptions of the trilogy that I ’ve read .
My own favorite Stephenson novel , Cryptonomicon , was the first of his writings to take that approach , and I look forward to reading the Baroque Cycle in the relatively near future .
All of his novels ( unless there are some I ’m forgetting or of which I ’m not aware ) are , in some respect , science fiction .
So far as I ’m aware , they all use ( speculative ) science and engineering as major plot points , almost as characters unto themselves in some respects , even if the science they use is by now obsolete by at least several decades in some cases .
The obsolete stuff , though , is definitely not science fiction in the traditional , superficial sense , though , where the focus is on speculative science and engineering of the future .
Another correlative trend , though one that does n’t translate into as strictly accurate a rule of thumb , is that Stephenson ’s earlier novels are more traditional science fiction fare , while his later novels stray further from that .
I say it ’s not as strictly accurate a rule of thumb because one could argue that Diamond Age is more science - fictiony than Snow Crash , and that Anathem is more science - fictiony than the Baroque Cycle ( based on what I know of it ) or Cryptonomicon .
I think this is a bit too narrowly focused on the most superficial trappings , though , as the actual role of the speculative science and technology in each novel he has written appears to be less traditional for the genre than the last .
Understand that I ’m basically lumping the Baroque Cycle together with Cryptonomicon , here , since I have n’t actually read it but it seems to be roughly equivalent in terms of what I ’m talking about here , judging by what I ’ve heard about it .
I find myself wondering what the causal relationships are here .
Is there some factor I ’ve mentioned that serves as the source of the other factors , at least roughly speaking ?
Is there some factor I have n’t mentioned , that may not have occurred to me at all , that ties this all together ?
Are there actually many causal factors , such that what looks like a small number of correlated trends is actually an accidental confluence of a great many unrelated trends ?
What would Neal Stephenson have to say about all this ?
Would this be a good subject for a statistical study , perhaps as thesis work for a psychology Master ’s degree ?
I had the pleasure of attending a Neal Stephenson reading and signing not too long ago .
It was , of course , part of a tour to promote the freshly published Anathem , and it was where I got my autographed copy of the book .
If I had thought of this before then , I would have asked him what he thought , myself .
Alas , almost nobody had read the book by that point , and these trends had not yet surfaced in a recognizable form ( since they really required Anathem to achieve that form , and enough time for people to express their opinions of it ) .
The question simply did n’t exist yet .
Instead , I ended up asking him about whether he intended to write anything like In the Beginning was the Command Line ever again .
The answer appears to be “ probably not ” , and that is apparently a very common question at his readings / signings .
By the way , I note that Anathem has been nominated for a Hugo award , and of the three books I ’ve read that were nominated in the Best Novel category this year , I think Anathem most deserves to win .
I quite liked the other two , though .
Of them , only Gaiman ’s The Graveyard Book is n’t in the aforementioned recommended book list as of this writing , and I ’m still trying to decide whether to include it in that list .
I want to read the Stross book that is also nominated , but I have some other Stross higher up my list of to - read books .
I do n’t know anything about Zoe ’s Tale yet , and in fact have n’t read anything by Scalzi at all at this point .

Freeman Withdraws From Intel Position
Updated 6:36 p.m .
By Walter Pincus
Charles W. Freeman Jr. withdrew yesterday from his appointment as chairman of the National Intelligence Council after questions about his impartiality were raised among members of Congress and with White House officials .
Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair said he accepted Freeman 's decision " with great regret . "
The withdrawal came hours after Blair had given a spirited defense on Capitol Hill of the outspoken former ambassador .
The National Intelligence Council oversees production of national intelligence estimates and shorter assessments on specific issues , tapping experts from among the 16 intelligence agencies .
The chairman 's position does not require Senate confirmation .
Freeman had come under fire for statements he had made about Israeli policies and for his past connections to Saudi and Chinese interests .
One of the first congressmen to raise questions about Freeman , Rep. Steven Israel ( D - N.Y. ) , said yesterday that he spoke of his concerns last week to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and later sent him materials about the former ambassador 's statements and associations .
Israel , a member of the House Appropriations Committee 's Select Intelligence Oversight Panel , said in a phone interview , " As I was leaving the White House this afternoon , they told me of Blair 's statement " of Freeman 's withdrawal .
" I think Blair 's defense of Freeman was indefensible , and people in the White House realized that . "
The congressman said Freeman 's withdrawal " preserved the impartiality of U.S. intelligence , " and he expected Blair would move on and " will find someone who is unimpeachable of intelligence matters . "
Freeman had been ambassador to Saudi Arabia and deputy chief of mission in China .
Since 1997 , he has presided over the Middle East Policy Council , a Washington - based nonprofit organization that is funded in part by Saudi money .
In that role , Freeman has occasionally criticized the Israeli government 's positions and U.S. support for those policies .
In 2007 , for example , he said , " The brutal oppression of the Palestinians by the Israeli occupation shows no sign of ending , " adding , " American identification with Israel has become total . "
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) questioned Blair about the appointment yesterday when the intelligence chief came before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Lieberman cited Freeman 's past relationships and statements which , the senator said , " appear either inclined to lean against Israel or too much in favor of China . "
Blair forcefully defended Freeman , saying the intelligence community needs people with strong views because out of that come the best ideas .
But , he added , the job of the intelligence community is not to make policy but to inform it with ideas and that Freeman , " with his long experience , his inventive mind will add to those strongly . "
Blair said Freeman 's statements had been taken out of context , and he urged members " to look at the full context of what he was saying . "
Lieberman countered that he feared that Freeman might not be able " to separate his policy views from the analysis , " adding , " whether I disagree or agree with them , he 's very opinionated . "
Blair responded that he could do a better job as DNI " if I 'm getting strong analytical viewpoints to sort out and pass on to you and to the president than if I am getting pre-cooked , pablum judgments that do n't really challenge . "
Sen. James Webb ( D - Va. ) later praised the way Blair defended Freeman , saying the danger of centralized intelligence was the lack of divergent opinion , as was seen in the run-up to the Iraq war .
Since 1997 , Freeman has presided over the Middle East Policy Council , a Washington - based nonprofit organization that is funded in part by Saudi money .
In that role , Freeman has occasionally criticized the Israeli government 's positions and U.S. support for those policies .
In 2007 , for example , he said , " The brutal oppression of the Palestinians by the Israeli occupation shows no sign of ending , " adding , " American identification with Israel has become total . "
Freeman has also been faulted for statements about the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989 .
Critics have said complained that he faulted the Chinese for not acting earlier in putting down the demonstrations , but Freeman said the remarks were actually his assessment of how Chinese leaders had seen things .
Sen. Christopher S. Bond ( Mo. ) , the intelligence committee 's vice chairman , and the six other Republicans on the panel wrote Blair yesterday to raise " concerns about Mr. Freeman 's lack of experience and uncertainty about his objectivity . "
His appointment , they said , would result in " even more oversight scrutiny to the activities of the NIC under his leadership . "
The White House had been largely mum on Freeman 's appointment .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked last week about the objections , but he ducked the question .
Opposition to Freeman 's appointment has been led by several pro-Israel groups and advocates in the United States , joined by some members of Congress .
Last week , nine House Republicans , including Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( Ohio ) , Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( Va. ) and two intelligence committee members , joined Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley ( Nev. ) in asking DNI Inspector General Edward Maguire for a comprehensive review of Freeman 's past and current financial , commercial and contractual ties to the Saudi government .
Rep. Steve Israel ( D - N.Y. ) , a member of the House intelligence committee , wrote a similar letter to Maguire .

YouTube has exterminated all legally uploaded music videos viewable to British users .
The move , which revolves around licensing disagreements , has sparked a public relations war with the music industry and fans .
As of late last night , all music videos uploaded legitimately by record labels will be unavailable .
The site has fallen out with the Performing Rights Society ( PRS ) , which administers and collects royalties for the music industry in the country .
PRS Outraged by Decision
The two sides both blame the other for the failure to renegotiate a new licensing deal after the previous one expired .
YouTube says " PRS is now asking us to pay many , many times more for our license than before , " and " we would lose significant amounts of money with every playback . "
The site also complains that the Performing Rights Society wo n't provide a full list of the music which would be covered by a license .
( Source : youtube.com )
However , PRS disputes the claims , saying YouTube " wish to pay significantly less than at present to the writers of the music on which their service relies , despite the massive increase in YouTube viewing . "
PRS has been quick to point out that it did not ask YouTube to pull the videos and says it is " outraged " at the decision .
( Source : prsformusic.com )
It 's not yet clear which side is telling the truth about the royalty demands , or if the disparity is caused by different interpretations of the deal -- for example , the balance between flat fees and pay - per - view royalties .
Move A Boost For Unlicensed Clips
In reality , most users wo n't see any difference , since a majority of the videos affected are also available through unauthorized uploads .
The problem there is that the music industry does n't receive any royalties , and if those clips start getting more viewers there 'll be even more anger from record labels accusing YouTube of failing to crack down on such uploads .
The blocking of the videos comes seven months after Internet radio station Pandora had to close its website in the UK after failing to reach a renewal deal with the Performing Rights Society .
However , the future for online music in the UK had looked brighter after the country became the first to get complete access to Spotify , an ad - funded site which offers millions of streaming tracks for free .

Little did the world realize 40 years ago that a San Francisco stage was featuring the first public glimpse of an invention that would revolutionize not only our daily lives but also our ability to solve the world 's problems .
An audience of about 1,000 people had witnessed the premiere of the personal computer .
The Dec. 9 , 1968 , unveiling of the primitive device with a mouse and interactive screen - in a now - legendary demonstration by its inventor , Douglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute - drew a rousing , standing ovation from the computing cognoscenti who recognized the significance of what they had just seen .
The machine raised hopes of solving a major modern quandary - how to navigate the world 's rapidly accumulating and increasingly complex store of information .
That year 's fledgling efforts to navigate the physical universe in spaceships seemed ponderous and slow compared to the prospect of speeding through the universe of information in the digital ships promised by the new computers .
The invention featured rudimentary windows and hyperlinks that allowed jumping from one document to another , as well as the ability to edit text and add graphics on a video monitor .
The presentation also offered a peek at future computer networks that would become the Internet .
" No one has ever before or since seen such a collection of great ideas in one demonstration , " said SRI President and CEO Curt Carlson .
The event - dubbed " the mother of all demos " by chroniclers of the computer industry and Silicon Valley - is being commemorated on its 40th anniversary Tuesday at Stanford University in an afternoon program titled " Engelbart and the Dawn of Interactive Computing : SRI 's Revolutionary 1968 Demo . "
The event includes Engelbart and some of the other pioneers who worked with him .
The 1968 demonstration was years before anyone dreamed of Microsoft or Apple .
" Bill Gates was 12 at the time ; Steve Jobs was 13 , " writes John Naughton in his book " A Brief History of the Future . "
Though Engelbart may have not achieved the fame of a Gates or Jobs , his profound influence is widely acknowledged in the field .
Engelbart is " the Moses of computers , " writes Steven Levy in his history of the Macintosh .
His 1968 demonstration at the Fall Joint Computer Conference held in the convention center at Civic Center - featuring Engelbart in tie and short - sleeved shirt at his computer terminal in front of a large video screen - may seem tame and quaint to today 's audiences accustomed to high - tech special effects .
But at the time , when computers were glorified calculators as big as cars and operating on punch cards , it was " just mind - blowing , " recalled Bob Taylor of Woodside , who helped guide the computer industry 's evolution and who , having seen the value of what Engelbart and his team wanted to do , provided much of the needed funding in his role as a program manager first at NASA and then at the Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Project 's Agency .
" For many who witnessed it , " writes John Markoff in his book " What the Dormouse Said , " about the development of the personal computer , " it was more than a bolt out of the blue :
It was a religious experience . "
" The standing ovation surprised all of us , " recalled Bill English of Novato , the SRI engineer who orchestrated the event , which featured Engelbart not only operating the computer but also engaging in shared - screen teleconferencing with colleagues back at SRI headquarters in Menlo Park .
( Playing a supporting role behind the camera in Menlo Park was counterculture hero Stewart Brand , founder of the Whole Earth Catalog . )
English is known also as the person who built the first mouse in 1964 .
It consisted of a small pine box equipped with a red clicker button on top and two wheels placed at right angles underneath that regulated the electric current that moved the cursor , then called the " bug . "
No one is sure who on the small team coined the term " mouse " for the little box with a wire coming out , English said .
But the name stuck once it was introduced .
" A small box with a tail coming out - you might as well call it a mouse , " said English , who figured out how to construct the device based on a sketch that Engelbart had drawn in 1961 .
The mouse was n't the automatic choice .
It won out only after other approaches - a light pen , a joystick , even a knee - operated control - proved to be far less efficient , English said .
Many retrospective looks at the 1968 demonstration have highlighted the introduction of the mouse , which Engelbart patented under the name " X - Y Position Indicator for a Display System . "
But Engelbart resisted being known as the man who invented the mouse , said Taylor .
" He was focused not on computing technology per se , " Taylor said .
" He was focused on how to better deal with information - how to better arrange it , how to be able to sift through it , how to be able to communicate it to other people .
He was not a gadget guy . "
It was Engelbart 's animating vision of seeking vastly improved access to the rapidly expanding store of human knowledge and information that appealed to Taylor , who , like others in the field at that time , were influenced by thinkers like J.C.R.
Licklider , author of such influential papers as " Man-Computer Symbiosis , " published in 1960 .
Engelbart 's success was built also on his ability to inspire his co-workers , Carlson said .
" Not only did he have a vision , but he had a way of going about it that made his team work around the clock , " Carlson said .
" They really bought into this idea of helping to solve the world 's biggest and most important problems . "

It parses time strings , so you can tell it to schedule something to occur " every 10m10s " ( 10 minutes 10 seconds ) or to occur at " Sun Oct 07 14:24:01 +0900 2009 " or you can supply it with a cron-style string .
The scheduler does n't do any server - side voodoo to get jobs to run , but relies on its scheduler being run up and maintained persistently ( or semi- persistently , as with Rails app processes that will tip the scheduler into action ) .
As an aside , Intridea are running an Introduction to Ruby on Rails course between February 27 and March 1 , 2009 ( yes , in 11 days ! ) in Washington DC .
So if you want to go and learn Rails from two ultra qualified Rails guys ( Adam Bair and Joe Grossberg ) go check it out .

By Hugo Salinas Price Several years ago � I do n't remember the date �
I read an interesting comment : � The great boom that the world is enjoying , is in effect an enormous shorting of cash and going long on debt .
Eventually , there will be a short squeeze on cash which will have to be covered by going long on cash and shorting debt . �
This appears to be a succinct description of events we are now seeing .
A tenet of the Austrian School of Economics holds that all human action involves choosing .
I am indebted to Professor Antal E. Fekete for the insight that choice involves going long what we choose and giving up � shorting � what we give in exchange .
The US consumer has been shorting cash for decades .
The very low , sometimes negative savings rate has shown that Americans have not wanted to accumulate cash .
Americans did not want to go long on cash , they wanted to short it .
They went long on houses to live in , houses to speculate with , boats to have fun with , new cars , extra cars , ocean cruises .
They also went long on stocks � now selling for 50 % of their value in October 2007 .
US businesses went in for � Cash Management � � which was supposed to minimize cash balances � short cash � and go long on purchasing short - term or overnight debt from banks to meet coming maturities .
Holding plain cash or checking account balances was old fashioned .
Worse , businesses also wanted to expand at all costs .
Extend more credit � short your merchandise and go long on accounts receivable � in order to increase sales .
Car manufacturers had their own financial arm , to enable them to short their own excess production of autos , and to go long on debts due from customers up to six , seven year 's out .
The long position in debt held by US banks is enormous .
The debt ( bank assets ) whose market value is known is classified as � Tier 1 � .
The debt whose market value can be assumed by comparison with the market value of similar debt is classified as � Tier 2 � .
The debt whose value is strictly an assumption on the part of the bank is classified as � Tier 3 � .
Then there are the highly dubious assets that some of the big banks are allowed to keep off their balance sheets , as �it would not be practical� to put them on the Balance Sheet , where accountants know they belong .
The banking system of the US went hog wild shorting cash , throwing it around the world in exchange for anything with a signature on it : shorting cash and going long on trash debt instruments .
The squeeze on those who shorted cash is now tremendous .
The figures on outlandish leverage in US banks and the figures on household debt illustrate the situation .
The Fed and the ECB are trying to meet and overcome the short squeeze by providing enormous amounts of money , available at the banks , in an effort to provide funds to those who are trying to cover their shorts on cash by going long � obtaining cash � to cover their long positions on debts owed .
The enormous increases in cash available at the banks are insignificant in comparison with the prevailing enormous shorts on cash and long positions in debt .
The squeeze is implacable .
In effect , everyone on God 's green earth is trying to obtain cash - going long on cash - in order to cover their long positions on debt .
� If consumers and businesses refuse to spend and instead pay back debts � �
This is saying in effect , �consumers and businesses are now attempting to go long cash and cover their long positions on ( i.e. , short ) debt� .
High time they did so .
News today is that US businesses face $ 200 billion in debt coming due in the next three years .
They are going to be terribly squeezed for cash .
Maybe lots of businesses will simply declare bankruptcy .
� Cash is being hoarded by banks and consumers alike� means � Banks are going long cash and shorting debt ( trying to reduce their leverage ) and consumers are saving cash ( going long on cash ) and shorting spending .�
Deflation and Depression are actually a manifestation of a massive short squeeze on cash in an attempt to reduce a gross and unsustainable long position on debt .
The Deflation and Depression will continue until the long position on debt is reduced .
The long position on debt in the world is so massive , that it will only be reduced by equally massive defaults .
Only until these defaults reduce the long position to a tolerable figure will the squeeze on cash terminate .
At that point , banks and consumers will once again be willing to short cash and go long on debt : the banks will once again be willing to lend and consumers will be once again willing and able to take on debt and spend , or reduce their rate of saving and become buyers once more .
Delaying the inevitable will only drag out the agony of Deflation and Depression for many years .
Bringing all the massive liabilities of the banking system onto the Treasury 's indebtedness � while the corresponding assets are worth far , far less than these liabilities � will solve nothing .
Debt must be reduced by defaults and bankruptcies .
There is no other solution !
The driving force behind the rise in the price of gold at this time is not the fear of inflation but rather the fear of placing cash where there is a possibility of default .
Only physical gold in possession is free of this risk .
I may add that even national treasuries do default on their bond obligations ( Nouriel Roubini just confirmed this ) and can and do default partially by devaluing their currencies .
The world is gradually realizing this and this is propelling investors into gold .
Could it be there is Method in the government 's Madness ?
Perhaps the unspoken idea is to save some critical institutions by bailouts at all costs and then � the Treasury defaults later on this year ?

CloserLookAtCharacters
Characters are not their codes -- Encodings and external format in Common Lisp
By default , Lisp files are text files .
A text file is a file containing characters .
That is , things like aleph , three , e with acute accent , exclamation point , etc .
Lisp objects are typed , so there 's no problem in Lisp with manipulating character objects .
But in a Unix ( POSIX ) file we can only store numbers between 0 and 255 .
Unix ( POSIX ) has no notion of text file .
So we need to encode the characters into a coded byte stream .
There are several different coding systems for characters .
The first step in defining a coding system is to specify the set of characters we want to encode .
The second step is to define a bijective mapping between this set of characters and a subset of integer numbers .
A third step may be to define a way to encode integer numbers bigger than 255 as a sequence of integer numbers between 0 and 255 .
Optionally , you may define in an additional step some meaning for additional codes that are not used so far , for purposes such as controlling output device or structuring files ( defining records , blocks , etc ) .
For example , ASCII defines the following set of characters :
SPC ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
ASCII defines the following mapping between characters and numbers :
32 SPC 33 ! 34 " 35 # 36 $ 37 % 38 & 39 ' 40 ( 41 ) 42 * 43 + 44 , 45 - 46 .
47 / 48 0 49 1 50 2 51 3 52 4 53 5 54 6 55 7 56 8 57 9 58 : 59 ; 60 < 61 = 62 > 63 ? 64 @ 65 A 66 B 67 C 68 D 69 E 70 F 71 G 72 H 73 I 74 J 75 K 76 L 77 M 78 N 79 O 80 P 81 Q 82 R 83 S 84 T 85 U 86 V 87 W 88 X 89 Y 90 Z 91 [ 92 \ 93 ] 94 ^ 95 _ 96 ` 97 a 98 b 99 c 100 d 101 e 102 f 103 g 104 h 105 i 106 j 107 k 108 l 109 m 110 n 111 o 112 p 113 q 114 r 115 s 116 t 117 u 118 v 119 w 120 x 121 y 122 z 123 { 124 | 125 } 126 ~
Since all numbers are between 0 and 255 , no further processing is necessary to get a unique byte sequence for each character .
Finally , since there are unused numbers , ASCII defines some control codes :
0 NUL 1 SOH 2 STX 3 ETX 4 EOT 5 ENQ 6 ACK 7 BEL 8 BS 9 TAB 10 LF 11 VT 12 FF 13 CR 14 SO 15 SI 16 DLE 17 DC1 18 DC2 19 DC3 20 DC4 21 NAK 22 SYN 23 ETB 24 CAN 25 EM 26 SUB 27 ESC 28 FS 29 GS 30 RS 31 US 32 SPC 33 !
34 " 35 # 36 $ 37 % 38 & 39 ' 40 ( 41 ) 42 * 43 + 44 , 45 - 46 .
47 / 48 0 49 1 50 2 51 3 52 4 53 5 54 6 55 7 56 8 57 9 58 : 59 ; 60 < 61 = 62 > 63 ? 64 @ 65 A 66 B 67 C 68 D 69 E 70 F 71 G 72 H 73 I 74 J 75 K 76 L 77 M 78 N 79 O 80 P 81 Q 82 R 83 S 84 T 85 U 86 V 87 W 88 X 89 Y 90 Z 91 [ 92 \ 93 ] 94 ^ 95 _ 96 ` 97 a 98 b 99 c 100 d 101 e 102 f 103 g 104 h 105 i 106 j 107 k 108 l 109 m 110 n 111 o 112 p 113 q 114 r 115 s 116 t 117 u 118 v 119 w 120 x 121 y 122 z 123 { 124 | 125 } 126 ~ 127 DEL
Note however that ASCII does n't define anything for byte values between 128 and 255 .
Some coding systems such as ISO - 8859 - 1 or the various Unicode coding systems are defined as extensions of ASCII ( but a few ( old ) are totally different , and a few are modifications of ASCII ) .
The various ISO - 8859 coding systems add additional characters to the ASCII character set , and map them to codes between 160 and 255 .
Additional control codes are defined for codes between 128 and 159 .
Unicode defines a much bigger character set and maps it to integers between 0 and 1114111 .
Then several ways to map these integers to sequences of bytes are defined , such as UTF - 7 , UTF - 8 , UTF - 16LE , UTF - 16BE , etc .
One interesting property of UTF - 8 is ASCII compatibility , i.e. in both systems , characters which belong to the ASCII set are encoded with the same byte sequence .
But this may be misleading when you try to read UTF - 8 files using the ASCII encoding : it may work most of the time , but will fail as soon as you encounter a character which is not in the ASCII set .
Now given that the Common Lisp Standard Character
Set is exactly the ASCII character set ( how lucky ! ) , and that ASCII is used by Unix ( POSIX ) , it is quite possible that the default EXTERNAL - FORMAT used to read and write text files in Lisp is ASCII .
If the file contains a byte between 128 and 255 , there 's no corresponding character in the ASCII set , so it will raise an error .
If you try to write a character outside of the ASCII set , then there will be no way to encode it and it will raise an error .
If you try to read a byte between 0 and 31 ( excluding 13 or 10 , one or both of which may control the line termination ) , it may very well raise an error .
Some implementations may use other encodings and external - formats by default or by configuration , and may map control codes to pseudo - characters in order to avoid raising errors .
But this is implementation specific behavior .
Some implementations extend the ISO - 8859 - 1 coding system to map the control codes to pseudo - characters so there 's a 1 - 1 correspondence between [ 0,255 ] and these characters .
Using this external - format on these implementations , you may be able to " safely " copy binary files .
But this is only valid for some very specific implementations in very specific circumstances .
In conclusion , if you want to copy a file of bytes , you should use :ELEMENT -TYPE '( UNSIGNED - BYTE 8 ) ( assuming it does what you want on your implementation / OS ) .
If you want to copy a text file with a specific encoding , you must give the implementation specific : EXTERNAL-FORMAT .
What you 've programmed is only guaranteed to work on " well formed " " text " files , i.e. text files produced by the same Lisp implementation on the same system .
What about unix file names ?
Unix systems do n't use characters to name files .
They use sequences of bytes , not containing 0 or 47 .
46 and the sequence ( 46 46 ) are reserved for the name of the current directory and the parent directory , respectively .
On 2007-01-29 19:45 , on irc://irc.freenode.org/#scheme , " Riastradh " wrote the following about unix pathnames , bytes and characters :
" Please , let 's [ be pedantic ] , because this is too important an issue to handle lightly and screw up .
On Unix , a pathname is an array of bytes , where a byte is usually an octet .
( It could be a septet , theoretically , but I do n't think there are any modern Unix systems where this is the case . )
[ Or a ninet . ]
The byte # x2 F has special meaning in the pathname .
Note that this is the interpretation of the actual bits involved ; it is not the character `/ ' that means anything to Unix , but the byte # x2 F .
Here , by ` the character `` / '' ' , I mean the symbol that you are shown when an ASCII text renderer displays the byte # x2 F , and the graphical and semantic implications thereof .
( In Unicode , `character ' is * not* a well - defined term ; its definition is explicitly avoided because there are so many different possible concepts competing for the name , so none was given it .
There are abstract characters , encoded characters , code points , scalar values , glyphs , default grapheme clusters , and more ; this is why I explain what I mean by ` the character `` / '' '. )
( Also , by `byte ' I mean the smallest addressible unit of memory -- i.e. what C very misleadingly calls `char ' -- , and by `octet ' I mean an array of eight bits . )
Now , on Unix , the various system calls and library routines that work with pathnames represent them as arrays of bytes , because that is what a pathname is on Unix .
They do n't know anything about text codecs , internationalization , user localization , and so on ; they deal with arrays of bytes .
When writing programs that work with pathnames and perhaps present them to users , however , we usually want two sorts of higher - level abstraction : one , a structure identifiable to the programming language , partly for convenience , partly for clarity , and partly for the sake of portability ; and decoding and encoding pathnames for users .
The user has some notion of `text ' , which must be stored physically on the file system somehow ; the file system knows about bytes , which must be presented to the user in an understandable format somehow .
To accomodate this , Unix has a number of environment variables ( which are , incidentally , also named by byte arrays ) by which the user can identify preferences in the means of translation between machine and human understanding .
For example , the user might often deal with Hebrew and not much else , and may choose to use ISO - 8859 - 7 to store pathnames .
Or another user might be uninterested in Western isolationism , and instead prefer culturally insulting approximation of Eastern languages by choosing to store pathnames in UTF - 8 , allowing the full range of Unicode text in his pathnames .
The operating system cares nothing about the user 's sociocultural background , however , and deals only in bytes .
These two users may need to communicate at some point , and they would like their programs to present pathnames without loss of information .
But on the other hand , they probably also want a consistent file system without two distinct file names ( that is , byte arrays ) for what they each see as the same thing -- a particular name composed of Hebrew and Latin text , say .
( Unfortunately , there * must * be some information lost in the translation from Unicode to ISO - 8859 - 7 , but never mind that for now . )
( By the way , I apologize if I have offended anyone by my choice of cultural derogation -- my intent was to poke fun at everyone equally . )
When writing portable programs that deal with pathnames , furthermore , we often want two different sorts of pathnames : those handed to us by the operating system or otherwise tied to the byte array model , and those that we wrote ourselves or read from user input with a higher - level notion of what text the user intends .
Now , it is not entirely clear what choices are best for the mapping between the two sorts of pathnames I described -- `text pathnames ' and `byte pathnames ' , say .
In Scheme48 1.5 , the decision is made for the programmer : whenever he constructs a pathname ( or `os - string ' ) from a byte vector , its textual interpretation is fixed by the locale when the Scheme48 image was started ; whenever he constructs a pathname ( or `os - string ' ) from a textual description , its encoding in bytes is fixed by the locale at the time the Scheme48 image was started . "
Implementation Specific Support for Encodings
ACL
ACL has extensive support for different text coding systems .
For details see International Character Support in Allegro CL .
CLISP
CLISP is usually compiled with libiconv and Unicode support .
It supports all the coding systems provided by libiconv , exported as variables from the CHARSET package .
The EXTERNAL - FORMAT arguments can take a EXT : ENCODING object which is composed of the character set ( as exported from CHARSET ) and a line terminator mode , which indicate which control codes are used to encode a # \NEW - LINE pseudo - character .
There are command - line arguments and variables in the CUSTOM package to set various default encodings ( pathnames , file contents , terminal , foreign function calls , miscellaneous ) .
Two functions are provided to encode and decode between strings of characters and vector of bytes : EXT : CONVERT -STRING -FROM-BYTES and EXT : CONVERT -STRING-TO -BYTES .
See the CLISP implementation notes , 30.5 .
Encodings .
CMUCL
CMUCL apparently supports utf - 8 I/ O through its simple - streams implementation , as well as iso - 8859 - 1 ; its regular file streams support only iso - 8859 - 1 .
CMUCL release 20a supports Unicode strings , many more external formats on all streams , and mapping between Unicode pathnames and OS byte - sequences .
The following external formats are recognized :
: ASCII :CP1250 :CP1251 :CP1252 :CP1253 :CP1254 :CP1255 :CP1256 :CP1257 :CP1258 :ISO8859-1 : ISO8859-10 : ISO8859-13 : ISO8859 -14 : ISO8859-15 : ISO8859-2 : ISO8859-3 : ISO8859 -4 : ISO8859-5 : ISO8859-6 : ISO8859-7 : ISO8859-8 :ISO8859-9 : KOI8 -R :MAC-CYRILLIC :MAC -GREEK :MAC-ICELANDIC
:MAC -LATIN2 :MAC -ROMAN :MAC -TURKISH :UTF -16-BE :UTF -16-LE :UTF -16 :UTF -32-BE :UTF -32-LE :UTF -32 :UTF -8
: LATIN -1
: ISO8859 -1
along with various aliases ( is an alias for ) .
There are also composing external formats ( external formats that must be combined with an external format ) :
: BETA-GK :FINAL -SIGMA :CR :CRLF
'( : utf - 8 : crlf )
Thus , an external format ofmeans that UTF - 8 is the main encoding but CR / LF characters will be converted on input to a linefeed and on output a linefeed becomes a CR / LF sequence .
See the Internationalization chapter from the CMU User 's Manual .
OpenMCL
OpenMCL has no support for different text coding systems .
SBCL
SBCL supports a limited number of coding systems .
Because the interface has not been finalized yet , they are undocumented , but as of the 0.9.15 release the following are recognized :
(: ASCII :CP1250 : CP1251 : CP1252 :CP1253 :CP1254 :CP1255 :CP1256 :CP1257 :CP1258 :CP437 :CP850 :CP852 : CP855 : CP857 : CP860 : CP861 : CP862 : CP863 :CP864 :CP865 :CP866 :CP869 : CP874 :EBCDIC-US :EUC-JP :ISO -8859-1 :ISO -8859-10 :ISO -8859-11 :ISO -8859-13 :ISO -8859-14 :ISO -8859-15 :ISO - 8859-2 :ISO - 8859-3 :ISO - 8859-4 :ISO - 8859-5 :ISO - 8859-6 :ISO - 8859-7 :ISO - 8859-8 :ISO - 8859-9 : KOI8 - R :KOI8 - U :UCS -2BE :UCS -2LE :UTF - 8 :X- MAC-CYRILLIC )
: LATIN-9
: ISO - 8859-15
along with various aliases ( so for instanceis an alias for ) .
At present , there is no support for automatic translation of line - ending or byte - order - mark conventions .
Additionally , for in - memory conversion , SBCL provides the following functions
SB -EXT : STRING -TO -OCTETS
string &key external - format --> octets SB - EXT : OCTETS -TO -STRING
octets &key external - format --> string string -- a string .
octets -- a vector of ( unsigned - byte 8 ) .
external - format -- a keyword designating an external format ( see above )
Until the interface with external formats is settled and documented ( which essentially means figuring out how to handle newlines , byte - order - marks and similar ) , ( apropos " EXTERNAL-FORMAT " ) is likely to be a good way to find out what is supported .
Other implementations
Please add links and indications about support of encodings in other implementations .
Working with character encodings in a semi-portable way
The Flexi - streams library can read and write character data in various single - or multi-octet encodings which can be changed on the fly .
Flexi-streams supports UTF - 8 , UTF - 16 , UTF - 32 , all ISO 8859 character sets , a couple of Windows code pages and US - ASCII .
External links
Wikipedia has more information about the various coding systems :
Markus Kuhn 's UTF - 8 and Unicode FAQ is another very comprehensive resource .
Nolan Eakins also has an article describing how to use Unicode with Slime , Clisp , and SBCL .
The article 's example is defining a function with a Unicode name .
Comments from Jack Unrue : I suggest changing the " if you want to copy a file " paragraph , such that the recommedation is for verbatim file copy operations to treat every file as if it were binary , to avoid accidental changes to end - line formats in addition to character encodings .
And use the word " process " instead of " copy " in the second sentence of that paragraph .
Also , it might be worth mentioning that text files may have a byte order mark if they are encoded in one of the Unicode encodings .

Cannabis Culture Magazine Publisher and Editor Marc Emery says a public forum on gang violence held in Surrey , BC would have been completely devoid of ‘ reason or rational words ’ if not for a small group of anti-prohibition activists holding signs and handing out pamphlets .
Two young men , one a BC Green Party candidate in the May 12 BC election , put on a public forum in a plaza outside of Surrey Central Skytrain , in Surrey BC .
It was designed to give the community an opportunity to express their indignation and frustration with the accelerating gang violence in the lower mainland .
I was there with 4 very sharp machine made signs that said :
“ How Do We Stop the Violence ?
End Drug Prohibition ”
“ Prohibition Funds Organized Crime .
End Drug Prohibition ”
“ Stop The Gangs ! Repeal Prohibition ”
“ Politicians who support Prohibition are Supporting Organized Crime ”
and 2,000 pamphlets titled “ How Do We End Gang Violence ? “ .
You can download copies of the pamphlet from the BC Marijuana Party Website .
The two sides of the pamphlet are printer ready in the article at the top of the page .
I was the first person there , arriving 45 minutes early , so I was able to give a pamphlet out to every single attendee of the event which started at 1 pm .
I had three volunteers who held aloft the very effective signs , the only signs there except for two nutbars that had signs saying “ The Judges Are To Blame ” .
Their solution was to execute all gang members and judges too .
250 people attended and all received my brochure .
It was the only brochure actually offered at the entire event so it was widely read and many endorsed the contents , although about 20 % were opposed and advocated executions and other lunatic emotional responses .
There were over 25 policemen in attendance , mostly RCMP officers .
Corporal Thiessen of RCMP media relations was doing interviews with the many electronic media .
The event drew only a small crowd despite the good weather ( it looked like rain but did n’t ) and huge media promotion .
Every speaker invited was part of the political establishment that is responsible for the prohibition that allows gang violence to flourish , from Mike Farnsworth ( NDP ) , Diane Watts ( Mayor of Surrey ) , and several other Members of Parliament and MLA ’s from the Liberals , NDP , and Conservative Parties .
All emphasized the demand for more of the same poison we ’ve been getting for years ; more cops , more surveillance , more laws , more arrests , longer sentences .
This is the same mantra these politicians advocate year after year and the gang violence is clearly the result of their prohibitionist policies .
Yet not one politician accepted ANY responsibility for this carnage that clearly is a result of their dangerous and wrong policies of prohibition .
Not one single word was ever said in the one hour about prohibition or ending prohibition , not a one .
Not even from the BC Green Party leader , although the BC Green policy on Substance Use , written by Victoria City Councilor and BC Green Philippe Lucas , is a beautiful , progressive document that managed to go completely unremarked upon by the BC Green leader at this event about … prohibition and substance use .
It was appalling in its omissions !
All the politicians who are the real criminals here got lots of face time on the TV news to spew the poison that got us into this tragic mess in the first place .
If prohibition had been repealed on January 1st , all those gangland killings would not have occurred .
The murder rate would be zero so far in 2009 , but not a single mention or consideration of that .
I was disappointed that an idealist like Trevor Lock was clearly manipulated into handing over his valuable forum to the very architects of this horrid situation , the political establishment .
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) speaker Tony Smith was denied an opportunity to speak .
I was not asked , as leader of the BC Marijuana Party to speak against prohibition .
Even Trevor and Paul , the other organizer , never advocated their own true feelings on the subject of prohibition – they want it to be repealed but declined to even say so at their own forum !
Only the status quo was invited – the very people who are creating the problem !
I ’m happy our excellent pamphlet and signs were seen and read , but this was a good example of idealists surrendering their podium to evil manipulators who injure our society with their propaganda , their laws , their prohibition , their police and the destruction of our civil liberties .
The people were robbed yet again .
No reason or rational words were spoken .
No one learned anything from the speakers , and politicians got a free , free ride .
I am pleased to say if I and my three volunteers were n’t there , the whole event would have been a colossal con and that would have been sad and appalling indeed .
Introduction
This article describes basic ideas of how to build workflow engine a - la Workflow Foundation based on F# workflows and CCR .
Main Idea
Recently I 've played a bit with F# workflows feature and one crazy idea appeared in my fevered imagination : “ Would it be possible to build a workflow engine a - la Windows Workflow Foundation using F# workflows ? ” .
In this article , you can see an attempt to build such an engine , at least a very initial version of it .
First of all , I would like to provide you with some useful links for those who have n't had a chance to play with F# and F# workflows in particular :
So , if you continue reading this , then you probably already have some F# knowledge or have checked the links above … or just want to check what this crazy guy is talking about .
Let ’s start with a small sample :
let workflowHost = new WorkflowEngine ( ) let fibonacciWorkflow number = workflowHost { do printfn " Started ! " let !
f1 = fib number let !
f2 = fib ( number + 1 ) do printfn " Finished " do printfn " Result is %s " ( ( f1 + f2 ) . ToString ( ) ) return 0 //success } runWorkflow ( fibonacciWorkflow ( 22 ) ) ; ;
What do we have here : A workflow or THE workflow called fibonacciWorkflow .
Something very trivial : we calculate two Fibonacci numbers and print out the sum of these numbers .
Here fib function calculates Fibonacci number for a given position .
Honestly , I 've copy pasted this function from somewhere on the web . :)
let fib n = let rec fib_aux ( n , a , b ) = match ( n , a , b ) with | ( 0 , a , b ) -> a | _ -> fib_aux ( n - 1 , a + b , a ) fun ( ) -> fib_aux ( n , 0 , 1 )
Looks like nothing special - a very trivial workflow .
Let 's have some fun now - it 's time to have a closer look at the workflow engine .
Of course , each dependable workflow engine should manage threading and execute all workflows and activities in parallel ( or not ? ) threads where possible and tries to do its best to increase performance .
So our engine tries to follow the tradition and uses CCR to execute all activities ( activities you can identify by “ let ! ” keyword ) .
Here we have two activities and each one is transformed behind the scene to CCR task .
The output of each activity ( CCR task ) is taken as an input to the next activity ( CCR task ) .
Before I show the actual implementation , I 'd like to describe one more feature of our workflow engine .
The second thing each dependable workflow engine should do is to provide developers with the ability to inject aspects during activity execution .
Let ’s define trivial security aspect which is intended to notify someone ( probably a system administrator ) about a security alert ( let 's assume that in your company it is forbidden to calculate Fibonacci numbers :) ) :)
let security Aspect ( ) = printfn " Security Alert :
Wake up , someone is running your workflow !!! "
This is a very , very simple aspect .
I could make it more complicated ( for instance , validate activity input within aspect ) … maybe next time . :)
type Activity <'a > = unit -> ' a let runWorkflow ( f: Activity < 'a > ) = f ( ) type WorkflowEngine ( ) = let dispatcher = new Dispatcher ( 8 , " MyDispatcher " ) //from Microsoft.Ccr.Core let queue = new DispatcherQueue ( " MyQueue " , dispatcher ) // from Microsoft.Ccr.
Core member b. Let( p , rest ) = rest p member b. Return ( x ) = fun ( ) -> x member b. Delay f = fun ( ) -> ( runWorkflow f ) ( ) member b. Bind( p , rest ) = security Aspect ( ) fun ( ) -> let res = queue .
Enqueue ( new Task ( fun ( ) -> printfn " Thread id is : %d " Thread.CurrentThread.Managed Thread
Id let res = p( ) let b = queue .
Enqueue ( new Task ( fun ( ) -> let fakeVal = rest ( res ) ( ) ( ) ) ) ( ) ) ) new ' b ( ) // return fake value - just to fool the F# compiler :)... sorry , //it 's ugly , but I have n't yet found a better way
Now it ’s time to have a look at the workflow engine code ( by the way , please forgive me for using “ engine ” term here , in F# usually is used workflow builder term ) :
Each keyword in the workflow is transformed to a method in the workflow builder : let ->
Let , let ! ->
Bind , return ->
Return and Delay method is used to provide invocation point for the whole workflow .
Actually , all workflow - engine - features - I - have - stated - above - related functionality is implemented within the Bind method .
It is possible to define additional keywords , like for , while , use , if / then … etc .
Here I 've implemented only the basic set of all possible keywords .
The important point here is that with the help of F# compiler , you have reasonable level of control over each line of code within the workflow and can influence it with aspects or any other ways you want .
The other important point is that within workflow , you can keep state of workflow execution .
Conclusion
Here I presented the basic ideas of how to build a workflow engine based on F# workflows .
The engine provided above is pretty trivial and its mission is to convey a basic idea of possible implementation .
There is absolutely no support for centralized exception handling ( dependable workflow engine should also provide it ) , which could be achieved through output ports in CCR .
And CCR usage is pretty superficial , I use it in a very simple and dummy way .
You can find much better CCR - related articles if you want to learn it ( I 've used some CCR samples as a base ) .
In an effort to encourage the development of Canadian programming that 's more accessible to the iPod generation , the federal government is doing away with the controversial Canadian Television Fund .
The fund , which is the source of taxpayer subsidies to the Canadian television production industry , will be combined with the Canada New Media Fund , which subsidizes digital media development starting April 1 , 2010 .
The government will invest $ 134.7 million annually in the new program , called the Canada Media Fund , Heritage Minister James Moore said at a press conference today on the Toronto set of the CTV police drama series , Flashpoint .
" We are levelling the playing field at a time when the industry is undergoing structural change , " Moore said .
" The eligibility for funding for broadcaster - affiliated production will be expanded , and broadcaster in - house production will be allowed ... including provincial educational broadcasters and CBC / Radio- Canada . "
The emphasis of the new broadcast policy will be on drama , comedy , and children 's programming , and will favour productions developed for distribution platforms other than prime - time television – the Internet and mobile telecommunications devices , said Moore , who admitted he watches " more television programs on my iPod than on regular TV . "
The new fund will also support documentaries and variety and performing arts programming that can demonstrate that the market alone would not support their creation .
" The realigned fund will favour projects produced in high definition and those that have achieved and demonstrated the most potential to achieve success , in terms of audience and return on investment , " Moore said
" Applicants will be required to make their projects available across a minimum of two distribution platforms , including television . "
The establishment of the new fund is a clear rejection of last summer 's recommendation by the broadcasting industry czar , the Canadian Radio - television Telecommunications Commission , that the $ 300 - million Canadian Television
Fund be split into two funding streams , one for private networks , the other for non-profit broadcasters .
MY RESPONSE TO M.I.A.C. REPORT
By Chuck Baldwin
March 24 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
By now , readers should be familiar with the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) report dated 02/20/09 and titled , " MIAC Strategic Report : The Modern Militia Movement . "
In this dreadfully malicious and slanderous " law enforcement sensitive " secret police report , Governor Jeremiah ( Jay ) Nixon ; John Britt , Director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety ; James Keathley , Colonel , Missouri State Highway Patrol ; and Van Godsey , Director of MIAC categorize certain citizens as being potential violence - prone " militia members . "
I would venture to guess that more than 75 % of the entire population of the United States would fit the MIAC 's broad definition of someone who would fall into the aforementioned category .
According to the MIAC report , if you oppose any of the following , you could qualify for being profiled as a potential dangerous " militia member " :
The United Nations
The New World Order
Gun Control
The violation of Posse Comitatus
The Federal Reserve
The Income Tax
The Ammunition and Accountability Act
A possible Constitutional Convention
The North American Union
Universal Service Program
Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID )
Abortion
Illegal Immigration
Again , I would bet that at least 75 % of the American people would oppose at least one or more items on the above list .
Well , according to the MIAC report , that is sufficient to make them potential dangerous " militia members . "
However , it is the following statement contained in the MIAC report that is particularly disturbing to yours truly .
Under the heading " Political Paraphernalia , " the report states , " Militia members most commonly associate with 3rd party political groups .
It is not uncommon for militia members to display Constitutional [ sic ]
Party , Campaign for Liberty , or Libertarian material .
These members are usually supporters of former Presidential Candidate [ sic ] : Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , and Bob Barr . "
The obvious inference of the above statement links Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and myself to potential dangerous " militia members . "
The broader implication is that the millions of people who supported Ron Paul , Bob Barr , or myself are likewise categorized as potential dangerous " militia members . "
This is a classic case of broad - brushed police profiling .
Can you imagine the fallout of this preposterous report had the names Jesse Jackson , Al Sharpton , and Maxine Waters been used instead of the names Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , and Bob Barr ?
Accordingly , Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and I wrote a formal letter to the above - named Missouri officials demanding " that the following - described document be immediately removed from any and all websites associated with or maintained by the state of Missouri or any agency thereof , including the MIAC ; that the said document no longer be circulated by the state of Missouri or any agency thereof or associated therewith ; and that the state of Missouri repudiate its references to the three of us contained therein . "

Ladies and gentlemen , we simply cannot allow this kind of police profiling to continue .
I assure you , this phenomenon is not limited to the State of Missouri .
Every state that has a " Fusion Center " is being fed this kind of nonsense on a regular basis .
You and I are commonly referred to as " extremists " in these secret police reports .
This has been happening in earnest for the past couple of months and is operating under the auspices of the federal Department of Homeland Security .
And people with a public platform ( such as myself , Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and a host of others ) are now being singled out by name .
How long will it be before police agencies begin " picking up and hauling away " those people whose names are mentioned in these reports ?
It may be sooner than we think .
To see if your state has a " Fusion Center , " click here .
The only thing that will stymie this nonsense is a huge public outcry opposing it .
Yes , the people of this country ( that means YOU ) still have the power to put a stop to this kind of totalitarian thinking .
If we do nothing , however , it will soon be too late to stop it .
We either stop it now , or it will quickly mushroom into a leviathan that will both monitor and control the personal opinions and speech of every man , woman , and child in this country .
No , I am not exaggerating .
The Feds already monitor virtually every phone call , email , and public speech in the country .
How long before these secret police reports will be used as justification to arrest and incarcerate people because of their ideas and opinions , labeling them as a " threat " or as " dangerous " to society ?
Here is the contact information for the appropriate officials in Missouri :
Email address : Brandon.middleton@mshp.dps.mo.gov
Missouri Information Analysis Center
Division of Drugs & Crime Control
P. O. Box 568
Jefferson City , MO 65102-0568
Phone : 573-751-6422
Toll Free : 866-362-6422
Fax : 573-751-9950
And while you are at it , you should also contact the state police agency as well as the governor 's office in your state , especially if your state has a " Fusion Center " ( see web site above ) .
Mark it down : if you have ever publicly opposed any of the above - mentioned issues or organizations , or have ever publicly supported an independent Presidential candidate , YOU ARE BEING PROFILED RIGHT NOW !
We await the State of Missouri 's response .
In the meantime , what are you going to do ?
P.S. Even as this column is being distributed , we have just received a reply from the Director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety , John Britt .
I will analyze and respond to this statement in my next column .

There are much bigger asteroids out there , like Itokawa ( pictured )
An asteroid which may be as big as a 10 - storey building has passed close by the Earth , astronomers say .
The object , known as 2009 DD45 , thought to be 21 - 47 m ( 68 - 152ft ) across , raced by our planet at 1344 GMT on Monday .
The gap was just 72,000 km ( 44,750 miles ) ; a fifth of the distance between our planet and the Moon .
The rock is of a similar size to the object that many scientists say exploded over Siberia in 1908 with the force of 1,000 atomic bombs .
The object was first reported on Saturday by the Siding Spring Survey , a near - Earth object search programme in Australia .
It was confirmed by the International Astronomical Union 's Minor Planet Centre ( MPC ) , which catalogues Solar System objects .
The closest recent flyby listed by the MPC is 2004 FU162 , a small asteroid about 6 m ( 20 ft ) across which came within about 6,500 km ( 4,000 miles ) of our planet in March 2004 .
The latest object , 2009 DD45 , passed by our planet at only twice the altitude of satellites in geosynchronous orbit .
Surprise miss
In 1908 , an object with a similar size exploded over Siberia , flattening 80 million trees over an area of 2,000 square km ( 800 square miles ) near the Tunguska river .
" There is still a lot of debate over how big the Tunguska object was , " Professor Alan Fitzsimmons , an astronomer at Queens University Belfast , told BBC News .
" It was always thought to be 50 or 70 m ( 165-230 ft ) across .
But some recent calculations have implied it may have been even smaller than that - maybe down to 30 m ( 100 ft ) in size .
There 's a large uncertainty there , but it puts ( this object ) in the same ballpark . "
Felled trees can still be seen today at the Tunguska site A United Nations working group on near - Earth objects ( NEOs ) met last month to discuss drafting international procedures for handling the asteroid threat .
Dr Richard Crowther , chair of the UN Working Group on Near - Earth Objects , commented : " Although we will meet formally again in June of this year to advance our work on this important issue , I am sure we will discuss the implications of the 2009 DD45 close approach informally before then .
The expert , who works for the Science & Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , told BBC News : " Such unanticipated near - misses - at least in astronomical terms - from objects such as 2009 DD45 ... demonstrate the need for the global community to establish the means to mitigate this impact threat . "
As had been shown with the Tunguska object , asteroids of this size could potentially unleash a destructive power equivalent to about 10 to 15 megatonnes of TNT , Dr Crowther explained .
This is about 1,000 times more powerful than the blast from the bomb dropped on Hiroshima .
Professor Fitzsimmons added that the destructive potential of an object such as 2009 DD45 depended on what it was made of and the angle at which it hit the Earth 's atmosphere .

And now another fine example of bigotry and intolerance from the great wackadoo state of Texas .
Richard Mullins , history and government teacher for over 30 years was suspended for being a “ suspected atheist ” and a liberal .
Mullins on the angry mother of the student making the accusations …
She accused me of being an atheist , saying I was too liberal , and that I allowed the students to talk about inappropriate things in the classroom .
I told her that occasionally students would get on topics and say things , but I was unable to censor them before they were able to say them .
She said that I called her daughter a name and I denied the accusation .
But then she said that I did n’t believe in god and should n’t be teaching .
She also said that she had spoken to 3 other board members who agreed with her that I should n’t be teaching because I was too liberal and I was an atheist .
After the principal of the school suspended Mullins …
I later had conversations with parents and a person who lives in the community , who informed me that the principal had met with the minister of the local church and had discussed my suspension with him .
I also later received information from REDACTED , a “ SCHOOL EMPLOYEE - POSITION REDACTED ” , that the minister was now subbing at the school and that he had heard that he would be taking my position , or if I returned he would be co-teaching with me .
There have been a number of rumors in our community now concerning inappropriate behavior : high school girls coming to my class to supposedly smoke marijuana , all kinds of accusations made by the members of the missionary baptist church at which this minister is the preacher .
In the January 24th letter from Mr. Richard Turner , my principal , I was also informed that my suspension had been extended indefinitely .
After the suspension , 100 of 103 students refused to sign a petition listing charges against Mullins , and now the principal of the school has forbade students from taking any action that would get Mullins reinstated .
For more information , Mullins ’ complete statement and an article in the Beaumont Enterprise .

As the economy weakens , big ticket items like cars are particularly hard hit .
And GM ’s offer of 0 % financing , which lead to a brief flurry of buying , apparently was n’t enough to offset the trend of broad - based consumer retrenchment .
There is a bit of disparity in reporting .
The Wall Street Journal tells us GM now says it needs an additional $ 16.6 billion and warns it could run out of cash next month .
Chrysler is seeking a comparatively modest extra $ 2 billion .
( on top of its original ask of $ 7 billion ) .
But the New York Times puts the additional cash request for GM at $ 12 billion .
And why the difference ?
The increase cited by the WSJ is in how much the total package sought is ( $ 30 billion ) versus the amount borrowed already ( $ 13.4 billion ) .
The Times , by contrast , is defining the increase as the increase in the total amount requested .
From the Wall Street Journal :
The largest U.S. auto maker , surviving on $ 13.4 billion in emergency loans granted in recent months , laid out a plan to close more factories , eliminate thousands of dealerships and slash 47,000 jobs this year around the world .
GM , however , said it failed to strike critical deals with the United Auto Workers union and bondholders to reduce labor costs and shrink its $ 47 billion debt load .
Negotiations with both parties are expected to continue .
Meanwhile , Chrysler LLC is seeking an additional $ 2 billion in federal funds on top of the $ 7 billion bailout it requested in December as part of the viability plan submitted to the Treasury Department on Tuesday afternoon .
Chrysler , which cited an “ unprecedented decline in the automotive sector ” since December , said it expects to remain viable and conduct an orderly restructuring outside of bankruptcy .
Chairman and Chief Executive Robert L. Nardelli said the company ’s standalone viability plan , enhanced by a strategic alliance with Fiat SpA , is the best option for Chrysler employees , unions , dealers , suppliers and customers .
The company so far has accepted $ 4 billion of its original $ 7 billion request ….. GM , in a 100 - plus page report submitted to the U.S.
Treasury , argues that bankruptcy would still be more costly and drawn out than a government - funded restructuring .
The auto maker said a traditional bankruptcy could cost as much as $ 100 billion , attributing much of that cost to lost revenue .
Instead , GM proposes an accelerated downsizing that involves cuts deeper than those outlined in December .
Steps include shuttering 14 factories by 2012 rather than nine , eliminating 47,000 hourly and salaried jobs this year globally , and closing its Hummer truck brand this year and Saturn in 2011 if no alternatives arise .
From the New York Times :
General Motors told the federal government Tuesday that it needed to increase its loan request to $ 30 billion , $ 12 billion more than it had initially sought in order to avoid a bankruptcy filing .
G.M said that it needed $ 4.6 billion within weeks from loans previously requested from the government as well as $ 12 billion on top of that because of a deepening slump in vehicle sales .
In addition , the nation ’s largest automaker said it planned to cut 47,000 jobs out of a total of 244,000 around the world by the end of the year .
About 20,000 of the job losses will come in the United States , as well as five more plant closings beyond those previously announced .
Based on its filing , G.M. appears to be in danger of running out of money by the end of March without another infusion from the Treasury Department .
The dire forecast was included in G.M. ’s broad restructuring plan delivered as part of the terms of the government ’s loan package to the ailing auto maker .
A smaller rival , Chrysler , was also required to file a restructuring package .
In its plan , Chrysler also increased its loan request to the federal government by $ 2 billion .
The company , which received $ 4 billion in December , originally planned to seek $ 3 billion in April .
But it said Tuesday that the vehicle market had deteriorated so dramatically that a total of $ 9 billion was needed .
As expected , G.M. ’s plan drastically scaled back global operations , with a goal of bringing the company to a break - even point by next year .
Note the Times article is written as if they have a copy of the plan , while the Journal does not give that impression .
Now that the dust has settled around the widely anticipated and highly touted launch of Killzone 2 , it 's worth taking some time to look deeper at the game 's multiplayer component .
Sony 's big gun , as it were , boasts one of the most capable , impressive , and fully - featured online multiplayer components that a PS3 game has seen thus far , but it 's only after spending almost a month with the game 's online experience that one can truly appreciate what works and what does n't with Guerrilla 's latest title .
Surprisingly , I 've found myself enjoying the multiplayer side of Killzone 2 less and less the more I play it .
My gameplay habits have changed a bit recently , and I 've been playing almost nothing but Killzone 2 since the game launched .
Initially , the multiplayer had me wowed as it did the critics and masses alike .
Though I still held to some of my original criticisms , I was for the most part captured by the overwhelming and relentlessly frenetic feel of the game 's multiplayer .
But while the game 's recent patch did manage to take care of a few of the game 's bugs and tighten up the much - discussed controls ( which Guerrilla clearly was in the wrong about from the outset , as evidenced by the game 's frustrating final boss , who is neither slow nor tactical ) , there are a few key issues which some hardcore gamers may come to loathe as time goes on .
When the game shines , it shines brightly .
When two coordinated teams are doing battle with one another and all of the game 's classes are being used properly , the multiplayer of Killzone 2 can truly be a symphony in motion — and what a bloody symphony it is .
When opposing spawn points are next to each other and in the immediate vicinity of a gameplay objective , forget about it : the unending cascade of bodies and bloodshed will have even the most grizzled first - person shooter veterans sweating and sitting on the edge of their seats .
PC - only gamers , this is a multiplayer shooter worth being jealous about when it 's at its best .
Even at its best , though , Killzone 2 still suffers from a few huge issues , the foremost of which is the poorly - conceived squad system which forces players to actually get out of the action to manage one of the most important elements of the game .
With 16 other players on a single team , multiple spawn points rammed up next to each other , and a seemingly impossible - to - complete objective given the unending waves of enemy players , it 's frustratingly difficult to bring order to the chaos .
What makes this all the more noticeable are the design concessions that Guerrilla made in an attempt to make the game appeal first and foremost to the clan audience .
I 'm not sure if the company intended from the outset to neglect Joe Gamer and strive to have Killzone take second seat to Halo at scarcely legitimate MLG tournaments , but the company 's bullish and forceful shaping of the game as a clan - centric experience will test the patience of all but the most casual and most clan - involved players .
Nothing proves my point more than an unforeseen problem with its admittedly - innovative class systems .
As you surely know by now , players can select " badges " that correspond to player classes .
These badges are unlocked as players progress .
Each badge has two potential special abilities , and abilities can be mixed across classes .
For example , the Medic gains the primary ability to revive a teammate once every minute or so , as well as a secondary Med pack ability which allows the Medic to toss out a Med pack approximately every 20 seconds .
While during the first week or so after launch the rooms were full of mostly soldiers ( the beginner class ) and medics , the game is now full of all the other classes .
This was , of course , to be expected .
Sadly , with so many Tacticians and Engineers running around , one of the strangest and most troubling design decisions has only now made itself known .
Both Tacticians and Engineers have special abilities which are " consumable items " much like the Medic .
Tacticians can throw down special grenades which add spawn points to the match and summon flying drones that act as air support , while Engineers can place and repair turrets .
Unfortunately for players playing these two classes , the amount of spawn grenades , drones , and turrets that can be summoned in a match is a tied to a limited pool shared across the whole team .
This means that a team of 16 can only have a maximum of 4 or so turrets up simultaneously .
While this makes sense from a balance perspective — you would n't want an entire team of 16 to each have 2 turrets up , or would you ?— it makes for one of the most frustrating casual , semi-casual , and even hardcore lone - wolf and small - group play experiences in such a high - profile shooter .
Your play experience is in every way made or broken by the other players on your team , which is a huge regression from the welcome advent of lone wolf and party modes made a genre norm by Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4 — especially when combined with the complete absence of a party system .
Because the team shares a pool of these special items , it 's trivially easy for your job of choice to be rendered useless .
Want to play Tactician because you like the class and you 're good at it ?
You 'd better hope that there are n't any other poor Tacticians on your team wasting the limited supply of spawn grenades .
While in clan play this creates the need for an amazing amount of coordination and talent , the likes of which truly serves as an excellent measure of clan skill , it 's an exercise in infuriating frustration when it comes to all nonclan matches .
Organizing and communicating with other players in a normal match is virtually impossible most of the time ( and it is of course exacerbated by the all - but - useless squad system ) .
This means that you 'll more often than not wind up playing a class that you do n't necessarily want to just to be productive , which runs contrary to the game 's custom class design and ranking system which requires players to sink much time and effort into unlocking all of the abilities and upgrades for a single class .
I 'm all for supporting clans in multiplayer games , but I can't help but feel that Guerilla made some serious missteps with the multiplayer experience that are only becoming apparent as the game gets older ; it feels like the developers focused on the clan side of the game at the cost of enjoyment for the rest of us .
The core action is fast , frenetic , and addictive in a way that is tough to describe and awe - inspiring to behold , but hardcore players will likely find themselves frustrated in the long run by a system designed from its foundation to be excruciatingly punishing to uncoordinated teams .
Not every hardcore player wants to get involved in clan life , and truly enjoying Killzone 2's multiplayer in a competitive and hardcore way all but requires it .
Whether that 's something you really want is up to you .
But as a gamer that loves to get down and dirty with just a few friends and play a multiplayer shooter long into the night , I find Killzone 2 to be an increasingly - frustrating game that has me saying " I wish this was different " much more often than " I wish I could play all night long . "
A British resident , once accused of plotting with Al Qaeda to detonate a radiological " dirty bomb , " is a free man and is now calling for an investigation into his alleged torture at the behest of the US government .
Binyam Mohamed was released from a cell at the Guantánamo terror prison camp in Cuba early Monday , where he had been held since September 2004 .
He was flown by private jet to a British military base near London , where he met with his legal team and doctors .
" I am not asking for vengeance ; only that the truth should be made known , so that nobody in the future should have to endure what I have endured , " Mr. Mohamed said in a statement released through his lawyers .
Mohamed 's freedom comes after years of investigation and legal pressure by the London - based human rights group , Reprieve .
It also follows a recent lobbying blitz in Britain by an appointed US military lawyer , Lt. Col. Yvonne Bradley .
How deep was British - U.S. partnership ?
Mohamed 's arrival in Britain is expected to add urgency to calls for an investigation into the possible knowledge by British intelligence agents of Mohamed 's harsh treatment , including allegations of routine beatings , druggings , and cuttings with a scalpel .
Some analysts say it may also increase pressure for a US investigation of controversial tactics used in the Bush administration 's war on terror .
" I have been through an experience that I never thought to encounter in my darkest nightmares , " Mohamed said .
" Before this ordeal , ' torture ' was an abstract word to me .
I could never have imagined that I would be its victim . "
He said he was " abducted , hauled from one country to the next , and tortured in medieval ways – all orchestrated by the United States government . "
Mohamed is a 30 - year - old former Ethiopian refugee who was granted asylum in Britain when he was 15 .
He has spent the past seven years of his life in a legal black hole that included stops in two Pakistani detention centers , two US military prisons in Afghanistan , the terror prison camp at Guantánamo , and – according to Mohamed and his lawyers – a bloody torture chamber in Morocco .
Claims of false confession under torture
Mohamed 's lawyers say he was held for two years in secret detention without charge or access to a lawyer at the request of the US government .
They say he was taken to Morocco , where interrogators tortured him until he consistently repeated a confession of involvement in a " dirty - bomb " plot and other alleged Al Qaeda operations .
Lawyers working on Mohamed 's behalf stepped up pressure on both the US and British governments in recent months .
In Britain , a legal campaign was undertaken to win release of 42 classified British documents related to Mohamed 's interrogation and treatment .
Meanwhile , in Washington , a federal judge ordered the US government to make a full accounting of the conditions surrounding every statement Mohamed allegedly made to his interrogators .
Last year , after a federal judge ordered the US government to turn over information about Mohamed 's interrogations and treatment , charges against him were dropped .
The charges originated from a special military commission set up by the Bush administration with stripped - down due - process protections to allow the introduction of evidence from coerced confessions .
Arrested in Pakistan
Mohamed lived in London beginning in 1994 .
After taking college courses , developing a drug addiction , and eventually becoming a student of Islam , he traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the spring of 2001 to experience Muslim societies first - hand and to try to shake his drug habit , according to his lawyers .
When war broke out in Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks , Mohamed sought to return to Britain .
He was arrested at the Karachi airport trying to use a friend 's passport .
While still in Pakistani custody , he was hung from the ceiling for a week with his feet just touching the floor , the lawyers say .
After several months in Pakistani custody , he was turned over to US agents , who flew him to Morocco , according to the lawyers .
Tortures detailed
Interrogations in Morocco were accompanied by repeated scalpel cuts , according to diary entries provided by his lawyers .
He was threatened with castration unless he " told the truth . "
The scalpel interrogation technique was repeated once a month for about a year , Mohamed has told his lawyers .
He says he was routinely beaten and was drugged .
The interrogators cuffed his hands so he could n't remove a set of headphones , then blasted music by Meatloaf and Aerosmith at top volume , over and over , all day and all night .
" I hated that , " he later told his lawyers .
He also told them : " About once a month they would do other things to me that I just cannot talk about . "
" I was in agony , crying , trying desperately to suppress myself , but I was screaming , " Mohamed wrote about his treatment in Morocco .
What role did Britain play ?
In London , controversy is growing around claims that British authorities were aware of the alleged mistreatment in Pakistan and Morocco .
" Many have been complicit in my own horrors over the past seven years , " Mohamed said .
" For myself , the very worst moment came when I realized in Morocco that the people who were torturing me were receiving questions and materials from British intelligence , " he said .
" I had met with British intelligence in Pakistan .
I had been open with them .
Yet the very people who I had hoped would come to my rescue , I later realized , had allied themselves with my abusers . "
The British government has refused to release documents related to Mohamed 's treatment , citing a threat from the US government that it would halt intelligence - sharing operations between the two countries if the sensitive information is made public .
Clive Stafford - Smith , director of Reprieve , is urging public release .
" You can't learn from history if you do n't know what the history is , " he said .
" It 's disturbing that the British government has thus far declined to put into the public domain evidence of Binyam 's torture . "
Mohamed is being allowed " temporary admission " to Britain , according to the British government .
He has reportedly agreed to abide by several voluntary security measures including reporting on a regular basis to the police .
His legal team , family , and friends have said that they intend to bring him to a " quiet place " to recover .
However , his return has already sparked a major clamor by sections of the British media trying to locate him .
His sister , Zuhra , a US citizen who traveled to London to meet him , said : " I am so glad and so happy , more than words can express .
I am so thankful for everything that was done for Binyam to make this day come true . "

We are using a recursive build , so we need to do a little thinking 20 # to get the ordering right .
21 # 22 # Most importantly : sub-Makefiles should only ever modify files in 23 # their own directory .
If in some directory we have a dependency on 24 # a file in another dir ( which does n't happen often , but it 's often 25 # unavoidable when linking the built - in.o targets which finally 26 # turn into vmlinux ) , we will call a sub make in that other dir , and 27 # after that we are sure that everything which is in that other dir 28 # is now up to date .
29 # 30 #
The only cases where we need to modify files which have global 31 # effects are thus separated out and done before the recursive 32 # descending is started .
They are now explicitly listed as the 33 # prepare rule .

Is sex work ?
Helena Aaberg Information Office
University of Gothenburg

Few things have aroused such conflicting feelings and heated discussions over the millennia as the sale of sexual services .
Swedish prostitutes are regarded as victims and are protected by the Sex Purchase Act .
In Germany persons who sell sex are seen as professionals and they can operate in legal brothels .
Just in time for this year 's tenth anniversary of the Swedish Sex Purchase Act , historian of ideas Susanne Dodillet explains how it is possible for these two similar societies to have such radically different ways of dealing with this activity .
Purchasing sex has been forbidden in Sweden since 1999 .
The Sex Purchase Act was passed in order to show that prostitution is a practice that is not acceptable in Sweden .
Two years later the Bundestag , the German parliament , approved a law with the aim of integrating sex sellers into society .
Since then prostitutes in Germany have been entitled to unemployment benefit , sickness benefit and pensions in the same way as all other skilled workers .
Furthermore , running a brothel has been made legal .
The change in the law was intended to reduce the stigmatisation and discrimination of those who sell sex .
- The disparity in the countries ' prostitution policies is partly due to their view of the welfare state , of feminism and of religion , explains Susanne Dodillet at the Department of Literature , History of ideas and Religion , University of Gothenburg , Sweden .
The Sex Purchase Act in Sweden was introduced as a way of influencing society 's view of gender equality .
Prostitution was described as an unacceptable expression of society 's genderised power structures .
According to the author of the thesis , a normative law such as the Sex Purchase Act is made possible partly due to the comparatively high level of trust that Swedish people have in the state .
She considers that Germans , on the other hand , tend rather to question the state 's responsibility for setting norms .
- It has something to do with the experience of two dictatorships .
Swedes have had a positive experience of their welfare state , but both the National Socialist dictatorship during the Third Reich and the socialist GDR highlight the fact that states can abuse their normative power .
It was the German left that pushed through the legalisation of prostitution and they emphasised that the state should not regulate sexual relationships between consenting adults .
When it comes to feminism , radical feminist theories have gained a strong influence in Sweden , emphasising power structures as male domination and female subservience .
In Germany feminism has more similarities with queer feminism , which is compatible with the way in which the state is viewed .
While Swedish prostitution policies are based on a normative view of how equality should manifest itself for women and men , the German left emphasises that there is a large range of sexual identities and modes of expression .
According to this way of thinking , selecting some as more equal and thereby superior to others entails discriminating against deviants .
With regard to religion , Dodillet points to the major influence that the Christian Democrats have in the German social debate .
- She calls attention to the fact that in Germany the Christian Democrats control half the parliament .
In common with the church , they oppose prostitution on moral grounds and sympathise with Swedish prostitution policy .
However , the left opposes the moral argument and the view of prostitution is consequently more liberal than in Sweden where there is little Christian political opposition .
Title of the thesis :
Is sex work ?

Thought Curling Was Boring ?
Glenn Howard Makes An Amazing Shot For The Win
Total Pro Sports –
And you thought the sport of curling was boring !!!!
I know most of you south of the border ( USA ) probably do n’t even know that curling even existed , and that ’s fine because sometimes I wonder why this sport was even invented ?
The unfortunate thing in Canada is that the sport of curling is huge and has always drawn large crowds .
Yes that ’s right I ’m more then happy to admit that Canadians love the cold and sports that involve a sheet of ice .
So if you did n’t know the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier is being held in Calgary , Alberta ( Polar Bears and igloos do not exist there ) .
After catching some of the nightly sports highlights on TSN ( The equivalent to SportsCenter ) the show ended with their nightly top plays that included a shot that occurred during curling match between Team Ontario and Team Saskatoon .
Team Ontario was trailing 6 - 4 and down to their last shot .
Skip Glenn
Howard took the stone knowing that if he did n’t score 3 points they would lose the match .
Well let me tell you Glen made one of the most amazing shots in curling history , he knocked both of Team Saskatchewan stones out and scored 3 points to win the match 7 - 6 .
Howard executed the play of the week with the hammer in Ontario ’s incredible 7 - 6 comeback win over Saskatchewan .
“ It was an angle - raise , in - off double and then throw - your - hands - in - the - air - and - run - around - like - an - idiot shot , ” said Howard , still shaking his head five minutes after the amazing play wowed the Saddledome crowd of 9,601 fans .
“ I do n’t think I was happier when we won ( the Brier ) in 2007 . ” [ The Recorder &Times ]
If you do n’t believe us and have no clue what we are talking about just take a look at the video below and watch the reaction of Glen Howard , Joel Jordison and Team Alberta ’s skip Kevin Martin , it ’s priceless .
I have to admit after watching this amazing shot , I am now a fan of curling !

Water shortages are predicted across large parts of Africa , Europe and Asia Growing world population will cause a " perfect storm " of food , energy and water shortages by 2030 , the UK government chief scientist has warned .
By 2030 the demand for resources will create a crisis with dire consequences , Prof John Beddington said .
Demand for food and energy will jump 50 % by 2030 and for fresh water by 30 % , as the population tops 8.3 billion , he told a conference in London .
Climate change will exacerbate matters in unpredictable ways , he added .
' Complacent '
" It 's a perfect storm , " Prof Beddington told the Sustainable Development UK 09 conference .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" There 's not going to be a complete collapse , but things will start getting really worrying if we do n't tackle these problems . "
Prof Beddington said the looming crisis would match the current one in the banking sector .
" My main concern is what will happen internationally , there will be food and water shortages , " he said .
" We 're relatively fortunate in the UK ; there may not be shortages here , but we can expect prices of food and energy to rise . "
The United Nations Environment Programme predicts widespread water shortages across Africa , Europe and Asia by 2025 .
The amount of fresh water available per head of the population is expected to decline sharply in that time .
The issue of food and energy security rose high on the political agenda last year during a spike in oil and commodity prices .
Genetically - modified Prof Beddington said the concern now - when prices have dropped once again - was that the issues would slip back down the domestic and international agenda .
" We can't afford to be complacent .
Just because the high prices have dropped does n't mean we can relax , " he said .
Improving agricultural productivity globally was one way to tackle the problem , he added .
At present , 30 - 40 % of all crops are lost due to pest and disease before they are harvested .
Professor Beddington said : " We have to address that .
We need more disease - resistant and pest - resistant plants and better practices , better harvesting procedures .
" Genetically - modified food could also be part of the solution .
We need plants that are resistant to drought and salinity - a mixture of genetic modification and conventional plant breeding .
Better water storage and cleaner energy supplies are also essential , he added .
Prof Beddington is chairing a subgroup of a new Cabinet Office task force set up to tackle food security .
But he said the problem could not be tackled in isolation .
He wants policy - makers in the European Commission to receive the same high level of scientific advice as the new US president , Barack Obama .
One solution would be to create a new post of chief science adviser to the European Commission , he suggested .

Joe The Plumber , Tucker Carlson and others adorn the ' blanket with sleeves ' trend .
| Composite image by POLITICO Conservatives embrace the Snuggie
" Never let it be said that conservatives and libertarians have no sense of humor , " says Americans for Tax Reform 's Derek Hunter , who 's been doing his best to photograph fellow conservatives sporting the trend of the moment : the Snuggie .
And it 's working :
So far he 's convinced Joe the Plumber , Tucker Carlson and Andrew Breitbart to adorn the " blanket with sleeves " that has people mocking it while simultaneously wearing it .
His boss , ATR President Grover Norquist , was the first " political celebrity " to put it on .

" I was plotting , trying to think of how to ask Grover , " said Hunter .
" But a friend of his grabbed him after a Wednesday meeting and said , ' You have to get your picture taken in this . '
He knew what it was , thought it was funny and slid it on . "
Hunter purchased the Snuggie after a bit too much to drink and later brought it into work simply to prove to his fellow Tax Reformers that , yes , he had — embarrassingly — purchased a Snuggie .
Soon , colleagues began taking photos of themselves in it and , eventually , a Facebook photo page — " The Snuggie Cult " — was born .
" From there , it blew up , " said Hunter .
" Within the next hour I was inundated with messages from people who wanted to see it , try it on and have their picture taken in it .
I figured it could be fun , so what the hell ?
Rather than give it away , which was my original plan , I thought I ’d keep it a while to take some pictures of people in it .
...
Next thing I knew I had 100 people in it . "
POLITICO Slideshows require the Adobe Flash Player
So who 's due for a Snuggie photo ?
Hunter says his wish list includes Karl Rove , Michael Steele , P.J. O'Rourke and Mary Matalin .
And he stands a good chance of getting most of them , since Norquist 's exclusive Wednesday morning meeting of conservative leaders frequently sees a roster of VIP visitors .
Hunter 's dream of getting President Barack Obama in a Snuggie , however , could prove a bit more challenging .
" I think it 's doable , " he joked .
The Red River is approaching record flood levels , likely to break century - old records this weekend .
Flowing north toward Manitoba along the Minnesota - North Dakota border , the river is jammed up by ice and is being fed by rain , snow and meltwater .
The National Weather Service has issued projections of a crest of 43 feet near Fargo , North Dakota , 24 feet above flood stage .
Volunteers and national guardsmen are out in force , building levees , rescuing and evacuating those that need to get to higher ground .
Cold temperatures are hampering efforts , freezing damp sandbags and making the job that much more strenuous for volunteers .
800 more National Guard troops and 150 Red Cross personnel are arriving in the area this weekend .

COLUMBUS — A new
study out last week
raised an intriguing question :
How free is your state ?
With state lawmakers in Ohio considering tougher seat - belt enforcement for civilians and shorter prison stays for criminals as two ways to balance the $ 54 billion , two - year state budget , the question seems both relevant and timely .
Ohio was ranked 38th out of 50 states on the index of personal and economic freedom developed by the Mercatus Center of George Mason University .
In other words , only 12 states are less free .
The study ranks New Hampshire , Colorado and South Dakota in a virtual tie for first place .
It ranks New York and California among the least free .
The index is wide - ranging and comes from an individual rights perspective , which defies many philosophical boundaries of the mainstream Republican and Democratic party platforms .
For example , Ohio 's prohibition against same - sex marriage is viewed as a wash in the study .
Why ?
Because all marriage requirements amount to unnecessary government intervention .
( As do blood test requirements and marriage license waiting periods , by their measure . )
Ohio's law allowing residents to carry concealed handguns ?
Good .
The state 's relatively lax marijuana laws ?
Also good .
By the researchers ' measure , seat belt laws and sobriety checkpoints " count as notable infringements on individual liberty . "
The index also issued freedom demerits for alcohol regulations , including " blue laws " against Sunday sales and taxes on beer , wine and spirits .
Open - container laws and cell phone driving bans are viewed as minor nuisances .
Ohio 's ranking in the study 's so - called " paternalism " category would presumably only worsen if lawmakers pass legislation allowing primary enforcement of the state 's seat belt requirement .
As it is now , a driver can only be fined if pulled over for another offense .
State lawmakers in the past have been resistant to making the switch .
But money talks , particularly in this historically bad economy , and Ohio can land $ 26 million in federal highway money if it complies .
A " yes " vote on primary seat belt enforcement might be offset on the freedom scale by allowing certain nonviolent offenders to do less time , earn early release credit faster , or serve time in community - based settings as opposed to prisons .
These are among ways state prisons officials are proposing to cut costs and reduce overcrowding .
The Mercatus Center has a whole list of crimes that it views as " victimless " for which governments are penalized for imposing in the index .
Those include many drug offenses for individuals over 18 , violations of liquor laws , gambling and prostitution .
Also on their list of paternalistic government activities are : bicycle and motorcycle helmet laws , regulations requiring motorists to carry personal injury insurance , home - and private - school regulations , campaign finance rules and asset forfeiture laws that allow government to take property without a conviction of the owner .
Ohio is ranked 46th of 50 in the study 's personal freedom ranking , above only Rhode Island , New York , Illinois and , the lowest , Maryland .
Alaska , Maine , New Mexico , Arkansas and Texas offer residents the most liberties in this area , the study found .
Amy Hanauer , executive director of Policy Matters Ohio , a nonprofit liberal think tank in Cleveland , said she finds the idea that New York is the nation 's least free state absurd .
She said the study appears to give high marks to states with particularly low taxes , such as Colorado .
" You can talk about freedom broadly -- being able to practice the religion of your choice , speak the language you choose , dress the way you want .
But to lump that in with the freedom from paying taxes is something I 've always found troubling and not very persuasive , " she said .
" The public sector is what enables us to pursue many other freedoms in our lives , " she said , " by keeping us safe , keeping our water clean , and giving us the ability to know that we are not surrounded by people who are in desperate want , which can also affect our freedom . "
State Sen. Bill Seitz , a Cincinnati Republican , tended to agree with the study that Ohioans ' freedom is suffering .
He noted Ohio has sanctioned red - light cameras , restricted payday lenders , passed a statewide smoking ban , and voted down legalized gaming all in the past year or two .
" The Republican Party and the state Legislature as a whole would be well - advised to promote a widely accepting message of individual freedom and individuality if they want to attract people and jobs to this state , " he said .
Ohio gets its highest marks -- 29th of the 50 states -- in the area of regulatory freedom .
This category ranks states based on their labor and utility regulations , health insurance mandates , occupational licensing requirements , eminent domain laws , land and environmental regulations , and their systems for allowing residents to recoup legal damages .
Ohio ranks 40th for its fiscal freedom , which takes into account budget constraints and the size of a state 's government related to its private sector .
South Carolina , New Hampshire and Colorado are the top three .
New Yorkers have the least amount of fiscal freedom .
A state 's fiscal and regulatory freedom combine for an economic freedom score in the study .
Ohio's was 32nd .
The researchers -- political scientists William Ruger of Texas State University and Jason Sorens of the State University of New York at Buffalo -- note that no one area of the country nor political party appears consistently to offer citizens more freedom .
Much has to do with state politics , a state 's social attitudes and ideological leanings and its institutional design .
Liberal states are more lenient on marijuana and same - sex partner laws , for example , but tougher on gun owners , home - schoolers , motorists and smokers .
Conservative states also fell in the middle of the study 's pack .
Mississippi , for example , has marijuana laws that are " a study in contradictions , " its taxes are high , and its liability system is one of the worst in the nation .
Moderate , centrist governments offer their residents the most freedoms , according to the study .
" As Americans grow richer in future years , quality of life will matter more to residence decisions , while the imperative of decent employment will decline by comparison , " they wrote .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A big new public health insurance program envisioned by President Barack Obama is shaping up as one of the most contentious issues in his drive to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system .
President Barack Obama speaks at the White House in Washington March 11 , 2009 .

The White House and congressional Democrats have not given details of any proposal .
But even before a plan emerges , some Republicans and the insurance industry are expressing concern about any new public health insurance program .
And conservative policy experts are trying to shape the debate by calling such a move a step toward “ socialized medicine . ”
Obama aims to sign a bill this year making sweeping changes in the healthcare system , which is the world ’s most expensive even as 46 million Americans have no health insurance and the United States lags other nations in important health measures , such as life expectancy and infant mortality .
Most Americans -- about 170 million -- get private health coverage through an employer , although some buy their own private insurance .
Others are eligible for public programs that offer coverage to the elderly and disabled ( Medicare ) , the poor ( Medicaid ) and low - income children ( State Children ’s Health Insurance Program ) .
But many go without coverage , paying instead out of their own pockets for care if they get sick , or trying to do without medical attention .
A new public insurance program would be intended to offer coverage to those who currently do not have it or who want an alternative to private insurance .
Obama last year proposed “ a new public plan based on benefits available to members of Congress that will allow individuals and small businesses to buy affordable health coverage . ”
It is part of an initiative to cut the number of uninsured while improving healthcare quality and controlling costs that are forecast to reach $ 2.5 trillion this year .
Leading congressional Democrats have embraced the idea but the specifics are still being worked out .
‘ TROJAN HORSE ’
“ There are , obviously , different ways of designing a public plan that would have different effects , ” White House budget director Peter Orszag told a Senate hearing this week .
Robert Moffit , a health policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank , said he believes some proponents of a new public program see it as a first step toward a full government takeover of the healthcare system .
“ It ’s a Trojan Horse for national health insurance where you basically rig the competition against private health insurance and you set up the economic incentives to encourage employers to dump people into the public plan , ” Moffit said .
Democrat Henry Waxman , who as chairman of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee will play a major role in getting legislation through Congress , envisioned “ a public plan like Medicare or some variation of it . ”
“ This system will work better if there is a public plan available as an alternative to private coverage , ” Waxman told a meeting of the American Medical Association this week .
“ Do n’t let anyone tell you that what I ’m interested in is socialized medicine .
I tell you flatly that is definitely not the case . ”
Changes in the U.S. healthcare system have been difficult to get through Congress , such as when President Bill Clinton ’s efforts failed in 1993 .
Republicans including Representative Roy Blunt , a leading House Republican voice on health care policy , have signaled that any new public insurance program will draw particular scrutiny .
Robert Zirkelbach of America ’s Health Insurance Plans said the insurance industry group has “ serious concerns ” about the impact of a new public program on private insurers .
“ We think it would be almost impossible to create a level playing field , ” he said .
An analysis by the Lewin Group , a healthcare policy consulting firm , predicts a migration of people out of private insurance if a new public plan is created .
If all businesses and individuals are able to get health insurance through the program , the plan could end up enrolling 130.5 million people , including 118.5 million people who currently have private insurance , according to the Lewin Group ’s analysis .
If only small businesses and individuals could use the program , up to 31.8 million people could leave private insurers for the public plan .
Under that scenario , the public program could have enrollment of 42.7 million people , the Lewin Group said .
There is nothing as pleasing as having a place to let loose and enjoy yourself after a long workday .
Many people actually enjoy having someplace like this than having some kind of hobby .
There are so many things and places that can be like this .
We can talk about a pub , casinos , or some other [… ]

SALT LAKE CITY -- Local health experts say potential missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints should shed a few pounds before heading to the mission field if they 're extremely overweight .
Steven Aldana , CEO of Wellsteps , spends his life speaking about the problems of obesity .
He says anyone obese , whether a missionary or not , is going to face health issues such as being sick more often .
" The obesity problem reduces productivity across the board , " he said .
Aldana says the problem gets even worse for those choosing to serve senior missions .
" About the time seniors reach retirement age is exactly the same time at which chronic diseases manifest themselves the most , " he said .
The Church declined to comment on whether they are keeping more missionary candidates home because of weight issues , but a spokesperson told us they have had a program for a long time now where severely overweight missionary candidates are encouraged to talk with their bishops about weight issues and guidelines relating to the body - mass index .
Aldana says increased health risks from obesity will affect anyone in any situation .

Turn to us in crisis , says Clegg
By Brian Wheeler
Political reporter , BBC News ,
Liberal Democrat spring conference
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Only the Lib Dems offer an alternative vision for the future of Britain post - recession , leader Nick Clegg has said .
In a closing conference speech , he said the " one dim light " in the current crisis was that it " opens the door to a genuinely new way of doing things " .
But that would not come from the " cycle of red - blue , blue - red government has got us into this mess " .
And it was the Lib Dems who now carried the " torch of progress , " he told delegates in Harrogate .
And he urged voters to make a " leap of faith " by backing the party .
Mr Clegg has used the two - day spring conference to paint Labour and the Tories as the joint architects of the economic meltdown , by their actions over the past 30 years .
And he has tried to portray his party as the one with a radically different solution to the country 's economic woes .
In his 40 minute keynote speech , Mr Clegg shunned jokes and the usual political " knockabout " and focused on help for families to beat the recession and a longer - term vision for rebuilding the economy .
" We will not promise just to rebuild what we had before .
We will promise to build it anew , and build it better , " he told delegates in Harrogate .
VAT ' pinprick '
The speech did not include any new economic policy announcements , but Mr Clegg repeated the party 's plans to scrap the £ 12.5 bn VAT cut , which he describes as a " pinprick " , and invest the cash in green initiatives he claims will create thousands of jobs .
We carry the torch of progress now , we exist to keep the flame of hope alive
Nick Clegg , Lib Dem leader Delegates :
What price a Tory deal ?
Clegg offers tea and sympathy
He also reiterated the party 's commitment to tax cuts for low and middle income workers , paid for by closing tax loopholes and changes to capital gains tax and pension relief for high earners .
He said : " Let 's change taxes so millionaires do n't pay less tax on their capital gains than their cleaner do on their income . "
He also spoke of the need to take control of the nationalised banks to get them lending again and to ensure that when they are finally returned to the private sector it is under a different system .
" I want a return to old high - street style banks so people 's savings are protected from the big risks of investment banking , " he told delegates .
He urged an end to short - term bonuses and vowed " those who are responsible for this crisis should be brought to account , " saying bankers who steered institutions to ruin should be disqualified from sitting on company boards .
' Spent match '
He rounded on the Conservatives accusing them of wanting to cut public spending which he said would be " economic madness " .
And he insisted the " flame " of progress no longer burned for Labour , and that the Lib Dems are the only party capable of rebuilding the country .
" Labour is like a spent match - there 's nothing left , " he said .
" You remember how hopeful people felt in 1997 , remember the promise of a better future ?
Do n't you feel the disappointment ?
" An economy in tatters , a country more unequal than before , an illegal war , our government implicated in torture and rendition , our environment poisoned , our privacy invaded , our freedom curtailed .
" If you believe , like I do , in progress , if you feel let down by Labour , and see that the Conservatives will never be a party of change , turn to the Liberal Democrats .
" We carry the torch of progress now , we exist to keep the flame of hope alive . "
He ended by saying : " A never - ending cycle of red- blue , blue - red government has got us into this mess - it is never going to get us out .
Try something new . "

Obama defends Bush - era secrets
President Obama ’s administration is moving aggressively to protect what the government insists are “ state secrets ” from a Bush - era wiretapping program .
Justice Department lawyers filed an emergency motion Friday with a federal appeals court in an effort to block a lower court ’s order that the government must show lawyers for the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation a copy of a document indicating that the group ’s communications were being intercepted .
The document has been the subject of a running legal battle since the papers were accidentally sent to attorneys for the group in 2004 and subsequently retrieved .

“ Disclosure of the material at issue here would cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security and result in irreparable injury to the United States , ” the Justice Department wrote .
It said information about the surveillance program is considered “ Top Secret — Sensitive Compartmented Information . ”
The government wants the wiretapping lawsuit thrown out on the basis of the state secrets privilege , but a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that the privilege is overruled by a law Congress wrote , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Attorney General Eric
Holder promised during the confirmation process to conduct a review of the Bush administration ’s frequent use of the state secrets privilege .
However , the emergency appeal in the al - Haramain case signals that Holder concluded the controversial privilege was correctly asserted there .
Earlier this month , civil libertarians were disappointed when the Justice Department stood by the “ state secrets ” tactic in opposing a suit brought by men who claim they were abducted by the Central Intelligence Agency .

The recent emergence of the 2007 report by the Red Cross confirming , in copious detail , the widespread , systematic use of criminal torture by the Bush Administration is a welcome development .
Although its facts will doubtless be drowned , or at least waterboarded , by the usual diversions -- faux shock in the Beltway over Wall Street fat cats paying themselves big bonuses with the free money that Washington knowingly gave them , for example -- it is still good to see the long - known record of this belching of filth by the nation 's leaders dragged out into the light momentarily again .
Every small nugget of truth that makes it through the heavy mesh of obfuscation that surrounds the workings of the Empire is to be lauded , hoarded and added to the fragments we have shored against our ruins .
Every piece that gets out remains out , somewhere , for someone to find again and make use of .
That 's the hope anyway , and I think it is a substantive one .
The best article so far on the Red Cross report is Mark Danner 's lengthy piece in the New York Review of Books .
Danner has been on the torture case for years , and presents an excellent history and summary of the Bush torture system , along with its craven approval by the Democratic - controlled Congress in the notorious -- and never - repealed -- Military Commissions Act of 2007 .
[ For more on this act and other authoritarian encroachments , see here , here and here . ]
Danner also lets the tortured speak for themselves , in the harrowing testimonies they gave to the Red Cross .
Danner 's entire article deserves a close reading -- but it should be remembered that while the article and the Red Cross report focus on the treatment of 14 " high - value detainees " in CIA custody , many if not most of the same torture techniques used on these " hard cases " were also employed on countless other captives swept up by the thousands in the Terror War dragnets .
Remember too that according to the Red Cross , at one time up to 70 to 90 percent of the thousands of captives held by the Americans in Iraq were innocent of any crime whatsoever .
For torture , like rain , falls on both the just and the unjust .
I was glad to see that Danner emphasizes a point that is almost always , well , obfuscated when our higher media and political types display their shock and umbrage at each new " revelation " about the torture system : the fact that the American state 's official embrace of torture was never a secret .
It was openly proclaimed , even bragged about , for years .
This is something I have been writing about for years , beginning in early 2003 , drawing on straightforward news stories published in the mainstream press .
Danner quotes two of the seminal texts of the public embrace of torture by the American establishment , a Washington Post story from December 2002 and a New York Times story from March 2003 -- stories I have referenced here and in the Moscow Times over and over .
He also notes the morally hideous piece by Jonathan Alter in November 2001 , another landmark in the American acceptance of torture .
From Danner :
And yet what is " secret " exactly ?
In our recent politics , " secret " has become an oddly complex word .
From whom was " the secret bombing of Cambodia " secret ?
Not from the Cambodians , surely .
From whom was the existence of these " secret overseas facilities " secret ?
Not from the terrorists , surely .
From Americans , presumably .
On the other hand , as early as 2002 , anyone interested could read on the front page of one of the country 's leading newspapers :
US Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations : " Stress and Duress " Tactics Used on Terrorism Suspects Held in Secret Overseas Facilities
Deep inside the forbidden zone at the US - occupied Bagram air base in Afghanistan , around the corner from the detention center and beyond the segregated clandestine military units , sits a cluster of metal shipping containers protected by a triple layer of concertina wire .
The containers hold the most valuable prizes in the war on terrorism — captured al Qaeda operatives and Taliban commanders ....
" If you do n't violate someone 's human rights some of the time , you probably are n't doing your job , " said one official who has supervised the capture and transfer of accused terrorists .
" I do n't think we want to be promoting a view of zero tolerance on this .
That was the whole problem for a long time with the CIA .... "
This lengthy article , by Dana Priest and Barton Gellman , appeared in The Washington Post on December 26 , 2002 , only months after the capture of Abu Zubaydah .
A similarly lengthy report followed a few months later on the front page of The New York Times ( " Interrogations : Questioning Terror Suspects in a Dark and Surreal World " ) .
The blithe , aggressive tone of the officials quoted — " We do n't kick the [ expletive ] out of them .
We send them to other countries so they can kick the [ expletive ] out of them " — bespeaks a very different political temper , one in which a prominent writer in a national newsmagazine could headline his weekly column " Time to Think About Torture , " noting in his subtitle that in this " new world ... survival might well require old techniques that seemed out of the question . "
As I noted in a Moscow Times piece back in March 2005 :
In the heady months after the September 11 terrorist attacks , the chickenhawks of the Bush Regime were eager to flash their tough - guy cojones to the world .
Led by the former prep-school cheerleader in the Oval Office , swaggering Bushists openly bragged of " kicking ass " with macho tactics like torture and " extraordinary rendition . "
.... In that same [ Washington Post ] article , other Bush honchos boasted about withholding medical treatment from wounded prisoners ; knowingly sending prisoners to be tortured in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Morocco and Jordan ( " I do it with my eyes open , " said one top agent ) ; and breaking international law as a routine part of interrogations by U.S. operatives .
" If you 're not violating someone 's human rights , " said an interrogation supervisor , " you 're probably not doing your job . "
These freely admitted violations included beatings , hooding , exposure , sexual humiliation and the medieval barbarism of strappado : chaining a prisoner with his arms twisted behind his back and suspending him from the ceiling , where the weight of his own body tears at his sockets and sinews .
Again , there was nothing secret about this .
Indeed , the December 2002 story was part of a series of similar admissions Bush officials cheerfully made to the mainstream press .
Beginning in October 2001 , we were told – by Bush officials – that Bush had signed " secret " executive orders granting himself the power to assassinate anyone on earth whom he arbitrarily declared a " terrorist suspect ; " that he had extended this unlimited license to kill to CIA agents in the field , who no longer needed to clear their secret murders with the White House ; and that he had expanded his unrestricted , arbitrary powers of arrest without charge , indefinite detention and extra-judicial killing to cover American citizens , as well as designated foreign " enemies . "
Thus , long before Attorney General Alberto Gonzales officially declared to Congress this year that wartime presidential powers cannot be constrained in any way by U.S. or international law , the Bush Regime was unashamedly asserting its embrace of torture , lawlessness and arbitrary rule .
Indeed , I first wrote about Bush 's assertion of his power to kill anyone on earth in November 2001 .
In another 2005 Moscow Times column , I detailed the growth of the American " Sacred Terror " regime :
On Sept. 17 , 2001 , President George W. Bush signed an executive order authorizing the use of " lethal measures " against anyone in the world whom he or his minions designated an " enemy combatant . "
This order remains in force today .
No judicial evidence , no hearing , no charges are required for these killings ; no law , no border , no oversight restrains them .
Bush has also given agents in the field carte blanche to designate " enemies " on their own initiative and kill them as they see fit .
The existence of this universal death squad -- and the total obliteration of human liberty it represents -- has not provoked so much as a crumb of controversy in the American establishment , although it 's no secret .
The executive order was first bruited in The Washington Post in October 2001 .
We first wrote of it here in November 2001 .
The New York Times added further details in December 2002 .
That same month , Bush officials made clear that the edict also applied to U.S. citizens , as The Associated Press reported .
The first officially confirmed use of this power was the killing of a U.S. citizen in Yemen by a CIA drone missile on Nov. 3 , 2002 .
A similar strike occurred in Pakistan this month , when a CIA missile destroyed a house and purportedly killed Abu Hamza Rabia , a suspected al - Qaida figure .
But the only bodies found at the site were those of two children , the houseowner 's son and nephew , Reuters reports .
The grieving father denied any connection to terrorism .
An earlier CIA strike on another house missed Rabia but killed his wife and children , Pakistani officials reported .
But most of the assassinations are carried out in secret , quietly , professionally , like a contract killing for the mob .
As a Pentagon document unearthed by The New Yorker in December 2002 put it , the death squads must be " small and agile " and " able to operate clandestinely , using a full range of official and non-official cover arrangements to ... enter countries surreptitiously . "
The dangers of this policy are obvious , as a UN report on " extrajudicial killings " noted in December 2004 : " Empowering governments to identify and kill ' known terrorists ' places no verifiable obligation upon them to demonstrate in any way that those against whom lethal force is used are indeed terrorists .
...
While it is portrayed as a limited ' exception ' to international norms , it actually creates the potential for an endless expansion of the relevant category to include any enemies of the State , social misfits , political opponents , or others . "
It 's hard to believe that any genuine democracy would accept a claim by its leader that he could have anyone killed simply by labeling them an " enemy . "
It 's hard to believe that any adult with even the slightest knowledge of history or human nature could countenance such unlimited power , knowing the evil it is bound to produce .
Yet this is what the great and good in America have done .
Like the boyars of old , they not only countenance but celebrate their enslavement to the ruler .
This was vividly demonstrated in one of the most revolting scenes in recent U.S. history : Bush 's State of the Union address in January 2003 , delivered to Congress and televised nationwide during the final frenzy of war - drum beating before the assault on Iraq .
Trumpeting his successes in the war on terror , Bush claimed that " more than 3,000 suspected terrorists " had been arrested worldwide -- " and many others have met a different fate . "
His face then took on the characteristic leer , the strange , sickly half - smile it acquires whenever he speaks of killing people : " Let 's put it this way :
They are no longer a problem . "
In other words , the suspects -- and even Bush acknowledged they were only suspects -- had been murdered .
Lynched .
Killed by agents operating unsupervised in that shadow world where intelligence , terrorism , politics , finance and organized crime meld together in one amorphous mass .
Killed on the word of a dubious informer , perhaps : a tortured captive willing to say anything , a business rival , a personal foe , a bureaucrat looking to impress his superiors , a paid snitch in need of cash , a zealous crank pursuing ethnic , tribal or religious hatreds -- or any other purveyor of the garbage data that is coin of the realm in the shadow world .
Bush proudly held up this hideous system as an example of what he called " the meaning of American justice . "
And the assembled legislators applauded .
Oh , how they applauded !
They roared with glee at the leering little man 's bloodthirsty , B - movie machismo .
They shared his contempt for law -- our only shield , however imperfect , against the blind , ignorant , ape - like force of raw power .
Not a single voice among them was raised in protest against this tyrannical machtpolitik : not that night , not the next day , not ever .
I 've still not heard any official condemnation , from either party -- and certainly not from Bush 's successor -- of this global murder ring .
Seymour Hersh has offered some tantalizing hints of more details of the operation , but he has not published them .
Danner sums up a few of the definitive statements we can now make about the torture program :
1. Beginning in the spring of 2002 the United States government began to torture prisoners .
This torture , approved by the President of the United States and monitored in its daily unfolding by senior officials , including the nation 's highest law enforcement officer , clearly violated major treaty obligations of the United States , including the Geneva Conventions and the Convention Against Torture , as well as US law .
2 . The most senior officers of the US government , President George W. Bush first among them , repeatedly and explicitly lied about this , both in reports to international institutions and directly to the public .
The President lied about it in news conferences , interviews , and , most explicitly , in speeches expressly intended to set out the administration 's policy on interrogation before the people who had elected him .
3 . The US Congress , already in possession of a great deal of information about the torture conducted by the administration — which had been covered widely in the press , and had been briefed , at least in part , from the outset to a select few of its members — passed the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 and in so doing attempted to protect those responsible from criminal penalty under the War Crimes Act .
4. Democrats , who could have filibustered the bill , declined to do so ....
And the Democrats are still providing cover for the torture system -- this time from the redoubt of the White House itself .
I noted back in 2005 that the Bush Regime was facing real danger , for the first time , over torture -- not from Congress , of course , but from the captives themselves , aided by several courageous lawyers and human rights groups like Reprieve :
.... But Bush is facing something far more dangerous than the occasional hiccup of bad PR or toothless probes by his Senate bagmen .
There are now several lawsuits afoot filed by innocent survivors of the " rendition " system set up at Bush 's direct order .
These cases could not only expose the ugly guts of his gulag , but also produce direct evidence of criminal culpability on the part of Bush and his minions under U.S. and international law .
The Regime has responded with draconian ruthlessness to this genuine threat .
In the main rendition case – and in an unrelated lawsuit concerning officially confirmed evidence of terrorist infiltration of the FBI before 9/11 – Bush is invoking the rarely - used , extraconstitutional " state secrets privilege . "
This nebulous maneuver , unanchored in law or legislation , allows the government to suppress any evidence against it merely by asserting , without proof , that disclosure of the truth might " harm national security . "
Evidence " protected " in this way cannot even be heard by a judge in secret – a well - established practice used successfully in numerous other national security cases over the years .
It is simply buried forever , and the case collapses .
As we all know , the Obama Administration is now fighting strenuously in court to uphold this cynical Bush strategy ( and others ) to cover up high crimes -- capital crimes -- by the leaders of the government .
Obama has offered the excuse that he is fighting for Bush in court because he does n't want to do anything that " would undermine or weaken the institution of the presidency . "
But how would applying the law of the land " weaken the institution of the presidency " ?
Why do the president and his minions need the " power " to commit crimes and get away with them ?
For make no mistake : in these court cases , this is precisely the " power " that Obama is seeking to preserve .
Why does he want that power , and the " state secrets " get - out - of - jail - free card that goes with it ?
The answer seems obvious : because he wants to use that power for himself , and to pass it on to subsequent managers of the empire .
For Obama is an intelligent man : he knows that the empire cannot be managed , maintained -- and expanded -- without recourse to criminal actions on a vast scale .
In 2005 , I noted :
It is almost certain that Bush 's invocation of this " night - and - fog " measure will be upheld .
So let us be clear about the consequences .
It will mean that any crime committed by a government official – torture , rendition , murder , state terrorism , even treason – can be sealed in permanent darkness .
The justice system itself will be " rendered " into a black hole .
Was this too " shrill " ?
And has n't the world been changed by the election of Barack Obama ?
Well , consider this headline from last week : Obama Justice Dept. defends Rumsfeld in torture case .
As Raw Story notes :
Language used in the brief of the individual defendants in the case , including Rumsfeld , having a " clear entitlement to qualified immunity " casts doubt on the hopes of civil and human rights activists that the Justice Department will take up calls to launch criminal prosecutions into the architects and policy designers of some of the most criticized Bush policies such as waterboarding , extraordinary rendition and warrantless wiretapping .
Or as Danner puts it :
We think time and elections will cleanse our fallen world but they will not ...
The decisions that [ President Bush ] made , especially the monumental decisions taken after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 — decisions about rendition , surveillance , interrogation — lie strewn about us still , unclaimed and unburied , like corpses freshly dead .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico will start a national register of mobile phone users that will include fingerprinting all customers in an effort to catch criminals who use the devices to extort money and negotiate kidnapping ransoms .
A person uses a mobile phone in this undated file image .
REUTERS / file
Under a new law published on Monday and due to be in force in April , mobile phone companies will have a year to build up a database of their clients , complete with fingerprints .
The idea would be to match calls and messages to the phones ’ owners .
Hundreds of people are kidnapped in Mexico every year and the number of victims is rising sharply as drug gangs , under pressure from an army crackdown , seek new income .
Lawmakers who pushed the bill through Congress last year say there are around 700 criminal bands in Mexico , some of them operating from prison cells , that use cell phones to extract extortion and kidnap ransom payments .
Most of Mexico ’s 80 million mobile phones are prepaid handsets with a given number of minutes of use that can be bought in stores without any identification .
The phones can be topped up with more minutes via vendors on street corners .
The register , detailed in the government ’s official gazette , means new subscribers will now be fingerprinted when they buy a handset or phone contract .
The plan also requires operators to store all cell phone information such as call logs , text and voice messages , for one year .
Information on users and calls will remain private and only available with court approval to track down criminals .
It was not clear whether the government would provide any funding to aid in the logistics of the register .
Billionaire Carlos Slim , who controls Mexico ’s No. 1 cell phone operator America Movil , said the law would be more useful if it tracked the movements of cell phone users .
“ What needs to be done is another type of more effective measures , ” Slim told reporters .
Former Finance Minister Francisco Gil Diaz , head of the local unit of Spain ’s Telefonica , has criticized the law , saying it will only create more bureaucracy for operators .
Telefonica is Mexico ’s No. 2 mobile operator behind America Movil .
Lawmakers say phone users must immediately report lost or loaned phones to avoid being held responsible for a handset used in a crime .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Cannabis has been used recreationally and for medicinal purposes for centuries , yet its 60 plus active components are only partly understood .
Now scientists have discovered how a compound in cannabis can help cells to function in our bodies , and aid recovery after a damaging event .
In a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience , the researchers report on their studies into cannabidiol - a naturally occurring molecule found in cannabis .
Also known as CBD , it is not the constituent that gives the high - that compound is called tetrahydrocannabinol or THC - and so may be more acceptable as a drug treatment .
Both compounds are currently used in a pharmaceutical medicine to help patients relieve pain and other symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis .
Now researchers have discovered how CBD actually works within brain cells .
By interacting with mitochondria - which are the power generators of all cells - it can help maintain normal levels of calcium allowing cells to function properly and providing a greater resistance to damage .
Disturbance of calcium levels has long been associated with a number of brain disorders .
So the finding could have implications for the development of new treatments for disorders related to malfunctioning mitochondria .
Dr Bettina Platt , from the University 's School of Medical Sciences , said : " Scientists have known for a long time that cannabidiol can help with pain relief but we never really knew how it worked .
" However we have discovered what it actually does at the cellular level .
" We are hoping that our findings can instruct the development of cannabidiol based treatments for disorders related to mitochondrial dysfunction such as Parkinson 's disease or Huntington 's disease . "
Nevertheless , Dr Platt warned that smoking cannabis would not necessarily have the same effect .
" There are different strains of cannabis out there and many no longer contain cannabidiol .
In fact , these have been deliberately bred out to enhance the THC content , " she said .
" As a result , smoking cannabis would not necessarily have the same beneficial effect , and could even exacerbate neuronal damage . "

Explore further Study : Medical marijuana associated with fewer hospitalizations for individuals with sickle cell disease
Two - thirds of patients referred for psychiatric services following an emergency room visit are likely to reach only an answering machine when they call for help , compared to about 20 percent of patients calling medical clinics with physical symptoms .
Only 10 percent of all calls to mental health clinics in nine U.S. cities resulted in an appointment scheduled within two weeks , according to a new University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine study published in Annals of Emergency Medicine .
" Our results indicate that even the most motivated patients will have difficulty obtaining timely appointments and pursuing treatment for mental health complaints , despite prior studies that fault patient non-compliance for poor follow - up rates for psychiatric conditions , " says lead author Karin V. Rhodes , MD , assistant professor of Emergency Medicine and Director of Penn 's Division of Emergency Care Policy Research .
" As we approach health care reform , we need to redouble our efforts toward improving mental health parity and design our health systems in ways that do not discourage people from getting important treatment . "
Since emergency departments are safety net providers for uninsured and underinsured patients , they are frequently the location where mental illnesses like depression - which affects 17 percent of all Americans at some point in their lives -- are first identified .
But because emergency departments are designed to treat acute illnesses and injuries and are not equipped to evaluate and care for non-emergent mental health conditions , these patients are most often referred for psychiatric care in the community .
The Penn study found , however , that mental health patients encounter many roadblocks - only voicemail on the other end of the phone , or unreasonably long waits for an appointment - when trying to access that care .
The study findings showed that even private insurance did not ensure access :
If and when a caller was able to reach clinic personnel , only 67 percent of privately - insured and 33 percent of Medicaid patients were able to make an appointment .
The Penn researchers used an " audit study " design that has previously been used to measure discrimination in other markets such as housing and employment .
In the Penn study , trained research assistants posed as patients calling to obtain an appointment after being diagnosed with depression in a local emergency room the night before and referred for urgent follow - up to the number being called .
Results from calls to a random sample of mental health clinics in nine U.S. cities revealed that callers were able to reach appointment personnel only 31 percent of the time , compared with 78 percent of calls to medical clinics for physical complaints including pneumonia , severe high blood pressure and a suspected ectopic pregnancy .
The " depressed " callers also had to make more calls overall in order to get services ; fifteen percent of successful mental health callers had to make five or more attempts before reaching clinic personnel , compared to three percent of callers with medical complaints .
When callers who reached appointment personnel could not get an appointment , due either to insurance or capacity constraints , roughly 75 percent received information about alternative providers , but only half of them were given a name and contact information for that provider .
About 14 percent were referred back to an emergency department .
Among callers who secured appointments , 61 percent had to be scheduled for during regular business hours because clinics did not offer night or weekend hours - which the authors say may pose hurdles to employed persons who seek mental health treatment .
While it is relatively inexpensive to combine resources to outsource appointment scheduling , it is likely that mental health clinics are both short staffed and lack the financial incentives required to reduce barriers to timely appointments .
The researchers say this is a troubling trend , as evidence suggests that making it easier to access depression care after an ED visit might be lifesaving .
" Our results would suggest that , for patients who are not already engaged with a mental health provider , ' usual care ' after an ED visit for depression involves leaving a message on an answering machine , " Rhodes says .
" More work is needed to assess whether depressed patients , who by definition are likely feeling hopeless and low in energy , interpret these access barriers as further evidence of their inability to function or as a rejection , and the extent to which these access barriers exacerbate depression and / or lead to suicidal thoughts . "

Much of the EU 's gas from Russia arrives via Ukraine Russia has stopped all gas supplies to Ukraine after the collapse of talks to end a row over unpaid bills and prices .
Russia 's gas giant Gazprom said it turned off the taps at 0700 GMT , when its contract to supply Ukraine ended .
Ukraine insists it has paid off its debts to Gazprom , but Russia contests this .
The two countries have also failed to agree on a price for 2009 .
The EU urged Russia and Ukraine to resume negotiations and not to let the dispute disrupt supplies to Europe .
A similar row between Gazprom and Ukraine at the beginning of 2006 led to gas shortages in several EU countries .
Pipes across Ukraine carry about a fifth of the EU 's gas needs .
Europe 's gas pipeline network

The new holders of the EU presidency , the Czech Republic , urged the parties to " rapidly reach a successful outcome " to their dispute .
" All existing commitments to supply and transit must be honoured , " it added .
Both Russia and Ukraine insist that gas supplies transported via Ukraine to the European Union will continue as normal .
By Thursday evening there were no reports in other countries of reduced supplies .
An official at Gazprom 's headquarters in Moscow said : " We have fully cut off supplies to Ukraine as of 10 am ( 0700 GMT ) today . "
" Usually we supply 390 million cubic metres per day , of which 300 million is transit gas for Europe .
Today supplies are running at 300 million cubic metres .
We continue supplying Europe in full , " Reuters quoted him as saying .
Ukraine 's state energy firm Naftogaz confirmed that supplies had dropped off steadily , and said it would start pumping gas from its reserves .
Ukraine says it has built up enough reserves to see it through the next few months .
' Eager for conflict ' Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said he was hopeful that negotiations on a new contract would be completed by 7 January , and that the sides were " close to a compromise " .
But there was no sign of similar sentiments in Moscow .
" The debt to Gazprom for gas supplied earlier was not paid .
Despite verbal statements from Kiev , Gazprom did not see any money in its account , " Gazprom 's chief executive Alexei Miller said .
They have a right to cut the supply if money is not paid .
This is the rule of the free market economy

He criticised Ukraine 's stance during the negotiations as " unconstructive " , and said Gazprom had no legal reason to continue supplying gas to Ukraine .
Mr Miller said the contract to supply gas depended on the full settlement of £ 2bn in gas bills and late - payment fines levied by Gazprom .
He also suggested that Kiev was seeking to provoke a wider dispute , saying he was " forming the impression that there are political forces in Ukraine which are very eager to see a gas conflict between our two countries " .
Gazprom 's Alexei Miller said he blamed Ukraine entirely for the situation Naftogaz said it has paid $ 1.5 bn ( £ 1 bn ) in outstanding bills to RosUkrEnergo - a Switzerland - registered gas trading company which is acting as an intermediary - but not the fines imposed by Gazprom .
Gazprom is the world 's largest gas producer and supplies a quarter of the European Union 's gas needs - and 42 % of its imports .
Most of that is transported via Ukraine .
Russia 's Vladimir Putin had earlier warned Ukraine not to disrupt the transit of gas to Europe .
He warned of " very severe consequences " for Ukraine in terms of its relations with both Russia and European countries .
Mr Putin said Gazprom had been generous in offering Ukraine a price of $ 250 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas in 2009 , given that the price in Europe was currently more than $ 500 .
He said he understood that Ukraine was in " a difficult economic situation " which was worse than Russia 's , but put the dispute down to a " war of the clans " between the Ukrainian Prime Minister , Yulia Tymoshenko , and President Viktor Yushchenko .

Caroline Kisko , Kennel Club spokeswoman , said : " The Kennel Club has never doubted the place that pedigree dogs have within the hearts of so many people across the country , and these figures bear out our unwavering faith and loyalty toward man 's best friend , just as they display their endless faith and loyalty towards us .

A DEPRESSING little anecdote from Chris Bodenner :
I stood with mostly African - Americans during the speech and the only time I ever heard booing of Obama , from many directions , was his shout - out to " non-believers . "
Goodness .
If you consider them a coherent group ( and there are arguments for and against doing this , but take it for the sake of argument ) , non-believers are easily the most underrepresented religious group in American political life .
A survey from 2001 ( discussed here ) found 30 m Americans claiming " no religion " .
About 10 % of the population ( almost certainly more now ) , yet there has not only never been an unbelieving president .
There is one congressman ( Pete Stark of California ) out of 535 willing to publicly declare his non-belief in God .
So , if you 're counting , that 's 10 % of the population with .2 % of the power .
Compare Mormons ( 1.7 % of the population , 2.6 % of Congress ) or Jews ( 1.7 % of the population , 8.4 % of Congress ) , according to this .
There are even two Buddhists , two Muslims and a Quaker .
And blacks booed Mr Obama 's call for respect of non-believers ?
It recalls ( alas ) black support for Proposition 8 in California .
A group with such vivid and recent memories of persecution should , in a better world , have more sympathy for ( if not always agreement with ) other minorities just trying to rub along the best they can in America .
Yes , it does taste better if you drag it away from the bowl .
And , no , I do n't know why .

A research team at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has uncovered a vast new class of previously unrecognized mammalian genes that do not encode proteins , but instead function as long RNA molecules .
Their findings , presented in the February 1st advance online issue of the journal Nature , demonstrate that this novel class of " large intervening non-coding RNAs " or " lincRNAs " plays critical roles in both health and disease , including cancer , immune signaling and stem cell biology .
" We 've known that the human genome still has many tricks up its sleeve , " said Eric Lander , founding director of the Broad Institute and co-senior author of the Nature paper .
" But , it is astounding to realize that there is a huge class of RNA - based genes that we have almost entirely missed until now . "
Standard " textbook " genes encode RNAs that are translated into proteins , and mammalian genomes harbor about 20,000 such protein - coding genes .
Some genes , however , encode functional RNAs that are never translated into proteins .
These include a handful of classical examples known for decades and some recently discovered classes of tiny RNAs , such as microRNAs .
By contrast , the newly discovered lincRNAs are thousands of bases long .
Because only about ten examples of functional lincRNAs were known previously , they seemed more like genomic oddities than critical components .
The new Nature study shows that there are actually thousands of such genes and that they have been conserved across mammalian evolution .
" The challenge in finding these lincRNAs is that they have been hiding in plain sight , " said John Rinn , a Harvard Medical School assistant professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT .
" The human and mouse genomes are already known to produce many large RNA molecules , but the vast majority show no evolutionary conservation across species , suggesting that they may simply be ' genomic noise ' without any biological function . "
To uncover this large collection of new genes , the Broad scientific team looked not at the RNA molecules themselves but at telltale signs in the DNA called chromatin modifications or epigenomic marks .
They searched for genomic regions that have the same chromatin patterns as protein - coding genes , but do not encode proteins .
By surveying the genomes of four different types of mouse cells ( including embryonic stem cells and cells from various tissue types ) , they found an astounding 1,586 such loci that had not been previously described .
The researchers also found that the vast majority of these genomic regions are transcribed into lincRNAs , and that these are conserved across mammals .
" The epigenomic marks revealed where these genes were hiding , " said Mitch Guttman , a MIT graduate student working at the Broad Institute .
" Analysis of their sequence then revealed that the genes are highly conserved in mammalian genomes , which strongly suggested that these genes play critical biological functions . "
By correlating the expression patterns of lincRNAs in various cell types with the expression patterns of known critical protein - coding genes in those same cells , the scientists observed that lincRNAs likely play critical roles in helping to regulate a variety of different cellular processes , including cell proliferation , immune surveillance , maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency , neuronal and muscle development , and gametogenesis .
Further experimental evidence from several of the identified lincRNAs verified these observations .
Because of the stringent experimental conditions imposed by the researchers in identifying the 1,600 lincRNAs in the Nature study , it is likely that there are many more lincRNA genes hiding in plain sight in the genome , as well as other RNA - encoding genes that are as important to genome function as their better - recognized protein - coding counterparts .

I want to play poker with Harry Reid .
Really I do .
Rather than call for a special election in Illinois to fill Barack Obama 's vacant Senate seat , Reid sends a letter to Blago signed by everyone in the Democratic caucus asking him to step down .
They assert that they will not seat anyone he appoints .
Harumph .
Blago wipes his ass with it and appoints Burris anyway .
Burris holds a press conference and announces he will be in D.C. on Tuesday to be sworn in with the rest of the Senate .
Bobby Rush plays the race card .
Reid does not see the handwriting on the wall .
He counters by calling Secretary of State Jesse White , who has already said he wo n't sign Burris 's certification , and encourages him .
What White is doing is most certainly outside his legal authority -- the Secretary of State does n't have veto power .
But Reid not only gives
White a high five , he tells him they 'll use this to keep Burris from being seated .
Then he smugly chortles about how he 'll manipulate Senate procedure and punt to the Rules Committee , and assures everyone that they will drag things out for months if necessary until Blago is impeached and his successor appoints someone else .
And he does it in the press .
Upon reading this , Cornyn announces that Franken wo n't have a signed certification either , and the GOP will use it to keep him from being seated ,
Reuters : " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid yielded to Republican threats and agreed on Monday not to immediately seat fellow Democrat Al Franken . "
Blago laughs out loud .
This is amateur night in Dixieland .
He leaks to the press that he spoke with Reid before the election , and that Reid did n't think any of the African American candidates vying for the seat were " electable , " while Tammy Duckworth was .
He stirs up the potential jury pool and makes Reid look like an idiot -- the day before Reid is set to appear on Meet the Press .
Reid looks like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs on Meet the Press .
Nobody knows how much Fitz has ( not even Fitz , who is still trying to transcribe his tapes ) or how much he 'll need to reveal to prove his case , so Reid says he " does n't remember " his conversation with Blago , but calls Blago a liar anyway .
When asked if he supported JJJ for the Senate seat , he says he would support JJJ .
And admits that there 's " room to negotiate " on Burris .
Burris appears at the Senate on Tuesday .
Gets turned away .
Could Reid look any worse ?
Yes !
Obama stares down DiFi , appoints Panetta to the CIA , and the NYT breaks the story before she 's told ( but Ron Wyden already knows ) .
DiFi 's fuming .
Despite having been one of the 50 Senators who signed Reid 's letter saying Burris would never be seated , she announces that as the outgoing head of the Rules Committee she thinks the Senate has no choice but to seat him .
( Good timing , because Charlie Rangel is already complaining about the Rules Committee dragging its feet . )
Reid can't hold his own caucus in line .
Blames Rahm .
Gives interview saying " I do n't work for Barack Obama . "
Smooth .
WaPo : " Burris Backs Reid Into a Corner . "
A seventy - one year old dude who has n't held office for 14 years , appointed by a crook , takes the Senate Majority Leader to the cleaners .
Reid is a red state senator , up for re-election in 2010 and under pressure from the right , who is already making noise about appeasing Republicans who are n't going to be appeased .
He 's a hazard to Obama 's agenda , which is why leading Senate Democrats tried to ease him out as Majority Leader last year .
See : Daschle , Tom .
Burris will be seated .
He 's not gonna deal .
Why should he ?
He 's playing poker with Harry Reid .
We all have those moments when talk turns to seminal artists .
" Hey , what do you think of Bruce Springsteen 's new one ? " or " I do n't know , man .
I kind of like Joni Mitchell 's ' Blue ' better than ' Court and Spark . ' "
How mortifying , then , when you have to confess : I do n't like those icons .
You know you 're supposed to - judging from the mouths gaping in disbelief - but you simply do n't .
Sure , you can acknowledge and even appreciate an artist 's brilliance and vast influence .
Bob Dylan is the granddaddy of modern songwriting , but that does n't mean you want to hear his grizzled croak while curled up by the fire .
Led Zeppelin are rock gods , but for naysayers , " Stairway to Heaven " is more like a descent into hell .
At the risk of losing the respect of friends and family - and critical credibility , while we 're at it - our music writers have decided to reveal the sacred cows we 're not afraid to tip .
But really , Mike , you do n't like the Beatles ?
That 's just shameful .
-- James Reed
The California Supreme Court today appeared inclined to uphold Proposition 8 , but showed obvious reluctance to void thousands of same - sex marriages already in place when voters restored a ban on gay marriage last fall .
During three hours of arguments in San Francisco , the justices peppered lawyers opposing Proposition 8 with questions that suggested they do not believe they have the authority to trump the will of the voters .
At the same time , even justices who voted against striking down California ’s previous ban on gay marriage indicated that Proposition 8 should not wipe out an estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages that took place last year .
Those couples mobilized around the state to obtain marriage licenses after the Supreme Court ruled last May that California ’s prior ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional .
“ Is that really fair to people who depended on what this court said was the law ? ” Justice Ming Chin asked Ken Starr , the former Clinton impeachment prosecutor who argued that same - sex marriages should n’t be recognized under Proposition 8 .
The justices are considering a high stakes legal challenge to the validity of the measure , which was approved by voters last fall and restored California ’s ban on gay marriage .
The ballot measure , enacted by a 52 to 48 percent vote , erased last May ’s historic state Supreme Court ruling finding California ’s prior ban on same - sex marriage unconstitutional because it deprived gay couples of the equal right to wed .
Proposition 8 amended the California Constitution to confine marriage to heterosexual couples , and its backers insist that the Supreme Court cannot overturn the will of the voters if they choose to change the state constitution .
During today ’s arguments , the majority of the court remarked that the current case is very different than last year ’s , primarily because the voters amended the constitution the court is bound to follow .
“ I stand by what I said in the marriage cases , ” Justice Joyce Kennard , a key vote in legalizing gay marriage last year , said at one point .
“ But this case is different .
We ’re dealing with the power of the people . ”
Justice Carol Corrigan , who dissented in last year ’s decision , remained reluctant to interfere with voters and legislators .
“ Is the essence of your argument that the people have the right to amend their constitution as long as it is n’t done in a way the Supreme Court does n’t like ? ” Corrigan asked one civil rights lawyer .
Civil rights groups , same - sex couples and a number of local governments , including Santa Clara County and San Francisco , sued to block enforcement of Proposition 8 , arguing that it was an improper method of amending the constitution and targets a minority group by depriving gay couples of the right to marry .
Attorney General Jerry Brown also has refused to defend the law , saying it is unconstitutional and conflicts with last year ’s state Supreme Court ruling .
Christoper Krueger , the senior deputy assistant attorney general who argued for Brown , had the roughest ride during arguments , as all of the justices appeared poised to reject his argument that last year ’s ruling created an “ inalienable right ” for same - sex couples to wed .
“ What I ’m picking up from the argument is that the court should willy , nilly disregard the will of the people , ” Kennard told him .
“ As judges , our powers are limited . ”
If the court upholds Proposition 8 , the justices must still determine whether existing gay marriages are valid across the state .
On that point , even Starr , now dean of the Pepperdine University law school , found himself on the defensive , particularly from Chin and Corrigan , two justices who voted against legalizing gay marriage in the prior case .
When Starr tried to maintain the measure had to be read as voiding the marriages , Corrigan shot back , “ But this court had said “ this is the law in California . ”
The justices agreed to review the case in November , producing an avalanche of legal arguments from all sides of the gay marriage debate .
The Supreme Court now has 90 days to rule in the case , ensuring the fate of Proposition 8 will be determined before summer begins .
The Supreme Court was divided 4 - 3 in last year ’s ruling , and gay marriage opponents have vowed a political campaign against justices who vote to overturn the ban on same - sex marriage , adding to the intrigue surrounding the high court ’s handling of the controversial issue .
Chief Justice Ronald George , who wrote last year ’s majority opinion , told a gathering of reporters in December that he ignores such political considerations when he ’s deciding a hot - button case .
George was joined in the prior ruling by Justices Joyce Kennard , Carlos Moreno and Kathryn Mickle Werdegar .
Justices Marvin Baxter , Ming Chin and Carol Corrigan dissented in that case , saying it is up to voters and legislators , not the courts , to change laws governing same - sex marriage .

One thing that continually frustrates me when working with dedicated test teams is that , well , they find too many bugs .
Do n't get me wrong .
I want to be the first person to know about any bug that results in inconvenience for a user .
But how do you distinguish between bugs that users are likely to encounter , and bugs that users will probably never see ?
The first thing you do is take that list of bugs from the testers and have yourself a triage meeting :
The term " triage " was borrowed from medical triage where a doctor or nurse has to prioritize care for a large group of injured people .
The main job of a software bug triage team is to decide which bugs need to be fixed ( or conversely , which bugs we 're willing to ship with ) .
Eric lists four questions that need to be answered during triage to decide whether a bug should be fixed or not :
Severity :
When this bug happens , how bad is the impact ?
Frequency : How often does this bug happen ?
Cost :
How much effort would be required to fix this bug ?
Risk :
What is the risk of fixing this bug ?
Triage is n't exactly my idea of a good time .
But you have to do it , because you 'll always have far more bugs than you have development time .
Nobody has the luxury of fixing all the bugs in their software .
Testers produce two kinds of bugs :
A small subset of very serious bugs that everyone can immediately agree on .
These are great .
They 're the kind of catches that make me thank my lucky stars that we have dedicated testers .
You go , girl - slash - boy !
Everything else .
A vast , gray wasteland of pseudo - bugs that nobody can really agree on .
Is it an inconvenience for the user ?
Would users really do things this way ?
Would a user ever run into this ?
Do we even care ?
It 's a clear win for the bugs everyone agrees on .
That 's usually about ten to twenty percent of the bug list in my experience .
But for everything else , there 's a serious problem : testers are n't real users .
I 'd give a bug from a customer ten times the weight of a bug reported by a tester .
The source of the bug is just one factor to consider .
Bug triage is n't a science .
It 's highly subjective and totally dependent on the specifics of your application .
In Bugs Are a Business Decision , Jan Goyvaerts describes how different triage can be for applications at each end of that spectrum :
Last July I flew to Denver to attend the Shareware Industry Conference .
I flew the leg from Taipei to Los Angeles on a Boeing 747 operated by China Airlines .
This aircraft has two major software systems on board : the avionics software ( flight computer ) , and the in - flight entertainment system .
These two systems are completely independent of each other , developed by different companies , to different standards .
The avionics software is the software that flies the plane .
No , the pilots do n't fly the plane , the flight computer does .
How many bugs would you tolerate in the avionics software ?
How many do you think Boeing left unfixed ?
How many people have ever been killed by software bugs in modern airliners ?
Zero .
A flawed flight computer would immediately ground all 747s worldwide .
Boeing would not recover .
The in - flight entertainment system is a completely different story .
It 's not essential to the plane .
It only serves to make the passengers forget how uncomfortable those economy seats really are .
If the entertainment system barfs all over itself , the cost is minimal .
Passengers are already out of their money , and most will choose their next flight based on price and schedule rather than which movies are on those tiny screens , if any .
I was actually quite pleased with Chine Airlines ' system , which offered economy passengers individual screens and a choice of a dozen or so on - demand movies ( i.e. each passenger can start viewing any movie at any time , and even pause and rewind ) .
That is , until the system started acting up .
It locked up a few times causing everybody 's movie to pause for several minutes .
Once , the crew had to reboot the whole thing .
That silly Linux penguin mocked me for several minutes while the boot messages crept by .
X11 showed off its X - shaped cursor right in the middle of the screen even longer .
Judging from the crew 's attitude about it , the reboot seemed like something that 's part of their training .
Bugs also cost money to fix .
In My Life as a Code Economist , Eric Sink outlines all the decisions that go into whether or not a bug gets fixed at his company :
Do n't we all start out with the belief that software only gets better as we work on it ?
The fact that we need regression testing is somehow like evidence that there is something wrong with the world .
After all , it 's not like anybody on our team is intentionally creating new bugs .
We 're just trying to make sure our product gets better every day , and yet , somewhere between 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 , we made it worse .
But that 's just the way it is .
Every code change is a risk .
A development cycle that does n't recognize this will churn indefinitely and never create a shippable product .
At some point , if the product is ever going to converge toward a release , you have to start deciding which bugs are n't going to get fixed .
To put it another way , think about what you want to say to yourself when look in the mirror just after your product is released .
The people in group 2 want to look in the mirror and say this : " Our bug database has ZERO open items .
We did n't defer a single bug .
We fixed them all .
After every bug fix , we regression tested the entire product , with 100 % code coverage .
Our product is perfect , absolutely flawless and above any criticism whatsoever . "
The group 1 person wants to look in the mirror and say this : " Our bug database has lots of open items .
We have carefully reviewed every one of them and consider each one to be acceptable .
In other words , most of them should probably not even be called bugs .
We are not ashamed of this list of open items .
On the contrary , we draw confidence from this list because we are shipping a product with a quality level that is well known .
There will be no surprises and no mulligans .
We admit that our product would be even better if all of these items were " fixed " , but fixing them would risk introducing new bugs .
We would essentially be exchanging these bugs which we find acceptable for the possibility of newly introduced bugs which might be showstoppers . "
I 'm not talking about shipping crappy products .
I 'm not suggesting that anybody ship products of low quality .
I 'm suggesting that decisions about software quality can be tough and subtle , and we need to be really smart about how to make those decisions .
Sometimes a " bug " should not be fixed .
To me , triage is about one thing : making life better for your users .
And the best way to do that is to base your triage decisions on data from actual usage -- via exception reporting , user feedback , and beta testing .
Otherwise , triage is just a bunch of developers and testers in a room , trying to guess what users might do .
