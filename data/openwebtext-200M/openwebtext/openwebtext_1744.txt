Though the pop culture juggernaut that is “ Lost ” is about to end , Javier Grillo - Marxuach — an Ann Arbor native ( and Huron High School grad ) who ’s now an established television writer / producer — was with the show when it was just being born .
( Consider this a flashback , “ Lost ” fans .
You ’re accustomed to those , right ? )

Grillo - Marxuach was part of “ Lost ” ’s writers ’ room during the show ’s first two seasons — a breakthrough gig that came on the heels of his previous work on “ Seaquest , ” “ The Pretender , ” “ Charmed , ” and “ Boomtown , ” among others .
And while he ’s now working on feature film and comic book projects , as well as a pilot for what he calls a “ political - based sci- fi action piece ” for ABC , he took time to answer questions about the role he played in the genesis of “ Lost , ” a series about plane - crash survivors on a mysterious island — Â and a whole lot more .
Q : How did you initially get involved with “ Lost ” ?
A : I was working on a ( UPN ) TV show called “ Jake 2.0 . ”
The show was on on Wednesdays , and they pre-empted us one night ( in February ) and showed a rerun of “ America ’s ( Next ) Top Model ” in our place , and that show did twice our rating .
So we were canceled the next day , without any further ado , and I found myself free .
My agent called and said , “ The agency has this weird project with ( “ Felicity ” and “ Alias ” writer / producer ) J.J. Abrams .
They have an outline .
They do n’t have script yet , but basically it ’s been green - lit to film off the outline . ”
And I remember thinking , “ Well , good luck . ”
It sounded pretty like it was going to be a real struggle to get this thing made in time for May , for when they select the pilots that are going to get on the air for fall .
But the proposal was that , for one , the pilot was very expensive , very big , and it had a lot of mythology and all that , and I have a reputation as somebody who ’s really good with science fiction mythologies and world - building .
And basically , the pitch to me was , they want to get a small room of maybe three or four writers to come in and help develop the mythology of the show .
For the next three months , me and a couple of other writers , Paul Dini , Christian Taylor and Jennifer Johnson would just brainstorm ideas for what the show could be , and who the characters could be , as they were being cast .

Q : “ Lost ” premiered when networks were moving away from scripted dramas and toward cheap - to - produce reality shows ( and even by scripted - show standards , “ Lost ” is hugely expensive , with its large cast filming episodes in Hawaii ) .
Why do you think ABC was willing to see this through ?
A : You ca n’t underestimate the power of J.J. Abrams .
He did “ Alias ” for the network , he is somebody who is rightfully perceived as being a miracle worker .
ABC had been trying to develop a show about castaways on a deserted island for a while .
They had actually developed a script with a writer named Jeff Lieber , and for whatever reason , they had parted ways on the script .
So they brought the idea to J.J .
They generally felt like J.J. could take them to the Promised Land on this idea , and that really was the thing that sold it .
And frankly , Damon ( Lindelof ) and J.J. together created — for a pilot to be green - lit from an outline is extremely unusual .
And that was just one of those things where the document they wrote was just spectacular .
Honestly , it was a pretty unusual set of circumstances that brought them to it , and it was one of those things where , all of the elements came together in a very fast and very , almost incredible way .
Q : The show ’s DHARMA Initiative ( a fictional research project tied to many happenings on the island ) had its headquarters in Ann Arbor .
I presume your presence in the writers ’ room is the reason for this ?
A : Actually , yes .
I try to put Ann Arbor in as many things that I work on as I can .
When you ’re in the writer ’s room , everybody contributes ideas .
And that was one of these things where I just thought , “ Ah , that would be cool ! ” I love Ann Arbor , I ’ve always been a booster , and I try to pay homage to my hometown whenever I can .
Watch a " documentary " about the DHARMA Initiative on ABC's " Lost " website .
Q : What led to you leaving the show after the second season ?
A : The show was maturing , and the makeup of the writers ’ room of the show was changing .
In its first year , it was about finding the right blend of voices and writers and people .
I had given a lot to the show , and the show had given a lot back .
And it was one of those things where I just realized that , in terms of what I could contribute to the show , I ’d kind of gotten to the end of my usefulness .
The show was going in different directions creatively , and we parted ways quite amicably .
I continued to be involved in creating The Lost Experience , which is this online and offline alternative reality game that established a lot of the mythology of the show , and I went off to write about a psychic soccer mom ( “ Medium ” ) .
TV writing is an extremely nomadic trade .
Q : What do you think about “ Lost ” ’s direction as a show since you left ?
A : The God ’s honest truth is I really have n’t kept up with the show since I left .
I ’m still very good friends with the writers of the show and with Damon , and I think that “ Lost ” is a massive animal that chews through story .
But I think that when we started on the show , J.J. and Damon knew how they wanted the show to go , and we really worked very hard to create the underpinnings of that .
But when you ’re staring down the barrel of 16 hours of narrative storytelling year after year , you ’re really talking about a huge amount of story .
And one of the things that happens with TV shows is that they evolve organically into the needs of the story you ’re trying to tell , and the characters take on lives of their own , and you realize that you have to take detours and you have to generate new conceptual material to support this block of time that you ’ve got to tell the story .
So I think about the direction they ’ve gone in terms of time travel , and the flash forward , and the flash sideways — I think that it ’s a case of a show knowing where it wants to go and having to develop narrative devices to get there .
But in terms of , how do I feel about where the show has gone , I think that anybody who manages to successfully put together a serialized narrative of sustained quality the way that ‘ Lost ’ has — it ’s an incredible accomplishment .
Q : Did you have a favorite character ?
A : I think that the character that I became most identified with as a creator on the show was Sun , because I wrote her origin episode , and I really was attached to ( Jin and Sun ’s ) mythology and their story .
It was a weird thing , because when I was given the assignment of writing their origin , I was like , “ What do I know about a Korean couple and their culture ?
I ’m a Puerto Rican immigrant to the United States . ”
And then I started thinking , “ Wow , a Puerto Rican immigrant to the United States . ”
My English was n’t all that great ( when I arrived ) .
It was hard for me to be understood , and I said , “ You know what ?
I absolutely know what this guy ( Jin ) is going through . ”
And really , Jin kind of became a kind of totem for my own childhood struggles as a non-native child trying to be understood in Ann Arbor , Michigan .
And I think ( the “ All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues ” episode , which Grillo - Marxuach wrote ) is a high - water mark for me personally as a writer in that it ’s tremendously emotional .
Jack ’s story with his father was something that I created as well .
Daniel Dae Kim , who plays Jin , comments on the current season :
Q : How much of the endgame that ’s now being played out was planned from the outset ?
A : My prediction is that it will be — as narratives grow in size and complexity , they develop unique needs .
I can only make the assumption that the final conclusion of the series will bear some resemblance to what we discussed so early on , because so much of it was integral to Damon ’s own conception of the series .
But after six years , those evolve and change .
If you come up with a single answer one day and say , “ I ’m going to write six years ’ worth of narrative storytelling to support this one idea that I had , ” I do n’t think that ’s necessarily a good thing .
I think a lot of TV writing is about respecting the evolutionary process of creation .
Q : How much of “ Lost ” ’s story arc was worked out in the early days ?
A : We needed to create things we could sustain for either a very short run or a long run .
That ’s the uncertainty whenever you work in television .
Before ‘ Lost ’ got picked up , and certainly before it became this huge hit , people were saying , “ Well , what can you do ?
Can you wrap it up in 13 episodes ?
Can you wrap it up in one more hour ?
Can you make it a mini-series ? ”
So we were just trying to create things that had huge wide open spaces that we could fill for as long as the network gods would let us .
Q : What was the earliest indication to you that the show was going to be a hit ?
A : The first indication that I personally got was , we took the show to the San Diego Comic Con , partially because of J.J. ’s imprimateur , partly because already such a buzz had been building up .
We played the first hour of the pilot in the biggest room in the venue , and we filled it .
Part of that was Dominic Monaghan ( Charlie ) , to be honest with you , who had just been in the ‘ Lord of the Rings ’ movies and was very popular with fans .
So it was this weird gathering of Ringheads and J.J. Heads — it played to about 3,000 people all together .
And it just went like gangbusters .
You could feel that electricity in the audience .
That opening sequence of the plane crash is so powerful and so strong and so visceral , that , just watching how people responded to that , you just knew that you ’d caught lightning in a bottle .
Frankly , that was the big anxiety , but also the big motivator in the writers ’ room the entire first season .
We had this incredible pilot , and we knew that every episode after it had to live up to it , and there was a lot of anxiety about that .
But what it did for that writers ’ room is that it created this real sense of , we just have to come in and swing for the fences .
And we had this thing that we said a lot , which was that the show should jump the shark every episode .
Basically , we should just come up with the wildest , most out there stuff for the show episodically and not be afraid that people would say we were jumping the shark .
Q : “ Lost ” is a show of mysteries , and the fans parse every detail .
Do the writers always know what everything is , and what it means , before throwing it into a storyline ?
Or do they allow themselves room for discovery as they go ?
A : To be honest , there ’s a little bit of both .
Damon was very rigorous , especially at the beginning , about saying , “ We will not put anything on the screen that we do n’t know what it is , ” because we were beginning to realize just how rabid our fan following was .
We had a continuity czar whose job is keeping track of everything .
But at the same time , you drop little things that become useful later on .
You do n’t even think about them , and then , you think , “ Oh , God , we just did this in episode 3 ; let ’s bring it back in episode 8 . ”
So again , it ’s a combination of evolution and intuition and pre-planning .
Last week 's episode , " Across The Sea , " revealed Jacob and his twin brother 's origins .

Q : Tons of shows try to establish a narratively seductive mystique , but “ Lost ” really broke through to the mainstream in a huge way .
Why do you think that happened ?
A : I do n’t think that there ’s as good a cast on television as “ Lost ” ’s cast .
So there ’s that .
I think that Damon certainly put together an amazing room of writers , and has consistently over the years .
But there ’s also this tangible X factor that you ca n’t quantify .
I think that , had ABC not already tried and not been satisfied with the other version of this show ; had J.J. Abrams not been free at that particular moment ; had Damon Lindelof not been available to come in and work with J.J. on the pilot ; had they not green - lit it at such a weird time , when there could n’t be as much meddling with it as there might have been ; had it not been made in such a rush ; you start looking at all of these things , and there ’s an alchemy that happens .
Damon ’s own preoccupation with issues of parents and their children informed the show tremendously ; and there are two things about the show that I think give it that amazing amount of resonance .
One of them is it asks questions that I think everyone asks themselves .
What if I got stuck on a desert island ?
What would I do with myself ?
Would it be “ Lord of the Flies ” ?
I think that ’s a timeless question , and it ’s a fundamental question .
What would I do if I was isolated with a representative sample of humanity ?
But also , I feel the show was very profoundly concerned with issues of personality , issues of family , issues of , who am I ?
And where am I going ?
And am I everything I can be ?
And have I done enough with my life ?
These characters are really trying to figure themselves out , and the island ’s a crucible for that .
The final regular episode of " Lost " airs at 9 tonight on ABC .
A series retrospective airs from 7 - 9 p.m. Sunday , and the two - and - a - half hour series finale follows from 9- 11:30 p.m. Sunday .

The Free Gaza Movement , the group behind the Gaza aid flotilla , is a broad coalition of human rights activists and pro-Palestinian groups that has been trying to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza since 2008 .
It is a registered charity based in Cyprus and is endorsed by international figures , including South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire .
But in recent years Israeli intelligence agencies say it has grown to include dangerous Islamic organisations with terrorist links .
The six - ship flotilla was carrying 10,000 tonnes of medicine , construction materials and education supplies - the movement 's largest operation to date .
There were more than 650 passengers , among them representatives of the Malaysian - based Perdana Global Peace Organisation , the Greece and Sweden - based Ship to Gaza group , and the large Turkish charity , IHH .
The organisers are well known for their ties with global Jihad , al - Qaeda and Hamas .
They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror Daniel Ayalon , Israeli deputy foreign minister
The Mavi Marmara , the lead ship stormed by Israeli troops , was operated by IHH , a group banned by Israel in 2008 .
IHH raises some of its money from Islamic religious groups and has strong sympathy among Turkey 's Islamist - rooted ruling party .
IHH , founded in 1992 , is now active in 120 countries and has been present in recent disaster areas including Haiti .
The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center ( ITIC ) - an Israel - based non-governmental organisation which has close ties to the Israeli Defense Forces - does not dispute the organisation 's legitimate philanthropic activities .
But the ITIC says the Turkish charity is an overt supporter of Hamas - an Islamic militant group that seized power in Gaza in 2007 , and is branded by Israel , the EU and US as a " terrorist organisation " .
The ITIC says it also has evidence the IHH has helped provide weapons and funds for " Islamic terrorist elements in the Middle East " .
But Greta Berlin , a director of the Free Gaza Movement , said the claim that IHH has links to radical Islamist groups was " utterly scurrilous " .
She said those on board the Mavi Marmara were unarmed civilians trying to get aid to Gaza .
She told the BBC News website that the Israelis acted illegally in international waters and now " they are trying to blacken the reputations of all of us " .
Permanent sea lane
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon described the Free Gaza Movement mission as an " outrageous provocation " .
" The organisers are well - known for their ties with global Jihad , al - Qaeda and Hamas , " said Mr Ayalon .
" They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror . "
He said weapons were found onboard and used against the soldiers .
Israel insists its commandos acted in self - defence , while enforcing a legal blockade of Gaza .
The Free Gaza Movement states its mission is " to overcome this brutal siege through civil resistance and non-violent direct action , and establish a permanent sea lane between Gaza and the rest of the world " .
It attempted to make its first deliveries to Gaza in summer 2008 , and tried again in 2009 .
The earliest aid deliveries were allowed to reach Gaza but later attempts were intercepted .
Despite the deadly consequences of its latest aid mission , the Free Gaza Movement says it is already considering sending " a second wave " of boats to Gaza .
Press Communication ( 15 June 2010 ) European Federation of Public Service Unions ( EPSU ) says the austerity packages imposed by many countries around Europe will have a serious impact on the prospects for economic recovery .
EPSU sends this message to the European Council meeting on 17 June .
Carola Fischbach - Pyttel , the EPSU General Secretary :
As governments swing the austerity axe they risk chopping off any green shoots of recovery , leaving workers , pensioners and communities to face the prospect of an even longer recession .
We demand plans focused on investment in public services and infrastructure , on green growth and job creation and on addressing poverty and inequality . -
The Federation is the European umbrella of 250 unions which organizes nurses , tax - collectors , labour inspectors , port control authorities , custom officers , teachers , civil servants , fire - fighters , police , elderly and childcare workers , cleaners , librarians , utility workers , prison guards , ambulance drivers and many hundreds of other public service occupations .-
Most workers are on low - or middle incomes and now see their purchasing power reduced by pay freezes and pay cuts ( see overview ) . -
Governments are cutting public service jobs or freezing or cutting recruitment .
Our estimate is that employment will be reduced by close to 200,000 in 2 - 3 years time .
First estimates show the cuts in public spending to be more than 200 bn Euros ( see overview ) .
This is more than the combined annual public expenditure of Hungary , Romania and Portugal .
EPSU underlines the cuts will :- Create more stress for the remaining and overstretched staff in hospital , schools , prisons elderly homes , regulatory agencies and more . -
Reduce the quality of public services - less care for the sick , the old , the dying ; fewer chances for the poor and vulnerable . -
Undermine the enforcement of laws and regulations , so letting off the hook polluting corporations and employers that that violate health and safety and other labour laws and evade taxes . -
Have a knock - on effect on non-EU countries that see their export markets effected and on developing countries as aid budgets are reduced .
EPSU , with over 8 million members , is building for the ETUC day of action on 29 September .
Ten of thousands will march on Brussels to show their anger over the coordinated European cuts strategy that is hitting working men and women but leaving the wealthy , speculators and large corporations untouched .

Press release ( different languages ) - Overview - Briefings / Background
TORONTO - A man denied bail in a case related to G20 security is becoming the subject of an international campaign to have him freed .
Byron Sonne was arrested on June 22 , just days before world leaders descended on Toronto for the G20 summit .
He faces charges of possession of explosives , weapons dangerous , intimidation of a justice system participant and mischief .
Tuesday 's news that Sonne -- an independent Internet security expert -- was denied bail seems to have strengthened the resolve of the " Free Byron " movement .
" Now that we 're looking at a few years of pretrial custody , this is something that 's taking off quite rapidly , " said James Arlen , a security consultant in Toronto and a longtime friend of Sonne's .
Arlen is in the process of revising five talks he 'll be giving at an upcoming hackers ' conference to include a plea for help for supporters of Sonne who want to see him released .
DEFCON is a premier hackers ' event held in Las Vegas and attended by 5,000 to 7,000 people .
Sonne had attended in the past .
" There are a few of us who are in positions where we get to stand up in front of crowds of people and talk and we 're going to be talking about this , " Arlen said .
" You 're going to have a hard time finding a Byron supporter who is n't wearing a Free Byron T - shirt ... and Free Byron stickers are going to be flowing like water . "
" Everybody is going to be talking about this . "
The details of the evidence presented in court are covered by a publication ban .
But friends and former co-workers have said they think Sonne 's case comes down to a misunderstanding , and they called Tuesday 's decision to deny bail an overreaction .
Mike Murray worked with Sonne for several years .
He described the work they did as hacking into organizations to find their security flaws in order to help the organizations build stronger security systems .
Murray said he worries the skill set specific to hackers makes them vulnerable to prosecution .
" It 's typical in the security industry where we have a lot of skills that could be used nefariously , " Murray said on the phone from Atlanta .
" I think it 's important for people in our industry to rally around this because it is easy to misconstrue what we do . "
" It could be any of us , " Murray said .
" Byron could be any of us . "
He said he 'll be speaking up at DEFCON as well .
This is not the first time the hacker community has rallied around someone they feel has been wrongly incarcerated .
Both Murray and Arlen brought up the case of Kevin Mitnick , a hacker they say served several years of jail time in the United States .
Technology expert Jesse Hirsh , another of Sonne 's supporters , recalled hearing him speak at a meeting of surveillance buffs in Toronto in May .
Hirsh said Sonne detailed his plan to listen in on police communications during the G20 summit .
Sonne will become a " social media hero " when his case goes to trial and the public hears details of the evidence against him , Hirsh predicted .
" He will be a cause celebre , " he said .
" Regular Canadians will be able to support this individual and this case ... because of the way he 's being treated and the way that he 's being prosecuted , which is ludicrous . "
While the Crown described Tuesday 's decision as " thorough " and " considered , " Sonne 's defence lawyer said she was disappointed .
" We will consider the options in terms of a bail review and start preparing for his trial , " Breese Davies said .

Many see this photo from 1985 as the beginning of what we nowadays call " media globalization " , because Omayra Sanchez 's agony was followed by television cameras from all over the world .
Despite all the footage that was recorded by those tv cameras , it was this photograph , of a shocking reality and humanity , that went down in history as the first broadcast of the pain and death of a human being .
Omayra Sanchez , 13 years old , was the victim of volcano Nevado del Ruiz 's eruption in 1985 , that devasted the Armero village , in Colombia .
Omayra was trapped for three days under the mud , clay and water that was left from her own house .
When the paramedics , with scarce resources , tried to help her , they sadly realized there was nothing they could do , since to remove her from the deadly trap they would have to amputate her legs and the lack of a speacilist on the scene would result in her death .
According to the paramedics and the journalists that surrounded her , Omayra was strong until the last minute of her life .
For the three days her agony lasted she thought only about going back to school , her studies and her friends .
Photographer Frank Fournier took this photo of Omayra that travelled the world and generated a worldwide controversy about the indifference of the Colombian government before the victims of natural disasters such as this .
The photograph was published months after the girl 's death and Frank Fournier was awarded the 1986 World Press Photo Premier Award for this picture .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said Friday most illegal immigrants entering Arizona are being used to transport drugs across the border .
Brewer said the motivation of " a lot " of the illegal immigrants is to enter the United States to look for work , but that drug rings press them into duty as drug " mules . "
" I believe today , under the circumstances that we 're facing , that the majority of the illegal trespassers that are coming into the state of Arizona are under the direction and control of organized drug cartels and they are bringing drugs in , " Brewer said .

" There 's strong information to us that they come as illegal people wanting to come to work .
Then they are accosted and they become subjects of the drug cartel , " she said .
Brewer spoke Friday when asked about comments she made in a recent election debate among Republican candidates for governor .
She said during the June 15 debate that she believed that most illegal immigrants were not entering the United States for work .
She then associated illegal immigrants with drug smuggling , drop houses , extortion and other criminal activity .
Brewer on April 23 signed a controversial new state immigration enforcement law that will take effect July 29 unless blocked by a court .
Five legal challenges are already pending in federal court already , and the U.S. Justice Department may file its own challenge .
The Arizona law requires police officers enforcing another law to question a person 's immigration status if there 's a reasonable suspicion that he or she is in the country illegally .

This is a hard article for me to write !
I feel like I am saying goodbye to a good friend , a comrade in arms , a companion that has been with me through thick and thin .
I remember the first time I saw the image to the left , and got really excited about the future of smartphones , and the fact that I finally would have an alternative to the iPhone .
The G1 , is no more .
Meaning , T - Mo has stopped listing and selling the unit officially on their site .
Of course , there are still plenty out there you can get your hands on if you really wanted to , but the life cycle of the G1 has officially come to an end .
The G1 was a ground breaking device , the first to really challenge the iPhone ’s dominance of the market , and the handset that gave birth to sites like our own .
The G1 is gone , a moment of silence needs to be observed as a piece of our history moves on .
We will always remember you .

Mel Gibson prays for forgiveness
Forgiveness is typically defined as the process of concluding resentment , indignation or anger as a result of a perceived offense , difference or mistake , and / or ceasing to demand punishment or restitution .
The Oxford English Dictionary defines forgiveness as ‘ to grant free pardon and to give up all claim on account of an offense or debt ’ .
You did n’t think BP was going to suddenly behave transparently , did you ?
At this point it seems highly likely that BP is going to take in outside funding to get through this patch regardless of what their PR team says .
A significant change of investors could have an impact on how BP handles the clean up effort in the Gulf of Mexico which is why the US had asked to be notified of any changes .
The US government is holding a pretty strong deck of cards in this game as they are the largest vendor supplying the DoD.
Canceling government contracts would have a very severe impact on BPs business .
One would hope that the Obama administration is keeping close tabs on any new developments with BP and acts decisively to any changes that may potentially disrupt BP from fulfilling the mission that was promised in the Gulf .

Beat Surrender
Go to BBC Radio Newcastle and listen again to catch Nick Roberts onevery Saturday with it 's unique blend of Punk , Ska , Beat & rock tunes you wo n't hear anywhere else .
Kirsten , the Polo - sporting mystery blonde who stars on the cover of chart topper Contra ( and the cryptic banner ads that preceded it ) has been revealed .
Her surname is Kennis , and the photo was taken in 1983 .
Also , she ’s not a Vampire Weekend fan .
Via TMZ :
The model is Kirsten Kennis — who claims she took the original photo way back in 1983 — and had no idea it was being featured on the album “ Contra ” … until after the band began to promote it back in November .
In a lawsuit , filed yesterday in L.A. County Superior Court , Kennis claims she thinks it all has to do with a “ photographic release ” that the band obtained from a photographer named Tod Brody .
Problem is , Kennis claims the signature on the release is a forgery .
Kennis blames the band for not verifying the legitimacy of the release — and is suing VW and the photog for more than $ 2 mil .
Thanks P4 K for the heads up .
We ’ll letcha know if we get sued for including the photo with this post .
" The prospects of the negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas do not look promising .
President Obama undoubtedly thinks otherwise , but if Abbas speaks for anyone , it 's barely half the Palestinians .
The chances of anything good coming of this are not great .
Another possibility is Jordan .
If Jordan were ready to absorb both more territories and more people , things would be much easier and more natural .
But Jordan does not agree to this .
Therefore , I say that we can look at another option : for Israel to apply its law to Judea and Samaria and grant citizenship to 1.5 million Palestinians . "
These remarks , which to many sound subversive , were not voiced by a left - wing advocate of a binational state .
The speaker is from the Betar movement , a former top leader in Likud and political patron of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a former defense and foreign affairs minister - Moshe Arens .
On June 2 , Arens published an op -ed in Haaretz ( " Is there another option ? " ) in which he urged consideration of a political alternative to the existing situation and the political negotiations .
He wants to break the great taboo of Israeli policy making by granting Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians in the West Bank .
Arens is not put off by those who accuse him of promoting the idea of a binational Jewish - Palestinian state .
" We are already a binational state , " he says , " and also a multicultural and multi-sector state .
The minorities [ meaning Arabs ] here make up 20 percent of the population - that 's a fact and you can't argue with facts . "
As Washington , Ramallah and Jerusalem slouch toward what seems like a well - known , self - evident solution - two states for two nations , on the basis of the 1967 borders and a small - scale territorial swap - a conceptual breakthrough is taking place in the right wing .
Its ideologues are no longer content with rejecting withdrawal and evacuation of settlements , citing security arguments calculated to strike fear into the hearts of the Israeli mainstream .
Their new idea addresses the shortcomings of the status quo , takes account of the isolation in which Israel finds itself and acknowledges the need to break the political deadlock .
Once the sole preserve of the political margins , the approach is now being advocated by leading figures in Likud and among the settlers - people who are not necessarily considered extremists or oddballs .
About a month before Arens published his article , Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin ( Likud ) said , " It 's preferable for the Palestinians to become citizens of the state than for us to divide the country . "
In an interview this week ( see box ) , Rivlin reiterates and elaborates this viewpoint .
In May 2009 , Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely organized a conference in the Knesset titled " Alternatives to Two States . "
Since then , on a couple of occasions , she has called publicly for citizenship to be granted to the Palestinians " in gradual fashion . "
Now she is planning to publish a position paper on the subject .
Uri Elitzur , former chairman of the Yesha Council of Settlements and Netanyahu 's bureau chief in his first term as prime minister , last year published an article in the settlers ' journal Nekuda calling for the onset of a process , at the conclusion of which the Palestinians will have " a blue ID card [ like Israelis ] , yellow license plates [ like Israelis ] , National Insurance and the right to vote for the Knesset . "
Emily Amrousi , a former spokesperson for the Yesha Council , takes part in meetings between settlers and Palestinians and speaks explicitly of " one land in which the children of settlers and the children of Palestinians will be bused to school together . "
It 's still not a full - fledged political camp and there are still holes in the theory .
But although its advocates do not seem to be working together , the plans they put forward are remarkably similar .
They all reject totally the various ideas of ethnic separation and recognize that political rights accrue to the Palestinians .
They talk about a process that will take between a decade and a generation to complete , at the end of which the Palestinians will enjoy full personal rights , but in a country whose symbols and spirit will remain Jewish .
It is at this point that the one - state right wing diverges from the binational left .
The right is not talking about a neutral " state of all its citizens " with no identity , nor about " Israstine " with a flag showing a crescent and a Shield of David .
As envisaged by the right wing , one state still means a sovereign Jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a democratic Jewish state without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations .
In such a state , Jews will be able to live in Hebron and pray at the Tomb of the Patriarchs , and a Palestinian from Ramallah will be able to serve as an ambassador and live in Tel Aviv or simply enjoy ice cream on the city 's seashore .
Sounds off the wall ?
" If every path seems to reach an impasse , ' Elitzur wrote in Nekuda , " usually the right path is one that was never even considered , the one that is universally acknowledged to be unacceptable , taboo . "
Dead end
A year ago , in a seminar sponsored by the Geneva Initiative group , Uri Elitzur astonished an audience of parliamentary assistants with pointed , clear remarks about the desirable political framework .
" The worst solution , " he said , " is apparently the right one : a binational state , full annexation , full citizenship . "
Among those who were not surprised were leading figures from the settlers ' movement Gush Emunim ( Bloc of the Faithful ) .
Elitzur has been trying to sell them his idea for some time .
" At first I was in splendid isolation , " he says , " but lately more and more people are willing to move in my direction .
I think it 's the only practicable solution .
The two - state formula has been kicked around for 10 years or more .
All the politicians say - aloud or in a whisper - they are for it , but it 's still not happening .
The differences between left and right , over which they kill each other in hatred , are really very small .
But everyone is convinced that moving a fraction of an inch from his viewpoint will mean the country 's destruction .
Neither the one side nor the other is to blame , nor even the Palestinians .
The Arab world simply does not want to reach a compromise with us , and even if the formula is found , it wo n't endure .
" The existing situation is also a dead end , " Elitzur continues .
" It ca n't last forever .
The problems Israel has faced in the international community in the past five years are due to the fact that the world is fed up .
The international community is telling us , ' You claimed it was a temporary situation , yet that temporary situation has already lasted 40 years .
We are ready to agree to another decade , but we want to know where things are going . '
The Israelis are also starting to grasp this .
I want us to look for the solutions on the other side of the scale , which lies between the existing situation and the annexation and naturalization of all the Palestinians . "
In internal forums and in front of a home audience , Elitzur is even more outspoken .
" There are many softened or newspeak variations of apartheid , " he wrote in Nekuda , which devoted an entire issue to the search for an alternative policy to the two - state solution .
" Some suggest that the Palestinians should be under Israeli rule but vote in the elections for the Jordanian parliament .
There are ideas involving autonomy , cantons , powerless self - government .
It 's not by chance or by neglect that none of these proposals became the official policy of Likud or of the right .
In the end , they all go back to a dead end : a whole population living under Israeli rule without civil rights .
That is unacceptable on a permanent basis .
It 's a situation that can exist only temporarily and faces mounting pressure , both internal and external , to bring the temporary situation to an end at long last . "
What do you say to the allegations that you have joined the radical left ?
" There 's a clear separation between us .
I am talking about a Jewish state , the state of the Jewish people , which will contain a large Arab minority .
The left is talking about an Arab state containing a Jewish minority , even if they do not explicitly think that .
The leftist demonstrators in [ the West Bank village of ]
Bil 'in have totally joined the Palestinian cause . "
Still , in terms of the political plan , there are points of convergence between you and them .
" In terms of the political plan , yes .
But so what ?
I have many points in common with the extreme left .
I am in favor of refusing an order to dismantle settlements , they are in favor of refusing an order to serve in the territories , and both of us are against the [ separation ] fence .
I am not frightened at the fact that there are Jews with whom I profoundly disagree on one issue but with whom I share views on other issues .
But I will not enter into a political alliance with the Anarchists [ Against the Wall ] even though I too am against the fence .
We have common ground , but beyond it we have a very deep disagreement .
As I see it , the State of Israel was established in order to preserve the rights of the small Jewish minority in the Middle East - six million vs. 300 million - and that is its main purpose .
After fulfilling its main purpose , it is also a democratic state .
That 's why it has to grant human rights to everyone , Jew or non-Jew . "
Indeed , Elitzur no longer needs the left to wrench him out of his splendid isolation .
Hanan Porat , for example , one of the iconic founders of Gush Emunim , though rejecting what he terms " the automatic citizenship that Uri is proposing , which is naive and is liable to lead to grave consequences , " also suggests gradually applying Israeli law in the territories , first in regions where there is a Jewish majority , and within a decade or a generation , throughout .
And the Palestinians ?
Porat : " In my view , every Arab has three options .
First , those who want an Arab state and are ready to implement that goal by means of terrorism and a struggle against the state , have no place in the Land of Israel .
Second , those who accept their place and accept Jewish sovereignty , but do not want to take part in the state and fulfill all their obligations , can be considered residents and enjoy full human rights , but not political representation in the state 's institutions .
By the same token , they will also not have full obligations , such as military or national service .
Third , those who say they are loyal to the state and to its laws and are ready to fulfill the obligations it prescribes and declare loyalty to it , can receive full citizenship .
I consider this a moral and human principle : citizenship is not forced on anyone or granted just like that .
We tried this in East Jerusalem , and the fact is that we failed .
" There is no point in threatening us with the idea of a state of all its citizens , " Porat continues .
" Already 30 years ago , we in Gush Emunim were against solutions of fear - both withdrawal and transfer - and said that in the Return to Zion there is room for the Arab population who desire this , as long as we are not naive about the process . "
Lower price
A few weeks before he published his article in Nekuda , Elitzur spoke at the conference Hotovely organized in the Knesset on alternatives to the two - state solution .
Despite the participation of serious speakers , such as former chief of staff and present minister for strategic affairs , Moshe Ya'alon , and Major General ( res. ) Giora Eiland , a former head of the National Security Council , Hotovely came out of the conference disappointed .
" It made a lot of headlines and had resonance , but I did not see a genuine vision , " she says .
" The ideas ranged from the status quo to ' Jordan is Palestine . '
Most of the speakers rejected the alternative put forward by the left without putting anything positive on the table .
" This approach has characterized the political discourse of the right wing for years , " she continues .
" The right , you could say , had a Qassam for every argument of the left .
We had deep ideological roots which said that this is our land , but beyond that we did not put forward a real solution .
Only Uri Elitzur took a different approach . "
Since then , Hotovely has become increasingly convinced that the idea of giving the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria citizenship must be part of the political horizon .
At the moment , she envisages this as a long - term process , perhaps lasting a generation , during which the situation on the ground will stabilize , while the symbols and character of the Jewish state will be enshrined in a constitution .
But the goal must be clear : annexation and citizenship , or as she puts it , " removing the question mark from above Judea and Samaria . "
Hotovely : " My outlook has two motivations .
First , my deep belief in our right to the Land of Israel .
Shiloh and Beit El settlements are , for me , the land of our forefathers in the full sense of the term .
The second thing is that I do not ignore the fact that there are Palestinians here .
Both the left and the right chose to shut their eyes to the fact that there are human beings here .
The left chose to do it by building a fence and deciding that they just do n't want to see them , and the right simply said , ' We will continue and see what happens . '
We have reached a critical point , a situation in which the entire Zionist enterprise is under threat , because the international community now disputes the legitimacy of our defense of Sderot and Ashkelon , not the legitimacy of building a settler outpost . "
The international community takes that stance because we are still occupiers .
There will be greater legitimacy when the occupation ends .
" We did not get legitimacy in return for our previous withdrawals .
Worse , the harm we are inflicting on the Palestinian population has become far more mortal .
Our instruments of defense became tanks and planes , and that is always worse than policing operations that are done when you control the ground .
" The assumption of the left is that once it hides behind the international border , everything will be permitted .
But it 's clear already now that not everything is permitted and that the principle of proportionality is shackling Israel in Gaza - so what will happen in Judea and Samaria ?
In fact , it goes even deeper .
There is a moral failure here .
After all , the left has long since stopped talking about peace and is resorting to a terminology of separation and segregation .
They are also convinced that the confrontation will continue even afterward .
The result is a solution that perpetuates the conflict and turns us from occupiers into perpetrators of massacres , to put it bluntly .
It 's the left that made us a crueler nation and also put our security at risk . "
Could a country with such a large non-Jewish minority still be Jewish ?
" At the moment , we are talking about citizenship in Judea and Samaria , not Gaza .
In Gaza there is an enemy regime that rejects Israel .
It is outside the political discourse , including the two - state discourse .
There are 1.5 million Palestinians in Judea and Samaria .
I want it to be clear that I do not recognize national rights of Palestinians in the Land of Israel .
I recognize their human rights and their individual rights , and also their individual political rights - but between the sea and the Jordan there is room for one state , a Jewish state . "
The fact is that the state is having a hard time containing a minority of 20 percent even now .
How will it cope with 30 or 40 percent and also preserve its character ?
" Every choice entails a price .
The status quo carries a heavy price , the two - state idea carries a heavy price , and the approach I am now presenting also carries a price .
Coping with the Arab minority is a lower price than the danger of the Qassams , the delegitimization and the immoral actions we will commit in coping with them , and also preferable to giving up parts of the homeland , including Jerusalem . "
Once the Palestinians become citizens , things might lurch out of your control .
Some will say you are playing with fire .
" Everyone is playing with fire .
There is no solution that is divorced from the world of risk in the Middle East .
The risks in the two - state conception are not virtual , they have already been actualized .
The risks I am talking about can be addressed in a rational process lasting a generation . "
Of the two dangers you discern - a binational state or a Palestinian state - which would you choose ?
" Unequivocally the binational danger .
In the binational process we have a degree of control , but the moment you abandon the area to the Palestinian entity , what control do you have over what will happen there ? "
51 percent majority
In a political reality of increasing polarization between the country 's Jewish and Arab citizens , talk of a shared space between the Mediterranean and the Jordan does not always get a serious hearing .
Some of the right - wing spokesmen understand this .
For Moshe Arens , integration of the Arab population into Israeli society is a prior condition - only afterward will it be possible to talk about granting citizenship to the Palestinians in the territories .
" If we are incapable of integrating Israel 's Arab citizens , how will we be able to offer the others citizens ? "
Arens says .
" If I wanted something to happen after my article was published , it was for an emphasis to be placed on the attitude toward the Arab population inside Israel .
I have spoken to the prime minister about this dozens of times .
It 's the biggest problem in the country .
If we do not integrate the Arabs , it will simply be a disaster . "
There is one large party that says they simply have to be transferred into a Palestinian state .
" The platform of Yisrael Beiteinu is nonsensical , an attempt to curry to the lowest common denominator in the country , " says Arens sharply .
" Where will the transfer be carried out ?
Will Galilee be transferred to the Palestinian state ?
The Negev to Egypt ?
It 's not doable .
They are just causing damage to 20 percent of our population , insulting them by saying they want to be rid of them , strip them of Israeli citizenship .
Who ever heard the like ?
" I repeat : first of all , we need to take care of the Israeli Arabs who are citizens .
That is also essential if we are thinking of giving citizenship to Palestinians from Judea and Samaria .
Only if they see that the Arabs have it good in Israel will they think it might be good for them , too . "
Your opponents will say that by publishing an article like this , you are strengthening Sheikh Ra'ad Salah [ a leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel ] and that you will introduce a fifth column into the country that will spell the end of the Jewish state .
" Only those who do n't grasp the full depth of the issue will say that .
I have written dozens of times that the policy must be two - pronged : against the Islamic Movement - to outlaw them , because they are a subversive , seditious movement - and , at the same time , to work against feelings of discrimination among Israel 's Arab citizens .
It is untenable for these people to be hewers of wood and drawers of water - doing the dirty work in the industrialized and advanced country that is Israel . "
Have you been accused of becoming a post - Zionist in the wake of your article ?
" That 's a lot of nonsense .
Was [ Revisionist leader Ze'ev ] Jabotinsky a post - Zionist ?
He talked about a Jewish state with a Jewish majority , but for him a majority meant even 51 percent , too .
In his last book , he suggested that the president might be a Jew and the vice president an Arab , and also the opposite .
Jabotinsky was no post - Zionist . "
If there is anything that unites the political establishment - Ehud Barak , Tzipi Livni and now Netanyahu , too - it 's the view that granting the Palestinians citizenship is dangerous and that only separation will ensure a democratic Jewish state .
" Demagoguery .
If Zionism means 'as little as possible for the Arabs , ' I have to say that I do not accept that .
Jabotinsky did not accept it , either .
You call that Zionism - as few Arabs as possible in Israel ?
That is the Zionism of [ Avigdor ] Lieberman .
If what is implied by the rhetoric of Tzipi Livni is that we need as few Arabs as possible in Israel , it 's not so far from Lieberman .
" People should not exploit what I said for their purposes .
My intention is that , to begin with , we have to focus on the Arab population in Israel , and especially the Muslims .
It 's definitely a dual - stage process .
Only then , many years from now , will it be possible to consider additional minorities , and then maybe the Arabs across the Green Line will say that things are simply good in Israel - not in order to overcome us demographically , but simply because things here are good .
We have n't yet reached that point . "
One land
If Elitzur , Hotovely and Arens represent the political aspect of the idea of a joint state , Emily Amrousi is interested in its everyday side .
Amrousi , who lives in the West Bank settlement of Talmon , is active in Eretz Shalom ( Land of Peace ) , an organization that arranges meetings between settlers and Palestinians , focusing on the local interests of both sides , not necessarily on the political pitfalls .
She , too , admits that in the distant future there will have to be citizenship for everyone .
" But do n't make me out to be a one - state advocate , " Amrousi says .
" In the end , it might arrive at that , but that 's still a very long way off .
Let 's talk first about one land , one strip of ground .
We are not like the Canaanite movement : we are not forgoing the State of Israel and the flag of Israel . "
And until we reach the coveted equality , will we have to make do with the status quo ?
" No , I do n't like the status quo either because it 's really not moral .
It 's impossible to go on like this , with a situation in which my Palestinian neighbors have to cross three checkpoints to get from one village to another .
There is a distortion here - true , for security reasons , for logical reasons - but something went wrong along the way , and we can't go on accepting this .
" The word ' citizenship ' is very national and very political .
In the Eretz Shalom initiative we do not talk about citizenship , but about concepts of neighborly relations .
There are no neighborly relations here , because either it 's relations between enemies or we are transparent to them and they to us .
And the relations that do exist are like those between horse and rider .
There must be an initial basis before we talk about citizenship and a judicial system .
We need to speak their language and we can even have a joint swimming pool here , because both they and we need separation between men and women .
That may be a bit far off , but we have to think first about everyday life .
I know that sounds like conditional citizenship - saying they must first be my good neighbors and then I will grant them rights - but I really do want to talk about a process that starts from below . "
From below or from above , in the end we reach a state whose demographic and geographic parameters are very different from what we have today .
" Demography is definitely a threat , but the other threat is bigger .
The harder price is to cut up this country , with one part topographically higher than the other .
I can't speak with the Israeli public now about citizenship and Palestinians on the beach in Tel Aviv , because that 's a threat to the public .
The whole situation now is wrong .
We made a mistake , we arrived at the wrong place and we have a long way to go , but in the end there has to be one space here .
We will yet talk about one state , but in the meantime we can talk about one land . "
One can take a cynical view of Eretz Shalom , of Amrousi 's decision to learn Arabic or of the project being organized by the settlers in Talmon : to build a lean - to for Palestinian workers awaiting a security check before entering their settlement .
Fashionably late , one could say , and under the threat of evacuation , Gush Emunim is discovering the enlightened occupation .
But there is another side , too : the impression that the Israeli center , in its addiction to the separation idea , has sloughed off the question of relations with the Arab population , on both sides of the Green Line .
Is it a coincidence that Amrousi chose to describe the reality in the Land of Israel as " one space , " a term used by critical sociologists from the radical left ?
Prof. Yehouda Shenhav , formerly from the Sephardi Democratic Rainbow and editor of the journal Theory and Criticism for the past decade , believes that the concept of reality for people on the right , as quoted above , is far more accurate and honest than the two - state concept of the left .
In his recent book , " The Time of the Green Line " ( Am Oved , Hebrew ) , Shenhav returns to what he terms the true foundation of the conflict , namely 1948 , and not " the obliterating and blurring paradigm according to which everything was swell until 1967 , and then things went awry , as David Grossman writes in ' The Yellow Wind . ' "
Shenhav rejects both the two - state idea and the " state of all its citizens . "
He argues that the only possible stable model is one that will recognize the distinctiveness of different communities - among both Palestinians and Jews - in the one space between the sea and the Jordan River .
" The diagnosis of the right - wingers is accurate , " Shenhav says , and immediately adds , " But let 's be precise : it 's not the whole of the right .
Most of them do not speak in those terms .
But there is a minority that reads reality in a far less denying and less repressive way than all the people on the left who support the two - state solution .
The majority of the left does not understand a spatial concept that does not permit homogeneity .
The Jews and the Palestinians are Siamese twins .
The ideology of the Jewish state espoused by the articulate spokespersons of the left tries to sever the different Palestinian groups , and takes their severance as a fait accompli .
In contrast , Rubi [ Reuven ] Rivlin and Moshe Arens understand that those on both sides of the Green Line are Palestinians .
" I am not in favor of the wrongs being caused by the settlements , " Shenhav continues , " but in their political diagnosis the settlers are right .
In one way or another , we too will ultimately learn this , and the only question is how much bloodshed it will entail .
I wrote exactly what the right is saying today : the war in Gaza is the model that will be repeated in the future if there is separation . "
The 1967 lines are accepted by the international community .
The left is against the plunder of land that is taking place to the east , against the fact that a settlement like Ofra is situated on private Palestinian land .
" What exactly is the difference between Ofra and Beit Dagan , which is situated on [ the former Palestinian village of ]
Beit Dajan ?
Do the 19 years from 1948 to 1967 make one settlement moral and the other immoral ?
In my book I quote Uri Elitzur , who says , ' You [ the left ] expelled the Palestinians in 1948 , did not allow them back , established settlements on all their villages and afterward built the separation fence , and then you come to us with complaints , even though we have not destroyed even one village in the West Bank - not even one - to build a settlement . '
" The 1967 paradigm is intended to make it possible for the left to live in Tel Aviv and feel good about itself , " Shenhav continues .
" The settlements will be sacrificed in order to atone for what they did to the Palestinians in 1948 .
The settlers will pay the price of the sins of the left .
Yossi Beilin and his Geneva Initiative and all the rest want to preserve the achievements of the Ashkenazi elite .
" Do n't get me wrong : I am not in favor of the vision of the right wing .
All I am doing is recommending that the left listen to what the right is saying .
To take the right wing 's diagnosis and develop it into normative and moral left - wing viewpoints , to create a horizon that reflects leftism - not nationalism , not a Jewish empire . "
Are you now a person of the left or the right ?
" I do n't know .
I wrote in favor of the [ Palestinians ' ] right of return and I am against the evacuation of settlements .
So where does that leave me ? "
Great candor
The supporters of the two - state concept always warned against closing a window of opportunity to establish a Palestinian state .
Now that the right has started to talk about a one - state solution , is the window closed ?
Definitely not , says Gadi Baltiansky , director general of the Geneva Initiative : " But I appreciate the sincerity of those who speak clearly at this time .
The right always spoke in negative terms .
Tzipi Livni once noted that the Likud 's platform always starts with the word ' no . '
No to a Palestinian state , no to withdrawal , no , no and more no .
Now there are people on the right who are saying with great candor what must be done , even if some of them are still hesitant about going public .
" I never liked the division into the ' peace camp ' and the ' national camp , ' " Baltiansky continues .
" The fact is that I am no less national than the right and they want peace no less than I do .
In Israel there is a two - state camp and a one - state , binational camp , and the choice is between them .
But the right should not delude itself : one Jewish state will not be a solution , but a continuation of the conflict .
There will be fights over the flag and over the anthem and over the school curriculum , and the situation will be untenable . "
As of now , giving citizenship to the Palestinians is not on the political agenda of the right .
According to the head of the Yesha Council , Danny Dayan , " the idea is unrealistic .
In the present circumstances , it could put Israel 's character at risk .
Morally , the fact that the Palestinians will not have full political rights in the foreseeable future is the fault of the Palestinians themselves .
They rejected every compromise and chose war and are now paying the price of their mistakes .
It 's not apartheid , it 's their choice . "
So what 's the solution ?
" The solution for the coming decades is the present status quo , with improvements of one kind or another .
Of all the possibilities , that one affords the most stable balance .
It is also important to say that even so , the Palestinians have more political rights than any Arab citizen in the Middle East , with the possible exception of the Lebanese . "
Faithful to his outlook , Dayan last week - ahead of Netanyahu 's meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama - was busy cobbling together a coalition of the leaders of the right - wing parties in the Knesset .
The aim : to compel Netanyahu to end the construction freeze in the territories at the end of September , as promised .
Other MKs who are against the two - state solution , such as Aryeh Eldad ( National Union ) and Danny Danon ( Likud ) , also told me that giving the Palestinians citizenship is not on their agenda , not even in the face of the emerging two - state plan .
Still , the impression is that even those who are against the idea have modified their approach recently .
Adi Mintz , a former director general of the Yesha Council , presented a plan whereby after the security situation stabilizes , Israel will annex 60 percent of Judea and Samaria , whose 300,000 Palestinian inhabitants will be granted Israeli citizenship .
The status of the rest of the population and of the area will , in this view , be settled within the framework of a comprehensive regional solution in the more distant future .
The right - leaning newspaper , Makor Rishon , recently devoted an issue to the possibility of leaving settlements under Palestinian sovereignty if the two - state plan is implemented .
Logic says that if supporters of such an idea are truly serious , it should not be a problem for them to agree to live in the one state that will extend from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River , whatever its character .
In any event , it will soon become clear whether renewal of the political process will lead to the removal from the agenda of every option except the establishment of a Palestinian state , or whether the opposition to such a state will generate momentum for supporters of the one - state alternative .
Those who espouse this idea admit that its main drawback is that no genuine discussion of its merits and shortcomings has ever been held .
Thus , key issues , such as the transition period leading up to citizenship , the refugee problem , the status of Gaza and even the bizarre question of how many Palestinians there really are have not been seriously addressed .
For this reason , Hotovely wants to publish a position paper on the issue , perhaps with the aid of an American research institute .
" I want people to understand the issues , not to say that [ MK Ahmed ] Tibi and I are from the same party .
The taboo that forbids talk about any option other than the two - state solution is almost anti-democratic .
It 's like brain - gagging . "

From Freilich 's diary :
An unfortunate confrontation occurred at the Rutland County Democrats Headquarters opening party between its leadership and the Daniel Freilich for U.S. Senate campaign .
Exclusion , omissions , tearing down campaign materiel , berating supporters , threatening , almost coming to blows ... the establishment ’s methods of protecting its turf .
As I understand it , to the extent any such confrontation occurred , it was initiated by Freilich and his supporters .
If you want evidence of that , I obtained this email sent out by the Freilich campaign to his supporters :
From : Daniel Freilich ( daniel.freilich@gmail.com )
Date : Fri , 23 Jul 2010 11:48:57 - 0400
To : Kevin Molduene ( kevin@danielfreilich.com )
Subject : ** Urgent ** Senator Leahy vs Dr Freilich ( Today , Rutland , 5 p )
So this is the big one folks .
Dan Freilich has been asking , the media has been asking , and now we are brining the fight to Senator Leahy .
Friday , July 23rd at the Democratic HQ ( 24 Center Street , Rutland ) 5 p , all volunteers , veterans , friends , and staff will stand by Captain Freilich as he challenges in front of dozens of cameras , and hundreds of Democrats to defend his 36 year record on TV .
We will make our stand here , this WILL be the game changer .
We are encouraging everyone who possibly can to meet us in Rutland at 430 p in front of the HQ , to get your new Freilich shirt and to help us in this momentous occasion .
This is where David finds a crack in Goliath 's armor and we need your help .
We are putting together car pools of volunteers from various areas of the state to join us .
We will compensate gas if you can let us know your coming in advance ( call me at 802.342.8370 ) food will be provided at the Democrats expense .
We just need you there to be with Dan and to show the Democrats that candidates have to actually meet their constituents and defend their vote , they still work for us dammit !
This is the moment we need you .
We know it 's short notice , we know it 's a drive for most of you , we also know it's of the utmost importance and can catapult the people 's candidate to the head of the pack .
Please bring your friends and join us .
Energetically ,
Kevin Molduene

Oh , and while we 're on the subject of Freilich 's campaign manager , Kevin Molduene :
Friday , December 11 , 2009 Gossip girls love talking about me ...
so for the last week a couple friends have told me they had seen postings on craigslist concerning my ads looking for various male models or promoters for my upcoming events .
i found a few of them ... gonna post them for you .

Hey Guys !!
Before you sign on for this , be sure to check out all that is being said about Ballzee Productions - Kevin Molduene - MadCap - Spokane Flirts !!!
Listed both in this section and the Local News Section on Community Section .
The guy is a pig and you will probably not be paid what he is offering - if paid anything at all !
Just sayin ' . . .
2)--------
I have to second the person upset about working with Kevin Molduene of Ballzee Promotions ( formerly Spokaneflirts.com ) also known as MadCap .
I worked with him and was never paid a cent , he was very unprofessional and does n't take responsibility for his mistakes and poor business practices .
check out his website and see for yourself www.ballzeepromotions.com and his myspace where he blames the liquor board www.myspace.com/kevinmolduene ;
Be safe ladies , this man has multiple sexual assault charges from former workers .
If you do work with him , do n't be left alone with him after a single drink .
3)----------
Anyone replying to the Ballzee Promotions ad should read what 's being said about Kevin Molduene in the Community Events sections of CL !!!
He is not a nice person to work with .
I know because I did not get paid for what I did for him !!!!!!
He 's a liar , cheat and bad " business " person - if you want to call what he does as business !
BEWARE !
He 's blaming the Liquor Control Board for all his woes .
He never takes responsibility or ownership when he is in trouble .
It 's always someone else 's fault !
Do n't say I did n't warn you !!
4)-----------
Beware of this post !!!
Ballzee Productions , aka SpokaneFlirts , aka MadCap , aka Kevin Molduene is a scam artist !
He has not paid many people who work for him and he lies about what he is offering !
I know because I am one of many .
He 's a real smooth talker that makes everything sound like the greatest thing on earth . . . a real con artist .
Read what others have written in the Local News section of CL and the Gigs / Events section .
Do n't become one of his victims like I did !!!
Time to give up , Kevin ; everyone is on to you in Spokane !
Take it somewhere else !

Anyway .
There is a picture of this alleged hostile confrontation , by the way :
Wow .
Surprised the Rutland police did n't bring out the tasers , water cannons , and rubber bullets .
( Photo credit : Rutland Herald )
Be that as it may , I can find no reference , no independent corroboration of any such contentious incident , anywhere , other than that asserted by Freilich in his Daily Kos diary .
One of my GMD colleagues spoke with VDP Exec .
Director Robert Dempsey , who was present at the event , and summarized his comments , along with some personal observations :
# Note the bogus third - person " reportage . " #
The state party leadership had nothing to do with this event , although Exec. Director Robert Dempsey was there ( I called him to see what he knew ) .
# Dan Freilich had the opportunity to seek the State Committee ’s endorsement and was given the information on the process .
He chose not to , while Sen .
Leahy sought and received the Committee ’s endorsement .
# Freilich is running as an independent since he expects to lose the Primary .
# According to Dempsey , DF and about 8 supporters showed up at the Rutland campaign office opening and asked whether they could put up a photo of DF on the wall with other candidate pics .
County Chair Ann Lezak said no , because he ’s running as an independent .
# According to Dempsey , Freilich ’s supporters then defaced a photo of Sen.
Leahy and attempted to instigate a physical confrontation with the Democratic volunteers , with videocamera running .
Dempsey intervened to request Freilich to control his supporters or the police would be called .
# Freilich & his supporters left .
Freilich , in his faux - third person " reportage " , calls the assertion that he is not a real Democrat an , " excuse . "
I call it a statement of fact .
This should dispel any doubt anyone may have of that assertion on MY part within seconds :
Note : Daniel Freilich is also a member of the Rutland County GOP 's Facebook page , for what that 's worth ...
I do n't know what Freilich is , ( other than a strong suspicion that he is a GOP provocateur ) but he 's certainly not a Democrat .
And that Daily Kos posting has to be one of the most transparently dishonest and insulting things I 've ever seen in any political campaign .
Clearly , whatever lessons Freilich was taught about honor in his vaunted military career did n't stick .
Fighting and Entertainment Group ( FEG ) , parent company of Dream and K - 1 , held a press conference in Tokyo on Friday to announce a newly - formed partnership with Chinese investment group Puji Capital .
Denying rumors of a possible sale , FEG officials say they will continue to run day - to - day operations while Puji works to raise funds and expand FEG 's brands internationally .
The deal could reportedly net the struggling promotion upwards of $ 200 million USD .
MMA Fighting 's Daniel Herbertson reports :
K - 1 President Sadaharu Tanikawa stressed that FEG had not been sold and in fact it will now be setting its sights much higher .
" This is a declaration of war against the WWE and UFC .
From Asia , we will take the world , " Tanikawa stated .
" When K - 1 and PRIDE were competing against each other , 80 % of the martial arts market was in Japan .
It is now the opposite and Japan is only 20 % .
We were worried that Japan would be left behind if we let this continue , it is unacceptable .
We needed to change our business model ...
We 've let Dana White get a lead on us .
Before ( Shinya ) Aoki beats ( Gilbert ) Melendez , we must win as promoters . "
Tanikawa's " declaration of war " feels like fairly transparent promotional bluster -- especially since Puji's Michael Chen would go on to describe the American market as " too developed and not lucrative " enough to delve into during the same press conference -- but the acknowledgment that FEG had been operating on a losing business model is a step in the right direction .
As Zach Arnold notes , the Puji money should help FEG offer its fighters more competitive purses , but this is a plan we 'll need to observe in action for some time before fully understanding how ( or if ) it can truly succeed .
UPDATE : Nightmare of Battle reports on the reaction from FEG 's foremost Japanese competitor , Sengoku :
SRC PR & Director Mukai tweeted on the 16th ( after the FEG global domination press conference ) : “ We ’ll always take the “ kenjitsu ( steady , sound ) kenzen ( health ) ” ( slowly but surely I guess ) route .
It ’ll be interesting to see how FEG ’s aggressive route will go compared to WVR ’s building slowly ( almost ) from scratch route .
The companies also released this graphic today , which vaguely outlines the plan for expansion :
For obvious reasons , FEG and Puji will first look to tackle the Asia / Oceania market .
Officials said that they 're interested in bringing MMA to South Korea on an annual basis , but also noted that the country 's GDP is not as high as Japan's .
( Dream was forced to cancel a planned South Korean show this past spring , reportedly due to lack of available stars and slow ticket sales . )
Hong Kong , meanwhile , has a higher GDP than that of Japan , but even less interest when it comes to MMA .
Tony Blair 's evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry that toppling Saddam Hussein helped make Britain safe from terrorists was dramatically undermined by the former head of MI5 yesterday .
Giving evidence to the same inquiry , Eliza Manningham - Buller revealed that there was such a surge of warnings of home - grown terrorist threats after the invasion of Iraq that MI5 asked for – and got – a 100 per cent increase in its budget .
Baroness Manningham - Buller , who was director general of MI5 in 2002 - 07 , told the Chilcot panel that MI5 started receiving a " substantially " higher volume of reports that young British Muslims being drawn to al - Qa'ida .
She told the inquiry : " Our involvement in Iraq radicalised , for want of a better word , a whole generation of young people – a few among a generation – who saw our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as being an attack on Islam . "
She added : " Arguably we gave Osama bin Laden his Iraqi jihad so that he was able to move into Iraq in a way that he was not before . "
Her words are in stark contrast to the claim that Mr Blair made in front of the same inquiry on 29 January .
The former prime minister told Sir John Chilcot : " If I am asked whether I believe we are safer , more secure , that Iraq is better , that our own security is better , with Saddam and his two sons out of office and out of power , I believe indeed we are .
" It was better to deal with this threat , to remove him from office , and I do genuinely believe that the world is safer as a result . "
But the evidence presented by Lady Manningham - Buller does not just call Mr Blair 's credibility into question , it also throws down a challenge to the coalition Government , warned Lord Carlile of Berriew , a Liberal Democrat peer who has acted since 2005 as the independent reviewer of anti-terror laws .
He told The Independent : " It 's certainly the case that the threat and number of home - grown terrorists – and ' not home - grown ' terrorists coming into the UK – increased after the Iraq war .
" This makes life difficult both for the old government , who have criticisms to answer , and for the current Government .
It makes their review of current terrorism law a delicate exercise because there is no evidence of any significant reduction in the threat .
We are where we were . "
Sir Menzies Campbell , former leader of the Liberal Democrats , added : " I should be astonished if Mr Blair were to return to give further evidence , but questions will remain as to what it was which prompted him to disregard the reservations of officials and their advice .
If only Britain had been as well served by its politicians as it was by Eliza Manningham - Buller then we would never have got ourselves into the illegal mess of Iraq . "
Lord West , who was counter - terrorism minister in the Home Office under Gordon Brown , told the BBC that he had " no doubt " that the Iraq war increased the threat of terrorism in the UK , which hit the government like a " bow wave " in 2003 .
Ken Livingstone , who was Mayor of London at the time of the 7 July bombings , said : " Eliza Manningham - Buller 's evidence is a damning indictment of a foreign policy that not only significantly enhanced the risk of terrorist attacks in London but gave al - Qa'ida the opening to operate in Iraq too . "
Before 2003 , MI5 's concern had been the possibility that foreign terrorists would infiltrate the UK .
Afterwards , she said : " We realised that the focus was not foreigners .
The rising and increasing threat was a threat from British citizens and that was a very different scenario to stopping people coming in .
It was what has now become called home - grown . "
She added : " We were pretty well swamped – that 's possibly an exaggeration – but we were very overburdened with intelligence on a broad scale that was pretty well more than we could cope with in terms of plots , leads to plots and things that we needed to pursue .
" By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the Prime Minister for a doubling of our budget .
This is unheard of , but he and the Treasury and the Chancellor accepted that because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem . "
The Chilcot panel published a previously classified document which showed that the former MI5 boss was not simply being wise after the event .
A year before British troops went into Iraq , she sent the Home Office a memo which – though phrased in official language – demolished the idea that Saddam Hussein 's regime represented a credible terrorist threat to the UK .
In a memo to John Gieve , Permanent Secretary to the Home Office , in March 2002 , Lady Manningham - Buller told him that Saddam was not likely to use chemical or biological weapons unless " he felt the survival of his regime was in doubt " .
The memo went on : " We assess that Iraqi capability to mount attacks in the UK is currently limited . "
Lady Manningham - Buller also hinted at tension between Mr Blair 's office and MI5 over the dossier that the Prime Minister presented to Parliament in September 2002 , to prepare public opinion for the likelihood of war .
" We were asked to put in some low - grade , small intelligence to it and we refused because we did n't think it was reliable , " she said .
Evidence :
What he said – and what she said
False claims of links between al - Qa'ida and Saddam Hussein
Tony Blair claimed on 21 Jan 2003 :
" There is some intelligence evidence about loose links between al - Qa'ida and various people in Iraq ...
It would not be correct to say there is no evidence whatever of linkages between al - Qa'ida and Iraq . "
Foreign Office spokesman claimed on 29 Jan 2003 :
" We believe that there have been , and still are , some al - Qa'ida operatives in parts of Iraq controlled by Baghdad .
It is hard to imagine that they are there without the knowledge and acquiescence of the Iraqi government . "
Eliza Manningham - Buller , former head of MI5 , yesterday :
" There was no credible intelligence to suggest that connection and that was the judgment , I might say , of the CIA . "
Hand - picking flimsy ' intelligence '
Blair , to the Commons 24 Sept 2002 :
" It [ the intelligence service ] concludes that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons , that Saddam has continued to produce them , that he has existing and active military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons , which could be activated within 45 minutes ; and that he is actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability ... "
Blair , to the Commons 25 Feb 2003 :
" The intelligence is clear : He [ Saddam ] continues to believe his WMD programme is essential both for internal repression and for external aggression .
The biological agents we believe Iraq can produce include anthrax , botulinum , toxin , aflatoxin and ricin .
All eventually result in excruciatingly painful death . "
Manningham - Buller , yesterday :
" The nature of intelligence – it is a source of information , it is rarely complete , it needs to be assessed , it is fragmentary ...
We were asked to put in some low - grade , small intelligence to it [ the September 2002 dossier ] and we refused because we did n't think it was reliable . "
Iraq posed no risk to Britain
Blair , to the Commons 10 April 2002 :
" Saddam Hussein is developing weapons of mass destruction , and we cannot leave him doing so unchecked .
He is a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
Manningham - Buller , yesterday :
" We regarded the direct threat from Iraq as low ... we did n't believe he had the capability to do anything in the UK . "
Ministers were told that invading Iraq would increase the threat of terrorism to Britain
Blair , farewell speech at the Labour conference , 26 September 2006 :
" This terrorism is n't our fault .
We did n't cause it .
It 's not the consequence of foreign policy . "
Manningham - Buller , yesterday :
" It was communicated through the JIC assessments , to which I fed in ...
I believe they [ senior ministers ] did read them .
If they read them , they can have had no doubt . "
The Iraq war made Britain a more dangerous place and allowed al - Qa'ida to gain a hold in Iraq
Blair , 29 Jan 2010 :
" If I am asked whether I believe we are safer , more secure , that Iraq is better , that our own security is better , I believe we are .
The world is safer as a result . "
Manningham - Buller , yesterday :
" Our involvement in Iraq radicalised a generation of young people who saw our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as an attack on Islam .
We [ MI5 ] were pretty well swamped ... with intelligence on a broad scale that was pretty well more than we could cope with in terms of plots , leads to plots and things that we needed to pursue .
" We gave Osama bin Laden his Iraqi jihad so that he was able to move into Iraq in a way that he was not before .

Three of the four suicide bombers had been born in Yorkshire ; the fourth , born in Jamaica , came to the UK aged five .
In his video , one bomber said : " Your democratically elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities . "
London Haymarket / Glasgow Airport attacks – 2007

When I started on Twitter , it took me several months to warm to the service .
I think the same principle applies to Buzz .
Buzz fills a nice niche between Twitter ( microblogging ) and regular blogging .
It ’s great when you want to throw out one quick idea , but you need more than 140 characters .
You can read my Buzzes ( or follow me on Buzz ) if you want .

Google Earth : most of the eye candy of Google Earth , but on your phone
LED Scroller : enter a message and your phone turns into a faux LED scrolling sign .
Kinda low - tech , but impresses people more than I expected .
Hypnotic Spiral : makes a swirling spiral that you can control

Then use this app instead of carrying a bunch of membership cards around .
I wish my phone could replace everything in my wallet .

Federal taxes on middle - income Americans are near historic lows , [ 1 ] according to the latest available data .
That ’s true both for federal income taxes and total federal taxes .
[ 2 ]
Income taxes :
A family of four in the exact middle of the income spectrum filing its taxes for 2013 this filing season paid only 5.3 percent of its 2013 income in federal income taxes , according to estimates from the Urban - Brookings Tax Policy Center ( TPC ) . [ 3 ]
Average income tax rates for these typical families have been lower during the Bush and Obama Administrations than at any time since the 1950s .
( See Figure 1 . )
As discussed below , 2009 and 2010 were particularly low because of the temporary Making Work Pay Tax Credit .
Overall federal taxes : Overall federal taxes — which include income , payroll , and excise taxes , and imputed corporate taxes — on middle - income households in 2009 were at their lowest levels in decades , according to the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
Federal Income Taxes Have Declined Significantly in Recent Decades
Federal income taxes on middle - income families have declined significantly in recent decades .
In 1998 - 2000 , the years before the 2001 tax cut enacted by President Bush and Congress , the median - income family of four paid roughly 8.0 percent of its income in individual income taxes , according to TPC estimates — a smaller share than in any year since 1967 .
[ 4 ]
The Bush tax cuts further reduced taxes for middle - income taxpayers , and the 2012 “ fiscal cliff ” bill ( the American Taxpayer Relief Act ) made these middle - income tax cuts permanent .
TPC estimates that the median - income family of four paid 5.3 percent of its 2013 income in federal income taxes when it filed its return this year .
The 5.3 percent rate ( as well as the other rates discussed here for 2013 and other years ) is the effective tax rate , or the percentage of its income that a family pays in taxes .
It is well below the 15 percent marginal tax rate — the rate paid on a filer ’s next dollar of income — that a family of four in the exact middle of the income spectrum faces .
A family ’s effective tax rate typically is significantly lower than its marginal tax rate because the family takes the standard deduction ( or , in some cases , itemized deductions ) , personal exemptions , and tax credits such as the child tax credit , and because a portion of the family ’s taxable income is taxed at lower rates .
( For the median - income family , some of its income is not taxed , some is taxed at a 10 percent rate , and some is taxed at a 15 percent rate . )
Expiration of Temporary Tax Breaks Raised Effective Income Tax Rate
Figure 1 shows that while the overall trend in a typical family ’s effective tax rate has been downward , the 2013 rate is above the rates for 2008 - 2010 .
This is because of the expiration of the Recovery Rebate Credit of 2008 and Making Work Pay Tax Credit of 2009 and 2010 .
In 2008 , policymakers enacted a one - time income tax rebate up to a maximum of $ 1,200 for married couples filing jointly .
[ 5 ]
The following year they enacted the Making Work Pay Tax Credit as part of the 2009 Recovery Act ; it provided an income tax credit of up to $ 800 to married couples ( $ 400 to single filers ) in 2009 and 2010 .
Expiration of Payroll Tax Cut Is Biggest Tax Change for Most People in 2013
In 2011 , policymakers shifted their tax - cutting stimulus focus from the income tax to the Social Security payroll tax .
They allowed the income - tax - based Making Work Pay credit to expire and , in its place for 2011 and 2012 , cut the employee portion of the Social Security payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent of workers ’
Social Security taxable earnings ( which were capped at $ 110,100 in 2012 ) .
The payroll tax cut did not adversely affect Social Security ’s finances because general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds offset the loss of payroll tax revenue .
This payroll tax cut expired at the end of 2012 .
This was the most significant tax change for most people in 2013 ( Table 1 highlights the tax cut ’s value for workers in various occupations ) .
A number of studies , including estimates by the Congressional Budget Office , suggest that the expiration of the payroll tax cut contributed to slower consumption and gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in 2013 . [ 6 ]

Overall Federal Taxes Also at Low Levels
While income taxes on middle - class households have declined in recent years , so , too , have overall federal taxes .
Households in the middle fifth of the income spectrum paid an average of 11.5 percent of their income in overall federal taxes in 2010 , the latest year for which data are available , according to CBO . [ 7 ]
This is the lowest on record in data that go back to 1979 .
When CBO publishes data for more recent years ( such as 2013 ) , overall federal average tax rates on this middle group will likely be higher — though still low historically — because they will reflect the expiration of the temporary income and payroll tax cuts discussed above .
Most Americans pay more in payroll taxes , which support Social Security and Medicare , than they do in income taxes .
In a typical , non-recession year ( that is , one without a temporary tax cut ) , payroll taxes amount to about 9 percent of income for households in the middle quintile , according to CBO . [ 8 ]
A lobbying group that represents the wireless industry is taking its fight over San Francisco 's recently adopted cell phone radiation disclosure law to the courts , claiming it misleads consumers and curbs their ability to make informed choices .
The lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Friday , July 23 , by CTIA -- The Wireless Association seeks to block the law 's enforcement set to take effect late this year .
San Francisco's Cell Phone Right - to - Know law , which was signed in June by Mayor Gavin Newsom , is believed to be the first of its kind nationwide .
At least two other California cities are researching the enactment of similar laws , though there 's scientific uncertainty about whether there 's a direct link between cell phone exposure and health risks .
Under San Francisco's law , retailers will be required to post information next to phones , listing their specific absorption rate ( SAR ) -- the measured rate at which radio waves emitted from a cell phone are absorbed by the user 's body .
The FCC capped these rates at no more than 1.6 watts per kilogram .
Absorption rates vary from phone to phone , depending on the make and model .
The wireless industry group claims that the law flies in the face of the FCC 's requirements .
" San Francisco 's attempt to regulate the sale of wireless handsets improperly intrudes upon the FCC 's exclusive and comprehensive regulation of the safety of wireless handsets , " the group stated in a press release .
" The ordinance misleads consumers by creating the false impression that the FCC 's standards are insufficient and that some phones are ' safer ' than others based on their radio frequency emissions . "
Not one to shy away from enacting groundbreaking , innovative and sometimes controversial policy , the consolidated city - county of San Francisco has already received some backlash , but is ready to defend its consumer - oriented law .
CTIA in late June publicly vowed to pull its annual trade show out of San Francisco after this October .
This lawsuit followed shortly thereafter .
" The cell phone lobby is arguing that improving consumer access to information will cause them to become frightened and confused and somehow that violates federal law , " said Matt Dorsey , spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera 's office .
" We do not think that 's sound legal theory .
The reality is that San Francisco 's Right - to - Know ordinance offers consumers access to the same information they can obtain elsewhere , but at the point of sale . "
The CTIA countered that access to such information will help " consumer confusion " flourish .
" The problem with the San Francisco ordinance is not the disclosure of wireless phone SAR values -- that information is already publicly available , " a press release from the group stated .
" CTIA 's objection to the ordinance is that displaying a person 's SAR value at the point of sale suggests to the consumer that there is a meaningful safety distinction between FCC - compliant devices with different SAR levels . "
Newsom , however , expressed disappointment that the wireless industry is challenging the city 's " landmark consumer information law , " saying it 's not an attack on the industry or its products .
" This is a commonsense measure which merely takes information already made available by these companies and makes it more accessible and easier to find by the point - of - sale consumer , " Newsom said in a press release .
" I am surprised that industry representatives would choose to spend untold sums of money to fight this in the courts ,
instead of cooperatively working with San Francisco to comply with a reasonable law that provides greater transparency and information without putting any undue burdens on small businesses or discourage cell phone use in any way . "
San Francisco's move toward disclosure has reinvigorated the conversation surrounding cell phone 's effects on public health .
Burlingame Councilman Michael Brownrigg , who wants the Bay Area city to consider a similar ordinance , said an informational meeting from experts on both sides of the issue is being scheduled for late summer .
" Once we have that input from people from both sides of the spectrum , we 'll decide what 's best for Burlingame , " he said .
" And obviously whatever the wireless industry does in that time will be part of that discussion . "
This legal challenge did n't exactly surprise San Francisco officials , who are accustomed to being challenged in court over such cutting - edge laws and positions on health care , medical marijuana and gun control .
" We think it 's a stretch to suggest , as the cell phone lobby is doing , that the public 's right to know conflicts with an FCC determination or is somehow unlawfully misleading , " Dorsey said .
" We 're not compelling anyone to reveal trade secrets or confidential information -- we 're confident that Congress never intended to prevent localities from being able to make sure consumers are informed about too much radiation in their cell phones . "

There were 32 confirmed or suspected suicides among soldiers in June , including 21 among active - duty troops and 11 among National Guard or Reserve forces , according to Army statistics .
ARMY SUICIDES ARMY SUICIDES
Soldiers killed themselves at the rate of one per day in June , making it the worst month on record for Army suicides , the service said Thursday .
There were 32 confirmed or suspected suicides among soldiers in June , including 21 among active - duty troops and 11 among National Guard or Reserve forces , according to Army statistics .
Seven soldiers killed themselves while in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan in June , according to the statistics .
Of the total suicides , 22 soldiers had been in combat , including 10 who had deployed two to four times .
" The hypothesis is the same that many have heard me say before : continued stress on the force , said Army Col. Christopher Philbrick , director of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force .
He pointed out that the Army has been fighting for nine years in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Last year was the Army 's worst for suicides with 244 confirmed or suspected cases .
DATABASE : A look at U.S. lives lost in Iraq , Afghanistan AFGHANISTAN : Coalition eases up on airstrikes GENERAL : Sees IED drop by year 's end The increase was a setback for the service , which has been pushing troops to seek counseling .
Through May of this year , the Army had seen a decline in suicides among active - duty soldiers this year compared with the same period in 2009 .
Philbrick expressed frustration over the June deaths .
" Because we believe that the programs , policies , procedures ... are having a positive impact across the entire force .
The help is there . "
A leading military suicide researcher says changing a culture that views psychological illness as a weakness takes time .
" I would expect it to be years , " said David Rudd , dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Science at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City .
The mounting stress on an Army facing renewed deployments and combat in Afghanistan is also a factor , Rudd said .
" That 's not a challenge they ( Army leaders ) control .
It 's a challenge that the president and Congress controls , " he said .
The Army also unveiled on Thursday a training video designed to combat suicides .
It contains testimonials by soldiers who struggled with self - destructive impulses before seeking help .
It is titled Shoulder to Shoulder : I Will Never Quit on Life .
Philbrick said this was an improved video that he hoped would reach troubled soldiers .
The previous video did not resonate with average soldiers , he said .
During a showing in Baghdad , soldiers laughed at it , Philbrick said .
" In grunt language , it sucked , " he said .
The Army 's current suicide rate is about 22 deaths per 100,000 , which is above a civilian rate that has been adjusted to match the demographics of the Army .
That rate is 18 - per - 100,000 .
Only the Marine Corps has a higher suicide rate , at 24 - per - 100,000 .
Although Marine Corps suicides had been tracking similarly to last year 's record pace , the service reported only one suicide in June .
Just among Guard and Reserve soldiers , suicides have occurred at a higher rate this year than last year , according to Army figures .
There have been 65 confirmed or suspected cases this year , compared with 42 for the same period last year .

PRINT — Pending Homes Sales Crash
The Index of pending home sales fell a record 30 % in May to a record - low reading of 77.6 — two hugely pessimistic predictors of future prices nationwide .
Yet the combination of two record negatives went barely reported when the stats were announced last week .
So here ’s the news for you now , a week late , but new to the marketplace of ideas .
Pending - home sales have crashed and now stand below the worst numbers we have seen since the housing crash started in 2006 .
The rubber bands and duct tape are breaking apart in the property market .
Presume the fix of a fall is in .
Take a look at the three charts below .
Judge for yourself how important the facts are which the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) announced last Thursday ( July 1 ) .
I personally find them startling , alarming , critical to review .
The oversight by major news outlets — snubbing record negatives — is egregious by virtue of its ignorance of the expiration of the free - down - payment program .
The pending - home - sales stat gave us our first view of buyer demand for housing without the hugely popular prop from the federal government .
I am not saying here that the news was buried .
I am saying that reporters failed to do the most basic leg work .
Even those who lucked out and stumbled upon the record stats , they failed to comprehend the importance of the new data .
I would have missed it too if I had n’t charted the numbers myself , but I did , so I did n’t miss it .
***
Speculation has run rampant as commentators have wondered about the direction of prices as government support starts to fall away .
The future direction of real estate prices is a major obsession of almost all economy watchers as the monthly bill for shelter overshadows others , as the value of homes is a predominant factor of family wealth , and because the banking sector has huge investments based upon residential property .
“ If you ’re looking for a silver lining in housing , you are n’t going to find it here , ” Mike Larson of Weiss Research said .
“ Demand has fallen off a cliff in the wake of the tax credit expiration , with pending sales falling by the biggest margin ever to the lowest level ever . ”
Mr. Larson ’s comment drew attention to the two new record lows .
His name is on every story that mentioned one or both record stats .
Had he remained silent , these highly relevant record lows would have gone unreported completely .
Of the 15 major media outlets i reviewed , four actually did learn about both of the record negatives , but they did n’t understand the meaning of it .
The statement by NAR announcing pending - home sales makes no reference to either the record fall or the record new low .
If their intention was to hide bad news , they got away with murder .
Let ’s show you the fools who fell for it .
***
Among the outlets who failed to uncover either of the two record negative stats are Barrons , Dow Jones , The Financial Times , Fox Business , The Los Angeles Times , and Marketwatch .
I reviewed stories on pending - home sales by 15 leading news outlets – in addition to the flunking students mentioned immediately above , I also read Atlaticwire.com , BBC News , Bloomberg , Boston.com , CNBC , Investors ’ Business Daily , New York Times , Reuters , US News — and the only difference between the outlets was the extent to which they screwed up this critical epicenter - type data set ( Please see the graphic nearby depicting the various degrees of incompetence . ) .
The future direction of housing prices are arguably the most critical factor in the most critical nation in the most critical financial crisis since the Great Depression .
The signs are not hunky - dory in this market .
The May pending - sale figures may in retrospect serve as a Rosetta Stone : A perfect guide to the true fortunes of residential real estate .
Just in case you have forgotten , we are in one hell of a market , and Mom did not tell us this is what would happen when we grow up .

HousingStory.net estimates current inventory for sale of 3.9 million is 1.2 million units higher than it should be , and not too far away from the record high 4.5 million .
Inventory stands at 8.3 months of sales , but it should be at 5.8 months .
Fourteen percent of mortgages are behind on payments — about 7.7 million borrowers or , more starkly , one in seven .
A record 4.63 percent of borrowers are in foreclosure .
Approximately 13 million homeowners have no equity or negative equity .
They would make nothing from the sale of their house if they could sell it .
Or they would lose a little or a lot .
Thus do we have the phenomena of strategic default — now as common as no-money - down mortgages during the boom .
***
We are in a pause of a tectonic shift of plates .
Prices have been flat since August 2009 , but are down 30 % from their peak .
The fall of 30 % was almost completely discounted as impossible prior to its occurrence .
My speculation is that the fate of bubble - mortgage debt remains as our key obstacle blocking recovery ( Unbelievers should rent the Godzilla movie “ Eating the Lost Decades of Japan ” for further enlightenment . ) .
Total mortgage balances remain almost unchanged from the peak of the bubble – $ 11.68 trillion today versus $ 11.95 trillion at the peak ( see chart below ) .
The data released last week on pending home sales and the dismal record of reporting on that data proves that breaking news business journalism fails even in surface scratching .
The cows just want to feed on the grass in front of them and go on to the next field .
The smart investor is going to look at these charts on pending - home sales and have a real advantage over the common media consumer .
Readers of my work know I have found pessimistic facts easy to find .
The pending - sales figures are a dramatic concurrence — a record fall and a record low .
So I will give you my opinion :
All hell has broken loose all over again in real estate .
Do n’t buy a home .
Sell one .

Oakland police are investigating City Councilwomen Jean Quan and Rebecca Kaplan for their decision to join a human line that blocked police from moving up Broadway during the demonstration Thursday night .
" The whole civil unrest incident is still under investigation , " said Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason , who added that additional arrests are likely .
" Regarding council members Quan and Kaplan , they are not exempt from this , " he said .
The councilwomen , who are both running for mayor , say they were merely acting as peacekeepers , trying to calm a tense situation .
The event in question began on Broadway near City Hall a few hours after a Los Angeles jury found former BART police Officer Johannes Mehserle guilty of involuntary manslaughter for fatally shooting Oscar Grant , an unarmed train passenger .
About 1,000 people gathered downtown after the verdict was announced .
When police began clearing the street and threatening demonstrators with arrest , tensions began to rise .
Quan and Kaplan helped to form a line that separated the protesters from getting to the cops - a line that also stopped the advancing police officers .
Quan , who as chairwoman of the council 's budget committee has been the subject of robo calls by the police union over the layoffs , said through a City Hall aide that her goal was " to keep things peaceful and help keep the police from overreacting and equally keep the crowd from overreacting . "
Kaplan said their actions " helped prevent things from escalating . "
The cops see it differently .
" They were encouraging people not to listen to us , " said one officer who was on the line .
" At one point , Kaplan was even giving a TV interview while her arms were locked , blocking us .
" If we had needed to go into the crowd , we should n't have to worry about going through a council member first , " the cop said .
Meanwhile : Oakland 's police tab for responding to Mehserle 's involuntary manslaughter verdict will top $ 1 million , according to preliminary reports from City Hall .
And that does n't include the costs incurred by the 15 other agencies that sent officers to help .
In addition to overtime costs , Oakland paid for setting up two police staging areas and also feeding hundreds of cops from other departments .
For example , the California Highway Patrol sent 400 officers from as far away as Fresno .
Oakland City Administrator DanLindheim and other officials have privately met with BART General Manager Dorothy Dugger to ask the transit agency to contribute to the city 's mounting tab .
BART spokesman Linton Johnson said , however , that it is unlikely BART would pay for any of the mutual aid , though the agency is planning a $ 25,000 donation to one of the community groups that hosted anti-violence rallies .
Rent free : San Francisco Planning Director John Rahaim has been hit with a $ 1,000 fine by the city 's Ethics Commission for not reporting the free use of a condo owned by the father of one of his employees .
The worker , Kelley Andur , was later promoted to director of neighborhood planning .
Rahaim moved into the condo when he was left homeless after his partner , Lance Farber , started a fire in the historic fire chief 's house .
The couple were staying there while shopping for a permanent home .
Farber was ordered to pay $ 50,760 in damages and went into substance abuse treatment .
He died earlier this year .
After the fire , Rahaim took up temporary residence in the unoccupied condo .
" I offered to pay rent , " Rahaim said , " but they would n't take it . "
Rahaim eventually reported the free condo on his annual statement of economic interest form , but it was still a violation of the city 's $ 390 gift limit .
Into the arena : San Francisco State University professor and CBS - 5 political analyst Joe Tuman has joined the list of candidates running for mayor of Oakland .
" This town is in crisis , " Tuman said .
" We need someone who will address the major structural problems and make difficult decisions .
And that may mean making choices that career politicians worried about re-election simply will not make . "
Tuman , a 25 - year Oakland resident , said that he is the only one running who is not a career politician - so he fit the bill .
Day Tripper : KTVU reporter Rob Roth was in Golden Gate Park for his son's baseball game on Saturday afternoon when he glanced up and saw Paul McCartney riding up the bicycle path .
( He was n't wearing a helmet . )
" Game going OK ? " McCartney called out .
" Yeah , " Roth said .
" You think you might want to sing the ' Star - Spangled Banner ' ? "
" I'm afraid I ca n't right now , " the British - born McCartney called back as he pedaled onward , followed by an unidentified woman and a contingent of security .

Americans are suffering because Republicans do n’t care who they have to hurt in their attempts to manipulate US Voters .
More than 1.3 million laid - off workers wo n’t get their unemployment benefits reinstated before Congress goes on a weeklong vacation for Independence Day .
An additional 200,000 people who have been without a job for at least six months stand to lose their benefits each week , unless Congress acts .
For the third time in as many weeks , Republicans in the Senate successfully filibustered a bill Wednesday night to continue providing unemployment checks to people who been laid off for long stretches .
The House is slated to vote on a similar measure Thursday , though the Senate ’s action renders the vote a futile gesture as Congress prepares to depart Washington for its holiday recess .
A little more than 1.3 million people have already lost benefits since the last extension ran out at the end of May .
" It is beyond disappointing that Republicans continue to stand almost lockstep against assistance for out - of - work Americans , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev .
The measure , however , stands a better chance of passing after a replacement is seated for Sen. Robert C. Byrd , D - W.Va. , who died Monday .
The measure fell two votes short of the 60 needed to advance Wednesday night , but only because Reid , a supporter of the bill , voted " nay " to take a procedural step that would allow for a revote .
" We will vote on this measure again once there is a replacement named for the late Sen. Byrd , " Reid said .
Byrd ’s successor will be named by West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin , a Democrat .
Unable to deliver more stimulus spending for President Barack Obama , Democrats in Congress had hoped to at least restore the jobless benefits .
Obama has urged lawmakers to spend about $ 50 billion to help states pay for Medicaid programs and to avoid teacher layoffs , but Democrats in Congress have been unable to come up with the votes .
Many Democrats see state aid and unemployment benefits as insurance against the economy sliding back into recession .
However , many Republicans and some Democrats worry about adding to the growing national debt … [ emphasis added ]
Inserted from < Common Dreams >
Aid to unemployed workers is an excellent way to stimulate job growth , because the recipients spend their benefits immediately to fulfill their day - to day needs .
But the GOP wants to prevent job growth , as long as Democrats are in power .
Not only are Republicans trying to deceive voters by preventing solutions to problems they caused and blaming Democrats , but also , they are manipulating the progressive base to turn us against Obama .
Rachel Maddow ran two segments that have bearing on the GOP tactics .
In the first she and DNC Chair , Tim Kaine , discuss this vote .
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
In the second , she and columnist , Ezra Klein , discuss the tactics .
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Ezra has his head so far up his butt that he ’s breathing pure methane .
Rachel ’s view is the correct one .
The Senate has a long tradition of collegial cooperation .
It has been an unwritten rule for over a century .
Democrats are still playing by it , but Republicans are not .
When Republicans pretend to be playing by the rules , Democrats respond habitually .
Republicans are like a woman who leads a man on , lasciviously and seductively implying a night of passion , enjoying the flowers , candy , gifts , dinner , and dancing , and knowing all along that they will leave him with a peck on his cheek and a bulge in his pants .
Tensions are escalating between Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , and despite attempts by both sides to cool tempers , a confrontation between the two figures appears virtually inevitable .
Votes by Yisrael Beiteinu ministers against the state budget this weekend , the battle over the conversion bill , the foreign minister 's appointment Friday of an acting UN ambassador without Netanyahu 's consent and Lieberman 's call for a " disengagement " from Gaza on the eve of the premier 's Egypt visit - all have only exacerbated an already strained working relationship .

Sources close to Netanyahu said the deterioration has been perceptible for weeks , peaking when Lieberman fumed at being left out of arranging the June meeting in Brussels between Industry , Trade and Labor Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and the Turkish foreign minister .
Still , the sources said , Lieberman 's actions over the past few days came as a surprise to the prime minister .
Netanyahu learned of the foreign minister 's unilateral appointment of an acting UN envoy by reading it in the press , and reportedly denounced the move as unacceptable .
The prime minister had delayed filling the post for months , hoping to appoint a senior public figure rather than the relatively unknown diplomat Lieberman chose , Meiron Reuven .
Lieberman's " disengagement " plan , widely viewed as a slight to Cairo ahead of Netanyahu 's visit , was neither coordinated with the prime minister nor received his approval - points Netanyahu is expected to emphasize at today 's meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
" Policies on this matter are set by the prime minister and the cabinet , " a Netanyahu source quoted the prime minister as saying this weekend .
" That 's how it has always been , and that 's how it will remain . "
In closed - door meetings over the weekend , Netanyahu said that in the coming days he intends to ask Lieberman to explain his actions .
The prime minister and foreign minister had already held conciliatory meetings after the Ben-Eliezer incident , though this time Netanyahu is expected to strike a firmer tone in a bid to iron out the differences of opinion between the two officials and their respective parties .
Budget stunner
Netanyahu was reportedly stunned during Friday 's budget meeting by the behavior of Yisrael Beiteinu ministers , who had apparently received instructions from Lieberman before his trip to Kazakhstan to firmly oppose the budget backed by Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz .
Leading the Yisrael Beiteinu offensive was Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov , appointed by Lieberman to oversee budget negotiations in his stead .
A source at the cabinet meeting said Misezhnikov addressed Netanyahu bluntly , essentially " hurling insults " at the prime minister .
" All of the other Yisrael Beiteinu ministers joined him shortly after , " the source said .
" It was like a well - synchronized orchestra . "
Another item on the Netanyahu - Lieberman agenda is the row over a bill that would ease the terms of religious conversion , scheduled to be heard in the Knesset a week from now , before the summer recess gets underway .
Under pressure from U.S. Jewish groups , Netanyahu has sought to stall the bill 's passing , but Lieberman and members of his Knesset faction maintain that failure to pass it would signify a violation of coalition agreements .
Amid the rising tension , Lieberman and his associates have issued conciliatory statements insisting they have no intention of quitting the coalition .
They explained the UN ambassador 's appointment as the result of an urgent need to fill a vacant post , and noted that the foreign minister had raised his plan to sever ties with Gaza on several earlier occasions .
" We believe the matter will ultimately be settled , " Lieberman associates said .
This weekend Misezhnikov reiterated that his party is not planning to leave the coalition .
" We do n't want to replace the coalition or leave the government that we built with our own two hands , " he said .
" But we are n't the ones who sent Fuad [ Ben- Eliezer ] to talk to the Turks .
When Netanyahu needed us a week ago in the Ministerial Committee for Legislation , he knew exactly how to speak to us nicely and make all kinds of promises over the budget . "
On the budget , Misezhnikov said , " This is not how you conduct negotiations .
Whoever thinks he has defeated us is plain wrong . "
Supreme court judges predicted that " more and more " gay and lesbian refugees are likely to seek protection in Britain after a landmark legal ruling recognised the rights of asylum seekers .
Five supreme court justices said gay and lesbian asylum seekers should not be expected to " exercise discretion " in their home countries to avoid persecution .
Their ruling met with cheers and applause from campaigners .
But the Home Office moved to dampen claims from anti-immigration groups that the ruling could lead to a massive expansion of asylum claims from " millions of people around the world " .
Lord Hope , one of the judges , said that for many years some countries had simply insisted homosexuality did not exist , which avoided the evil of persecution .
However , anti-gay sentiment had dramatically worsened in some places , fanned by " the rampant homophobic teaching that right - wing evangelical Christian churches indulge in throughout much of sub- Saharan Africa " and " the ultra - conservative interpretation of Islamic law that prevails in Iran " .
The gulf was set grow , he said .
" More and more gays and lesbians are likely to have to seek protection here as protection is being denied to them by the state in their home countries . "
They cited parallel British examples of being free to enjoy going to a Kylie concert , cocktails , or talking about men to female friends .
The home secretary , Theresa May , said the ruling was a vindication of the coalition government 's decision to halt the deportation of asylum seekers whose sexual orientation had put them at proven risk of imprisonment , torture or execution .
" I do not believe it is acceptable to send people home and expect them to hide their sexuality to avoid persecution , " said May .
" Asylum decisions will be considered under the new rules . "
The Liberal Democrat deputy leader , Simon Hughes , said he hoped the ruling would go some way to restoring Britain 's reputation as a human rights haven .
He appealed to other countries to follow .
Stonewall , the lesbian , gay and bisexual charity , said there were 80 UN member countries where consensual homosexual sex was still illegal , including six that imposed the death penalty .
Uganda is deciding whether or not to become the seventh .
But Sir Andrew Green , chairman of the campaign group Migrationwatch , said the ruling " could apply to millions of people around the world " .
He added : " An applicant has now only to show that he or she is homosexual and intends to return and live openly in one of the many countries where it is illegal , to be granted asylum in the UK . "
The Home Office said this was unlikely , as each individual had to prove they faced a personal threat of persecution or imprisonment .
The applicants whose case was decided by the supreme court , an Iranian known as " HJ " , 40 , and a Cameroonian , " HT " , 36 , have had their claims referred back to tribunals .
They were refused asylum on the grounds that they could avoid persecution by exercising " discretion " in their countries , despite the possibility of being beheaded in Iran , and an attack on HT in Cameroon in which a crowd beat him and attempted to cut off his penis with a knife .
The men challenged the law after a previous court of appeal ruling stated that asylum could be refused depending on " whether discretion was something that the applicant could reasonably be expected to tolerate " .
Abbey Kiwanuka , 29 , from Uganda , said : " This gives me hope for my appeal .
I feared for my life in Uganda .
Just two weeks ago a gay man was beheaded .
I lost my appeal because the court said I should go back and live a discreet life .
I can't do that .
It 's impossible to do . "
Dell 's new tablet called the Streak is set to make its debut in the U.S. this summer .
But while temperatures have been soaring , there 's still no sign of the device .
The Streak , which was launched in Britain last month for 450 British pounds , is expected to be available on AT&T for $ 500 .
Dell now says it has been testing the device and hopes to have it in the hands of U.S. consumers soon .
The company still wo n't disclose the exact availability .
Meanwhile , Gadget Lab got some hands - on time with the U.S. version of the Streak .
Nearly 30 percent thinner than the iPhone 3G S , the Streak bills itself as a tablet but also offers the option of a SIM card in it , so you can make phone calls .
The device includes 3G connectivity and a 1 - GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor .
Think of it as a turbocharged phone .
" The 3.5 - inch - to - 4 - inch screen devices are optimized primarily around the phone experience , " says Kevin Andrew , product manager for Dell .
" The Streak is for those who want something bigger than a phone but not something so big they have to carry it separately . "
The Streak fits the bill .
It is ultrathin , lightweight ( 7.8 ounces ) and extremely easy to use .
Read on for our hands - on impression of the tablet .
The Streak 's 5 - inch touchscreen display is just a little bigger than the latest crop of Android smartphones ( HTC Evo and Droid X each sport a 4.3 - inch touchscreen ) but significantly smaller than the iPad 's 9.7 - inch display .
That puts the Streak in an awkward middle ground : too big to be a phone , too small to directly take on the iPad .
But the Streak 's 5 - inch display looks much better in real life than it sounds on paper .
The screen is smooth , responsive and big enough to comfortably type on and access different widgets .
The device itself is ultrathin , just 9.9 mm thick compared to the iPhone 3 G's 12.3 mm and almost on par with the iPhone 4 .
It slips easily into your jeans or jacket pocket and does n't feel awkward if you hold it up to your ear to make a phone call .
The Streak has just one 30 - pin connector and no USB port .
The Streak runs Android 1.6 , which seems ancient considering that Google has released Android 2.2 Froyo .
But Dell says it has created an enhanced version of Android 1.6 that puts it almost on par with Android 2.0 Eclair .
" If you compare Android 1.6 on the Streak to Eclair , the only feature that is missing versus Eclair is the live wallpapers , " says Andrew .
The Android experience on the Streak is very similar to what we have seen on the latest Android cellphones .
The Streak supports up to six home screens .
The main screen ( shown above ) has icons for phone , calendar , messaging , browser , maps and market , among other things .
A small round dot at the top left corner of the screen acts as a shortcut to applications .
Streak users can download apps from the Android market .
The Streak has a 5 - megapixel camera on the back and 0.3 - megapixel VGA videocam on the front .
It can shoot videos up to 720 p ( 1280 x 720 pixels resolution ) .
Sharing photos is easy and should be familiar to most Android phone users ; Click on the photo , choose the Share button from the virtual menu and pick Facebook , Twitter or Flickr to upload it to .
Dell also offers an accessory dock , with an HDMI output that can be connected to a TV .
The Streak will have a user - replaceable battery , internal storage of 2 GB and additional storage up to 32 GB using a microSD card .
Overall , the Streak is an exciting , well - engineered device that should appeal to consumers who want to supersize their phone .
But that also means its unlikely to have Apple or iPad fans quaking .
The Streak seems like a tablet for a very different audience than the iPad .

When your mind drifts , it 's hard to remember what was going on before you stopped paying attention .
Now a new study has found that the effect is stronger when your mind drifts farther - to memories of an overseas vacation instead of a domestic trip , for example , or a memory in the more distant past .
Psychologists have known for a while that context is important to remembering .
If you leave the place where a memory was made - its context - it will be harder for you to recall the memory .
Previous studies had also found that thinking about something else - daydreaming or mind - wandering - blocks access to memories of the recent past .
Psychological scientists Peter F. Delaney and Lili Sahakyan of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and Colleen M. Kelley and Carissa A. Zimmerman of Florida State University wanted to know if the content of your daydreams affects your ability to access a recently - acquired memory .
For one experiment , each participant looked at a list of words as they appeared on a computer screen , one at a time .
Then they were told to think either about home - where they 'd been that morning - or about their parents ' house - where they had n't been in several weeks .
Next , the participant was shown a second list of words .
At the end of the test , they had to recall as many of the words from the two lists as possible .
Participants who had thought about the place they 'd been only a few hours before remembered more of the words from the first list than did participants who had thought back several weeks .
The same was true for memories about place , tested in a second experiment .
Those who thought about a vacation within the U.S. remembered more words than those who thought about a vacation abroad .
The study is published in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science .
One practical application of the research might be for people who want to forget about something .
" If there 's something you do n't feel like thinking about , you 're better off remembering a more distant event than a close event , to try to put it out of your mind for a while , " says Delaney .
" It can help you feel like you 're in a different situation . "
Explore further Differences in recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse
SEXUALLY abusing a child is as sinful as eating soup with a dessert spoon , Pope Benedict confirmed last night .
Launching the latest edition of The Vatican ’s Quarterly Guide to Sinning , the Pope said that God would take up to three years to forgive those who misused cutlery , placing it in the same ‘ Sin Basket ’ as underage sodomy .
The Pontiff said : “ I ’ve arranged all the major sins in a series of handy baskets .
The top basket is things like condoms and abortion and women having thoughts .
“ The next basket is certain kinds of war and being a bit shy with the old collection plate .
And down here in the 24th basket is child buggery and spoon ignorance .
“ That does n’t mean that spoon ignorance is okay , it just means that if you are , for instance , a priest and you get stuck into a bowl of Scotch broth with the spoon that was positioned at the top of the place setting at right angles to the knife and fork , then there ’s only so much we can do to protect you . ”
He added : “ Men who use the wrong cutlery have simply lost their way on the path to God .
And we also have to remember that , in the right light , a dessert spoon can be incredibly sexy . ”
Outlining the latest sin formulas , the Pope said that child violation equalled three parking tickets or two consecutive weeks of putting paper and plastic in the same recycling bag .
Meanwhile , the Church is now offering an exchange rate of three acts of paedophilia to one act of fly - tipping .

Update : err , oops .
I seem to have been writing this at the same time as Jess was writing hers , but she pipped me to the post .
Sorry , Jess !
Update # 2 : ( what I think is ) the full cabinet has now been announced and it is a sea of white people .
The single minority representative is Baroness Sayeeda Warsi , who becomes the first Muslim woman to serve in Cabinet as Conservative Party Chairman .
The Cabinet has 4 female representatives out of 23 posts ( that ’s 17 % , folks ) .
There ’s another 6 white men attending cabinet , so the meetings will be 14 % female and 3 % minority ethnic .
For the record , the most recent national population estimates put us at 16 % non White British .
The full cabinet line up is here .
So women ’s representation in parliament may have inched up , but so far Cameron ’s cabinet seems woefully lacking in any diversity whatsoever .
Obviously the situation ’s moving quickly but , as of Wednesday morning , the posts which have been announced ( and they ’re the most important ones ) have gone exclusively to white men .
Step forward : Deputy Prime Minister , Nick Clegg ; Foreign Secretary William Hague ; Chancellor George Osborne ( yes , he ’s taking charge of our recession stricken economy with a degree in history and never having held a proper job ) ; Defense Secretary Liam Fox ; Health Secretary Andrew Lansley ; Business & Banking Secretary Vince Cable ; and Energy & Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne .
At time of writing the BBC also expects David Laws , Danny Alexander and Michael Gove to have some cabinet role yet to be announced .
White men the lot of ’em .
All but two of them graduated from Oxbridge , and the majority of them went to private schools .
I can see Cameron really meant it when he promised ‘ change ’ .
Where is Theresa May ?
Caroline Spelman ?
Sayeeda Warsi ?
Are they the ministers who will to ‘ fall on their swords ’ to make space for the white men the Lib Dems are putting forward ?
Cameron ’s shadow cabinet was pretty sorely lacking in diversity , but his actual cabinet so far is worse still .
I suppose that ’s not entirely surprising given the profile of the people from each party doing the negotiating ( the title of that article says it all ) .
Let ’s hope that things pick up rapidly as new announcements emerge from No10 .
So far , none of the female shadow ministers have been displaced in the announcements but some relatively senior white men have been , and it seems possible there could be some ‘ bumping down ’ through the hierarchy of portfolios until the women ( including the single Asian member ) of the shadow cabinet get bumped into junior ministerial positions .
For a whole host of reasons we should be keeping a beady eye on Cameron ’s government .
This is just the first .
Enlarge By Justin Sullivan , Getty Images U.S. Army soldiers carry a critically wounded colleague on a stretcher Thursday to a waiting helicopter near Kandahar , Afghanistan .
WASHINGTON  Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday that the United States and its allies are not " bogged down " in Afghanistan despite the delay of a planned offensive in the southern city of Kandahar .
The remarks come one day after President Obama relieved the commander of allied forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , and nominated Gen. David Petraeus to replace him .
U.S. officials worked to allay concerns that the abrupt change reflects any lack of commitment on the part of the White House or flaws in its strategy .
Obama said the United States will " not miss a beat " as a result of the change .
HEARTS AND MINDS : Negotiation is Army 's secret weapon
One of the key advantages of appointing Petraeus is his familiarity with the region , Gates said .
Petraeus heads Central Command , which oversees wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and so will need little schooling before assuming command .
The Defense secretary said Obama himself raised the idea of replacing McChrystal with Petraeus during a meeting Tuesday .
Key Senate leaders pledged to quickly confirm Petraeus ' appointment in order to minimize any disruption caused by the change .
Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , announced a Tuesday morning hearing .
Obama accepted McChrystal 's resignation after the general and his top aides were quoted in a Rolling Stone article describing their civilian leaders or counterparts in disparaging ways .
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Gates praised McChrystal 's career but did not defend or excuse the remarks in the article .
" Honestly , when I first read it , I was nearly sick , " Mullen said .
" I was stunned . "
Mullen said the comments from McChrystal and his staff had the effect of challenging civilian oversight over the military , a bedrock principle .
Nevertheless , Gates and Mullen drew a distinction between the intemperate remarks made by McChrystal and his staff and the conduct of the war .
The leadership change comes at a critical time .
About 30,000 additional servicemembers have been pouring into Afghanistan as part of a broader effort to seize the initiative from the Taliban .
An offensive in Marjah , a Taliban stronghold in the south , decisively drove insurgents from the town this winter , but the U.S. military and Afghan government have struggled to build an effective local government in its wake .
Coalition and Afghan forces are now turning their attention to Kandahar , which was the Taliban 's spiritual homeland .
Gates said the military needed more time to improve political conditions there before starting the offensive .
" I do not believe we are bogged down , " Gates said .
" I believe we are making some progress .
It is slower and harder than we anticipated . "

h/t Raw Story : Toxicologist : Oil / Corexit mix caused heart trouble , organ damage , rectal bleeding :
Shrimpers who had bare - skin contact with the mixture of oil and Corexit , she said , were not so lucky .
Read on ...
Dr. Susan Shaw , founder and director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute , said during a CNN broadcast that after personally diving the oil spill in late May , a " very fiery sore throat " plagued her from inhaling fumes coming off the water .
Because she was covered from head to toe in a protective suit , Dr. Shaw was spared direct exposure .
Shrimpers who were exposed to a mixture of oil and Corexit dispersant in the Gulf of Mexico suffered severe symptoms such as muscle spasms , heart palpitations , headaches that last for weeks and bleeding from the rectum , according to a marine toxicologist who issued the warning Friday on a cable news network .
And as Laffy noted at The Political Carnival the LA Health Dept. is getting into the act now : La. Health Dep’t .
Memo :
“ We have serious concerns about the lack of information related to the use of dispersants ” :
The following memo is proof that the necessary studies were not , and have not yet been , done by BP ( or the EPA ) before BP decided to continue killing our ocean , harming sea life and wild life , and poisoning Amercians with toxic dispersants , with the EPA rubber - stamping the whole thing .
Read on .. .
He reminded me , and I will now remind you , that BP is in charge of poisoning the Gulf with dispersants .
The EPA is just along for the ride .
However , necessary technical studies were not done before the Big Decision .
My friend and senior policy analyst at the EPA ’s office of solid waste and emergency response , Hugh Kaufman ( altakocker on Twitter ) , sent me a link to the above memo .
And she has much more on the concerns about the use of the dispersants here .
Scientists : Obama not doing enough +
VIDEO : Shrimpers exposed to Corexit “ bleeding from the rectum ” .
Transcript of Dr. Shaw 's interview via CNN below the fold .
RICK SANCHEZ : But interestingly enough , someone I 've been following now for the better part of a month is Susan Shaw .
Susan
Shaw is a marine toxicologist who you 're about to hear from .
She dove into the oily Gulf waters to see for herself what was going on under water .
She was the first to do so .
And I read her columns , and I 've been trying to get a hold of her .
And every time we called her she was some place like Tokyo or Hong Kong or something , and we could n't get a hold of her .
So , finally , we got her , and what a perfect day to talk to her .
Because , Susan , I do n't know if you know this , but we 've had Philippe Cousteau and some of our people under water today showing us these murky waters that they say would normally be clear , but now they 're not .
First of all , thank you for being with us .
Your impression of what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico , beneath the surface ?
SUSAN SHAW , MARINE TOXICOLOGIST :
Well , when you go into the water , you realize quickly what 's going on .
The oil from the surface is breaking up into smaller pieces , globules , and this is a dispersed oil that contains the COREXIT .
So it 's a combination of COREXIT and oil .
And I think what people do n't realize is how toxic that dispersed oil really is .
The COREXIT contains solvents , petroleum solvents .
The oil contains hydrocarbons .
And the combination is lethal to many , many organisms under the water .
But when I was there , I could see .
It looks exactly like plankton .
Plankton gets all mixed up in it , and it kills plankton right away .
But all the fish and animals that eat plankton , like the small fish , they 're going after this dispersed oil and taking that in .
So that 's another layer where you have an immediate lethal effect on part of the food ( INAUDIBLE ) .
And that 's what we 've been concerned about all along .
SANCHEZ : So that 's interesting .
I had n't heard that before .
What you just explained to the viewers is that the animals that generally eat plankton , sometimes large animals -- whale sharks eat plankton , interestingly enough , or take it in .
SHAW : Whale sharks .
Right .
SANCHEZ : Yes .
And they -- because it looks like plankton , they 're eating it , but actually what they 're eating is a combination of oil and dispersants ?
SHAW : That 's right .
They 're going through the -- these animals go through the water column with their mouths wide open .
They 're indiscriminately eating what they think is plankton .
And with all of this dispersed oil in the plumes , that is exactly what they 're eating , is dispersed oil .
And the reason this is so toxic is because of these solvents that penetrate the skin of anything that 's going through the dispersed oil , takes the oil into the cells , takes the oil into the organs very quickly .
And this stuff is toxic to every organ system in the body .
So we 've been really concerned .
SANCHEZ : Let me just ask you the obvious question that a lot of our viewers want to know and a lot of people have been asking .
Would it have been different or worse or better to not use the dispersant and then just let the oil go into the Gulf of Mexico , or at least as the dispersant broke it up enough to help ?
SHAW : Well , this was a tradeoff that was discussed , you know , and they made their decision to save the wetlands , the marshes from the thick oil by dispersing it into the ocean , thinking that that was the least of evils .
But actually , it is n't the least of evils .
We 're starting to see a lot of death out there .
I just got off of a shrimping boat .
I was out in an area of the Gulf that is -- it 's definitely oiled .
And I heard what is dead out there is just amazing .
All of the shrimp have died .
All of the oysters .
All of the crabs .
All of the small fish .
I was out there for hours on this boat .
We saw barely any birds .
This is an area that is so rich in life , and now there is so much death out there .
There 's no fish .
The birds are starving .
SANCHEZ : We just talked to a coral specialist --
SHAW : It 's really bad .
SANCHEZ : -- who , by the way -- we just talked to a coral specialist , Susan , a little while ago , Dr. Shaw , who told us that 75 percent of the coral he had found had died in that area as well .
SHAW : Right .
SANCHEZ : OK .
Before I let you go , long - term view here ?
As a scientist , as an expert in this particular field , what do you believe will be the long - term effect of that which we 're seeing now , which we can't yet understand perhaps ?
SHAW : Well , I think we 've lost a lot .
We 've lost generations of fish .
We 've lost pieces of this food web that 'll never come back .
You know , it 's going to take decades and decades .
And I think the dispersant , the whole plan around the dispersants has made the situation far worse than if we just sucked up the oil with some technology that works that would have been far better .
But now we 're going to look at long - term effects throughout the food web and people .
And if we -- I can tell you what happens -- because I was in the oil -- to people .
I do n't know if we have the time --
SANCHEZ : Go ahead .
Finish up .
You 've piqued my curiosity .
SHAW : OK .
So I got a very fiery sore throat after being in the water .
I had covered myself , all of my skin , so it was n't skin contact , but the fumes .
But I talked to shrimpers today who were throwing their nets into the water .
It 's about a month ago when they were using the more toxic COREXIT , the 9527 .
The water from the nets splashed on his skin and he got a headache that lasted for three weeks .
He had heart palpitations .
He had muscle spasms and bleeding in the -- bleeding from the rectum .
And that 's what that COREXIT does .
It ruptures red blood cells , causes internal bleeding , and liver and kidney damage .
So this stuff is so toxic , combined , it 's not the oil alone , the dispersant alone .
It 's the dispersed oil that still contains this stuff .
It 's very , very toxic .
It goes right through skin .
SANCHEZ : Dr. Susan
Shaw is a marine toxicologist who we 've been wanting to get on for quite a while , because we knew she had some information to share with the rest of us about -- firsthand information about what 's going on in the Gulf of Mexico .
I 'm glad we finally had a chance to get you on , Dr. Shaw .
Thanks for being with us .
We appreciate your time .
SHAW : Thank you .
Machine Learning Engine
Behavioral Recognition Systems , Inc. , USA
Behavioral Recognition Systems is a technology start - up based in Houston , Texas specializing in Behavioral Analytics ™ -- on - the - fly behavior analysis of video - feed content using AI techniques and technologies .
We began developing our Lisp - based Machine Learning Engine in 2006 using the best of the open source Lisp compilers then available .
After several months we decided that we really needed a more stable , better supported compiler and began looking for other solutions .
After speaking with several commercial Lisp vendors we decided that LispWorks provided the best price - performance combination available .
Nothing in the ensuing two years has given us any reason to regret that decision .
Updates have been timely and benign .
On the rare occasions when we have found bugs , they have been fixed rapidly .
When we thought we needed additional features or needed the compiler to work differently that it did , LispWorks technical support suggested solutions within the existing capabilities of the product to solve our problems .
If we persisted in asking for extensions to the product , then the extensions were added .
While our more " hardcore " developers still do use Emacs as a development environment , the LispWorks IDE has proven to be quick , convenient , and so powerful that even they resort to it when debugging problem code .
The source code for the Machine Learning Engine has now grown to more than 185 thousand lines of Lisp code , yet LispWorks compiles it all from a clean start into a tight native binary in less than 90 seconds .
The engine is massively multi-threaded ( typically 30 - 35 threads ) , and large ( typically 2 - 3GB RAM ) , yet the generated code is so stable that the product can run for literally months at a time .
The Machine Learning Engine , entirely implemented in LispWorks , is the core technology underlying our AISight™ product .
We could never have come so far , so quickly , without LispWorks .

Shock new evidence of a NASA scientist faking a fundamental greenhouse gas equation shames beleaguered space administration in new global warming fraud scandal .
Caught in the heat are NASA 's Dr. Judith Curry and a junk science equation by the space agency ’s Dr. Gavin Schmidt creating disarray over a contentious Earth energy graph .
The internal row was ignited by the release of a sensational new research paper discrediting calculations crucial to the greenhouse gas theory .
Hot on the heels of my recent scoop that the U.S. space agency may have suppressed evidence from the Apollo Moon landings that invalidated the greenhouse gas ( GHG ) theory , an internecine fury among NASA employees over fudged equations is set to further embarrass the current U.S. Administration ’s stand on global warming .
Word is getting round that junk equations were threaded into the GHG theory to artificially inflate the heating effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by a factor of two .
The spark to this cataclysmic revelation was lit in April 2007 after a public gaffe ( see below ) by the space administration ’s Dr. Gavin Schmidt , who fronts popular pro-global warming website , ‘ Real Climate .

An official decision to bring no charges against the policeman who struck Ian Tomlinson minutes before he died at the G20 protests is under intense scrutiny as it emerged that the Independent Police Complaints Commission had backed a prosecution for manslaughter .
Keir Starmer , the director of public prosecutions , acknowledged there was evidence that the officer , named as PC Simon Harwood , assaulted Tomlinson , 47 , minutes before he died .
But he said there was no realistic prospect of conviction because of " sharp disagreements " between pathologists .
The decision was met with fury by Tomlinson 's family , who accused the authorities of a 16 - month cover - up over the death of the seller on 1 April last year , when he was seen on video being struck by an officer and then shoved to the ground , despite behaving peacefully .
The Crown Prosecution Service 's view clashes with that of an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
The Guardian has learned the IPCC concluded there was sufficient evidence to charge the officer with manslaughter , and told Tomlinson 's family so .
The first postmortem by Dr Freddy Patel endorsed the police 's version of events , ruling that he died from a heart attack .
But a direct challenge to the CPS also emerged last night from Dr Nat Cary , the second forensic pathologist who examined Tomlinson 's body .
He told the Guardian prosecutors made a factual error in dismissing a charge of actual bodily harm .
He said his report contained clear evidence that Tomlinson suffered injuries sufficient to support an ABHcharge .
The CPS dismissed the injuries as " relatively minor " and thus not enough to support a charge of ABH in its written reasons given to the family .
Cary , speaking for the first time about the case , said : " I 'm quite happy to challenge that .
The injuries were not relatively minor .
He sustained quite a large area of bruising .
Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike , which could amount to ABH .
It 's extraordinary .
If that 's not ABH I would like to know what is . "
The CPS said Patel 's findings would provide a jury with enough reasonable doubt that the officer 's strike contributed to the death , and as a result they would acquit .
By coincidence Patel yesterday faced a disciplinary hearing at the General Medical Council for allegedly conducting four other autopsies incompetently .
He could be struck off and the Home Office has suspended him from its approved list .
Starmer said the CPS could not bring a charge of common assault because it failed to do so within a legal time limit .
Tomlinson 's family accused the authorities of a " big cover - up " and there were heated exchanges as they met with prosecutors after being told the news .
Tomlinson 's stepson Paul King said : " It 's outrageous .
We feel like it was not a full investigation from the beginning .
It 's a big cover -up .
" He has just admitted on TV that a copper assaulted our dad .
But he has n't done anything .
He 's the man in charge … why has n't he charged him .?
The Tomlinsons ' solicitor , Jules Carey , said the decision was disgraceful and said an inquiry must examine if it was due to a " lack of will or incompetence " .
The solicitor said Cary 's view that the CPS made factual errors would be examined to see if it could form part of a legal challenge : " The family were surprised about how the extent of the injuries were minimised by the CPS . "
The family 's expectation that the officer would be charged was built on the video evidence and because of what the IPCC told them about its investigation .
The IPCC concluded its investigation into the death and handed its file to the CPS in August 2009 .
Shortly after , senior investigators held a meeting with the family to discuss their findings .
While they made clear the CPS was responsible for charging decisions , IPCC officials told the family they believed there was sufficient evidence to charge the officer with manslaughter .
Last night the IPCC said : " The officer was interviewed for the offence of manslaughter under caution . "
An inquest will now be held into the death , where the family will hope a jury hear the case .
The officer remains suspended and is expected to face a disciplinary hearing .
Deborah Coles of the Inquest charity said : " The eyes of the world will be looking on with incredulity as yet again a police officer is not facing any criminal charges after what is one of the most clear - cut and graphic examples of police violence that has led to death .
This decision is a shameful indictment of the way police criminality is investigated . "
The CPS lawyer who made the decision was the same one who decided no officer should face charges for the shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes by police who mistook him for a terrorist .
That shooting happened five years ago yesterday .
The Met commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , said he regretted Tomlinson 's death and offered his sympathy to his family .
He said he was concerned by the video footage but that it was not appropriate for him to comment on the outcome of the IPCC inquiry or the CPS decision .
Last month , i said that combo videos and combos in general comprise a relatively small piece of the complete fighting game puzzle .
How exactly do they factor into the overall picture ?
Tactically speaking , executing a combo is a lot like finishing a traditional three - point play in basketball .
As a reward for driving past a perimiter defender and baiting an interior defensive mistake , the player is granted an additional free throw after the made basket .
The two primary components of free throw shooting are technical ability and maintaining composure .
Can free throws decide games ?
Absolutely .
Does anyone consider free throws a core strategic aspect of the game ?
No .
They serve a clear purpose , but there ’s much more to the game on a fundamental level : spacing , timing , footwork , adaptation , defense , etc .
In fighting games , landing a combo involves recognizing an opportunity , evaluating damage options , having the technical ability to perform the combo , and maintaining enough composure to pull it off under pressure .
Anyone who drops a combo during tournament play should absolutely be penalized for failing to complete a simple task that they can ice ninety - nine times out of a hundred in practice .
That ’s a perfectly valid part of the game .
However , most veterans are more impressed by a player ’s ability to set up a combo in match play , over the ability to execute it – and for good reason .
The only consistent way to create openings is to mentally outplay the opposition .
It takes a broad skill set and a strong mastery of the game to bait an opponent into committing a major mistake , while ending up in the right place at the right time to capitalize on it .
Continuing the basketball analogy , combo videos are akin to slam dunk contests and other such exhibitions .
They ’re very exciting to watch as a spectacle , but they transform an inherently multi-player game into a single - player activity .
Of course slam dunk contests and combo videos can be competitive as well , but they essentially remove the concept of defense from the equation .
On a technical level , combo videos always play a crucial role in advancing the community ’s understanding of game engines and combo systems .
Obviously , elaborate combos involving complex trade setups do n’t usually pay immediate dividends to tournament players seeking a competitive edge .
It takes a long time to process those technical discoveries into practical applications .
Nevertheless , there have been times when a combo video has changed the way a game is played in tournaments .
It ’s worth noting that combo videos are a poor indicator of character balance and tier rankings .
Even the weakest character in a game can look utterly broken without the need to play defense or produce reliable mixups .
However , combo videos are a great indicator of what ’s cool in a game .
If you have five minutes and you want to see a certain character produce fireworks , watch a combo video .
You ’ll get a good sense of what the game engine allows and how characters can maneuver within it .
Lastly , combo videos are great for shaking up the status quo .
When you feel like you ’ve seen everything there is to see in a game , or everything your character can do , watch a combovid .
It might inspire you to look in a new direction .
Until yesterday , it seems that the Oregon Tea Party has been using the most famous and menacing of Anonymous ' slogans : " We are Anonymous .
We are Legion .
We do not forgive .
We do not forget .
Expect us . "
At first , it showed up on a sign held by a woman at a Tea Party protest .
Then , the Oregon Tea Party started printing the slogan on their bumper stickers .
Yesterday , all this came to light .
Over on Reddit , user choochy posted the image of the bumper sticker above with the comment Found this on my conservative parent 's fridge .
It is real .
There was some skepticism , but user Tissues2 pointed out the following .
Actually look real http://oregonteaparty.ning.com/
An internet meme just escaped into the real world .
It 's like Tron in reverse .
Another user , strolls , elaborated .
It obviously has a lot of users , logging on regularly to post comments .
So people realized that the bumper sticker was legit and so was the group .
By the way , keep those Reddit users ' ability to read the Oregon Tea Party 's site yesterday in your memory .
It will come in handy .
Some Anonymous person then emailed the Oregon Tea Party to see if the sticker really was legit .
Here is the response .
At this point , technology sites started paying attention .
Geekosystem picked up the story , followed by The Next Web , and finally Gawker .
This meant that 4 Chan , one of the homes of Anonymous , found out as well .
That 's when the fun started .
If any of you are familiar with Anonymous , you know they are a bunch of trolls and script kiddies ( ETA : also intrepid crusaders against Scientology -- Anonymous has a good side as well ) who will go after anyone .
In fact , it was someone from Anonymous who hacked into Sarah Palin 's email account during the 2008 campaign .
They do not like it when anyone impedes their ability to have fun , and they will stop at nothing to have their fun .
So , you can probably guess what happened to the Oregon Tea Party 's Facebook page .
By 2:50 PM , Anonymous was flooding the wall of the Oregon Tea Party with macros , desus , and flames .
By 4:33 , the Oregon Tea Party had had enough .
By midnight , all comments had been wiped off the Oregon Tea Party 's Facebook Wall .
Tonight , the Oregon Tea Party 's Facebook page page is apparently no more .
Click on the link ; you 'll be directed to Facebook 's main page .
Oh , and as for the ability to read the Oregon Tea Party 's Ning page , that 's no more as well .
Here is what you will get for your trouble .

Like Katy Perry , Kelis ’s new single 4th July ( Fireworks ) has also been getting the remix treatment from a lot of great sources .
I mean for instance we had the Richard X remix a few days ago which was great .
However this Rusko remix is a totally different proposition .
This track is as 8 - Bit as fuck , which is right down my street .
It has a traditional Rusko sound to it , which a few of you may be accustomed to already .

IT ’S been hot lately , which makes getting dressed in the morning a little harder .
I want something cool enough for the five - block walk to the subway , but warm enough for an air - conditioned day at the office .
Sometimes it takes a couple of outfit changes , but the other day , I was torn .
I wanted to wear a pair of long navy blue Elizabeth and James shorts , with a light purple silk blouse and very high , blush - colored snakeskin heels .
But I was afraid that the silk blouse , which I usually wear with skinny jeans , would not be flattering with the loose blue shorts .
My husband was of little help .
And I was n’t about to call my girlfriends for advice .
So I pulled out my iPhone , snapped a photo of myself in the outfit and uploaded it to a Web site called Fashism .
“ Is this look too boxy for me ? ” I wrote .
“ I love these shorts but not sure how it all looks on my body . ”
About five minutes later , the first comment landed .
“ It ’s a tad form - less , ” thestalwart wrote .
Another commenter , MLG , agreed : “ Just a little bit too much going on for my taste . ”
The crowd - source had spoken .
I went back into my closet , slipped on a colorful dropped - waist dress , and headed to work with an extra kick in my flat , silver sandals .

Yesterday 's post on the 32 Questions and Answers on Bill C - 32's digital lock provisions focused on general issues in the bill , including compliance with WIPO , the penalty provisions , and their constitutional validity .
Today 's post discusses the shortcomings in the anti-circumvention exceptions that are included in C - 32 .
With the exception of a new exception for cellphone unlocking , the exceptions are the same as those found in C - 61 and a virtual mirror of the U.S. DMCA .
For those that want it all in a single package , I 've posted the full series as PDF download .
C -32's Circumvention Exceptions
This section features answers to the following questions :
Bill C - 32 contains circumvention exceptions for encryption research and security testing .
Does n't that address the research concerns ?
Bill C - 32 contains a circumvention exception for privacy .
Does n't that address the privacy concerns ?
Bill C - 32 contains a circumvention exception for the visually impaired .
Does n't that address those access concerns ?
Bill C - 32 contains a circumvention exception for interoperability .
Does n't that address those concerns ?
Bill C - 32 contains circumvention exceptions for encryption research and security testing .
Does n't that address the research concerns ?
No .
The impact of the anti-circumvention provisions on the research community extends far beyond just encryption research and security testing .
Bill C - 32's exception is the same as that used in Bill C - 61 .
When C - 61 was introduced , I met with several University of Ottawa researchers engaged in fields as diverse as biblical scholarship and engineering .
Their common thread was that their research plans would be stymied by Bill C - 61 .
Researchers that need to circumvent in order to access content for media criticism , search technologies , network content distribution , etc. will all find themselves unable to conduct their research .
Those that argue that Bill C - 32 is unenforceable have never had their work subjected to an ethics review that invariably includes an examination of the legality of the methodology .
If the work fails the review , there will be no grant funding and the research simply stops .
The exceptions for encryption research and security testing are needed , however , the Canadian approach to exceptions has been to simply mirror the U.S. DMCA list .
A general research exception is essential if Canadian researchers are to be able to continue their work .
Moreover , the encryption research exception requires the researcher to inform the target about plans for circumvention for research purposes .
The exception already includes a condition that " it would not be practical to carry out the research without circumventing the technological measure " and that the person has " lawfully obtained the work , " so the researcher has a legal copy and must pass a necessity barrier .
The inclusion of an additional notice requirement should be dropped since it has little to do with copyright protection , yet creates a possible barrier for researchers who need to do encryption research without telegraphing their plans to the target organization .
The exception also raises issues for peer review since the exception does not cover third party peer reviewers , who may be unable to adequately review the research .
Bill C - 32 contains a circumvention exception for privacy .
Does n't that address the privacy concerns ?
No .
The exception fails to provide Canadians with full privacy protection and Bill C - 32 unquestionably makes it more difficult for Canadians to effectively protect their privacy .
The reason for this is that though there is an exception that permits circumvention to protect ( and prevent the collection or communication of ) personal information , the ability to exercise this exception is rendered difficult by virtue of the inability to legally obtain devices ( ie. software programs ) for this very purpose .
The bill states that a person can offer circumvention devices or services for the protection of personal information only " to the extent that the services , technology , device or component do not unduly impair the technological measure . "
Bill C - 32 does not include a definition of " unduly impair . "
However , according to an Industry Minister official who was responding to a journalist inquiry under Bill C - 61 about the same language :
" The intent of the provision is to ensure that while individuals may obtain devices and services that circumvent technological measures with a view to protecting privacy , any ensuing circumvention of the technological measure cannot be done in a manner that would enable unauthorised uses of the underlying copyright material by that person or by a third party . "
In other words , you can use a circumvention device to protect your privacy but it cannot allow you to simultaneously access the underlying content .
Of course , once most circumvention devices circumvent a technological measure , the protected content will be in the clear .
Distribution of this form of device is therefore illegal .
Moreover , service providers will be likely be unwilling to use this provision for fear of facing liability .
Not only should the " unduly impair " wording be removed , but the bill should place a positive obligation on those companies that use DRM that may raise privacy concerns to provide the keys to circumvent their technological measure where requested to do so for privacy purposes .
Bill C - 32 contains a circumvention exception for the visually impaired .
Does n't that address those access concerns ?
No .
The provision suffers from the same shortcoming as the privacy exception .
While there is an exception for the act of circumvention , access to devices that can be used to circumvent again comes with the restriction that a person can offer circumvention devices or services only " to the extent that the services , technology , device or component do not unduly impair the technological measure . "
The notion of not unduly impairing the TPM is even more non-sensical in this context given that the whole point of circumventing is to provide access to the content for those with perceptual disabilities .
The content will obviously be in the clear since that is what is needed to provide the necessary access .
The limitation on devices and services here makes absolutely no sense unless the real aim to stop those with perceptual disabilities from obtaining access .
Not only should the " unduly impair " wording be removed , but the bill should place a positive obligation on those companies that use DRM to circumvent their technological measure where requested to do so for access for those with perceptual disabilities .
Bill C - 32 contains a circumvention exception for interoperability .
Does n't that address those concerns ?
No .
The emergence of open source software as a powerful alternative to proprietary software models has been an important business and societal development .
Open source software is today widely used by consumers ( e.g. , Firefox browser ) and businesses ( e.g. , Linux operating system , Apache web server ) .
From a policy perspective , the Canadian government 's professed goal is to create a level playing field so that the marketplace rather than laws will determine marketplace winners .
It has opposed attempts to create policy preferences for open source ( over the objection of some advocates and countries ) instead favouring a more neutral approach .
Notwithstanding the claims of neutrality and trusting in the market , Bill C - 32 creates significant marketplace impediments for open source software .
Achieving a level playing field requires interoperability so that differing computer systems can freely exchange data .
The bill includes an interoperability provision at Section 41.12 which states that the anti-circumvention provisions do not apply to :
a person who owns a computer program or a copy of it , or has a license to use the program or copy , and who circumvents a technological measure that protects that program or copy for the sole purpose of obtaining information that would allow the person to make the program and any other computer program interoperable .
The problem with this provision is that it does not extend far enough to maintain a level playing field .
The classic example involves the use of Linux as a consumer operating system .
Unfortunately , this operating system cannot officially play DVDs since most commercial DVDs contain a digital lock and the entity that controls the lock does not license the necessary locks to play DVDs on Linux .
Programmers have developed alternatives , but all involve circumventing the digital lock , an act that becomes illegal under Bill C - 32 .
The interoperability provisions do not help address this issue , since DVDs may not be considered computer programs and many of the circumventing programs have functionality beyond playback of commercial DVDs .
The net effect is that Bill C - 32 erects an enormous barrier to open source software adoption , thereby harming innovation and a competitive marketplace .
The solution – as proposed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association in 2000 – is to create an exception the substantially broadens the interoperability exception .

Interview : Alexander Zaitchik on his new biography of Glenn Beck , ' Common Nonsense '
Last summer , when Glenn Beck was rocketing from talk radio stardom to the status of a national icon , he got the full profile treatment from Alexander Zaitchik at Salon .
That profile was the first serious -- if not too sympathetic -- attempt to understand how a small - time " morning zoo " radio host became a top conservative critic of the Obama administration , with legions of fans signing up with his projects and hanging on his words .
The profile also started Zaitchik on the path to writing " Common Nonsense : Glenn Beck and the Triumph of Ignorance . "
Would I recommend the book to Beck fans ?
It will tell them more than they 've ever known about Beck , but it will challenge the premises of his stories and his crusades .
Zaitchik defends ACORN and environmental activist Van Jones from the pounding Beck gave them -- at times , the reader feels that he 's watching a medic team pick up wounded bodies from the culture war .
Below , my questions for Zaitchik , and his answers .
This is the question I hear liberals most often ask about Beck :
Is he doing this for money , or does he believe this stuff ?
You seem to come down in the middle , and argue that he 's a huckster , but he 's also dim enough to believe that , say , ACORN is at the root of all evil .
His main motivations are , and have always been , money and fame .
If Beck has a true religion , it ’s not Patriotism .
It ’s not Mormonism .
It ’s cross - platform self - marketing .
The one constant in his life has been enormous ambition .
His business and brand will never be big or successful enough — hence the new projects never stop coming .
But I do n’t think Beck ’s self - image as a businessman is at odds with his beliefs about religion and politics .
He does n’t know enough about the world to understand why his grand - unified theory of a 100 - year progressive plot is a laughingstock outside of his own TV and radio studios .
I think he actually believes God wants him to make all this money and fight dirty for right wing causes .
Does he really believe God is speaking to and through him ?
I do n’t know .
But in one of his books , he describes Heaven as a place where everybody “ can make as much money as they want , ” and he does believe that God basically wrote the Constitution in 1787 .
The mistake Beck ’s critics often make is to say , “ Okay , so if his main self - identity is as a media and entertainment mogul , then everything else is just an act . ”
There ’s no need to choose just one door .
On his worldview ’s own terms , there ’s no contradiction between his enormous success , his entertainment toolbox , and his bat - in - the - bell tower politics .
What ’s shocking to me is how completely his fans swallow the “ selfless patriot ” act .
It ’s like they ’re deaf and blind to the way his tearful civic - activist shtick feeds directly into the business , indeed is the business .
What ’s happening , I think , is that Beck thinks God approves of his manipulations , and his fans are willing to suspend their disbelief and give him a pass because , they too , think Beck is ultimately doing God ’s work .
The whole thing is arguably the most elaborate Kabuki theater on view on the right today .
The most recent Beck mini-outrage came when he mocked Malia Obama for asking her father whether he'd " plugged the hole " in the Gulf of Mexico .
Is n't this the stuff that made Beck famous , and wo n't he get away with it ?
Beck has a long history of attacking other people ’s kids .
In the past , he ’s even attacked fetuses .
In Phoenix in the mid-1980s , he once called the wife of a rival deejay and mocked her live on the air about her recent miscarriage .
In Tampa , he repeatedly called the second - marriage children of Michael Schiavo ( husband of Terri ) “ bastard children . ”
The tic is just one of the many recurring manifestations of Beck ’s molten mean - streak , which runs a mile deep and often explodes like a volcano .
As for whether he ’ll get away with it , of course he will .
He knows his audience very well .
He plays directly to their own oversized spleens , which fuels so much Tea Party politics .
What sort of attempts did you make to interview Beck for this book ?
If you made those attempts why were you denied ?
I never tried to get in touch with him or his inner-circle .
Even if he had agreed to talk to me , which was extremely unlikely , I would n’t have believed a word that came out of his mouth .
Beck may not know much about politics or history , but he has arguably the most demonstrably sophisticated instinct for self - promotion on earth .
I was n’t interested in allowing Beck to use the book as a way to reinforce his well crafted and partly fictitious redemption narrative .
Nor was I interested in trading my cerebellum for subject - access .
I ’ll leave that kind of thing to Zev Chafets .
You hint very strongly that Beck has a problem with non-whites , such as when he infamously attacked non " decent " victims of Katrina .
And you call him a " symbolic racist . "
How does he view race in America ?
“ Symbolic racism , ” sometimes called “ laissez - faire racism , ” basically describes the kind of racism you find in post - Nixon conservative politics , where white racial fears and anxieties are exploited by exaggerating the threat and burden of those on state assistance , the so - called ' undeserving poor , ' who are usually racialized despite the actual demographics of welfare .
You see this in Beck ’s fixation on ACORN , Van Jones ’ “ street ” background , and especially in his false casting of green jobs and health care reform as forms of “ stealth reparations . ”
There ’s also a huge cultural component .
I have a chapter in the book in which I unpack how , for Beck , “ whiteness ” is bound up with a whole imaginary universe of “ Heartland ” values and institutions .
This is why Beck can call Obama a “ racist , ” and in the same breath say that this does n’t mean Obama hates white people .
Beck caught flack for this seeming contradiction , but he was actually being truthful in ways he did n’t even realize .
Beck likes to describe himself as “ the whitest guy you ’ll ever meet . ”
His profound animus toward black social - justice activists — and , wow , does he hate them — comes partly from understanding his audience ’s own prejudices , partly from a genuine dislike of their style , and partly from a complete ignorance of black history and culture .
I mean , this is a guy who thinks the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment is an urban legend .
His base is made up of people who watch Bill O’Reilly and Pat Robertson for entertainment .
Or , if they really want to laugh , they go see a Glenn Beck “ comedy ” show .
Beck carries the flag for a fading white “ corny ” culture ( his word ) in a world in which Chris Rock is the biggest comedian going , not Bob Hope .
His fans are the kind of people who cheer at the end of " Easy Rider . "
How much Beck did you consume in the research for this book ?
It was a very unhealthy amount .
I basically compiled as complete an archive of his radio and television recordings as possible , going back to the 1980s .
Then I lived in it for the better part of a year .
Every morning for many months , his voice was often the first thing I heard after waking up in the morning , and the last thing I heard before going to sleep .
There were a few moments where I almost cracked .
I moved down to Tampa [ from Brooklyn ] so I could write the book without any distractions .
But there were days when I wanted nothing more than a large distraction .
Such as global thermonuclear holocaust .
What would the tea party movement be like without Beck ?
Would it exist ?
Would it be better or worse informed ?
It would definitely exist .
In fact , Beck reconceived his 9.12 Project on the fly to capitalize on the movement as it came into being in March and April of 2009 .
I do n’t think it ’s possible the Tea Partyers could be any less informed with another leader .
Beck tells people that the most important book they can read is " The 5,000 Year Leap , " by Cleon Skousen .
This man was a raving lunatic who thought God ’s hand directed the writing of the U.S. Constitution , which He modeled largely on the governing system of the ancient tribes of Israel .
Beck ’s required reading list in Common Sense only has ten titles , four of which are by Skousen , who was so far out he was monitored closely by Hoover ’s FBI and almost excommunicated by the Mormon Church .
I have a chapter in the book devoted to Skousen ’s story , which is crucial to understanding how fringe Beck ’s foundational influences really are .
Skousen ’s prominence tells us an awful lot about the intellectual seriousness of this movement .
In the last year , Media Matters and other liberal groups have made a cottage industry of Beck - watching and Beck - bashing .
I think you show that he loves this stuff — he loves it when people mock him for crying .
Is the left doing a shoddy job of challenging Beck ?
It is very easy and extremely tempting for liberals to tee - off on everything that comes out of Beck ’s mouth .
He ’s a giant tree whose branches bend with juicy , chest - high fruit .
But what I think a lot of people do n’t understand is that this is all by careful design .
Beck understands that controversy is the closest thing to a publicity perpetual - motion machine .
He ’s been courting controversy for decades .
That ’s the name of the game he learned in radio — get them talking about you , raise your profile — and it's in his blood in a way it can only be for someone who has been fighting for his survival in ratings wars since he was a teenager .
It ’s all about being in the news , finding the next biggest stage on which to promote his shows and his sponsors .
Beck loves it when people go after him for crying , or blog about silly questions like , “ Did he really boil the frog ? ”
Back in Baltimore in the early '90s , he crafted this whole extensive bit around hamsters and snakes in order to get PETA protesting in the station parking lot .
He ’s a positional marketing mastermind .
It ’s not a coincidence that the “ third most listened to ” show on talk radio is so well branded as being hosted by “ the crying conservative with the chalk board and the Truth . ”
He knows exactly what he ’s doing .
I wish the left was better at resisting some of the bait he dangles on a daily basis , and focus on the bigger picture , like the agenda of [ David and Charles ] Koch - funded groups like Americans for Prosperity , which feeds Beck most of his scripts .
That , and the content of the religious pseudo - histories he keeps telling people to read .
At some point , enough is enough , and the left is letting him run this never - ending diversion play .
Does Beck write his own stuff ?
How smart is he ?
He has a huge team of writers .
To his credit , he ’s very up - front about this .
Orson Welles , one of Beck ’s heroes , used to deny his ghost writers credits , but Beck does n’t .
I think " Arguing with Idiots " had something like nine authors listed .
His fiction is ghosted , of course .
When you do four hours of radio and television every day , plus all the rest of it , including running a business , then you are most definitely not sitting at your desk writing a steady stream of nonfiction books and novels .
Especially when you have Beck ’s ADHD .
Clearly , he hired some of his friends in the patriotic thriller business — and he surely had favors coming , after what Beck has done for them — to ghost his new novel , The Overton Window .
But his fans do n’t care .
As long as his name is on it , and Beck tells them to buy it , they ’ll buy it .
As for his smarts , he ’s clearly smart enough to do what he does very well .
How important is understanding Mormonism in understanding Beck ?
I expect your chapter on Beck 's religion to be the most controversial .
I thought that chapter might be controversial as well .
But the response I ’ve gotten from Mormons has been overwhelmingly positive .
I ’ve done a lot of media in Utah , and the most common response is that I nailed the influence of Mormonism on Beck ’s act .
Aside from providing an introduction to Skousen , Mormonism is a perfect religious fit for Beck in a lot of ways , from the wealth - worshiping corporatism of the LDS Church , to the teary social ritual known as “ bearing testimony , ” to the schmaltzy sentimentalism found in so much Mormon film and literature .
But those are each long stories in themselves .
If anyone is interested in hearing them , they should buy the book .
You end the book by intimating that his rise is unstoppable .
Is it ?
When and how does he lose his audience and influence ?
If his fans have n’t grown bored or disgusted with him yet , I ’m not sure what it will take .
Consider his Aug. 28 “ Restoring Honor ” rally .
The whole thing is classic Beck : a massive self - promotional event that he ’s masquerading as a way to “ support the troops . ”
He ’s actually asking his fans to pay for the thing by sending him money — and only any money left over will go to charity .
You ’d think his fans would stop and think :
Gee , where have we seen this before ?
It ’s a replay of his listener - supported “ Rallies for America ” tour in 2003 , which exploded his profile while he was racking up affiliates and building his national brand .
His fans just do n’t get the fact that , as one of Beck ’s former producers told me , “ It ’s always about Glenn . ”
Some people are currently making a big deal about his Fox News ratings dip in 2010 , but his radio numbers remain strong .
And he ’s headed for another # 1 bestseller before the thing even hits the shelves .
So I would n’t write his obit quite yet .
Summary
Republican Meg Whitman is making false claims about Democrat Jerry Brown ’s " lifetime in politics " in an attack ad .
The two are battling to become the next governor of California .
The ad claims that " crime soared " while Brown was mayor of Oakland .
That ’s false .
The total number of crimes actually went down by more than 13 percent .
Also false is the ad ’s claim that Brown " damaged the school system so badly the state had to take it over . "
As mayor , Brown had almost no control over the school district , which was run instead by an elected school board .
A charge that Brown " lobbies for a corporate polluter " is highly misleading .
Brown was n’t a paid lobbyist .
The claim is based on a phone call he made for a past campaign contributor , and it had nothing to do with pollution .
The ad claims Brown worked to " send California jobs to China , " but that ’s unproven .
The claim rests on an 18 - year - old newspaper story that Brown strongly denied .
Some of the ad ’s other claims lack context .
For example , it ’s true as claimed that California had unemployment of 11 percent when Brown finished his time as the state ’s governor .
But the ad fails to mention that the national unemployment rate was 10.8 percent at the time .
Analysis
Edmund G. " Jerry " Brown Jr. , the Democratic candidate for governor of California , has been involved in politics for more than four decades .
And it ’s all been a " failure , " according to an ad from Meg Whitman , his GOP opponent .
But it ’s Whitman who fails when it comes to the facts .
This 60 - second attack ad first appeared June 22 :
[ TET ]
Meg Whitman for Governor Ad : " The Real Story "
Announcer : The Jerry Brown Story .
The real story .
Forty years in politics , and failure has followed him everywhere .
In the ‘60s , Brown enters politics and later serves two terms as governor .
His big spending turns a surplus into a billion dollar deficit .
Brown appoints liberal judges who fight the death penalty , supports billions in new taxes and leaves the state with record unemployment of 11 percent .
Failure .
In the ‘ 80s , he runs for Senate , but Californians say no .
He lobbies for a corporate polluter and works to send California jobs to China .
Failure .
The ‘90s saw Jerry run as a presidential candidate against Bill Clinton .
Clinton :
You know , he reinvents himself every year or two .
Announcer : Failure .
And in the 2000s , Jerry was mayor of Oakland where he taxed everything from garbage to cable TV , crime soared and he damaged the school system so badly the state had to take it over .
Another failure .
Jerry Brown .
A lifetime in politics , a legacy of failure . [ / TET ]
Soft on Crime ?
The ad ’s claim that " crime soared " while Brown was mayor of Oakland , Calif . , is wrong .
When Brown exited as mayor , the number of crimes reported to police was actually down by more than 13 percent from the year before he came into office .
According to the FBI ’s Uniform Crime Reports , there were 37,182 crime offenses in Oakland in 1998 .
But the number of crime offenses declined to 32,250 in 2006 .
Whitman ’s claim rests on the fact that the number of murders in Oakland doubled from 72 in 1998 to 145 in 2006 .
There were more robberies and auto thefts when Brown left office , too .
But decreases in forcible rapes , felony assaults , larceny and burglaries drove down the overall total .
Furthermore , Oakland ’s 13 percent decrease in the number of crimes was actually higher than the national trend .
According to FBI data , there were 12,542,142 criminal offenses in the U.S. in 1998 , but only 11,462,617 offenses in 2006 .
That ’s a decrease of less than 9 percent .
Responsible for State Takeover of Schools ?
The claim that Brown , also as mayor of Oakland , " damaged the school system so badly the state had to take it over , " is also false .
California , under former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis , did assume control of the Oakland Unified School District in June 2003 , but not because of Brown .
California school districts are governed by independent school boards , whose members are elected directly by district residents .
And the school districts are run by superintendents who are appointed by the school boards .
It ’s a point Brown emphasized in a June 10 interview with an ABC News affiliate in San Francisco :
Brown , June 10 : In California , the school district is a separate government elected directly by the people and it makes its own decisions ; the mayor has absolutely no control of an independent school district .
At one point , Brown actually considered having voters give him the authority to appoint every member of the district ’s school board .
Instead , he opted for having the power to appoint three new members in addition to the board ’s seven publicly elected ones .
Voters agreed to allow the extra appointed members in 2000 , still only giving Brown a minority voice on the board .
According to multiple news reports , the Oakland school district ’s history of financial trouble — and an $ 82 million debt under then - Superintendent Dennis K. Chaconas — led to the takeover , which was a condition of the $ 100 million bailout the school district received from the state .
Moreover , Brown actually opposed the school board ’s selection of Chaconas , who was replaced as superintendent during the state takeover .
Pollution Lobbyist ?
The ad claims that after his failed run for U.S. Senate in 1982 , Brown " lobbies for a corporate polluter . "
But , in fact , Brown was never a paid lobbyist for the firm .
The ad ’s claim rests on a single telephone call that Brown made in 1988 to a powerful member of Congress who later complained that Brown was " lobbying " him .
But the call had nothing to do with pollution .
Furthermore , Brown called on behalf of the parent firm , not " the corporate polluter . "
The " polluter " the ad refers to is ICN Biomedicals , a firm that manufactured products used by medical researchers studying diseases such as cancer and AIDS .
The Los Angeles Times reported that the company was once " California ’s largest producer of low - level radioactive waste . "
Brown served on the firm ’s board from 1987 until his run for U.S. president in 1992 , but he was not employed as a lobbyist .
The Whitman campaign bases the lobbyist rap on a phone call Brown made on behalf of Milan Panic , a campaign contributor , and the founder of ICN Pharmaceuticals ( now Valeant Pharmaceuticals International ) , the parent company of ICN Biomedicals .
The pharmaceuticals company was then being accused by the Food and Drug Administration of false advertising of Ribivarin , an antiviral drug the company produced .
ICN later settled the case , agreeing to pay hefty fines to settle civil charges , but admitted no wrongdoing .
Brown admitted to calling Rep. Henry Waxman of California , the then - chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee , to ask what he knew about the case .
Waxman told The Washington Post at the time that he " looked at if as Jerry Brown calling to lobby me for his friends and supporters . "
Strictly speaking , Brown was not calling on behalf of ICN Biomedicals , the " polluter " the ad refers to .
It was a subsidiary of ICN Pharmaceuticals and was not involved in the FDA case .
Overseas Jobs Pusher ?
The claim that Brown worked " to send California jobs to China " rests on a disputed news account from 18 years ago , which Brown strongly denied at the time .
Brown visited China in the late 1980s while serving on the board of ICN Biomedicals .
In 1992 , the San Francisco Examiner reported that Brown had been in China to set up operations for ICN .
The paper quoted former San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and members of a San Francisco Bay Area trade commission , claiming they recalled Brown telling them that he was in China on business for ICN .
But Brown denied this , and told Bob Schieffer , host of CBS News ’ " Face the Nation , " that he was in China for other reasons :
Brown , April 5 , 1992 : As a matter of fact , the reason I was in Hong Kong was to secure equity capital for investment in California .
That ’s why I was there .
I was with a particular company from Sacramento and those records are available . … I was there to secure equity capital .
And it ’s true that I was formerly affiliated with a company that wants to sell its pharmaceutical products in China to combat river blindness and the Chinese army , I believe , is buying some of the –that drug that cures that , but I was not looking around for land or anything of the kind .
According to The Washington Post , Brown said that he was in China on behalf of a real estate firm headed by Jeffrey Berger , another financial supporter , who , according to Brown , paid the former governor to accompany him to Hong Kong .
However , that story is contradicted in the same Post article by Richard H. Keatinge , a partner at the law firm Fulbright & Jaworski , who oversaw the firm ’s work for ICN .
Keatinge told the paper that he believed that the Examiner ’s explanation of Brown ’s visit to China was accurate based on his recollection of conversations with ICN officials about why Brown went overseas .
Keatinge , though , told the Post that nothing actually came of Brown ’s trip , although ICN later reached a tentative deal with a Chinese medical company to build a manufacturing plant in Shanghai .
Did Brown work " to send California jobs to China " ?
Perhaps so .
But based on the murky evidence , we conclude that the ad ’s claim is unproven .
More to the Story
Some of the ad ’s other claims are mostly on point , but could use some explanation .
For example , the ad claims that Brown left the state with " record unemployment of 11 percent " when he exited as governor .
It ’s true that the unemployment rate for California was 11.1 percent in December 1982 , Brown ’s last full month in office .
What the ad fails to mention , however , is that the U.S. was coming out of a more than yearlong recession around that time , according to the National Bureau of Economic Research .
California ’s unemployment rate was actually not much higher than the national rate , which was 10.8 percent in that same month .
The ad also claims that when Brown was governor of California , the state went from having a surplus of $ 6 billion to a deficit of $ 1 billion .
We have n’t been able to verify those exact numbers with either the California Department of Finance or the California Legislative Analyst ’s Office .
The Whitman campaign bases the claim not on actual budget documents , but on an interview Brown did with CNN ’s Larry King in 1992 , where he claimed to have had a $ 6 billion surplus at one point , and a New York Times article from the same time period that reported that the state faced " more than a $ 1 billion deficit " when he left office .
That may be true , but according to the same Times report , the disappearing surplus was caused by several things , including Proposition 13 , a measure state voters approved — and Brown opposed — that cut residents ’ property taxes , and reduced state revenue :
New York Times , April 5 , 1992 : Mr. Brown is widely criticized for not heading off a taxpayers ’ revolt that produced Proposition 13 , the ballot measure that in 1978 slashed property taxes and sent the state ’s finances reeling .
Had Governor Brown been more attentive to angry citizens whose property taxes were soaring at a time of huge government surplus , critics say , he might have crafted tax relief legislation that was less severe .
The loss in revenue from Proposition 13 has been blamed for contributing to crumbling infrastructure , overcrowded schools and understaffed law enforcement and public health departments .
…
With Proposition 13 a fait accompli , Mr. Brown directed $ 2.2 billion of the state surplus to the schools and $ 1.85 million to the counties and cities as emergency relief , actions which make it possible for him to accurately make the campaign claim today that taxes were cut and financing for schools increased in his administration .
But seeing that government ’s response to their demands for limits was resulting in a handout of the surplus , voters rose up again in 1979 .
They passed another ballot measure that placed a lid on government spending , tying it to inflation and forcing government to receive voter approval for increased taxes .
Because the state constitution grants the governor the power to veto appropriations , Mr. Brown was eventually able to slash $ 2 billion from various budgets .
But overall , state spending increased by nearly 120 percent during the Brown years after Proposition 13 , even as the measure pushed down the individual state taxpayer ’s burden from $ 158 per thousand of taxable income in 1978 to $ 108 per thousand when Mr. Brown left office in 1982 .
By that time , Proposition 13 had cut average property tax rates to $ 1.13 per $ 100 of assessed valuation in 1982 from $ 11.24 per $ 100 in 1972 , and forced $ 7 billion in spending cuts .
The budget surplus had evaporated into a deficit of more than $ 1 billion and the state ’s general fund reserve had fallen from nearly $ 2 billion to zero .
The ad ’s charge that Brown supported " billions in new taxes " as governor — $ 7 billion according to a graphic that appears on screen — rests on a quarter - cent increase in the state ’s 6 percent sales tax that he proposed in 1981 , and a bill he signed that year that raised the state tax on gas by 2 cents a gallon .
The sales tax hike , the " first tax he has ever proposed , " according to a 1981 article in The Economist , was estimated to raise $ 5 billion over 10 years to help fund local police departments and finance an expansion of the state ’s prison system .
And The Los Angeles Times said that the gas tax increase — estimated to bring in $ 2.5 billion in revenue — was implemented " to keep the state ’s highway system from going broke . "
— by D’Angelo Gore and Kelsey Ferguson
Update , July 2 : We initially failed to note the year that Brown called Waxman about ICN .
It was 1988 .
That information is now included in the story .
Correction , July 2 : This article originally referred to former Gov. Gray Davis as a Republican .
He is a Democrat , and we have updated the story to reflect that .

EXCLUSIVE : HBO is teaming with Will Ferrell and Adam McKay ’s Gary Sanchez and actress Lizzy Caplan to develop a comedy series project based on actress / writer Julie Klausner ’s memoir I Do n’t Care About Your Band .
The project is eyed as a potential starring vehicle for Caplan , who is coming off Starz ’s cult comedy series Party Down .
The book , a gritty but comedic look at what it ’s like to navigate the dating world in your 20s , chronicles Klausner ’s experiences from her preadolescent sexual awakenings through the unsavory details of sleeping with a gallery of losers throughout her 20s .
Gary Sanchez ’s Owen Burke brought the book to the company ’s Jessica Elbaum , who recently received an Emmy nomination for executive producing Ferrell ’s You ’re Welcome America HBO special .
( She also exec produced the one - man Broadway play the special was adapted from from . )
Elbaum started developing the project with Caplan .
Gary Sanchez ’ Ferrell , McKay , Chris Henchy and Elbaum will executive produce Band , with Caplan and Burke producing .
Band expands Gary Sanchez ’ relationship with HBO .
The CAA / WME - repped company produces HBO ’s comedy series Eastbound & Down , which is returning for a second season .
HBO also owns a stake in Gary Sanchez ’s successful comedy web site Funny or Die , which spawned a Funny or Die- branded sketch comedy series on the pay cable channel .
Caplan , repped by CAA and Benderspink , also has a history with HBO where she recurred on True Blood .
The actress recently completed Danny Boyle ’s 127 Hours and indie Queens of Country .
She got a lot of praise for her guest starring stint on the CBS comedy pilot Mad Love but declined to stay on as a regular on the show , which was picked up to series for midseason .
Stuck in the urban jungle and longing for greener places ?
We ’ve all been there , but it ’s not always easy to sneak away and take a short trip to the forest .
DUS Architects made it possible to take a break from the concrete jungle and get back to nature with its uniquely wonderful project called Unlimited Urban Woods .
The Unlimited Urban Woods was a temporary public art pavilion at the Oosterdokskade , Amsterdam .
The unassuming box took up only a few square meters of ground space , but inside sat a forest that went on forever .
Upon stepping into the box , visitors were greeted with an impossibly lush and full wooded area .
The effect was achieved with one full - size tree and some strategically angled mirrors .
The image of the tree was repeated in the mirrors over and over , making it feel as though one could simply walk through these woods for eternity .
The exhibit was an unexpected bit of green in the city , giving passers - by a chance to take a break from their normal busy day and simply relax for a while in a calm , green space .
Even if the forest was n’t real , the sense of being in a vast space certainly was .

During the July 25 , 2010 segment of ABC's This Week , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner defended President Barack Obama 's economic track record .
He specifically brought up the successes that the administration has had in boosting activity in the private sector .
" But right now , the best thing the government can do ... is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again .
Now , we 've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector .
That 's pretty good . "
We do n't have the expertise to evaluate what constitutes " pretty good " job growth , but we can check the claim that the growth has been positive for the last six months .
We visited the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , one of our favorite federal number crunchers .
On July 2 , 2010 , the bureau released its monthly Current Employment Statistics Highlights report .
On page five , the report contains statistics on seasonally adjusted private sector employment going back to January 2000 .
Geithner specifically referenced the last six months of the current year , so that 's where we focused our attention .
In December 2009 , the private sector shed 83,000 jobs .
That was significantly smaller than the average drop for the year , since the private - sector employment losses averaged 388,000 per month during 2009 , according to the report .
And so we come to 2010 .
How have we fared for the past six months ?
Here 's a quick monthly summary of jobs added :
January : 16,000
February : 62,000
March : 158,000
April : 241,000
May : 33,000
June : 83,000
Data for the month of July -- which was n't over when Geithner spoke -- wo n't be released until August , so that 's the most up - to - date data available .
The report notes that data for the two most recent months are preliminary .
But unless there 's an unusually big after - the fact correction for either month , it 's pretty clear that Geithner was correct .
We 've seen positive job growth in the private sector from January to June .
We rate this True .

This Friday they are releasing their Left 4 Dead 2 range of strictly limited high end collectibles .
First up is the Tank .
Pre-orders go live Friday July 30th .
Today ’s update covers quite a few subjects so we thought we should touch on a few of them .
When we did our blog poll on rage quitting we mentioned we would be working on some of the underlying issues .
Left 4
Dead 2 does n’t have a more rage or less rage button – well not directly …
We checked some stats , did some testing , checked more stats , and did more testing .
We have many more changes we are working on , some ideas failed , some were exploitable , and some were just bad ideas .
What we are releasing today is not the sum of our answer to the problem but simply some of the updates that are ready to ship .
More are coming .
While we were testing other changes with the Charger , we were bothered that doing the right thing did not give you the best score .
New players were often confused by this lack of feedback , so we fixed that .
Friendly fire is never fun , especially when it really is n’t friendly fire .
So in both Versus and Co-op we wanted to remove those times when you receive a friendly fire warning for shooting through an infected .
Bullets that first pass through an infected character before striking a Survivor are now ignored as friendly fire .
Failing at the Tank is miserable experience .
We all know the feeling when you are trying to explain to your team - but he was already on fire !
So we did some work there .
Tanks go into a stasis when they spawn and leave stasis when the human player takes over .
Tanks do not attack when they are in stasis .
Tanks in stasis are invisible but still show a glow to the infected team .
Tanks in stasis can not be set on fire .
The updates are n't over and you should expect to see some more shortly .
As for the blog , besides the regular Friday update , next week we will be going into details on the Mutations , why Realism Versus was made permanent and other Mutations have not been .
Plus what gets played more - Versus , Co-op , Survival , Single Player , or Scavenge ?
OK , so we 've got a very large alligator with the wings of a pterosaur that can repel musket fire .
Now it just needs to breathe flames .
This is where no parallel exists — there are no known animals that can spit fire or even a flammable liquid .
But there are some beetles that can shoot caustic chemicals from their abdomen that can burn people 's skin , so it 's not totally out of the question that some animal at some point in time could make a flammable liquid .
Cobras can spit venom with great accuracy at objects six feet away ; the dragon could borrow that ability to propel the flammable liquid .
As for lighting it ?
" Well , maybe , if you had some specialized organ like an electric eel 's tail dangling in the mouth , that could spark that liquid and allow the creature to breathe fire , " Conrad says .
" Of course , this is all very theoretical . "

Every now and then , I get an email from someone who ’s keen to get into science writing and wants to know how I started .
Whenever I reply , and I always try to , I ’m always left with the nagging feeling that my experience is but one of a multitude of routes that people have taken .
Science writing ( whether you want to call it journalism , blogging , communication and so on ) is a diverse field , as are the people working in it .
It would be far more illuminating for a newbie to see a variety of stories rather than just one .
This was the origin of this thread of origins .
I will be asking science writers around the world to do what they do best - tell a story - about the thing they know best - themselves .
This will be a perpetual thread that I hope will act as a lasting resource for the writers of tomorrow to take inspiration from .
Some kind individuals have already submitted their stories and I hope that many more will chip in .
You can already see that they 're a varied bunch .
Some stumbled into it by accident .
Some came from traditional journalistic backgrounds .
Others were bitten by a radioactive Carl Sagan .
The more the stories accumulate , the better this diversity reveals itself .
Who should contribute to this thread ?
Anyone who regularly writes about science , and preferably has been doing it for a couple of years now .
I originally wanted to focus on science journalists but because all these definitions are bleeding into one , I ’m opening it to all manner of science writers .
From blogger to book writer , beginner to veteran , Asimov to Zimmer , tell us your story .
What should I say ?
You ’ll see from the existing entries ( which are virtually unedited ) that there ’s a lot of variety in content , tone and length .
This is as it should be – science writers are a diverse bunch and it would be a shame to edit them into uniformity .
But essentially , there are two basic questions :
how did you make your start
what advice would you give to people in the same position ?
What do I do ?
Just stick a comment in with your story , who you are and what you do .
If there are multiple links , it ’ll be diverted to my spam folder , but just email or tweet me and tell me to rescue it .
Alternatively , feel free to email your story and I ’ll put it up on your behalf .
How do I tell people about this ?
Obviously , the URL is above , but you can also link to this page from tinyurl.com / sciwriters and bit.ly/sciwritersWhat about regular comments ?
I ’m not going to restrict people from posting regular comments initially , but I ’d ask that readers keep them to a minimum .
The thread ’s value relies on the stories taking centre - stage .
Other than that , go for it .
Who has contributed ?
I 'll keep a running list here , with links to their stories :

There ’s a simple statistic called the Lincoln Index that lets you estimate the total number of errors based on the number of errors found .
I ’ll explain what the Lincoln Index is , why it works , give some code for playing with it , and discuss how it applies to software testing .
What is the Lincoln Index ?
Suppose you have a tester who finds 20 bugs in your program .
You want to estimate how many bugs are really in the program .
You know there are at least 20 bugs , and if you have supreme confidence in your tester , you may suppose there are around 20 bugs .
But maybe your tester is n’t very good .
Maybe there are hundreds of bugs .
How can you have any idea how many bugs there are ?
There ’s no way to know with one tester .
But if you have two testers , you can get a good idea , even if you do n’t know how skilled the testers are .
Suppose two testers independently search for bugs .
Let E 1 be the number of errors the first tester finds and E 2 the number of errors the second tester finds .
Let S be the number of errors both testers find .
The Lincoln Index estimates the total number of errors as
E 1 E 2 /S .
You can find historical background on the Lincoln Index here .
How does the index work ?
Suppose there are n bugs and the two testers find bugs with probability p 1 and p 2 respectively .
You ’d expect the two testers to find around np 1 and np 2 bugs .
If you assume the probabilities of each tester finding a bug are independent , you ’d expect the testers to find around np 1 p 2 bugs in common .
That says
E 1 E 2 /S
would be around
( n2 p 1 p 2 ) / ( n p 1 p 2 ) = n .
The probabilities of each tester finding a bug cancel out leaving only n , the total number of bugs .
Simulation code
Here ’s some Python code for simulating estimates using the Lincoln Index .
from random import random def find_error ( p ) : " Find an error with probability p " if random ( ) < p : return 1 return 0 def simulate ( true_error_count , p1 , p2 , reps=10000 ) : " " " Simulate Lincoln 's method for estimating errors given the true number of errors , each person 's probability of finding an error , and the number of simulations to run . " " " estimation_error_sum = 0 for rep in xrange ( reps ) : caught1 = 0 caught2 = 0 caught_both = 0 for error in xrange ( true_error_count ) : found1 = find_error ( p1 ) found2 = find_error ( p2 ) caught1 += found1 caught2 += found2 caught_both += found1* found2 estimate = caught1*caught2 / float ( caught_both ) estimation_error_sum += abs( estimate - true_error_count ) return estimation_error_sum / float ( reps )
I used this to simulate the case of two testers , one with a 30 % chance of finding a bug and the other with a 40 % chance , and a total of 100 bugs .
I simulated the Lincoln Index 1,000 times , keeping track of the absolute error in the estimates .
The code to do this was simulate ( 100 , 0.30 , 0.40 , 1000 ) .
On average , the Lincoln index over - or under -estimated the number of bugs by about 16 .
This is a good estimate considering each tester greatly under - estimated the number of bugs .
If you did n’t think about using something like the Lincoln Index , in the previous example one tester would find around 30 bugs and the other around 40 .
The two lists might have 10 bugs in common , so you ’d estimate the total number at 60 , far short of 100 .
But the Lincoln index would often find estimates between 84 and 116 .
Note that it is possible that the testers wo n’t find any of the same bugs .
In that case the Lincoln Index can not be computed and the code will divide by zero .
But this is unlikely unless the p‘s are small and n is small .
Software testing
Does the Lincoln Index actually provide a good bug count estimate ?
That depends on how well the assumptions are met .
The index assumes all bugs are equally hard for a given tester to find .
It does not assume that both testers are equally skilled , but it does assume that their chances of finding a bug are independent .
In other words , tester A is no more or less likely to find a bug just because tester B found it .
The most questionable assumption is that all bugs are equally hard to find .
That ’s usually not true .
But it may be true that all bugs of a certain kind are equally hard to find .
For example , spelling errors may be easier to find than validation oversights , but the Lincoln Index might be good for estimating separately how many spelling errors or validation errors there are .
The index might provide a rough rule of thumb even if the assumptions it that go into it are violated .
For example , suppose one tester found 15 bugs and another found 20 .
But only 3 of the bugs were the same .
A naive estimate would say since there are 32 unique bugs found , there must be around that many in total .
But the Lincoln Index would estimate 100 bugs .
Maybe the Lincoln estimate is not at all accurate , but it does tell you to be worried that there may be a lot more bugs to find since the overlap between the two bug lists was so small .

Whenever , wherever on this earth , we will find people who contravene gender boundaries .
I 'm not talking about the small ways of ' queering ' gender , such as the lesbian separatists who wore dungarees in the 1970s .
I mean the big ways : not just queering gender , but crossing gender .
I mean the drive that makes people risk so much to represent a gender they feel is theirs , and yet is very different to the social , cultural and legal expectations of their birth sex .
Whatever culture , country or epoch you choose to research , you will find a history of individuals who , if they lived now , we might now refer to as trans people .
We must be careful with our words .
' Transvestite ' originated in 1910 from the German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld , who would later develop the Berlin Institute where the very first ' sex change ' operations took place .
' Transsexual ' was not coined until 1949 , ' transgender ' not until 1971 , and ' trans ' ( a very British term ) not until 1996 .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first use of ' androgyne ' was recorded in 1552 , but it has only been in the last 10 years that people have claimed it for themselves to describe a state of being in - between , or having both genders .
' Polygender ' is a late 1990s Californian invention used to describe a state of being multiple genders .
This is by no means a complete list of words used by people to describe themselves .
Long before Hirschfeld , other cultures had developed their own terminologies to describe ' trans ' people .
From the Hijra of India , to the Fa'afafine of Polynesia , the ladyboys and the tomboys of Thailand , and the Takatāpui of New Zealand , there are a myriad of words used by trans people to describe themselves .
The start of the scientific study of sexology
In 1885 the Criminal Law Act was passed in the UK , which made all homosexual behaviour illegal .
Similar laws were put in place throughout Europe during this period .
When homosexuality was made illegal , those suspected of it - such as Oscar Wilde - could face imprisonment and hard labour for up to two years .
People who cross - dressed became easy targets of the law because they were associated , in the public mind , with homosexual subculture .
One of the first public trials for transvestite behaviour was that of Ernest ( Stella ) Boulton , and Fred ( Fanny ) Park , arrested in 1870 for indecent behaviour .
The authorities based the prosecution on their transvestism and their soliciting of men as women , rather than the act of sodomy .
No conviction could be obtained on these grounds and they were acquitted of the charge of conspiracy to commit a felony by cross-dressing .
One of the largest organisations for transvestite men in the US today is the Boulton and Park Society .
As a result of these laws , people who were trans sought out doctors who could cure them and a whole new field in medicine developed : sexology .
The first sexologist who took a special interest in the sexual impulses of trans individuals was probably Krafft - Ebbing ( 1840 - 1902 ) , professor of psychiatry at Vienna .
His Psychopathia Sexualis was published from 1877 to after his death .
Krafft - Ebbing constantly endeavoured to give clearer classifications to the behaviours and individual histories of his patients .
Through the work of the early sexologists such as Krafft - Ebbing and Hirschfield , transsexuality became a recognized phenomenon available for study , discussion and treatment .
Throughout the 1920s and 30s medical provision was very sparse , but still transsexual people managed to find doctors who would help them .
At Hirschfield 's infamous clinic , the first sex change operations were performed by Dr Felix Abraham : a mastectomy on a trans man in 1926 , a penectomy on his domestic servant Dora in 1930 , and a vaginoplasty on Lili Elbe , a Danish painter , in 1931 .
The surgery was not easy , and Lily died less than two years later from complications .
In the UK , Michael ( formerly Laura ) Dillon managed to obtain gender reassignment treatment during the war .
In the late 1940s he even had a penis constructed by the plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gilles , who later became famous for his work with burns victims .
Michael Dillon trained and worked as a ship 's doctor until he was outed by the Sunday Express in 1958 .
He withdrew to India where he became a Buddhist monk and writer until his death in 1962 .
Modern transsexuality
Eight years before Dillon was outed , Christine Jorgensen , a former American GI , returned from Denmark where she had undergone the first of several operations as part of her gender reassignment , and the media picked up on the story .
Overnight she became a news sensation , and was undoubtedly the most famous transsexual figure in the 20th century .
She was beautiful , blond , and everybody 's idea of the ' all - American girl ' .
As one obituary put it :
" Her very public life after her 1952 transition and surgery was a model for other transsexuals for decades .
She was a tireless lecturer on the subject of transsexuality , pleading for understanding from a public that all too often wanted to see transsexuals as freaks or perverts ...
Ms Jorgensen 's poise , charm , and wit won the hearts of millions . "
[ Candice Brown Elliot , 1999 ]
Almost immediately , Jorgensen 's psychiatrist in Denmark , Dr Hamburger , started receiving letters and in 1953 he published a paper , The desire for change of sex as shown by personal letters from 465 men and women .
Suddenly medical professionals realised that these were not exceptional cases : there was a whole swathe of people who were unhappy because their gender role did not match their body .
The endocrinologist Harry Benjamin ( who had trained at Hirschfield 's clinic ) set up a clinical practice , first in New York and later in San Francisco .
He trained a new generation of psychiatrists and psychotherapists in the treatment of transsexual people .
The former head of research at the UK Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross hospital , Professor Richard Green , trained with Benjamin .
When Benjamin published the first major textbook on the subject , The Transsexual Phenomenon , in 1966 , gender reassignment was still the subject of extensive social stigma both publicly and in the medical world .
Over 40 years later , some of that stigma remains , but it is widely accepted that the only successful treatment for transsexual people is hormone therapy and surgical reassignment .
A 1999 appeal court decision in the UK has confirmed this view , and it is an area of medicine that is gradually gaining respectability .
Transsexual people have also become much more visible .
Jan ( James ) Morris , the travel writer , was the Times reporter on the 1953 expedition that conquered Everest ; Billy ( Dorothy ) Tipton was one of the best jazz saxophonists of the 1950s ; Wendy ( Walter ) Carlos is famous for her Switched on Bach recordings .
And , of course , many of us now know a trans colleague , neighbour , family member or friend .

Kudos to The Associated Press for reporting on the ground in the Bahamas about the search for 19 - year - old fugitive Colton Harris - Moore , better known as the Barefoot Bandit .
But for a graphic that puts Harris - Moore 's alleged exploits in context ,
.
Then read the AP 's latest :
View Tracking Colton Harris - Moore , aka The Barefoot Bandit in a larger map
Colton Harris - Moore , who hopscotched his way across the U.S. and appears to have escaped in a stolen plane to the Bahamas , lived up to his legend Wednesday , eluding a manhunt after allegedly committing a new series of break - ins on a normally quiet island .
Bahamian police interviewed burglary victims while searching for the 19 - year - old Camano Island man on Great Abaco Island days after the fugitive dubbed the " Barefoot Bandit " is suspected of crash - landing the plane and making his way to shore .
His arrival coincided with an annual regatta that could make it easy for him to blend in among the crowds of visiting tourists .
A Royal Bahamian Police Force bulletin warned that Harris - Moore should be considered " armed and dangerous . "
Bar and restaurant owner Alistair McDonald said he was one of Harris - Moore 's latest victims .
McDonald said surveillance video captured the suspect inside his establishment in Great Abaco's Marsh Harbour before dawn Tuesday .
He said the suspect at one point looked directly into a security camera , then shone a flashlight into it to blur the image and turned all three security cameras to the wall .
" He seemed pretty relaxed and at ease , " McDonald said , adding that he thinks the burglar was looking for money or got spooked because he left empty - handed .

One of the most common questions asked during our Fundamentals series is “ What ’s up with everyone wearing Chuck Taylors ? ” or “ Do shoes matter ? ”
So , I decided to take a few moments to explain why shoes matter and why Chuck Taylors are a good all around choice for CrossFitting shoes .
CrossFitters choose their shoes for numerous reasons such as comfort , style , cost , and performance .
Comfort is a no-brainer .
No one wants to magnify the pain of a high intensity “ Fran ” by lacing on a pair of uncomfortable shoes of any size , shape , or style .
Style on the other hand is like an opinion , everyone has one and it differs from one person to the next .
Although style may not be the most important factor when selecting a shoe for CrossFitting , you ’d be fooling yourself if you said style had zero influence in the decision tree .
If a particular brand or type of shoe just does n’t mesh with your personal style , then you are not likely to run out to grab a pair just because you saw someone at Cross Fit Impulse sporting them .
We all want the best product at the lowest cost .
That does n’t change when shopping for a pair of kicks to wear during your next WOD .
Snoop Dogg may wear $ 1500 Gators while driving his $ 65,000 Snoop Deville , but he ’s not going to scuff them on a plyo - box during Filthy Fifty .
Finding a shoe that fits your budget can be as important as comfort and style .
CrossFitters are constantly seeking ways to shave seconds off their metcon times or set a PR on Olympic lifts .
As you may have anticipated , shoes can be a significant performance variable when CrossFitting .
Some features that affect performance are sole thickness , sole density , heel thickness or angle , and flexibility of the shoe .
Let ’s examine a 1 RM ( one rep max ) deadlift attempt wearing a pair of Asics GT - 2150s running shoes designed with a thick , cushy sole to absorb those infamous heel strikes .
To perform a proper deadlift , we must pull the loaded barbell from the ground , maintaining core stabilization , by driving our heels against the floor .
When wearing a traditional running shoe like the GT - 2150s , that thick , shock absorbing sole will do exactly what it ’s designed to do : absorb force .
What do I mean ?
The cushiony sole has to be compressed before any force is applied to the barbell .
Imagine deadlifting while standing on a mattress .
Sound ridiculous ?
It is !
So why do it by wearing high heeled running shoes ?
Additionally , the thick heel automatically puts you at a disadvantage for driving through the heels .
The heel is usually much thicker and higher than the forefoot of the shoe , shifting you unnaturally to your toes .
We all know the shame of being on our toes while performing lifts .
Double - unders , running , and box jumps are a few incidents when being on your toes ( or forefoot ) is desired and accepted .
However , the majority of the time we want to drive through our heels to transfer the most force to the ground .
I have n’t even mentioned the lateral or side - to - side instability that is absorbed by the comfy cushioned sole shoes , but it ’s time to move on .
Whether you are deadlifting , cleaning , or squatting you want a thin , flat , hard soled , minimalist shoe to transfer the maximum amount of force to the ground through the heels .
This means moving heavy loads more efficiently .
Now is a good time to talk about why I , and many other CrossFitters , prefer Chuck Taylor All - Stars .
To no surprise , Chucks have a thin , flat , hard sole .
During a lift , minimum sole compression takes place before force is transferred to the ground to move the load .
A completely flat sole allows you to start , and remain , on your heels throughout the movement .
This makes Chucks ideal for any type of lift .
I initially bought my first pair of Chucks for lifting but I quickly found that they are very versatile .
Unlike specialty shoes , I can wear my Chucks during any and all workouts .
I can lift , run , wall - ball , row , tire flip , box jump –you name it .
I even bought a pair to wear outside of the gym .
The only workouts when I do n’t prefer my Chucks are long distance runs of five kilometers ( 5 K ) or more .
If done with proper POSE form , running is not bad in Chucks .
I have run up to a 5 K in mine with no issues , but sometimes I would like to have a little more sole , like a Nike Free .
What about the comfort , style , and cost of Chucks ?
They are not the lightest shoe available , but I find Chucks to be comfortable , offering little to no restrictions .
Numerous styles and colors are available for as little as $ 45 .
You can build your own custom Chucks on the Converse website , including printing personalized text on the shoe for approximately $ 60 .
Jeff Barnett , CrossFit Impulse co-owner and trainer , took advantage of the customization with his bright orange “ Snatchtastic ” high - top All - stars .
It took a lot of ingenuity to get the word “ snatch ” past Converse ’s word filter , but he pulled it off .
Are Chucks the only shoe to achieve the versatility CrossFitters need ?
Of course not .
They are just my choice .
Many other options are available that offer a flat , minimalist sole shoe for CrossFitting .
Vibram FiveFingers are popular among many CrossFitters .
FiveFingers are probably the most minimalist shoe on the market .
They are about as close to barefoot as you can get , which makes them truly functional .
We were not meant to have miniature mattresses on our feet , such as the GT - 2150s mentioned earlier .
FiveFingers are extremely light and flexible with a thin , dense rubber sole .
I have never worn a pair for any substantial length of time , but I know many CrossFitters that swear by them .
They say “ it ’s like wearing an extra thick sock that fits between your toes ” .
The “ fits between your toes ” is what I do n’t like .
I have to agree with Chuck Carswell , a Cross Fit HQ trainer , “ Thongs between more than two toes sketches me out a little . ”
FiveFingers are also not the most visually appealing footwear either .
Not that we are concerned with appearance , right ?
Although they are a minimalist shoe , they are not sold at a minimalist price .
A pair will set you back $ 80 - $ 100 .
I am considering giving FiveFingers another chance because I do like their raw functionality .
Who knows , maybe I can adapt to the “ thongs between more than one toe . ”
The Nike Free is another shoe that seems to get good reviews from the Cross Fit community .
It “ attempts to simulate barefoot running while wearing a shoe , ” making it another good option for those looking for a minimalist shoe for CrossFitting .
Nike grades the shoe on a scale from 0 to 10 , with 10 offering the most support and 0 being closest to barefoot .
For example , the Nike Free 5.0 would be like running 50 % barefoot .
I have not worn a pair of Nike Free(s ) other than trying them on in the store .
It seems they are extremely light and flexible , offering little support , but they do have a soft sole .
This is another shoe on my list to try , specifically for running .
A pair of Frees will cost you $ 90 - $ 100 .
I have directed much attention to minimalist shoes .
However , some CrossFitters prefer to go the ultra- minimalist route and workout barefoot .
Barefoot is by far the most primitive and functional way to go .
There is nothing between your foot and the ground , so no force is lost to compressing a shoe sole .
This is especially beneficial and most common when executing a 1 RM power lift such as deadlift or back squat .
However , faster movements like snatches and cleans may roll your pinky toe in ways nature did n’t intend , so perform shoeless Olympic lifts at your own risk .
I have not seen many people go barefoot when things like running or box jumps are involved .
Barefoot running or running in minimalist shoes is a hot topic in the fitness and running communities .
Research has shown that many running related injuries are actually caused by our advances in the technology of running shoes .
They allow us to run improperly , causing injury over time .
Barefoot is an option at CrossFit Impulse , and it does n’t cost anything .
Hosts of other options abound on the market .
The shoes I have mentioned are simply my picks .
Mix it up and find what works best for you .
You may find that you like Chucks for general metcons , running shoes for workouts that involve running , and weight lifting shoes for strength days .
I am certainly not suggesting you wear any particular brand , make or style of shoe .
The intent is to give you my opinion for you to use in finding what shoes work best for you as an individual .
CrossFit is about improving your fitness .
Find the shoe or shoes that will help you meet your fitness goals .
If you want to wear $ 1500 Gators during Fight Gone Bad , by all means , go for it !
The U.S. announced this week that it would upgrade its diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority by granting its mission in Washington - which is actually a PLO mission - the same status it enjoys in most European countries : that of a PLO " general delegation . "
This is still a lower status than an embassy and does not give them any diplomatic privileges or immunities - a status the PA mission does have in many African and Asian countries , as well as some European and South American states .
But it is a major step above what the PA has had until now .
Prior to this decision , the PA mission in Washington was at a very low level from the point of view of protocol :
It was not even allowed to fly the PLO flag at the entrance to its offices .
Open gallery view Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and U.S. President Barack Obama Credit : Archive
" This decision reflects our confidence that through direct negotiations , we can help achieve a two - state solution with an independent and viable Palestine living side by side with Israel , " said White House spokesman Thomas Vietor .
" We should begin preparing for that outcome now , as we continue to work with the Palestinian people on behalf of a better future . "
The PA has been seeking an upgrade in diplomatic relations ever since U.S. President Barack Obama took office last year .
But after 18 months without progress , it received a letter from the State Department on Tuesday announcing that the U.S. had agreed .
The letter was sent to Maen Areikat , who heads the PLO mission in Washington .
The Americans began seriously considering the upgrade two weeks ago as one of several steps it intends to take in an effort to entice Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas into direct talks with Israel .
A week ago , American officials contacted both the Israeli embassy in Washington and the Prime Minister 's Office in Jerusalem to see whether Israel would object to the upgrade , a senior Israeli official said .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded that he had no objections .
A senior Palestinian official confirmed the upgrade , and stressed that this is more than a symbolic step .
" This move will enable PLO officials and Palestinian diplomats to operate in Washington in an official and orderly manner , " he said .
The U.S. has also promised that if the PA does agree to direct talks , the construction freeze in the settlements will continue , and " not one house will be built , " Abbas said this week .
Abbas made this claim three days ago , in an address to his Fatah movement 's Revolutionary Council .
But since the media were barred from that meeting , it became known only Thursday , when the PA published it on its official website , Wafa .
In his speech to the council , Abbas said he has not yet received sufficiently clear answers from the Americans about other issues that he wants settled before the talks begin , and is therefore not yet willing to agree to them .
While Obama sent him a message that contained very positive statements on the subject of borders , he said , they were " not positive enough . "
Abbas said he would submit a definite response to Washington 's request for direct Israeli - Palestinian talks on July 28 , but his basic position is that direct talks will be possible only if sufficient progress is first made on the issues of borders and security during the indirect talks now being conducted with American mediation .
PA officials said this week that the PA has asked Israel for answers on several specific points relating to these issues , and will not agree to direct talks unless the replies are satisfactory .
But so far , they said , Israel has not responded .
The PA 's insistence on a complete settlement freeze stems from the fear that its image will suffer severely if it agrees to direct talks without one .
It also fears that Israel is not really serious about the talks , and would therefore rather wait until September , when the 10 - month freeze on settlement construction expires , to see whether Israel extends it .
If so , the PA might view that as a sign of good faith on Netanyahu 's part .
White House spokesman Thomas Vietor said , " This decision reflects our confidence that through direct negotiations , we can help achieve a two - state solution with an independent and viable Palestine living side by side with Israel .
We should begin preparing for that outcome now , as we continue to work with the Palestinian people on behalf of a better future . "
Israel 's defense establishment , meanwhile , has advised the government to allow the Palestinian Authority to import 50 Russian - made armored vehicles - something Israel has been refusing to do for five years now .
Russia first proposed giving the vehicles , which are armored only against light weapons , to the PA security services more than five years ago , in an effort to strengthen the rule of PA President Mahmoud Abbas .
In March 2008 , toward the end of Ehud Olmert 's term as prime minister , Israel finally informed the Russians that it would approve the deal - but only if the number was halved to 25 and the vehicles were altered so that it would be impossible to mount a machine gun on them .
The PA agreed to these restrictions , saying it needed the vehicles to maintain law and order and deter Hamas .
But in practice , the deal never went through , because Jerusalem got cold feet after the decision provoked a storm of criticism from the right wing , which accused it of repeating the mistakes of the Oslo era - when weapons Israel gave the PA were later turned on Israeli soldiers and civilians .
In the meantime , the Russians sent 50 of the vehicles to Jordan , where PA security personnel were trained in their use as part of a wider American - led training program aimed at upgrading the PA 's security capabilities .
Recently , the PA again began asking that the vehicles be allowed in , raising the issue with both Israel and the United States .
Both the Israel Defense Forces ' Central Command and the coordinator of government activities in the territories have recommended that the government accede to this request , in light of the impressive improvement in security cooperation between Israel and the PA .
A security official told Haaretz that as long as the vehicles cannot mount machine guns , they pose no danger to Israeli forces .
But it seems likely that Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak will seek to link this gesture to the effort to persuade the PA to move from indirect to direct diplomatic negotiations .
Hear that choking sound ?
That 's the dying gasps of Climategate .
The Pennsylvania State University 's investigation into allegations of misconduct by climate scientist Michael Mann found him innocent , specifically saying :
... the Investigatory Committee determined that Dr. Michael E. Mann did not engage in , nor did he participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing , conducting , or reporting research , or other scholarly activities .
Mann , as you may recall , was a key figure in the so - called Climategate fiasco , where leaked emails were purported to show scientists fixing data to make global warming evidence appear stronger .
Since Day 1 of this I have been calling it a non-event , a manufactured controversy by global warming denialists trying to make enough noise to drown out any real talk on this topic .
And time and time again I have been shown to be correct .
This conclusion by the committee is yet another nail in Climategate 's coffin .
But let me be clear : that has almost no bearing on what the denialists will say or do .
They will continue to beat this drum , have no doubt .
Climategate may be dead , but the zombie attacks will continue .
Case in point : I have written several times about Virginia State Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli , who wants to waste taxpayers ' money investigating the work Dr. Mann did while he was at the University of Virginia .
UVa is fighting these charges .
They petitioned a judge to set aside Cuccinelli 's subpoena for records from that time .
The Union of Concerned Scientists just put out a press release saying that Cuccinelli 's response to that petition has serious and critical factual errors :
Cuccinelli's response acknowledges the existence of investigations that have cleared Mann and other scientists of misconduct charges stemming from emails stolen from a British university last year , claiming those investigations " speak for themselves . "
But Cuccinelli's response repeats misleading claims to justify his subpoena , despite the fact that the investigations he referenced debunked the claims he is making .
Furthermore , he gets basic facts wrong about the content of the emails .
Wow .
You 'd almost think Cuccinelli has some sort of agenda he 's pushing .
As I 've pointed out in the links above , Cuccinelli 's investigation has all the hallmarks of a political witchhunt , and I strongly suspect these new conclusions clearing Mann of any academic wrongdoing will not stop the Attorney General .
Nor will it stop the deniers at large .
Expect the comments below to be filled with changing goalposts , poisoning of the well ( something along the lines of " scientists should n't be investigating scientists " , even though what they were investigating was Dr. Mann 's scientific conduct ) , distractions , diversions , and just general noise -- anything to bury the cold fact that the scientists involved with modeling global warming did not cheat , did not fake any data , and the bigger issue that climate change is real .
Remember , when it comes to deniers of all stripes :

If you 've been anywhere near the internet in the past few hours , you 've undoubtedly heard about a Steve Jobs email conversation in which he told an angry iPhone customer to " calm down " and that the iPhone 4 was " just a phone . "
That email chain , which was published on Boy Genius Report earlier , was also reportedly shopped to AppleInsider a few days ago -- for a price .
Well , now Fortune is reporting that they 've been told by a " a top Apple spokesman " that the emails are fake , and the exchange never happened .
Of course , emails are notoriously easy to fake , and Apple has not been in the habit of commenting on its CEO 's online wanderings , so our ears pricked up when we saw this article .
We 've reached out to Apple and they have independently confirmed to us that the conversation is indeed a hoax .
So as usual , take all of these Jobs - uncensored dialogues with a healthy grain of salt .
Free Press is still up in arms over what the reform group calls the Federal Communications Commission 's " back room " meetings with big corporations to cut a deal on net neutrality rules .
" Despite public outrage and repeated promises of transparency , the FCC continues to meet behind closed doors with the largest companies to negotiate a secret deal that would short circuit public participation in policymaking that will shape the Internet for a generation , " declared Free Press 's Josh Silver in a message just sent to us .
" The great irony here is that the FCC 's ' transparency ' policy is part of the negotiations behind closed doors . "
Which stakeholders
We 've been following this story since late June , when the news first surfaced about these meetings .
They do n't seem to be related to any single FCC proceeding .
Rather , the focus is on some compromise deal on Internet nondiscrimination rules with which everyone can live , possibly enacted over on Capitol Hill , rather than via the Commission .
" Some stakeholders have shared their ideas with staff at the Commission , including ideas for legislative options , " FCC Chief of Staff Edward Lazarus wrote on the FCC 's blog .
" To the extent stakeholders discuss proposals with Commission staff regarding other approaches outside of the open proceedings at the Commission , the agency 's ex parte disclosure requirements are not applicable . "
Lazarus ' point here is that since ex parte rules only apply to specific rule - making or inquiry proceedings , the FCC 's disclosure rules technically do n't apply .
But for " secret , " " closed , " " back room " meetings , these have been remarkably open affairs .
Here 's the sordid history of these allegedly clandestine gatherings , summaries of which we found as plain as day on Lazarus ' blog .
June 22
A small battalion of corporate biggies piled into the offices of Lazarus ' office to talk up " details relating to prospective legislation relating to open Internet principles . "
The attendants included representatives from Verizon , Google , Skype , and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , but it also included a rep from the Open Internet Coalition , which includes Free Press .
June 23
The next day the same crew had themselves another session .
Markham Erickson of the Open Internet Coalition sent in a summary of the conversation , which touched on the following issues :
Prohibitions on blocking legal content and interfering with attachment of nonharmful devices ;
Possible legislative language for a nondiscrimination principle ;
Treatment of specialized services ;
Transparency of broadband Internet service performance and network management practices ;
An enforcement regime to protect consumers ; and
The applicability of the principles to wireless platforms .
June 24
Of course it would n't be a picnic without the Motion Picture Association of America dropping by .
Ars readers can doubtless guess what was discussed , but here 's the thumbnail for the record :
" The purpose of the meeting was to discuss possible legislative proposals , in particular stressing that reasonable steps taken to address the transfer of unlawful content would not violate open internet principles , " an MPAA wrap - up of the meeting concluded .
The June 22/23 group also dropped by again for another conversation on the same bullet points .
June 28
Sprint showed up on the last Monday of June .
As we 've reported , the company is in sync with general telco opposition to the FCC partially reclassifying ISPs as Title II common carriers , but less vehemently so than AT&T and Verizon .
Sprint 's big issue is connectivity with those latter companies .
" In particular , Sprint emphasized the need to ensure access to data roaming and IP / VoIP interconnection " with other carriers , Sprint 's summary of their conversation explained .
July 12 , 14 , and 19
Next , Google , Skype , and the Open Internet Coalition had their own session with the FCC , which mostly focused on possible legislative ways to ban the blocking of legal content .
Two days later the NCTA , Verizon , and AT&T checked in for another meeting .
Then on July 19 a very mixed group gathered to offer solutions .
The guests included the MPAA , the Directors Guild of America , Public Knowledge , and the Center for Democracy and Technology — the last two organizations were often at odds with the positions of the first two .
According to MPAA 's summary of the meeting , they discussed :
Concerns that open Internet principles apply solely to lawful content ;
Concerns about the FCC 's jurisdiction over copyright law ;
The importance of respecting privacy and protecting free speech ;
Concerns about the possible implications of a nondiscrimination principle on the jobs , incomes , benefits , and creative output of Americans employed in the creative and entertainment industries .
The latest : on July 23 , the June 22 group did a repeat performance of their prior discussions .
These conversations have all been earmarked in the FCC's two main net neutrality proceedings — broadband reclassification and open Internet proposals .
But because they go beyond specific agency rules and deal with ideas for Congressional action , the Commission has more leeway to pick and choose with whom they wish to meet .
In that sense , they 're less open than normal FCC gatherings , and it 's unclear whether other groups are going to get their chance to tell the agency what Congress should do .
But if everybody ran their " secret " meetings the way the Commission is running them here , Washington , DC would be a much more transparent place .
Update
Since we posted this story , the FCC has revised its public list of these meetings .
The roster now includes conferences with the American Cable Association , XO Communications , T - Mobile USA , CTIA - The Wireless Association , Clearwire , the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , Andrew Jay Schwartzman of the Media Access Project , The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners , The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , and Free Press .
The whistleblowing website WikiLeaks says it plans to release a secret military video of one of the deadliest US air strikes in Afghanistan in which scores of children are believed to have been killed .
WikiLeaks announced the move in an email to supporters .
It said it fears it is under attack after the US authorities said they were searching for the site 's founder , Julian Assange , following the arrest of a US soldier accused of leaking the Afghanistan video and another of a US attack in Baghdad in which civilians were killed .
WikiLeaks released the Baghdad video in April , prompting considerable criticism of the US military .
It says it is still working to prepare the film of the bombing of the Afghan village of Garani in May 2009 .
The Afghan government said about 140 civilians were killed in Garani , including 92 children .
The US military initially said that up to 95 people died , of which about 65 were insurgents .
However , American officials have since wavered on that claim and a subsequent investigation admitted mistakes were made during the attack .
The video could prove to be extremely embarrassing to the US military and risks weakening Afghan support .
The US said it was targeting Taliban positions when it used weapons that create casualties over a wide area , including one - tonne bombs and others that burst in the air .
But two US military officials told a newspaper last year that no one checked to see whether there were women and children in the buildings .
The US commander , General David Petraeus , said a year ago that the military 's video of the attack would be made public as evidence that the US assault on Garani was justified .
But it was not released .
In an email to supporters , Assange said WikiLeaks has the Garani video and " a lot of other material that exposes human rights abuses by the US government " .
Last week , it was revealed that US authorities are trying to make contact with Assange to press him not to publish information the Pentagon says could endanger national security .
Assange cancelled an appearance in Las Vegas last Friday .
In his email , Assange also calls on supporters to protect the website from " attack " by the authorities following the detention of a US soldier , Bradley Manning , who was arrested in Iraq after admitting to a former hacker that he leaked the Garani and Baghdad videos to WikiLeaks .

Black Hole Blows Big Bubble
Combining observations made with ESO ’s Very Large Telescope and NASA ’s Chandra X -ray telescope , astronomers have uncovered the most powerful pair of jets ever seen from a stellar black hole .
This object , also known as a microquasar , blows a huge bubble of hot gas , 1000 light - years across , twice as large and tens of times more powerful than other known microquasars .
The discovery is reported this week in the journal Nature .
“ We have been astonished by how much energy is injected into the gas by the black hole , ” says lead author Manfred Pakull .
“ This black hole is just a few solar masses , but is a real miniature version of the most powerful quasars and radio galaxies , which contain black holes with masses of a few million times that of the Sun . ”
Black holes are known to release a prodigious amount of energy when they swallow matter .
It was thought that most of the energy came out in the form of radiation , predominantly X - rays .
However , the new findings show that some black holes can release at least as much energy , and perhaps much more , in the form of collimated jets of fast moving particles .
The fast jets slam into the surrounding interstellar gas , heating it and triggering an expansion .
The inflating bubble contains a mixture of hot gas and ultra - fast particles at different temperatures .
Observations in several energy bands ( optical , radio , X - rays ) help astronomers calculate the total rate at which the black hole is heating its surroundings .
The astronomers could observe the spots where the jets smash into the interstellar gas located around the black hole , and reveal that the bubble of hot gas is inflating at a speed of almost one million kilometres per hour .
“ The length of the jets in NGC 7793 is amazing , compared to the size of the black hole from which they are launched , ” says co-author Robert Soria [ 1 ] .
“ If the black hole were shrunk to the size of a soccer ball , each jet would extend from the Earth to beyond the orbit of Pluto . ”
This research will help astronomers understand the similarity between small black holes formed from exploded stars and the supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies .
Very powerful jets have been seen from supermassive black holes , but are thought to be less frequent in the smaller microquasar variety .
The new discovery suggests that many of them may simply have gone unnoticed so far .
The gas - blowing black hole is located 12 million light - years away , in the outskirts of the spiral galaxy NGC 7793 ( eso0914 b ) .
From the size and expansion velocity of the bubble the astronomers have found that the jet activity must have been ongoing for at least 200 000 years .
Notes
[ 1 ] Astronomers do not have yet any means of measuring the size of the black hole itself .
The smallest stellar black hole discovered so far has a radius of about 15 km .
An average stellar black hole of about 10 solar masses has a radius of about 30 km , while a “ big ” stellar black hole may have a radius of up to 300 km .
This is still much smaller than the jets , which extend out to several hundreds light years on each side of the black hole , or about several thousand million million km !

Anderson Cooper : ‘ We are not the enemy here ’
Journalists who come too close to oil spill clean - up efforts without permission could find themselves facing a $ 40,000 fine and even one to five years in prison under a new rule instituted by the Coast Guard late last week .
It ’s a move that outraged observers have decried as an attack on First Amendment rights .
And CNN ’s Anderson Cooper describes the new rules as making it “ very easy to hide incompetence or failure . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Coast Guard order states that “ vessels must not come within 20 meters [ 65 feet ] of booming operations , boom , or oil spill response operations under penalty of law . ”
But since “ oil spill response operations ” apparently covers much of the clean - up effort on the beaches , CNN ’s Anderson Cooper describes the rule as banning reporters from “ anywhere we need to be . ”
A “ willful ” violation of the new rule could result in Class D felony charges , which carry a penalty of one to five years in prison under federal law .
The new rule appears to contradict the promises made by Adm .
Thad Allen , the official leading the Coast Guard ’s response to the oil spill .
“ Media will have uninhibited access anywhere we ’re doing operations , except for two things , if it ’s a security or safety problem , ” Allen told ABC News in June .
ADVERTISEMENT
In defending the new rule , Allen told reporters that he got “ complaints from local officials ” about the safety of people near cleanup efforts .
“ We ’re not the enemy here , ” Cooper responded in a report broadcast Thursday night .
“ Those of us down here trying to accurately show what is happening — we are not the enemy .
I ’ve not heard about any journalist who ’s disrupted relief efforts ; no journalist wants to be seen as having slowed down the cleanup or made things worse .
If a Coast Guard official asked me to move , I ’d move .
But to create a blanket rule that everyone has to stay 65 feet away from boom and boats , that does n’t sound like transparency . ”
The rule has come under severe criticism not only from journalists but from observers and activists involved in the Gulf Coast clean - up .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ With this , the Gulf Coast cleanup operation has now entered a weird Orwellian reality where the news is shaped , censored and controlled by the government in order to prevent the public from learning the truth about what ’s really happening , ” writes Mike Adams at Natural News .
“ We might expect something like this from Chavez , or Castro or even the communist leaders of China , but here in the United States , we ’ve all been promised we lived in ‘ the land of the free , ' ” Adams continues .
“ Obama apparently does not subscribe to that philosophy anymore ( if he ever did ) . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Under the rule , reporters or anyone else wishing to get within 65 feet of a cleanup operation need to get permission from the Coast Guard Captain of the Port of New Orleans .
“ The fact is we ’re not attempting to keep anyone from seeing anything , ” Edward Stanton , the current Coast Guard Captain in New Orleans , told WKRG News in Mobile .
“ Nine times out of 10 , probably 10 times out of 10 Ã ¢â ‚ ¬Â access will be granted , Stanton said .
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the rule was put into place because of complaints about “ boaters interfering with the oil spill operations . ”
Yet the rule seems on its face to be just the latest attempt to reduce media coverage of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , which has now attained the status of worst accidental oil spill in history .
Reporters have been complaining for weeks about BP , the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard working to keep reporters away from wrenching images of oil - covered birds and oil - soaked beaches .
On Friday , a photographer from ProPublica was detained by police and BP officials after taking photos of a BP refinery in Texas City , Texas .
Cooper compared the latest effort to prevent access to the oil spill to similar efforts during Hurricane Katrina .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Frankly it ’s a lot like in Katrina , where they tried to make it impossible to see recovery efforts of people who died in their homes .
If we ca n’t show what is happening , warts and all … that makes it very easy to hide failure , and hide incompetence . ”
The following video was broadcast on CNN ’s Anderson Cooper 360 , July 1 , 2010 , and uploaded to YouTube by user djohnsto77 .
The number of UK service personnel killed as a result of the Afghanistan conflict since 2001 has hit 300 , after a wounded marine died in hospital .
The MoD said the man , from 40 Commando Royal Marines , died in Birmingham 's New Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Sunday .
His family has been informed .
He had been injured in a blast in the Sangin district of Helmand on 12 June .
The prime minister said it was a moment for the whole country to reflect on the sacrifices the armed forces make .
David Cameron said the marine 's death was " desperately sad news " and another family was suffering " grief , pain and loss " .
' High price '
" The 300th death is no more or less tragic than the 299 that came before , " he said .
" But it 's a moment for the whole country to reflect on the incredible service and sacrifice and dedication that the armed forces give on our behalf . "
About 10,000 British military personnel are in Afghanistan as part of a 45 - nation Nato - led force .
If no real and measurable progress is made in the course of this year , and the death toll rises significantly over a fresh summer of fighting , calls in the UK for an earlier withdrawal of troops will increase Caroline Wyatt , BBC defence correspondent Tragic milestone for UK troops
Life for those waiting back at base UK fatalities in images
It was deployed in the wake of al - Qaeda 's 9/11 attacks on the US , with the aim of unseating Afghanistan 's then Taliban rulers said to be harbouring those responsible .
Mr Cameron , who recently warned the UK to expect more casualties during the summer of this " vital year " , acknowledged that many people questioned the country 's role .
" We are there because the Afghans are not yet ready to keep their own country safe and to keep terrorists and terrorist training camps out of their country . "
UK forces would withdraw as soon as Afghanistan could ensure its own security , he added .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai's spokesman said he recognised the forces ' sacrifices " to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan , to the region and to the rest of the world " .
It was nearly seven years before the UK's dead in Afghanistan numbered 100 but the past two years have seen an increasing casualty rate .
Last year was particularly bloody , largely because of the proliferation of insurgents ' increasingly sophisticated roadside bombs , with the 200th death marked in August and more than 100 over the calendar year .
It has taken just 10 months for the total to increase to 300 , with about 4,000 British troops involved in Operation Moshtarak , aimed at shoring up government control in southern Helmand .
British military spokesman Maj Gen Gordon Messenger said the threat of makeshift bombs , known as IEDs , was a daily part of life for troops .
" The threat is getting more lethal in that the IEDs - that is the weapon of choice - are widespread on the ground .
We are also on patrol more , " he said .
Troops were operating " in areas that would be of no surprise to the Taliban " to deliver security to the population , he added .
Some 34 of the 300 deaths have been from accidents , illness or non-combat injuries .
The announcement of the 300th UK military death in Afghanistan is a reminder that the clock of public impatience is ticking ever louder for Nato 's mission there .
It 's going to take years more to train Afghan National Army and police units to a level where they can handle the security challenges being thrown at them by the Taliban , drug lords and other insurgents .
Put simply , Nato does n't have years to play with , it has months .
The Dutch and the Canadians are on their way out , while President Barack Obama has indicated he wants to begin withdrawing US troops in mid-2011 .
This does not mean the situation is hopeless , nor that Afghanistan should be hastily abandoned to the Taliban , al - Qaeda or an anarchic civil war .
What it means is that the Nato - led coalition will need to show demonstrable progress in the south - and soon - if the generals wish to retain their countries ' political backing .
Another 1,282 UK military and civilian personnel have been wounded in action since 2006 , including about 388 who suffered serious or life - threatening injuries .
Of those , 120 lost limbs .
The Ministry of Defence has no clear record of how many casualties there were before then , although statistics show 10 were seriously hurt .
Speaking about the latest death , 40 Commando spokesman Maj Renny Bulmer said : " Our thoughts are with his immediate family who were with him at the hospital .
" His courage and sacrifice will not be forgotten . "
The death was announced as it emerged three Australian commandos and a US soldier had been killed in a helicopter crash in Kandahar province .
Seven other Australians were injured , two seriously .
The US has suffered the most fatalities of the coalition partners , losing 1,125 personnel since 2001 according to the independent iCasualties website , although its presence numbers 100,000 .
However , countries with much smaller military force in the country have suffered significant losses .
For example Denmark , whose presence numbers 750 , has suffered 33 fatalities , while 147 Canadian personnel have died from its force of about 2,800 .
The chief of the defence staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , said personnel from across the world were " putting their lives on the line " every day and that people owed them their backing .
Defence Secretary Liam
Fox said the UK 's resolve to see through the mission and prevent the creation of a " security vacuum " in Afghanistan remained " steadfast " .
The British deputy commander of the Nato - led force , Lt Gen Nick Parker , said individual tragedies must not be allowed to affect the mission 's plan .
" What people want is definable progress so that we start to bring sustainable security to Afghanistan , and that 's what we 're doing , " he told the BBC .
' Clear strategy '
However , shadow foreign secretary David Miliband said the government must have a " clear strategy " to bring the conflict to an end .
" That can't be done by military means alone .
It needs a political settlement , " he added .
Meanwhile , at a protest outside Downing Street on Tuesday , the Stop the War Coalition will demand troops are withdrawn immediately .
Convenor Lindsey German said : " This is obviously a very sad occasion but ... the government should now admit there is no justification for British troops to be in Afghanistan and bring them home . "
Labour MP for Newport West , Paul Flynn , told the BBC it was a " complete myth " that fighting in Afghanistan could stop al - Qaeda .
" They already can work in those areas where the Taliban occupy in Afghanistan .
We 're only there in a small area , and they can also operate in Pakistan , and in the Gulf , and in north Africa . "

In a blow to opponents of the use of naughty words on television and radio , a federal appeals court today knocked down the Federal Communications Commission 's indecency policy on what can or can't be broadcast over the nation 's airwaves , asserting that the policy violates the First Amendment of the Constitution .
The ruling , issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , stems from a March 2006 FCC ruling which found that the broadcast networks could be fined for airing unscripted expletives .
The networks sued the FCC over that ruling .
And the court today found that " the FCC 's policy violates the First Amendment because it is unconstitutionally vague , creating a chilling effect that goes far beyond the fleeting expletives at issue here . "
In the ruling , the court finds that " under the current policy , broadcasters must choose between not airing or censoring controversial programs and risking massive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses , and it is not surprising which option they choose .
Indeed there is ample evidence in the record that the FCC 's indecency policy has chilled protected speech . "
One telling example noted in the ruling : Phoenix TV stations dropped live coverage of a memorial service for Pat Tillman , the former football start killed on active military duty in Afghanistan , " because of language used by Tillman 's family members to express their grief . "
The 32 - page decision makes for a lot livelier reading than the average court opinion , quoting liberally from examples of expletives the FCC has previously found to be in violation of its indecency policy .

Multiple uses of the word " bullshit " on NYPD Blue .
There 's also a section of the ruling which discusses the vagueness of the FCC 's policy , noting that in the case of an episode of NYPD Blue that was found to be patently offensive by the Commission , the FCC ruled that you could n't use the word " bullshit " - but that the word " dickhead " was fine .

Fernando Alonso believes Ferrari is set to make big strides with its forthcoming developments , and denied that the next upgrade package is a ' last ditch effort ' to rescue its title bid .
The former champion has not won since the Bahrain season - opener , but following a dismal Turkish Grand Prix that saw Ferrari trailing Mercedes and Renault as well as McLaren and Red Bull , Alonso was a frontrunner all weekend in Canada and finished third after a tough battle for victory with the McLarens .
Having not changed its package at all for Montreal , Ferrari is now introducing significant upgrades for Valencia , which is understood to include a new exhaust system that will improve airflow over the rear aerodynamics .
Alonso reckons this step will be the piece Ferrari needs to get firmly back in contention - and reminded critics of Ferrari 's recent performance that last year , during a much worse season , it still rallied to a string of podiums and a win with Kimi Raikkonen in the summer .
" We will have major updates on the F10 which I hope will allow us to up our performance level , " Alonso wrote in his blog for Ferrari 's website .
" Following on from that , we have further developments in the pipeline which should arrive for England and Germany : which is to say that the European Grand Prix is simply the ninth round of the championship , not a last ditch effort for Ferrari , which I heard some people saying .
" I do n't see how they can say that given that we have not even reached the halfway point of the season and that after Valencia there will still be ten grands prix to go .
" I 've said it before and I 'll say it again now , this is a stage event and the final one of those stages will not come until November in Abu Dhabi .
There is still a long way to go and things can change very quickly , going either one way or the other .
" People seem to have forgotten that last year , in the middle part of the season and in a car that was getting ever less competitive , Kimi was the driver who had scored the most points . "
Alonso added that the Canada performance proved that Ferrari had never really been in crisis , and that its Istanbul slump was just an anomaly .
" We were back to where we have been in practically all the other races , the one exception being Turkey , where for various reasons , everything about the grand prix went wrong , from every point of view , " he said .
" The normal situation is the one we have seen in Montreal , Monaco , Melbourne and Sakhir and all the other tracks where we fought for a podium finish .
" Maybe the results did not always match our potential , but I think the same can be said for all the top teams .
In these first eight races of the season , all sorts of things happened - mistakes , reliability problems , bad luck - but we are still in the thick of the fight for both championships .
The same can be said of McLaren and Red Bull , who have also missed out on points along the way . "
If you want to add cheese of any kind , do it in the last half - minute of the process .
Do n't overcook it .
For an 1000W microwave lamp running at 100 % power :
slice of cheddar , gouda , emmentaler : 10s
farmhouse cheeses , very fat , but somewhat dry , lightly astringent : 20 -30s
extra - dry cheese like italian Parmesan : 30s - 1 minute -> this is your best bet !
Do n't microwave blue - green cheeses .
Nasty .
Most should be eaten cold .
You may have some success with light white cheeses such as Brie , Camembert , certain regional varieties .
Greek feta is not a good idea either .
Avoid factory - melt cheeses .
They use various potassium salts which still linger .
Microwaving them further transforms the composition of the cheese , making it unsuitable for eating , if not toxic .

This is an unbelievable story of true friendship .
A young girl and a monkey became close friends .
Emily Bland taught the orang - utan named Rishi how to pour tea and take strolls together .
This all happened at the Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species ( TIGERS ) in Florida when both friends were still at the crawling stage .
Still the story is n’t over …
Two years later Emily met Rishi again , and the two friends found new ways how to have fun !

The last time members of a Northern California Indian tribe held a coming - of - age ceremony beside a popular river , they were heckled by boaters .
Drunks yelled racial taunts , jet - ski engines roared and a woman flipped down her bathing - suit top as she passed them .
The tiny group known as the Winnemem Wintu saw it as their right to hold a sacred ceremony on their ancestral land undisturbed .
But some vacationers on the McCloud River arm of Lake Shasta near Redding were more in tune with a man who shouted : “ Hey dude — it ’s our river too ! ”
This weekend the Winnemem are trying again , preparing an elaborate four - day rite for two teenage girls .
A third was set to participate but opted out because of anxiety about outsiders ’ reaction , said Winnemem chief Caleen Sisk - Franco .
The U.S. Forest Service is putting up signs announcing a “ voluntary closure ” along the shore and on a 200 - yard stretch of the river .
Still , the Winnemem are bracing for trouble during the ceremony , called Balas Chonas .
“ We know what to expect , ” said Sisk - Franco .
“ We know there will be some hostile people who go through the voluntary closure .
It ’s incredible that the U.S. Forest Service can’t find any way to stop them . ”
The Forest Service weighed the public ’s right to recreation against the tribe ’s right to its rituals and decided it had no legal authority to shut off the contested portion of river during the ceremony .
Supporters of the 125 - member tribe say they will take to the water themselves , asking boaters to reverse course to avoid disrupting the rites .
Forest Service employees will deliver the same message , according to Debbie Davis , of the Environmental Coalition for Water Justice , a Sacramento - based group that has taken up the tribe ’s cause .
“ I have to say that the Forest Service has tried very hard to figure out how to do a full closure , ” she said .
“ The challenge is that the tribe is n’t federally recognized . ”
Under a 2008 law , agencies can temporarily bar the public from areas in which tribes are conducting rituals .
But those tribes must be federally recognized — and most California tribes , despite lengthy attempts to meet federal criteria , are not .
In a letter to tribal representatives , J. Sharon Heywood , supervisor of the Shasta - Trinity National Forest , said it ’s the Shasta County Sheriff ’s Office that has jurisdiction over boat traffic on the lake .
A spokesman for the sheriff ’s office referred all questions to the Forest Service , where a spokeswoman had no comment .
Lacking federal recognition has made life more difficult , say the Winnemem .
Last year , they sued six federal agencies , accusing them of destroying sacred sites during road and bridge construction .
“ The government ’s position basically is that since we ’re not recognized , we ’re not really Indians — and ca n’t have sacred sites , ” Sisk - Franco said .
The Winnemem , whose ancestors lived along what is now the McCloud River , say they ceded 4,800 acres to the federal government in return for land that was never delivered .
Meanwhile , the creation of the lake flooded many of their sacred sites .
Only when the water level drops in the summer does the place they call Puberty Rock emerge .
It ’s a central spot in the coming - of - age ritual , in which the girls sleep several nights in a cedar - bark lodge on one side of the river .
On the day after a full moon , they and their minders swim the 200 feet or so across the McCloud as tribal members on the other side welcome them to womanhood .
In 2006 , the tribe performed its first such ceremony in 80 years .
On the final day , Shasta County sheriff ’s deputies blockaded the river for several hours after the Forest Service asked them to step in .

After their former hosting provider received an injunction telling it to stop providing bandwidth to The Pirate Bay , the worlds most resilient BitTorrent site switched to a new ISP .
That host , the Swedish Pirate Party , made a stand on principle .
Now they aim to take things further by running the site from inside the Swedish Parliament .
When the Swedish Pirate Party announced , back in mid-May , that they were the new ISP of The Pirate Bay , it surprised a lot of people .
With their latest announcement , that they will run The Pirate Bay from inside the Swedish Parliament , they hope they will surprise people again .
The Pirate Parties around the world are best known for copyright activism and are often seen as a ‘ one - issue party ’ .
While they also focus on privacy , government transparency , free speech , and patent reform , it is copyright that people ’s minds spring to .
So , with an election coming up , the Swedish Pirate Party has decided to play to their strength .
The party has announced today that they intend to use part of the Swedish Constitution to further these goals , specifically Parliamentary Immunity from prosecution or lawsuit for things done as part of their political mandate .
They intend to push the non-commercial sharing part of their manifesto , by running The Pirate Bay from ‘ inside ’ the Parliament , by Members of Parliament .
This move will certainly push the site to center - stage in Sweden .
It will ensure a huge amount of scrutiny in any and all decisions made regarding the site , which is undoubtedly the intent .
“ Sweden has long been a nation at the forefront of IT .
But we have fallen in the rankings , largely because today ’s politicians do not see the connection between file - sharing culture and future industry skills .
We have now moved from place three to eight in available household bandwidth , ” the Pirate Party informed Torrent Freak in a statement .
“ There is no reason for us to accept this development – there are no technical reasons for this , only political . ”
“ Therefore , we can never accept the copyright industry ’s way of systematically and legally harassing anyone who tries to build next - generation industries .
The approach is criminal in the world and should be criminal in Sweden also , professional saboteurs are professional criminals , whoever they get their money from , ” the Party added .
Aside from hosting The Pirate Bay in Parliament , the Pirate Party also plans to criminalize copyright lawsuits against noncommercial file - sharers and websites , as well as lawsuits against ISPs for linking to copyrighted material .
“ The Lobby is used to using dirty tricks .
Let ’s see them take on legislators under constitutional protection who aim to criminalize their entire bag of dirty tricks , ” Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge told us .
Of course , the plan can only take place if the Party wins some seats in the September 19th Elections , where there is a 4 % barrier to overcome .
However , last June they did manage 7 % in the European Parliament elections , so it ’s not an impossible goal by any means .
We will have to wait and see what September brings .
If The Pirate Party succeeds it will add some more controversy to the upcoming appeal of the ‘ Pirate Bay Four ’ , which is currently scheduled to take place a month after the general elections .
CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert got in another word about the messy , heartbreaking split with LeBron James .
He promised it 's his last one .
It had better be or NBA commissioner David Stern could fine him another $ 100,000 .
On Monday , Gilbert said he strongly disagrees with Rev. Jesse Jackson 's criticism of his recent comments about James , who announced last week he was leaving Cleveland after seven seasons to join fellow All - Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat .
Shortly after James ' announcement , Gilbert fired off an incendiary letter to Cavs fans , vilifying the 25 - year - old and calling his decision to bolt Cleveland as " narcissistic " and " cowardly behavior . "
He also guaranteed his team would win an NBA title " BEFORE THE SELF - TITLED FORMER ' KING ' WINS ONE . "
Gilbert took it a step further when he later told The Associated Press in a phone interview that he felt the NBA 's two - time MVP quit on the Cavs during the playoffs the past two years , and that James " has gotten a free pass . "
He also said James should be held accountable for his actions .
Jackson responded to Gilbert 's remarks on Sunday by saying the Cavs owner sees James as a " runaway slave " and that Gilbert 's comments put the player in danger .
" He speaks as an owner of LeBron and not the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers , " Jackson said in a release from his Chicago - based civil - rights group .
" His feelings of betrayal personify a slave master mentality .
He sees LeBron as a runaway slave .
This is an owner employee relationship -- between business partners -- and LeBron honored his contract . "
In a statement released by the team on Monday , Gilbert tried to put an end to the issue .
" I strongly disagree with Rev. Jesse Jackson 's recent comments and we are not going to engage in any related discussion on it , " Gilbert said .
" Going forward , we 're very excited about the Cavaliers and the positive future of our region . "
Gilbert is attending the owners ' meetings in Las Vegas , where Stern fined him $ 100,000 for the " inappropriate " comments about James .
" He was completely correct in expressing his disappointment , " Stern said , adding that Gilbert 's statement and the sentiments he expressed in a follow - up interview with the AP were " a little bit extreme . "
Stern also said Jackson is a friend and ally to the league , but as with Gilbert , felt the reaction simply went too far .
" However well - meaning Jesse may be in the premise on this one , he is , as he rarely is , mistaken , " Stern said .
" And I would have told him so had he called me before he issued his statement , rather than this morning .
But he is a good friend of the NBA and our players .
Has worked arduously on many good causes and we work together in many matters . "

KABUL , Afghanistan 
Ten civilians , including at least five women and children , were killed in NATO airstrikes in Khost Province , the provincial police chief said Saturday .
Five other civilians were killed , as were two Afghan National Army soldiers and two police officials , in other violence around the country on Saturday .
NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force said in a statement that it had carried out precision airstrikes against a large number of armed insurgents from the Haqqani network , Taliban allies operating in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
“ We are aware of conflicting reports of civilian casualties from local officials and are therefore reviewing the operational details of the engagement , ” the force said in a statement .
“ Our mission is to protect the population and we will accept full responsibility if civilians were unintentionally harmed in the intense fight against the insurgents . ”
Coalition forces claimed to have killed at least 17 Taliban insurgents in six operations throughout the country , including a Taliban subcommander , Mullah Abdul Razaq .
The International Security Assistance Force said Mr. Razaq was suspected of involvement in a roadside bombing that killed two American soldiers in northern Kunduz Province on Wednesday .
ISAF said Mr. Razaq and “ a number of insurgents ” were killed on a raid on their compound in the Chahar Darah District .
My friend tweets a lot .
She tweets when she wakes up in the morning , just before going to work , as soon as she ’s back home , just before she goes to sleep , and at anytime in between that !
And no , she just does n’t tweet to share about personal thoughts and activities … she uses Twitter for marketing her business .
What is Twitter ?
Twitter , a micro- blogging tool , has become a powerful marketing instrument today .
Almost every business uses Twitter for marketing , and why not ?
It has become a valuable tool in building your network , establishing connections , engaging in valuable conversations and making friends .
All of these things are essential in marketing and public relations , and if you ’re not yet sold on this micro- blogging phenomenon , now is the time to reconsider and use Twitter for marketing .
Here are the 5 ways you can utilize Twitter for marketing :
1. Promote blog articles , webinars , interesting news and more .
Share valuable information through your tweets .
You not only promote your name and business – you get to share to thousands of people , who could retweet your information to their own followers !
2. Provide live updates .
If you ’re attending a conference , seminar or trade show , you can use Twitter to announce last minute changes and events that are happening as it happens .
3 . Announce specials , deals or sales .
If you have some exciting promotional activities , Twitter is a nifty way of getting the message across to your target market .
Remember though , that Twitter should not be used as a pitch tool .
This turns people off , so you do n’t want to be doing any aggressive marketing here because this should be a place for sharing information and knowledge .
4. Eavesdrop and get valuable feedback .
You can also monitor what people are saying about any person , topic or company .
Twitter has a search engine that lets you do just this .
Or , you can use the hash tag #symbol .
5 . Keep in touch with bloggers / media .
Bloggers abound on Twitter .
Follow those who inspire you , and find others who have valuable information to share too .
Be friends , and take advantage of the power of the retweet button to spread great information !
Indeed , Twitter is a great promotional and marketing tool , and for pointing to interesting things you ’ve found on the web .
It ’s also great for building credibility and influence , so use it , and use it well .

Ten Benefits of Expatriation
Everybody has their own personal reasons for expatriating , but here are some of the benefits :
1 ) Freedom from the global US tax net .
Taxing you no matter where you breathe on this earth is wanton American exceptionalism .
What other nations do n’t dare do to their citizens , the US government does n’t think twice about .
Once you renounce , it ’s your choice either to live the rest of your life free of any tax net , or to pick a place you want to be year - round and opt into the tax system ( assuming it ’s not a tax - free jurisdiction ) .
If you do , you ’ll at least know you have the freedom to walk away from it by simply moving elsewhere .
Taxes in the US are already high , and rates are set to increase across the board .
To gain some perspective , it ’s clarifying to calculate the number of months per year you work for the government .
How many months did it take to pay all the federal , state , and local income taxes , capital gains taxes , FICA taxes , property taxes , and AMT – plus the raft of permitting , licensing and accounting costs you incur over the course of a year ?
Add corporate taxes if you ’re a business owner .
And do n’t forget the new 3.8 % health care surcharge tax on all investment income , including dividends .
Be honest and add it all up .
You ’ll then have a decent idea of how much it costs you in time and money to be a US citizen every year .
That cost will rise dramatically going forward .
Here ’s the take - away :
The biggest guaranteed return on your capital that you ’ll ever have is investing your money free of taxes .
Do some long - run compounding calculations with and without taxes to see what I mean .
I ’ll wager John Templeton did .
2 ) Freedom from the death tax .
Its political label is the “ estate tax , ” but the fact is the tax is based solely on your demise .
I used to think the death tax only applied to gains on assets that had not been taxed already .
How naïve I was !
It grabs half of all your assets , regardless of the fact that you ’ve paid taxes on them .
If you have over a few million dollars net worth , your heirs will be writing a heart - stopping check to the IRS .
They also may be forced to liquidate your assets to raise cash .
This has happened to countless small businesses and family farms .
And if you ’re a young , talented entrepreneur who goes on to earn substantial wealth over the course of your life , the death tax has you in its crosshairs too .
The death tax is 45 % now and is scheduled to jump to 55 % in 2011 .
Either way , the amount is staggering .
Expatriation lifts the death tax burden from your children and other heirs .
3 ) Freedom from the US government ’s War on Solvency .
Washington ’s crazed debt addiction is uncontrollable and endemic .
US politicians have strapped an inconceivably large debt burden on the backs of their subjects .
It pays to spend some time on www.usdebtclock.org.
The multi-trillion dollar debt avalanche roars on , headed straight towards economic hell .
After “ Debt Per Taxpayer ” and “ Liability Per Citizen , ” check out “ US Unfunded Liabilities ” to see a number that ’s suited to astronomical calculations – not economics .
Do n’t be tricked into thinking this is a partisan issue .
It ’s sobering to review the debt records of both Democratic and Republican administrations …to behold what politicians do when given trillions of dollars of other people ’s money .
They spend it all – and then borrow trillions more !
Of course , the burden of servicing that debt is on you , not them .
Their six - figure salaries are guaranteed , along with their uber - perks and fully funded pension plans .
While often described as “ the richest nation in the world , ” the reality is that the US is the most indebted nation , by a country mile .
No other government comes close to matching the debt burden that has been dumped onto every taxpayer .
The US government is rampantly incurring debt in your name , and you have no way to stop it or slow it down .
Standing in free speech zones with protest signs did n’t work when it came to war and crony bailouts , and it wo n’t work for the debt burden either .
The one truly meaningful act you can take as an individual is to opt out .
Unload the government ’s debt burden off your back .
Do n’t let yourself or your family be a casualty of the government ’s War on Solvency .
4 ) Freedom from being treated like a “ toxic citizen . ”
When traveling abroad , being a US passport holder used to be a positive thing .
Now it ’s an albatross .
The New York Times article I cited earlier explains it plainly : Americans abroad are being treated like “ toxic citizens . ”
They ’re cut off from banking and other business and investing opportunities solely because of their US citizenship .
Typical currency controls do n’t permit you to take money out of a country .
The US does n’t have that ( yet ) .
Instead , and this is quite clever , the government enacts laws and regulations that function as indirect currency controls .
There are so many Patriot Act and other costly impositions forced on foreign banks that handle US customers that they ’re simply refusing to put up with the harassment .
Here ’s the upshot :
Your money is n’t fenced in ; it ’s fenced out .
If you seek firsthand evidence , visit a major banking center outside the US and try to open a bank account .
Odds are you ’ll be turned away when the bank finds out you ’re a US citizen .
Reports abound of US citizens ’ long - held accounts at foreign banks being summarily terminated .
The US government has made its subjects , along with their money , persona non grata .
I ’ve read that some foreign banks are now setting up , in essence , holding pens designed to handle US citizens who want to bank offshore .
But , really , what ’s the point ?
You ’re burdened with having to file extra IRS paperwork , along with FBAR forms to the Treasury Department .
And even if you do n’t file all the extra papers ( not a smart move ) , new laws force foreign banks who accept US customers to report on you anyway .
They are pressured to sign “ information reporting agreements ” to have US citizens as customers .
Google “ FATCA ” and “ qualified intermediary agreements ” if you want details .
Now for the most extreme instance of liability .
Being a US passport holder can mean life or death in the context of a terrorist attack .
The US government ’s never - ending War on Terror makes the world more dangerous for Americans .
After so many years of bombing and military occupation in the Middle East , how can the hundreds of thousands of civilians who ’ve been maimed and killed by the US government NOT be the source of enduring resentment and blowback ?
Needless to say , the US passport is on the short list of ones you least want to have if somebody sticks a gun in your face and says , “ Passport . ”
Unfortunately , this has happened on more than one occasion , and it would be unreasonable to assume it wo n’t happen in the future .
5 ) Freedom from the paperwork prison .
Millions of Americans are plagued every year by days , sometimes weeks , of preparing tax documents and paying thousands of dollars to accountants to decipher the IRS tax code .
There are , literally , hundreds of different IRS forms .
The tornado of rules and regulations in the tax code fills roughly 70,000 pages .
And then you have to save boxes and boxes of papers for years in fear of someday being audited and not being able to produce the demanded documents .
If you ’re unfamiliar with audits , here ’s how they work :
You ’re guilty of whatever the IRS claims , unless you prove yourself innocent .
If that sounds preposterous , I encourage you to ask a tax lawyer .
“ Innocent until proven guilty ” does not apply .
Freedom from spending days of tedium on mind - numbing paperwork and thousands on accounting fees has been an absolute joy .
Highly recommended .

Here , the upper tooth rows of Timor 's extinct giant rat ( left ) , the biggest rat that ever lived , compared with the skull of a black rat ( right ) , one of the most common rats , weighing some 5 ounces ( 150 grams ) .
The skull of the black rat shown here is 35 mm long .
Watch out Heathcliff , there 's a rat out there bigger than you .
Or at least there was .
Just a couple thousand years ago , the world 's largest rat , weighing more than the average house cat , scuttled about what is now East Timor of Southeast Asia .
The skeletal remains of the robust rodent were found in a cave , researchers announced today .
The excavations also turned up 13 other species of rodents , 11 of which are new to science , with eight of the rats estimated to have weighed more than 2 pounds ( 1 kg ) .
When alive , the giant of the bunch weighed some 13.2 pounds ( 6 kilograms ) .
For comparison , a house rat weighs on average 5 ounces ( 150 grams ) .
Today 's heftiest rats weigh around 4.4 pounds ( 2 kg ) and live in rain forests in the Philippines and New Guinea .
Carbon dating suggests the animal lived up until 1,000 to 2,000 years ago , along with most of the other Timorese rodents found during the excavations .
Only one of the smaller species found is known to survive on Timor today , the researchers say .
" People have lived on the island of Timor for over 40,000 years and hunted and ate rats throughout this period , yet extinctions did not occur until quite recently , " said study researcher Ken Aplin of CSIRO , adding that the arrival of humans to an area does n't necessarily have to equate with extinctions .
( CSIRO is the national government body for scientific research in Australia . )
" Large - scale clearing of forest for agriculture probably caused the extinctions , and this may have only been possible following the introduction of metal tools , " Aplin said .
East Indonesia is a hotspot for rat evolution , Aplin said .
In fact , each of the islands of eastern Indonesia evolved it own unique rat species .
Aplin also has found six new rat species in a cave on the island of Flores .
Though most of Timor today is arid , it was once covered by lush rain forests .
Even so , Aplin does n't rule out finding other " new " creatures today .
" Although less than 15 percent of Timor 's original forest cover remains , parts of the island are still heavily forested , so who knows what might be out there ? "
Aplin said .
Aplin and Kris Helgen of the Smithsonian Institution detail their findings this week in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History .

News Feature
A new class of materials is poised to take condensed - matter physics by storm .
Geoff Brumfiel looks at what is making topological insulators all the rage .
For a brief time in Portland , Oregon , this past spring , thousands of physicists moved from session to session at the annual March meeting of the American Physical Society ( APS ) on the lookout for the next big thing .
It was a talent search not unlike the one that unfolds every night in the bars and converted dance halls of Portland 's famous music scene , where locals listen for the next big sound .
The physicists ' quest is a lot harder , though .
Trends in music come and go , but the disciplines that dominate the APS March meeting — such as optics , electronics and condensed - matter physics — are rooted in the original theories of quantum mechanics , which were more - or - less completed in the 1930s .
When it comes to describing how light and matter behave , only a few phenomena have emerged since then to become the physics equivalent of superstars .
At this year 's APS meeting , however , the hallways were filled with talk of a promising newcomer — an eccentric class of materials known as topological insulators .
The most striking characteristic of these insulators is that they conduct electricity only on their surfaces .
The reasons are mathematically subtle — so much so that one physicist , Zahid Hasan of Princeton University in New Jersey , tried to explain the behaviour using ' simpler ' concepts such as superstring theory .
( " It 's awfully beautiful stuff , " he said reassuringly . )
Yet the implications are rich , ranging from practical technology for quantum computing to laboratory tests of advanced particle physics .
Hence the excitement .
It is still too early to say whether topological insulators are the next big thing .
But physicists are auditioning various formulations of the insulators in their labs , eager to determine whether the material can live up to its many promises .
A topological insulator sounds simple enough — a block of material that lets electrons move along its surface , but not through its inside .
In fact , it is far from straightforward .
Ordinary metals conduct electrons all the way through , whereas ordinary insulators do n't conduct electrons at all .
A copper -plated block of wood conducts only on the surface , but that is two materials , not one .
The idea of a topological insulator is so strange that for a long time , physicists had no reason to believe that such a material would exist .
Electrons move along the surface of , but not through , topological insulators such as bismuth selenide .

Quantum dance
Things changed in 2004 , when Charles Kane , a theoretical physicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , was studying sheets of carbon called graphene .
Kane 's calculations suggested that electrons would move through this one - atom - thick material in a way that reminded him of the quantum Hall effect : a phenomenon first observed in 1980 .
This effect occurs when electrons are confined to thin films of certain materials , subjected to large electric and magnetic fields , and cooled to within just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
At that point , the ordinarily chaotic motion of the electrons gives way to a more orderly collective behaviour governed by quantum mechanics .
The transition shows up in the laboratory as a series of discrete quantum steps in the capacity of the material to conduct electricity .
What Kane and his group saw in their graphene calculations was n't exactly the same as the quantum Hall effect .
Even so , further analyses showed that there might be other thin - film materials with similar behaviour .
This time there would be no need for huge external magnetic fields or ultra-low temperatures to get the electrons moving in unison .
Such a material would produce the magnetic field from the nuclei of its own atoms — possibly even at room temperature .
These coordinated electrons would mostly end up just spinning in place .
Intriguingly , however , those at the edge of the thin film would be forced to skip along the boundary .
The net result would be that thin samples would conduct electricity along the edge — and only along the edge — but in separate quantum steps , similar to those seen in the quantum Hall effect1 .
The work of Kane and his colleagues got noticed almost immediately .
Joel Moore , a theorist at the University of California , Berkeley , and his co-workers built on Kane 's calculations to show that three - dimensional blocks of material would also display quantum effects2 , although the way electrons moved along the surface would be more complex than in the flat sheet used by Kane .
Moore also gave the materials a new name .
They were originally termed " novel Z 2 topological invariants " by Kane , in reference to the quantum - mechanical properties that cause the electrons to skip along the edge .
" We got tired of typing that out , so we called it a ' topological insulator ' , " says Moore .
" I do n't know that that term is particularly explanatory , but at least it 's short . "
Meanwhile , Shoucheng Zhang at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , and his team were researching what types of real material could be topological insulators .
In most materials , Zhang realized , the link between electrons and nuclei is too weak to create a topological - insulating behaviour .
But the link gets stronger as the nuclei get heavier .
In 2006 , Zhang predicted that one material in particular , a crystal made of the heavy elements mercury and tellurium , would be able to do the trick3 .
And within a year , Laurens Molenkamp , a physicist at the University of Würzburg in Germany , and his group had grown a thin layer of mercury telluride crystal and showed that its conductance hopped from one quantum value to the next along the edge of the sample4 .
The experiment by Molenkamp proved that the theorists were onto something , but by itself it did n't cause much excitement .
Mercury telluride crystals are difficult to obtain — they have to be grown one layer at a time using a laborious process known as molecular beam epitaxy — and they are not pure topological insulators because they conduct some electricity on their inside .
New compounds based around bismuth , which are simple to make and cheap to work with , have caused the field to take off .
" What got so many talks at the March meeting was the bismuth - based compounds , " says Hasan .
" Anybody can grow them , you can buy them off the shelf , and you do n't need a high - purity crystal to see the topological effects . "
Those effects go beyond the way electrons move on the surface .
For example , all electrons are spinning in a quantum mechanical way .
Usually , the spins are constantly knocked about by random collisions and stray magnetic fields .
But spinning electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are protected from disruption by quantum effects ( for more , see page 323 ) .
This could make the materials beneficial for spin-related electronics , which would use the orientation of the electron spin to encode information , thereby opening up a whole new realm of computer technology .
Mathematical mimicry
Joel Moore : " There 's something about many - particle quantum mechanics that causes perfection to emerge out of imperfection . "

Researchers also believe that the collective motions of electrons inside topological insulators will mimic several of the never - before - seen particles predicted by high - energy physicists .
Among them are axions , hypothetical particles predicted in the 1970s ; magnetic monopoles , single points of north and south magnetism ; and Majorana particles — massless , chargeless entities that can serve as their own antiparticles .
This mimicry is not entirely surprising .
Almost by definition , collective electron motions can be described by just a handful of variables obeying simple equations , says Frank Wilczek , a Nobel - prizewinning particle physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
" There are only a few kinds of equations that you can write down that are really simple , " he says .
So topological - insulator theorists and particle physicists have almost inevitably ended up in the same place .
Majorana particles could prove particularly useful for practical quantum computing .
The idea is to perform calculations using the laws of quantum mechanics , which could make computers much faster than the normal variety at certain tasks such as code - breaking .
But the fragile quantum states essential to their operation are easily destroyed by jolts from the outside environment .
Majorana particles would spread quantum information across particles , making them far more resistant to interference , says Kane .
If Majorana particles could be harnessed on the surface of a topological insulator , " this would be big " , he says .
The wealth of calculations , experiments and applications offered by topological insulators , together with their availability , have given the field a white - hot status at the moment — as has a certain thirst for glory .
Two variations of the quantum Hall effect have won their discoverers Nobel prizes , and some researchers think that a Nobel awaits whoever can contribute the most to the growing field .
" I 'm not thinking about that at this point , " says Kane , but the competitiveness has forced him to ensure that others are aware of his work .
" I sort of feel like if I do n't assert myself , then I 'm going to get buried , " he says .

Yet trips to Stockholm are some way off .
Although samples of topological insulators are now easy to get hold of , most still contain impurities that cause them to conduct electricity on the inside , disrupting the states on the surface .
Getting things perfect remains more of an art than a science .
Furthermore , some of the sought - after effects will require topological insulators to be combined with more common materials .
To create Majorana particles , for example , topological insulators will have to merge with superconductors .
Many experiments on how best to do that are under way .
The results of these studies will determine whether topological insulators are more than a one - hit wonder .
Regardless , says Moore , there is an undeniable appeal in how the collective behaviour of electrons can lead to so many wonderful things .
" There 's something about many - particle quantum mechanics that causes perfection to emerge out of imperfection , " he says .
" That 's somewhat cheering as far as our everyday lives are concerned . "

Christopher Nolan 's dream - noir Inception is that precious Hollywood rarity : A taut sci - fi thriller constructed largely within the architecture of the mind .
The movie 's intellectual interrogation of the blurred line between waking life and lucid dreaming is hammered home with elegant visuals and thunderous music , delivering an impressively heady mix of cinematic brains and brawn .
Cerebral sci-fi is always hard to find , but Wired 's staff banged its brains and salvaged the following classics from speculative cinema 's past .
Feed your head , then fire off your favorite mind - wipers in the comments section below .
Children of Men — — — — —
–
George Orwell 's future - fascist classic Nineteen Eighty - Four was really about 1948 , although it was published in 1949 .
Same goes for director Alfonso Cuaron 's destabilizing Children of Men : Although its enviropocalypse takes place in 2027 , it is really about 2007 , although it was released in 2006 and based on P.D. James ' 1992 novel .
Children of Men compressed increasing militarism , class warfare , indefinite terrorism and civic collapse into a too - near nightmare that can still keep you awake at night .
And it did it without egregious CGI or high - cost FX , leaning heavily instead on the intelligence of its actors , especially Clive Owen , and its disturbing vision of a world nearly stripped bare of compassion and innocence .
Like director John Hillcoat and novelist Cormac McCarthy 's similarly crushing The Road , Children of Men 's banal apocalypse is a wake - up call in search of seeking minds .
Brazil — — –
Terry Gilliam 's riotous dark comedy about media , terrorism , bureaucracy , insurgency and too much more to smash into one sentence was an undisputed classic upon its 1985 arrival .
Led by manic actor Jonathan Pryce , Brazil 's mash of Kafka , Orwell and Monty Python proved both entertaining and maddening .
For who among us does not know what it is like to be Tuttle-d ?
As Gilliam 's superb movie explained , the line between patriot and pariah is a fearsomely thin one .
All it takes is a dead fly to turn the innocent Archibald Buttle into suspected terrorist Archibald " Harry " Tuttle , and all hell breaks loose .
It 's enough to make one go insane , which is what Pryce 's Sam Lowry spends the film trying to ascertain .
Has he lost his mind , or has the world gone mad ?
And what 's the difference ?
Gilliam explored similar themes a decade later in his almost - awesome 12 Monkeys , an upgrade of Chris Marker 's sci- fi montage La Jetee .
Loop them up for a triple - feature that will melt your lobes .
THX 1138 — — —-
Long before George Lucas was bothering with mind - numbing merchandising tie-ins like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks , he was dissecting the primal dark urges of the '60s and '70s .
It started with his impressive 1967 student film , Electronic Labyrinth : THX 1138 4EB , and ended with its 1971 adaptation , THX 1138 .
Like Nineteen Eighty - Four before it , Lucas ' feature - length debut probed the dark spaces between perceived utopias and debilitating dystopias , leaning heavily on mandated medication to alter its victims ' mental states .
Rendered in stark blacks and whites , THX 1138 's yin -yang insanity was perhaps too understated for its audience , which seemed to prefer Woody Allen 's more laughable but similarly cerebral 1973 satire Sleeper .
The Fountain — — — —
–
Darren Aronofsky 's time - shifting love story The Fountain , starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz , took thanataphobia to the nth degree .
In three timelines , Jackman tries to save his dying wife , eventually traveling in the 25th century to a blinding nebula in a spaceship bubble bearing a dying tree of life .
The movie flopped at the box office , probably because , as Aronofsky told The Guardian in 2009 , " Why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love ?
Everything about Western culture denies that . "
But hungry minds have a tendency to change , and they probably will on The Fountain .
The Man in the White Suit — — — — — — — ——
Sort of about the clash between innovation and business , director Alexander Mackendrick 's 1951 movie The Man in the White Suit primarily deals with a geeky scientist played by Alec Guiness who creates a machine that burbles and burps and pumps out a fluorescent , unbreakable fabric that 's impossible to stain or rip .
Everyone from the garment industry to the little washwoman gets up in arms about it .

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind — — — — — — — — — — — ——
Director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman 's labyrinthine 2004 love story about identity and erasure spent most of its time inside the head of its emotionally tortured lead Jim Carrey , in hopes of obliterating memories of his co-star Kate Winslet .
And in the end , he realized that he was thinking from the heart all along .
Spoiler alert !
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 's greatest strength is that it mixed romantic drama with mind - wiping sci- fi source texts like The Prisoner , pulling a perennial winner from the petri dish .
From Gondry 's technical trickery and Carrey 's subtle theatrics to Kate Winslet 's electromagnetic personality and Tom Wilkinson 's predatory memory - erasing machinery , it proved that brilliant sci- fi can take place in inner as well as outer space .
Seconds — ——
Like Point Blank or Blow Up , John Frankeneimer 's Seconds is classic ' 60s – the cinematography is consistently far - out , the parties are frantically groovy , and The Man lurks around every corner .
Still , anyone who grokked Frankenheimer 's The Manchurian Candidate will love this bleakly comic horror story .
Our protagonist ( played by John Randolph ) is a middle - aged square who 's hounded by some shadowy corporation and a friend who " died " years ago .
They convince him to surgically alter his appearance and disappear into a new life .
When the bandages come off , he weeps with joy to see a handsome new face under all the hideous stitches and sutures : Randolph has been transformed into Rock Hudson .
Though casting this mediocre screen hunk as an uptight businessman 's alter ego was a stroke of pop genius for Frankenheimer , it was Hudson 's idea to have two actors play the lead , and his surprisingly thoughtful performance galvanizes this harrowing , cerebral thriller ( and suggests Hudson 's talents were underutilized ) .

Solaris — — —
Andrei Tarkovksy 's measured 1974 film adaptation of author Stanislaw Lem 's 1961 novel Solaris examined how humans are incapable of comprehending the alien minds they are probing because they 're unable to comprehend their own .
Fraught with emotional turmoil and shattering hallucinations , they 're unable to differentiate their interior trauma from the exterior world .
Put them near a planet that can turn their brainwaves and desires into reality , and everything goes wrong .
Sunshine — — —-
Danny Boyle 's underrated , understated Sunshine captured a crew of cosmonauts falling apart at the seams on an interstellar voyage to reignite the sun .
The interpersonal havoc wreaked by spending too many million miles in close quarters with the survival of humanity weighing on their shoulders begins to wear them down immediately .
But things get more surreal and terrifying once the sun begins to exert its own physical and symbolic power over the minds of those looking to kick - start its heart .
Bonus points go to Boyle for naming one nefarious astronaut Pinbacker , in homage to the troubled space - farer of John Carpenter 's existential sci-fi film Dark Star , another mind - frying classic .
Moon — —
In director Duncan Jones ' feature debut , helium miner Sam Bell ( played by Sam Rockwell ) works alone on a lunar base , with only his robotic assistant Gerty and dispatches from his family back on Earth to keep him company .
An accident leads to a disconcerting revelation that throws Sam into a mental tailspin .
As the rapidly unraveling miner realizes the gravity of his situation , the mental wheels keep turning , making 2009 's Moon into an instant sci- fi classic .

Pi —-
Darren Aronofsky specializes in the sci - fi mind - wipe .
His debut 1998 thriller
Pi hurled a math geek into a hell storm of mental illness , murderous multinationals and messianic theologists .
In the end , he can't stop drilling holes in his head in his effort to keep from going insane .
The low - budget stunner revealed the deep - thinking Aronofsky to be a directorial force .
The Iron Giant — — — — —-
A gun with a soul is an alien notion in our current sci- fi filmscape , which is infested with bigger and louder weaponry signifying less then ever .
But The Iron Giant , director Brad Bird 's animated skewering of military and pop-cultural paranoia , was anchored by one such seeking soul , who , before he bumped his massive head , was merely a killer robot from outer space .
The robot is easily the most humane character in Bird 's stunning film , and for good reason :
It 's hard to tell the dumb tools apart from their war - mongering masters .
Who 's shooting who ?
This essential question infuses The Iron Giant 's warm heat and fertile mind , with entertaining results .
More than any film on this list , this cerebral sci- fi classic is for the entire family , and consistently rewards repeat viewings .
The Iron Giant thinks very deeply about big issues like nuclear apocalypse , interstellar danger , government corruption and social unrest .
Its openly exuberant and sobering tale of a boy and his best friend , who just happens to be a death - bringing robot with excellent restraint , is probably the most cerebral sci-film made over the last 10 years that is n't more depressing than Auto - Tune .
And for that , we should meditate on its legacy and wonder .
The Matrix Franchise — — — — —— —-
The Wachowski brothers ' dizzying bullet - time hypermash of source texts like Jean Baudrillard 's Simulacra and Simulation , William Gibson 's Neuromancer and Katsuhiro Otomo 's Akira took viewers , and their brains , down a technocultural rabbit hole .
From its central conceit – humans are just consensually hallucinating batteries empowering murderous artificial intelligences that have taken over Earth – to its peripherally intellectual figures like The Architect , The Oracle and onward , The Matrix franchise 's spiraling cerebral strands were practically impossible to pull together into a coherent whole .
It 's safe to say that The Matrix was so cerebral that it thought itself into a corner .
After blowing out brains and eyes with deep concepts and breathless action in the first two films – The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded – it threw in the towel on The Matrix Revolutions , leaning too heavily on a wargasmic resolution that failed to deliver on its ambitious gray matter .
Too bad .
But even with its obvious missteps ,
The Matrix came close – albeit in three films , rather than one – to challenging 2001 : A Space Odyssey 's cultural dominance as the smartest sci- fi film ever made .
It started exceedingly strong , but anyone who follows bloodsport of any medium will tell you it 's not how you start but how you finish that counts .
2001 : A Space Odyssey — — — — — ——
–
The godfather of brainy sci-fi cinema , Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke 's landmark 1968 narrative literally succeeded on two levels – as a book and a film .
In fact , both agreed the writing credits should read , " Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke , based on a novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick . "
Now , that 's star power .
As a sprawling exploration of human , artificial and alien intelligence , 2001 : A Space Odyssey remains the alpha and omega of cerebral sci-fi films until Christopher Nolan or some other budding heavyweight comes to take its title .
Many have tried , and many have failed .
With good reason (s ) .
From its iconic Monolith and smartening primates to its satellite space waltzes and mercenary supercomputer Hal 9000 , which had its mind wiped by astronaut Dave Bowman , 2001 : A Space Odyssey transformed cinema 's puny universe .
Wasting more words on the issue would only sully Bowman 's wordless journey beyond the infinite .
Craig Ferguson took to his opening monologue as a Koala puppet to hit back at the story started in the Daily Telegraph that Rove McManus would be his replacement for 6 weeks .
“ I read on the intergoogle that Craig Ferguson , the Scottish Conan thing , is gonna be replaced by an Australian apparently .
And whoop - de - do here I am , ” he said .

Academic poll ranks George Bush as one of the worst presidents in US history .
But was he really as bad as all that ?
It 's time for another one of those pseudo - serious polls rating the US presidents .
This one , from Siena College 's research institute , asked 238 presidential scholars to rank the 43 presidents [ pdf ] , and judged that George Bush was among the worst of all time .
According to the survey :
Today , just one year after leaving office , the former president has found himself in the bottom five at 39th rated especially poorly in handling the economy , communication , ability to compromise , foreign policy accomplishments and intelligence .
Rounding out the bottom five are four presidents that have held that dubious distinction each time the survey has been conducted : Andrew Johnson , James Buchanan , Warren G Harding , and Franklin Pierce .
To no one 's surprise , FDR was ranked as the number one best president , followed by Teddy Roosevelt at number two ( he 's on the rise , it seems ) and Abraham Lincoln and George Washington at three and four .
Let 's admit straight away that these sorts of polls , while fun , are silly and pointless , and that no real comparison can be made by politicians of different eras .
With that out of the way , let me say that George Bush does not deserve this calumny – although he does deserve some criticism , as most US presidents do .
But this just is n't fair or reasonable .
For example , Richard Nixon is ranked 30th , while Bush junior is 39th .
Now it seems plain to me at least that by resigning in disgrace , ahead of certain impeachment , as well as his foreign policy in Laos and Cambodia , Nixon should sit below GWB in any ranking .
Both men had fairly disastrous economic policies , but Nixon 's did far more damage to America , although I 'd be open to arguments on that .
The absurdity of these sorts of polls is highlighted by the position of William Henry Harrison , who I have sometimes argued should be counted as the worst US president of all time .
If you have n't heard of Harrison , that 's because he took office on 4 March 1841 and left it on 4 April 1841 .
He died of pneumonia and pleurisy , and may have been weakened by insisting on reading the longest presidential inauguration address in history , standing for several hours outdoors in the freezing Washington winter but refusing to wear a coat or hat to reinforce his macho image as a warrior .
So there 's real stupidity for you : all he had to do was wear a coat and he could n't even manage that .
Worse , Harrison 's death caused his vice president , John Tyler , to move into the White House , and Tyler was a fool of world - class proportions , one of the string of idiots who held the presidency in the awful years leading up to the Civil War .
( Tyler later joined the Confederate government after the war began , so that tells you where he was coming from . )
Notably , the others of that era – Filmore , Pierce , Buchanan and Andrew Johnson – are rightly down at the bottom of the pile in these ratings .
While we 're on the subject , it 's an amazement that Lincoln is n't the automatic number one choice in lists such as this , since he faced challenges like no other president , including FDR .
Teddy Roosevelt in second place ?
Good grief .
And what exactly did Bill Clinton do to justify being as high as 13th ?
And Grant as low as 26th ?
Bah .
The thing about these lists , once they get you hooked ... anyway , here 's the full list ( and you can see the full rankings here [ pdf ] :

[ Geek note :
There have been 44 presidencies , but only 43 presidents are ranked here .
Why ?
Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th presidents , since his two non-consecutive terms were interrupted by losing the 1892 election to Benjamin Harrison , the 23rd president .
No , it does n't really make sense but that 's how they do it . ]
The ' porn star killers ' :
Actors who met on adult film set charged with killing tattoo shop owner with a sledgehammer
Jason Andrews was a bisexual Chicago DJ with a British accent , whose chiseled jaw and good looks landed him roles in countless gay porn videos .
Amanda Logue was a married , bleach - blond Georgia woman who once owned a lingerie shop , dabbled in prostitution and starred in several X - rated videos herself .
Florida detectives claim that together they stabbed and bludgeoned to death a 41 - year - old tattoo shop owner with a sledgehammer .
They are also claimed to have hatched some of their plans in expletive - laden text messages .
Using his BlackBerry , Andrews allegedly typed : ' I 'm so glad you 're really committed to this take .
Keep eyes for a knife , etc for me !'
Jason Andrews and Amanda Logue have been charged with first - degree murder
Transcripts of the messages were included in court records .
Logue replied in a nearly incomprehensible text that she was excited - and she wanted to have sex after they killed him .
Nearly two months after Dennis ' Scooter ' Abrahamsen was found dead in his Tampa - area home , Logue and Andrews have been charged with first - degree murder .
Logue is being held without bail at a Florida jail and Andrews was arrested on Thursday in Tennessee .
Andrews was arrested by U.S. Marshals and the Chattanooga Police Department after working for several weeks as a manager at the Chattanooga Billiard Club , an upscale pool hall and cigar lounge .
' I would say he was very surprised .
He was very clean cut , broad shoulders , dressed in a suit , not in a suit and tie , but more Miami Vice , more of a GQ appearance , ' said Paul Salayko , a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service .
Twitter picture : Amanda Logue took this photo of herself and Jason Andrews the day before the murder of Dennis Abrahamsen , later posting it on Twitter
He is jailed in Tennessee until he can be extradited to Florida .
Authorities did not yet know if he had a lawyer .
Police in Florida say the pair killed Abrahamsen in the early morning of May 15 and swiped $ 6,000 cash , his credit cards and a video camera .
Abrahamsen had hired Logue - whose porn name is Sunny Dae - to work at a sex party at his house , and police said that 's when Logue and Andrews set him up .
They traded dozens of text messages about their homicidal plan , police said .
According to an affidavit , Logue would later deny that she had anything to do with the killing and claim Andrews was the one who bludgeoned Abrahamsen .
' Logue told [ a detective ] that Andrews grabbed the back of her hair then twisted her arm behind her back .
Andrews forced her to view Abrahamsen 's crushed skull and told her that 's what would happen to her if she told anyone . '
Logue and Andrews met on the set of a porn video late last year and fell in love - even though Logue was married to a man in Georgia , authorities and friends said .
Andrews ' Chicago friends find it difficult to believe he was involved in the killing .
The 27 - year - old Andrews was known in that city as DJ Veritas , and his Facebook and MySpace pages feature several video clips of him playing techno music in large clubs .
' He was a really straight up dude , ' said Michael Sarkowicz , a Chicago club photographer .
Alter ego : Married mother of one Logue as model and porn star Sunny Dae .
She met Andrews on the set of a porn film
The 28 - year - old Logue seemed like a decent person , said Kristen Cameron , a Florida - based model who met her last year .
According to several profiles on modeling websites , Logue did bikini and fetish modeling .
' She was professional , prompt and seemed all around normal , well so I thought , ' Cameron wrote in an e-mail to Associated Press .
' She was nice to me and was a great model !
I felt a connection to her since we both have southern backgrounds . '
But Cameron 's opinion changed this spring when she saw how Logue acted around Andrews , her new boyfriend .
' Amanda was n't the Amanda I knew , ' Cameron wrote .
' She would n't talk , all she did was text with Jason . '
Andrews , Cameron said , was obnoxious and brash .
He often bragged about his military service , of which Cameron was skeptical .
In April and May , according to their Twitter accounts , Logue and Andrews spent several weeks in Florida , shooting porn videos , lolling on the beach and professing their love for each other .
Photos on Logue 's Facebook show the pair grinning and hugging .
Victim : Dennis Abrahamsen , 41 , hired Logue to perform at a party in his Tampa home .
It is alleged that Andrews and Logue murdered him after the guests had gone home
On May 14 , Andrews posted a link to a pornographic photo of Logue and wrote on his Twitter account : ' therealsunnydae and I are killing time waiting for a party to find us !'
The next day , detectives said , Abrahamsen hired Logue to have sex on camera during a party at his house .
During the party , Logue texted her boyfriend several times , witnesses told investigators .
Text messages retrieved from Andrews '
BlackBerry show the couple discussed vinyl gloves , when other guests would leave Abrahamsen 's home and what was inside a safe .
According to an affidavit , everyone at the party left Abrahamsen 's home around 5 am May 15 - except for Logue .
Andrews waited outside in his car , still texting her .
' Just get him on his face either bash or tell me to get in and .
Where to go , ' Andrews wrote .
'K I 'm horny !
I 'm getting him to play music , ' Logue typed .
' Wicked .
Ill just be waiting .
Really .
Take .
Your .
Time , ' Andrews replied .
Abrahamsen was found dead in his house by a family member some 18 hours later , face down on a massage table with blood splattered on the walls and ceiling fan .
Authorities have not officially disclosed a motive for the killling .
At 4.29 pm on May 16 - less than a day after the murder - Logue wrote on her Twitter account : ' Taking it easy with hearveritas !
Laying around eating popcorn and watching movies !'
Hearveritas is Andres ' Twitter name .
At 5.20 pm , Andrews tweeted : ' therealsunnydae and I wanna go watch a movie tonight , any suggestion ? '
As detectives pieced together the slaying , Logue and Andrews were arrested May 18 in a neighboring county after trying to use Abrahamsen 's credit card at Home Depot .
But officials did n't have enough evidence to link the pair to the killing , and released them .
On May 19 , Logue went home to her husband and child in Georgia .
On May 21 , Andrews wrote on his Twitter account in Hebrew : ' Amanda please let me know when you are ok , really .
My heart can't take the weight of the fear that I would never see you again . '
It is unclear whether Logue ever saw Andrews ' plea , or whether she replied to him .
On May 26 , she was arrested in Georgia and taken to a Florida jail , where she awaits trial .
Editor 's note :
This story and video contain mature subject matter .
ESPN does not generally identify victims of sexual abuse .
These women agreed to tell their stories .
KWA THEMA , South Africa --
In the small , neat home she shares with a husband she describes as a broken man , Mally Simelane talks about her daughter , Eudy , who two years ago was gang - raped and stabbed to death .
Eudy Simelane 's mother , Mally , at her grave .
Joel and Jesse Edwards for E:60
" These children are ours , " she says , her hands folded across her kitchen table .
" The gays and lesbians .
I mean , we must accept our children .
What they like , it 's up to them .
We are not God to stop them . "
But there are those who are trying to stop them .
And to punish them .
To scare them .
To change them .
To " correct " them .
At the time of her murder , Eudy Simelane was almost a decade removed from her career on the South African women 's national soccer team .
But at 31 , she had become a well - respected youth coach , a passionate ambassador for the game she loved .
Everyone knew she was gay .
At Eudy 's grave -- not far from the creek where her tormentors dumped her mutilated corpse -- Mally says , " I look at her picture .
Then pray .
Cry .
Talk to her .
Telling her , ' I miss you . ' "
The rationale ?
For an act of such violence and malice , it 's called something so clinical : " corrective rape . "
" The phenomenon of corrective rape is based on the mistaken belief that through the violent act of rape , you can alter someone 's orientation , you can alter their identity , " says Jody Kollapen , the former chairman of the South African Human Rights Commission , a governmental organization .
" The rationale would be that a woman who chooses to be lesbian has surely not had a relationship with a man , and therefore , if she has a relationship with a man , even if it 's a violent , forced one , that will surely convince her that the lifestyle she chose is inappropriate . "
Eudy Simelane 's grave in the township of Kwa Thema .
Joel and Jesse Edwards for E:60
Sometimes , as in the case of Eudy Simelane , the perpetrators of corrective rape are interested less in changing their victims than in eradicating them and sending a message to other South African lesbians , who , recent studies show , live in a heightened state of fear -- with good reason .
In the country with the most reported rapes per capita in the world , where it is estimated that nearly half of all women will be raped , so - called corrective rape represents only a fraction of the sexual assaults committed .
The exact numbers are impossible to determine -- in part because South Africa has no hate - crime laws that would require authorities to classify corrective rapes separately from other rapes -- but , according to the Human Rights Commission , it is a growing phenomenon .
The anecdotal evidence is overwhelming ; for instance , the Triangle Project , a gay and lesbian advocacy organization , says it is dealing with 10 new cases of corrective rape every week in Cape Town alone .
A disproportionate number of female athletes have been victims , if only because more are openly gay as Simelane was .
On paper , South Africa is among the world 's most progressive countries ; its constitution emphasizes the rights of the individual , and gay marriage is legal .
But South Africa 's constitutional aspirations run up hard against certain realities .
Before his election , President Jacob Zuma was tried for raping ( not corrective rape ) an 18 - year - old family acquaintance .
He was acquitted , but his attitudes about gay marriage -- which he has condemned -- and gays and lesbians in general reflect the prejudices of many of his constituents .
" When I was growing up , [ a homosexual ] would not have stood in front of me , " Zuma said .
" I would knock him out . "
The rape and murder of Simelane brought the issue of corrective rape to the nation 's attention , however briefly , but the situation for lesbians has not improved .
On the contrary , it seems to be deteriorating .
Talk to men in the impoverished townships , and you see why .
Homophobia is rampant .
Violence against lesbians is encouraged .
And victims say even the police treat them as nuisances and mock them .
Corrective rape is primarily an issue in South Africa 's predominantly black townships .
Although there are no statistics to show that the majority of victims are black lesbians , the Triangle Project says that 86 percent of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of sexual assault , as opposed to 44 percent of white lesbians .
Mvuleni Fana
Eleven years ago , when she was 16 , Mvuleni Fana was walking down a small side street in Daveyton , a township outside Johannesburg , a few hundred yards from the soccer stadium where she played for her local girls team .
Mvuleni Fana no longer plays soccer .
She was raped in a stadium after soccer practice when she was 16 .
Joel and Jesse Edwards for E:60
Then , Fana remembers , four young men -- she knew them from the soccer fields -- attacked her , knocking her down , dragging her to the stadium .
" I remember some of the things , " Fana says now .
" I do n't remember clearly , but I remember when they took my clothes off . "
Fana was raped , beaten , and left battered and unconscious at the stadium .
She woke up in a hospital .
Her assailants , she says , had taunted her about her sexual orientation .
" You could hear in their voices that I disgust them , " she says .
" They wanted to teach me a lesson .
They wanted to show me who 's the man .
They wanted me to stop being a lesbian . "
When Fana went with her aunt to the police to report the attack , she says she was again taunted : " They say , ' She deserve everything .
How can she pretend to be a guy .
Why , she 's a girl .
There 's no such thing as gay .
A woman is a woman , and a man is a man . ' "
Fana says that after the attack , she could never bring herself to play soccer again .
Prejudice still exists
South Africa 's mostly peaceful transition from minority white control to democracy in the early 1990s was a triumph of domestic diplomacy .
Averting civil war was a modern miracle .
But South Africa remains a dangerous place , and the legacy of apartheid is a legacy of violence .
Corrective rape , which is primarily a black - on - black crime in South Africa , cannot be blamed entirely on apartheid ; it is part of the equation , however .
Whooping Cough Now Epidemic in California Officials say inadequate vaccination coverage is at least partly to blame .
June 24 , 2010  -- California is facing what could be the state 's biggest outbreak of pertussis since 1958 , according to its top public health official .
This contagious disease is more commonly known as whooping cough due the distinctive whoop that occurs when sufferers cough and gasp for breath .
" Whooping cough is now an epidemic in California , " said Dr. Mark Horton , director of the California Department of Public Health , in a statement .
" Children should be vaccinated against the disease and parents , family members and caregivers of infants need a booster shot . "
As of June 15 , a total of 910 cases had been confirmed in the state .
Another 600 suspected cases are currently being investigated by local health officials , the statement indicated .
The number of pertussis cases is now on a pace to surpass the total of 3,182 seen in the most recent major outbreak , which occurred in 2005 , said Ken August , spokesman for the department .
August told MedPage Today that 1,200 cases were recorded in 2005 as of mid-June , meaning the state would probably exceed that this year .
The highest yearly total on record is 3,837 cases , seen in 1958 .
So far this year , five children have died , all infants younger than three months .
Dr. Blaise Congeni of Akron Children 's Hospital in Ohio said he was n't surprised , as higher - than - usual numbers of pertussis cases have been reported across the country .
" We are having an outbreak in Ohio , " though not as severe as in California , he said .
Oregon public health officials have also reported an unusually high number of pertussis cases in that state .
Both Congeni and August noted that pertussis tends to wax and wane in cycles .
But gaps in vaccination coverage may also be playing a role , particularly in California .
Whooping Cough in California Worries Officials
" California is the epicenter of vaccine refusal " in the United States , said Congeni .
Although outright refusal as well as so - called designer schedules for vaccinations that deviate from evidence - based recommendations are occurring throughout the country , including Ohio , " it 's not as much as what my colleagues in California tell me , " Congeni said .
August explained that California requires that children receive the full slate of vaccinations for pertussis , measles , and other infectious diseases before they can attend school .
But the requirement is waived if parents file a " personal belief exemption " ( PBE ) , which need not be based on religion or medical necessity .
He said that the overall rate for PBEs among the state 's roughly 7,200 schools is about 2 percent .
But rates are much higher in some schools .
Records for 2009 indicated that close to 175 schools had PBE rates of 20 percent or more .
A few had rates above 70 percent .
Researchers have found that vaccination rates of at least 93 percent are needed to ensure so - called herd immunity against pertussis , which prevents the disease from spreading quickly to unvaccinated individuals .
However , August said that some parents may use the PBE to withhold just one vaccine from their children .
Others may change their minds after filing a PBE and have their children fully vaccinated .
He also noted that , in severe outbreaks of vaccine - preventable diseases , local school officials can declare a health emergency and require that all schoolchildren be vaccinated .
Parents who insist on withholding vaccination must then keep their children out of school .
August said he was unaware of any such declarations in the face of the current pertussis outbreak .
The California public health department first warned of a pertussis spike in April , when the case count was running double the rate seen at the same time in 2009 .
The current outbreak in California still pales against a major epidemic that swept England and Wales in the late 1970s and early 1980s , after pertussis vaccination coverage dropped to 30 percent in the wake of controversy over alleged vaccine reactions .
Whooping Cough Epidemics Follow Lax Vaccination Rates
From January to September 1982 , for example , nearly 50,000 children and adults contracted the disease .
As many cases were reported in a single week as are expected in California for the entire year in 2010 .
Boris Johnson , that accidental subversive , has been bemoaning the lack of " counterculture " in London , but it 's hard to guess exactly what he would like to see going on that is n't already out there .
My initial reaction to the mayor 's complaint , voiced on a radio programme about the modern city , was to assume he was having a semi-political dig at New Labour 's funding of more marginal artists and art forms .
Perhaps Boris was obliquely suggesting that there is now so much avant - garde work going on , and so very many outreach schemes supported by our national cultural institutions , that the creative fringe no longer has anything left to kick against .
Or perhaps he just feels there could be bigger outbursts of dissent , both political and creative .
I do n't know .
But then , against my will , I began to wonder if the mayor was on to something .
London now is so culturally confident that everything creative is efficiently branded and sold to the public , no matter how offensive it aims to be .
So possibly the city has developed a deaf ear to , say , provincial talent and trends .
Do people who live in the regions think there is a counterculture in London ?
Or just one vast , liberal , metropolitan project ?
Barry Miles 's book London Calling made the point earlier this year that , even in the capital , countercultural explosions are always highly localised .
In the 60s , the outburst of samizdat activity only really took hold in corners of Soho and Chelsea .
Listing some of the stars of the " scene " back then , Miles comments : " Naturally there was a strong old Etonian contingent . "
So probably alumni of Johnson 's old school have always liked to get down and dirty with a few radicals in their spare time .
Moving from one politician seamlessly on to another I should point out , further to my last blogpost , that the Daily Mail is now suggesting Blair 's publishers tried to stop a broadcast of extracts from Mandelson 's new book on Radio 4 .
( Though Blair 's office assures me that any current suggestion that the former prime minister himself tried to delay the publication of Mandy 's rival book is " unfounded " . )
In my list of forthcoming political memoirs I forgot one , by the way .
Giles Radice , an old timer who knew Blair , Mandy and Gordon Brown long before they came to power , is bringing out a book too , which the publishers promise will be reliable because it has no axe to grind .
Gawker Media LLC said the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked it to retain documents as part of a probe into the exposure of email addresses belonging to iPad owners , the second time the blog publisher has been in a legal spotlight over a big news story it wrote involving Apple Inc .

First , a little bit of history First , a little bit of history
It Seems that was yesterday when a year ago in the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit , Victor sent a file to me through Bluetooth and kdebluetooth saved it in a hidden folder , the file is still there " ~/.kbluetooth4/Vídeo003.3gp " .
That fact is what made me decide to use my spare time working on kdebluetooth .
After months of work in kbluetooth ( the kdebluetooth fork I did ) , it started to work , but that spent hours made me realize that the kbluetooth never would be stable , it is a clear example of spaghetti code .
Because of that , we started a new project called BlueDevil .
If you 're wondering about the name , Edulix came with it while working on the daemon , and it is based on PowerDevil ( the name ) .
After a few fridays working on it , suddenly a Spanish company sent an email to me , asking for help to develop a Qt library to deal with BlueZ .
A couple of emails ( and beers ) later , they hired us ( ufocoders ) to write the library , the first big step towards a real BlueDevil was done .
It 's known that the best way to fully test a library is by using it a lot , so we started a negotiation to finance the development of BlueDevil , finally we got an agreement , we 'll pay it 50 % / 50 % .
So , this is the boring history , that in my most humble opinion had to be written , now let 's start with the review .
KDE Config Module ( system preferences )
The Bluetooth KCM allows you to configure all the options from a single place , it is divided in 3 pages :
Devices , allows you to switch on / off global KDE Platform Bluetooth integration , and manage your remote devices ( add , rename , remove ... )
File Transfer , allows you to switch on / off the reception of files , and configure where ( by default ) they will be saved once received .
Adapters , allows you to configure your adapters , changing the name , the visibility ...

BlueDevil Wizard :
The wizard allows you to pair with other bluetooth devices , and if they have compatible services connect to them .
the highlights are :
Pair with any device
Connect to input service ( mouse , keyboard , Wiimote )
Connect to audio service ( headset , phones )
Powerfull " auto " PIN Mode , which has a database containing exceptions .
In the following video , you can see the pair + input connection done with a cellphone , which is used at the final to disconnect itself :p

Systray :
The systray is executed only if Bluetooth adapters are found , it allows you to do everything you want to :
Send files
Browse devices
Configure remote devices
Configure adapters
Configure file transfer
Add new remove devices
Connect to known devices services .

KDE Input / Output integration ( KIO ) :
The KIO integration allows you to discover and browse your devices from your favorite file browser , the highlights are :
Discover device
Show and configure ( after clicking on them ) the supported services .
If supported by the device , browse the files ( copy , remove , create dir ... )

The death of a young humpback whale near the Farallon Islands prompted officials of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary on Monday to warn boaters to be alert to whales drawn to the coastal area by an abundance of krill .
Scientists working on the Farallon Islands spotted the newly dead whale Sunday a mile off the Farallones and say it was apparently killed by a boat that had crashed into it .

What the hell was Judas even doing behind that rock ?
Was he waiting three days just in case ?
I guess you have to play it safe when you ’re dealing with divinity .
Jesus is a tough figure to talk about nowadays , especially in America .
There ’s still a lot of devotion to him across the globe and sometimes that devotion seems to trump even the love expressed for his Father ( with a capital F ) .
Consider that for a minute .
Like the Buddha , Jesus ( as a man ) has always held my interest .
Unlike other major religious figures , it ’s hard to find a lot to dislike about what he preached .
Some of what we read has almost certainly been doctored by writers with an agenda but the good bits are still terribly fascinating .
As with myth , it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction when it comes to religion and that can breed confusion .
Jesus , to me at least , seems like the sort of person that could have lived and his sermons seem reasonable for their time .
Whatever the truth may be , there is power in stories and not many stories have had quite the same power that the life of Jesus has had .
The proof is in the numbers .
Roughly 33 % of people in the world adhere to Christianity .
From a writer ’s perspective , the story of Judas and Jesus is one of the most interesting bits about the last days of Jesus .
In the tale Jesus asks God directly why it is he that must die for the sins of humanity , implying that he knows exactly what is going to occur .
There has been some controversy about Judas ’ role in all this .
If Jesus knew , did he ask Judas to turn him over or did Judas stab him in the back ?
Did Judas really hate the savior of all mankind or was he commanded to do what he did ?
If he was commanded , why did n’t Jesus just turn himself in ?
There are so many questions !
It ’s like a half written detective novel .
We ’re left just at the cusp before the villain reveals himself and his master plan .
That ’s just sloppy workmanship .
Maybe there will be a sequel .
Regardless of your personal beliefs ( I do n’t adhere to the Bible ’s assertions , FYI ) the Bible is an interesting read .
Wordy , difficult to process , and loaded with ideas that may seem foreign , but still an interesting read .
It may be tough to find a copy , but you should try to find one somewhere .
Check a hotel or something .
It looks harmless dog .
However , this cute tererchik eaten five cats .
His owner brought him to the vet after he started to refuse food .
X - ray revealed that the animal had already dined entire five rubber kitty .
Narni is a small hill town of around 20,000 people located in the Italian province of Terni on the southern boundary of the Umbria region , very near the exact geographical center of Italy .
A Short History of Narni or Narnia
Although there is evidence of Neolithic remains in the area , the first historical document we know of is dated 600 b.c. where Nequinum is mentioned .
In 299 we know the town as Narnia , a Roman colony .
The name comes from the nearby Nar river , which is called the Nera today .
Narni rose in importance with the construction of the Via Flaminia from Rome to Rimini .
In the 12th and 14th century Narni became part of the Papal State and developed an important school of painting and goldsmiths .
Getting to Narni by Train
Narni can be reached on the Rome to Ancona train line .
The Rome to Florence line stops in Orte where you can get a connection .
The Narni station is out of town but served by local bus .
Getting to Narni by Car
The A1 Autostrada del Sole is the fast ( and expensive ) way to get there from Rome , exiting at Orte for the Orte - Terni connecting road .
The free route is the E45 that goes from Terni -Cresena .
Regional Events in Narni
Umbria Travel offers a limited Calendar of Events for Narni .
Interesting Festival in Narni
In Narni on April 25 to the following weekend is the Corsa all ' Anello : " Traditional feast which roots date back to the Middle Age , organized during the celebration in Patron St. Giovanale 's honor .
An impressive competition in which young people of the ancient quarters participate .
Dressed in traditional costume , they try to run a spear through a ring which is supported by ropes extending through the houses of Via Maggiore .
What About C.S. Lewis' Narnia ?
Over 50 years ago C. S. Lewis invented a place called Narnia .
Factmonster presents a bit of speculation :
It has been said that Lewis discovered the name ( Narnia ) in an atlas as a child , though he may also have come across mention of the city in his university studies .
By chance , the modern - day town of Narni ( as it is now known ) honors a local saint known as " Blessed Lucy of Narnia . "
Today the town 's Cathedral of Narnia adjoins a shrine to this St. Lucy .
Staying in Narni
For its size , there are many places to stay in Narni - - and prices can be quite reasonable .
Some are just outside of town in the countryside , so pay attention to the location if you want to stay right in town .
Narni Attractions
There are a number of interesting buildings in Narni :
The Cathedral
Church of San Francesco ( 13th century )
Palazzo dei Priori ( 1275 )
Palazzo Comunale ( 1273 )
Church of Santa Maria Impensole ( 1175 )
Torri dei Marzi ( 1400 )
Palazzo Scotti ( 1500 )
Underground of San Domenico ( 13th century )
Church of Santa Maria Maggiore ( 1400 )
Palazzo Vescovile ( Bishop 's Palace )
Palazzo Arca-Corsini
Church of Santa Restituita
Palazzo Cardoli ( 15th century )
Opera Beata Lucia ( 1700 )
Palazzo Capocaccia ( 1545 )
Church of Sant'Agostino ( 14th century )
Church of Santa Margherita ( 1600 )
Albornoz Castle ( 1370 )
Fonte di Feronia
There 's also an interesting walk out of town to the 1st century Ponte Cardona , part of the Roman Aqueduct Formina .
Along this wooded walk , you 'll also pass the geographical center of Italy benchmark .
Further out of town to the west , there are the interesting ruins of Ocriculum near the modern town of Otricoli .
If you enjoy visiting ruins , especially underground places , Narni has a volunteer group called Subterranea that gives tours .
Lots of good information on the site about things to visit as well .
And finally , the nearby cities of Terni and Orte are interesting places to visit as well .
So you might have read the headline and thought to yourself “ I know what all of those words mean , but not in that order … ”
Last week was Citrix Synergy , and annual productannoucement / cheerleading session from Citrix .
( Interestingly enough , it was scheduled to overlap with EMC World , and on the opposite side of the continent , so people had to pick which to attend .
That ’s an interesting bit of psychological warfare , and I wonder how it affected them …anyway , end digression ) .
At Synergy , Citrix announced XenClient , the next logical step in the progression of desktop virtualization , namely a bare metal hypervisor .
So what is a bare metal hypervisor ?
Think about server - based bare metal hypervisors … ESXi , or HyperV , or maybe even KVM .
Essentially , a bare metal hypervisor is a kernel ( and generally speaking , the attached very small OS ) that is responsible for hardware and resource management of a computer , which it metes out to guest virtual machines that run on top of it .
If you ’re still struggling to tread water at this point , IBM created a longish Introduction to Virtualization that will help , while TechCollective wrote a much shorter , simpler virtualization overview that will help in a time crunch .
Previously , bare metal hypervisors had been restricted to the server space , and servers have been gearing their hardware toward it .
Both Intel and AMD have been racing to add more cores per socket , and both have included on - chip virtualization features designed to make passing instructions and memory contents to VMs more efficient .
With the recent Nehalem chips , Intel has been able to release very , very high performance chips , even on laptops .
The i7 / i5 chips are full of virtualization potential , but sadly , until now , they ’ve had * to make due with userland virtualization solutions like VirtualBox , or if you ’re in the “ I like to pay for software ” camp , VMware Fusion , or Parallels .
(* — Alright , so some people have gotten ESX ( i ) to run on laptops .
That does n’t mean it ’s a good idea )
Well , now there are better ( or at least , different ) options .
Because of the in - processor virtualization features that it relies on , the hardware compatibility list is n’t what I would call extensive , but more laptops will be built that take advantage of these new processors , so this list will grow as time goes on .
As luck would have it , the Lenovo T500 is on the list .
That laptop is the one that I decided was going to be the “ fleet ” laptop for the company last year .
Currently , I only have 3 , and they ’re all in the field , but I sweet - talked one of the salesmen into letting me “ borrow ” his laptop for the night .
As soon as we had the laptop , my junior admin took an image of the existing OS install using Clonezilla , so we could restore the machine to good working order quickly .
Once that was done , we popped in the XenClient CD and rebooted .
We immediately got this error :
Well , duh .
I guess I did n’t think about it , but of course we should have checked the BIOS and set those .
VTx is the in - processor Virtualization Technology , and can be toggled via a setting in the “ processor ” screen in the BIOS .
VT-d is a technology used for I/ O passthrough , which helps ensure VM performance , and is set in the same place as VTx .
Having fixed that , we rebooted and were on our merry way .
The first choice we were given was to choose between a quick install or an advanced install .
Of course we chose “ Advanced Install ” .
Looking at the User Guide , there ’s not too much of a difference .
We did get this screen :
Which deserves some explaining .
As you ( probably ( hopefully ? ) ) know , system administration is moving away from ad - hoc administration of one computer at a time to managing infrastructures at a time .
Citrix realizes this , and has included methods for managing your fleet of XenClient - running laptops .
The primary method is XenClient Synchronizer .
Let me just quote from their webpage :
Citrix® Synchronizer for XenClient™ enables laptops with XenClient to download centrally managed virtual desktops .
Using Synchronizer , IT can centrally backup user data through the secure connection whenever the user connects to the internet , define security policies for managed laptops , disable lost or stolen XenClient laptops and restore a user ’s virtual desktop on any XenClient based laptop .
That sounds okeydokie to me .
And apparently , it ’s free , although I ’d be really surprised if they did n’t offer commercial support for it .
In fact , I ’m interested to see where the licensing for this whole line goes , but I ’m digressing again .
Back to the install … I did n’t have the time to spin up a Synchronizer install , so I skipped this .
When I get a spare laptop and a little time , it is something that I ’m going to be testing , though .
The next step was formatting the drive on the laptop .
It did warn me in big giant letters that it was destructive , and that I ’d lose the data contained thereon , so that was nice , but pretty boring overall so I did n’t take a picture .
Following the completed install , the machine rebooted .
The boot process is nice .
There ’s the omnipresent throbber to let you know that the machine has n’t hung , and when you finally get into the XenClient interface , it ’s good .
It ’s not beautiful , but it ’s smooth .
It reminded me of something that Apple might use , if they were into brushed stainless steel instead of white plastic .
Because it ’s an OS designed for a laptop , it has all of the laptoppy things and user niceties that people like .
You can change backgrounds , you can dictate power options , etc .
Below is an embedded movie of me going through the settings in the control panel .
( there ’s no useful sound , so do n’t worry about unmuting it )
As you can see , it looks a lot like a “ regular ” operating system .
It just does n’t do anything …. except run virtual machines .
Speaking of , lets talk about that …
You ’ll notice on that screen that the only guests available are Windows XP , Windows Vista , and Windows 7 .
Funny , but I wanted to install Linux .
I figured that if the virtual machine could run XP , it could probably run Linux , too , so I popped this in :
and booted it up .
Sure enough , before too long …
You ’ll notice that it looks exactly like a native install .
There is no Window containing the VM .
It ’s completely immersive , and it should be .
This is going to be someone ’s operating system , and they do n’t want to have to constantly deal with the fact that it ’s a VM .
Citrix ( and your user ) wants that to be a non-issue .
So it is .
And it ’s very convincing .
Fortunately , they do tell you to hit ctrl - 0 before the VM starts , so you can return to the XenClient interface :
We also ended up installing Windows XP , but I did n’t take pics of that install process , mostly because there ’s no difference between it and any other OS install , except for the time .
Good lord , did it take a long time to install operating systems on this .
I do n’t know what was wrong with the I/O , but it was _not_ good .
I ’m fairly sure that we enabled VT-d , but man .
It took nearly an hour just to get through the “ … 35 minutes remaining ” part of the Windows install .
It wo n’t be an issue if you ’ve got Xen Synchonizer , since it ’s not using vitualized I/O at that point ( and the initial XenClient install did n’t take over - long ) , but I was not impressed with the disk performance .
I did n’t run any tests , but that ’s going to be the first thing I do when I get my own laptop to play with .
The only other oddity that we saw was that the T500 ’s HDMI output did n’t get virtualized .
It ’s very possibly a lacking on my part to get the Xen tools installed , or something similar , but this was my result ( on Mint , anyway ) :
I ’m certain that it will get fixed ( or that I ’ll learn how to do it ) , but just fair warning .
With each new guest that you install , the shortcut key increments by one .
So you hit ctrl - 0 to go to the “ Xen Receiver ” desktop , then ctrl - 1 to go to your first VM , Ctrl - 2 to go to the 2nd , etc etc .
Here ’s a video of me flipping between desktops .
It really feels like using a KVM ( that ’s keyboard / video / mouse , not kernel - based virtual machine ) .
( by the way , if you are n’t getting these videos , feel free to check out the blog entry at the Standalone Sysadmin blog )
So that ’s XenClient , or at least , as it stands now .
The one thing that I have n’t talked about is ‘ why ’ .
Why would you want to do this ?
There are at least a couple driving reasons .
First , security .
If you run a locked - down OS for work , your computer is nearly unusable for anything else .
When you ’re on the road , that means your only computer is the one that you ’re prevented from using .
With this technology , you can have a second machine that has no ability to interfere with the security of the first one , and it ’s usable .
There are some fairly hefty arguments against this particular use case , chief among them is “ that computer belongs to work , and installing and maintaining an additional OS image for the sole purpose of non-work activity is a waste of resources ” .
Honestly , it ’s hard to defeat that logic …
Another reason would be if you need to run legacy applications on legacy OSes .
I installed Linux . XP runs fine .
If your company is moving to Windows 7 , but needs an app that ( for whatever reason ) requires XP to run , that ’s an option .
From a sysadmin perspective , I love the idea .
I run Windows XP in VirtualBox right now .
If I could use a hypervisor to give it better performance , I would , in a heartbeat .
I would lose the integrated nature of the desktop , because I ’d have to flip back and forth , but I expect that will change in the next couple of years , too .
I imagine that eventually XenClient ’s desktop will become something like a compositing window manager which can display windows from all running guests .
Eventually .
Anyway , that was my review of XenClient .
It seems like it ’s going to be interesting , and I ’ll be watching to see how people respond .
HP has already produced the first laptop designed to support XenClient , which I suspect means they had a laptop nearly ready for production which just happened to fit the requirements , but whatever .

Okay , maybe it was n't that much of a mystery .
In fact , it took a little more than three hours for Danger Room reader jemelehill to figure out the odd string of letters and numbers in the logo of the U.S. military 's new Cyber Command .
Turns out , it 's the new unit 's mission statement , translated into 32 digits with the md5 cryptographic hash :
USCYBERCOM plans , coordinates , integrates , synchronizes and conducts activities to : direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and ; prepare to , and when directed , conduct full spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains , ensure US / Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries .
Eventually , other commenters figured it out ( especially after jemelehill 's solution made it to all the databases of cracked hashes ) .
But that did n't stop folks from offering their own , shall we say , creative guesses , in order to win one of two coveted prizes : a Danger Room T - shirt or a ticket to the International Spy Museum .

Netroots Nation concluded this weekend in Las Vegas – with appearances by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , dozens of panels and workshops and a rousing Keynote by Senator Al Franken that renewed hope for liberal bloggers .
If there ’s one major frustration leading into November , it ’s the U.S. Senate – where Republicans have obstructed practically everything that passed the House .
Reid came to the Conference on July 24th – right after announcing we “ do n’t have the votes ” for comprehensive climate change reform this year , only adding insult to injury .
One panel on filibuster reform suggested we ’re in a constitutional crisis , but Reid himself would n’t commit to any specific solution .
But rather than give up , Al Franken reminded the netroots that Senators elected in 2006 and 2008 with their help are a “ coalition of the impatient ” – and represent a new generation of more progressive Democrats .
Bloggers are needed this November to add to their ranks , in order to change the Senate .
“ The Senate sucks and I mean that literally , ” said Congressman Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) at a panel on Saturday .
“ It sucks the energy out of everything progressives do . ”
For years , House Democrats have joked that House Republicans are the “ opposition ” but the Senate is the “ enemy ” – and it ’s easy to understand why .
Since January 2009 , House Democrats ( with practically no support from Republicans ) have racked up an impressive list of accomplishments – only to see few of these become law because of the Senate .
Even the successes we ’ve had ( e.g. , the federal stimulus , health care reform and Wall Street reform ) were watered down in the Senate by right - wing extortionists like Ben Nelson , Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman – leaving a bitter taste in everyone ’s mouth .
This made pronouncements by Reid , Pelosi and President Obama ( who sent a video message to the conference ) about all that we ’ve accomplished feel a little insulting .
Voters are still angry like they were in 2006 and 2008 , but now there ’s a legitimate danger that they ’ll blame Democrats who are “ in power ” – which is infuriating .
Senate Can’t Walk Away
To her credit , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged how much the Senate has been a problem – and it was apparent in her tone how upset she was .
“ We do n’t know what can pass the Senate … ever , ” she complained .
“ Think of all we can do without obstruction of Republicans in the Senate . ”
Referring to Harry Reid ’s pronouncement that there are n’t enough votes before the November election to pass climate change reform , Pelosi said : “ this is not something the Senate can walk away from .
Time is running out . ”
When Reid addressed the conference a few hours after Pelosi , a group of undocumented college students held a silent protest in front of the stage – dressed in caps and gowns , and calling on the Senate to pass the DREAM Act .
Reid acknowledged the DREAM
Act is a compromise of what ’s really needed – comprehensive immigration reform – but said “ I ’m not going to do the DREAM Act if I do n’t have 60 votes . ”
In fact , it was his refrain through the discussion on all issues – health care reform , climate change legislation , etc .
The Senate Rules require 60 votes to end a filibuster , and Reid complained that Senate Republicans have made “ sixty the new 51 ” by simply announcing that they ’ll filibuster everything .
But these are effectively preemptive filibusters – killing legislation before any debate starts ( let alone ends ) , and Reid replied that you “ ca n’t make people talk ” once it ’s clear we do n’t have sixty votes for cloture .
But what he failed to address is that Democrats like Blanche Lincoln and Ben Nelson actively colluded to filibuster .
Reid does n’t have the same excuse that Democrats in the California state legislature have – where the State Constitution clearly requires a two - thirds vote to pass the state budget .
“ The text of the U.S. Constitution says nothing about the filibuster , ” said Mimi Marziani of the Brennan Center for Justice – at a panel discussion right after Harry Reid ’s speech .
The Constitution allows each house of Congress set their Rules , and the Senate requires 60 votes to bring anything to a vote .
“ But just like laws Congress passes can be found unconstitutional , ” said Marziani , “ so can particular Senate Rules .
Today ’s filibuster does not promote debate – it merely blocks debate .
That was not intended by the framers . ”
In fact , Common Cause plans to file a lawsuit challenging the 60 - vote requirement – on behalf of Senator Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) as a plaintiff .
But no guarantee that succeeds .
When asked about filibuster reform , Reid said “ I ’ll drink to that ” and held up a water bottle – but only said he ’s “ looking into ” specific changes .
Meanwhile , other Democrats in the Senate are pursuing concrete alternatives .
Missouri ’s Claire McCaskill wants to end “ secret holds ” – where Senators can anonymously say they intend to filibuster a bill .
Michael Bennett of Colorado ’s a proposal that would require Senators who filibuster to actually stay on the Senate floor and do so – or a lack of quorum kills the filibuster .
But changes to the Senate Rules can only pass by a two - thirds supermajority – unless they are introduced at the start of a new Congress .
New Mexico Senator Tom Udall addressed the panel , and said he would propose a filibuster reform measure in January .
Of course , my obvious question was – why did n’t the Senate take up filibuster reform in January 2009 ?
The Republicans had already planned to be total obstructionists , and in fact Democrats had complained about it in 2008 – when they were already shattering filibuster records .
“ We were under the myth that we had a filibuster - proof Senate once we got 60 votes , ” said Udall .
“ I remember asking about it , and was told not to worry about it because we ’d have 60 votes once Al Franken got seated .
Well , we found out what 60 votes got us . ”
Newer Senators : The “ Coalition of the Impatient ”
Tom Udall is a freshman Senator , elected in 2008 when the netroots played a vital role in helping Democrats win and expand their majority .
In fact , every Democratic Senator pushing filibuster reform is either of the Class of 2006 or 2008 – suggesting a sea change .
Senator Al Franken was the Keynote Speaker on the final night of the conference , and connected with bloggers more clearly than Pelosi or Reid did .
“ I ’m not telling you to be patient , ” he said .
“ That would be hypocritical .
But now , Republicans want to undo everything we have done .
No matter how frustrated you are , you ca n’t check out now . ”
Franken hit on a point that made it obvious how the blogosphere cannot give up on the November elections .
“ We have a lot of Democratic votes in Congress , ” he said , “ but we do n’t have enough progressive votes .
And I ’m not satisfied . ”
Effectively , the theme of the whole convention had been – we need more progressives , not necessarily more Democrats .
Since 2006 , Democrats have netted 14 seats in the Senate – and the newer Senators are keenly aware that the netroots helped them get there .
Unlike Harry Reid and other more senior Democrats , they are more willing to challenge the status quo and be combative against Republican obstruction .
Sherrod Brown , Bernie Sanders , Jon Tester , Jim Webb , Sheldon Whitehouse , Jeff Merkley , Kay Hagan , Mark and Tom Udall , Claire McCaskill and Franken are the “ Coalition of the Impatient , ” he said , and they need reinforcements .
Democrats had been a minority in the Senate for so long , that people like Harry Reid just do n’t know how to be in charge .
That ’s why it is so important to elect young blood to change the culture of the Senate , and Franken ’s speech brought hope to the audience .
“ I had decided to stop contributing money to political things , ” said a blogger that night on Twitter .
“ Al Franken has changed my mind . ”

Within days after the attack on the Mavi Marmara , European activists announced a Jewish Boat to sail in July from an undisclosed location in the Mediterranean , attempting to break the siege imposed by Israel in 2006 .
The boat is sponsored by a coalition of international Jewish organizations dedicated to peace with justice in Israel / Palestine , including the ” Jüdische Stimme ” ( ‘ Jewish Voice ’ for a Just Peace in the Near East ) , along with European Jews for a Just Peace in the Near East ( EJJP ) and Jews for Justice For Palestinians ( UK ) .
American Jews for a Just Peace ( AJJP ) will serve as the U.S. Coordinator , creating a transatlantic partnership .
The small boat ’s cargo will include school books , medicines and medical equipment .
Why a Jewish boat ?
Lots of reasons .
The universal values contained in the ethical tradition of Judaism do n’t include ‘ Do unto others as was done unto us . ’
For Jews to publicly confront the Israeli government ’s policies of occupation , apartheid , and siege on a world stage highlights the political nature of the conflict and discredits those who insist on framing it strictly in ethnic and / or religious terms .
I like best the answer from Glyn Secker , the Jewish Boat ’s captain , a British Jew , and longtime activist with Jews for Justice for Palestinians in the UK : “ As Jews we should stand as a beacon for human rights , not as an internationally known perpetrator of atrocities . ”
These may be reasons enough for us to pour our hearts and souls , as well as the contents of our pockets , into supporting this effort .
And imagine telling our grandchildren that in response to Israel ’s stranglehold on 1.5 million Palestinian people in Gaza , and in solidarity with the international movement , we sent a boat of Jewish activists to break the blockade .

John McDonald ’s father , Jack , knew he was dying .
He had known for a while , since being diagnosed for a recurrence of liver cancer in March , and by the end , he even had a good idea of exactly when .
But the 60 - year - old Connecticut native and his 35 - year - old son , a utility infielder with the Blue Jays , had made a commitment to be together in Toronto for a semi-annual Father ’s Day Q&A , their third such event , and it ’s not like this family to step away from a promise .
The two Macs started their shared tradition of hosting a group of fans at the ballpark when John was a young player with the Cleveland Indians .
When McDonald was dealt to the Jays , they revived the idea , and after being originally diagnosed with cancer in November , Jack asked his son if he could make those plans happen so they could be together one more time on Father ’s Day .
He probably knew he would n’t be able to make it , but it ’s good to have goals .
Jack McDonald passed away at home last Tuesday and was laid to rest on Friday .
John McDonald left his wife and daughter at home and flew back to Toronto on Saturday so he could rejoin his teammates and also fulfill his Father ’s Day promise to the fans who had won tickets .
For 40 emotional minutes before Sunday ’s finale of the Giants series , McDonald answered questions , mostly personal ones , in a private box on the 300 level at the Rogers Centre , pointing out to the admiring fans that in the past it was his dad who did most of the talking .
For 14 emotional seconds in the ninth inning of a 9 - 6 loss to the Giants , McDonald sprinted around the bases with teary eyes after hitting an unlikely two - run homer that fulfilled his father ’s dying wish —
“ Hit your next one for me . ”
“ I knew I wanted to hit the ball really hard and I was trying to calm down my emotions , ” McDonald said .
“ I was really excited to be back in a ballgame and the reception of the fans was really nice for me because they do n’t have to .
It meant an awful lot to me . ”
The ball was indeed hit hard , hooking just over the left - field fence into the bullpen .
As he circled the bases , McDonald had trouble holding back .
When he touched home plate , he pointed skyward .
As he reached the dugout , he pumped his fist and headed up the dugout tunnel to deal with his emotions .
He was greeted with hugs from a group of players coming from the clubhouse — Vernon Wells , Aaron Hill , Alex Gonzalez , Casey Janssen and Adam Lind .
The biggest change hit him hard : “ The fact that I could n’t call my dad after the game . ”
Many people in similar situations have a list of regrets , things they want to tell their father before he goes .
But McDonald speaks with reverence and respect about the bond that had always existed with his father and about spending the final night of his life with his friend and mentor .
“ We were extending our friendship further , ” McDonald explained .
“ His last night before he came home to hospice care , I stayed in the hospital with him all night and we sat up and we talked and we watched the sun come up .
He would fall asleep and wake up an hour later and we would talk some more and they ’d get more medication and we ’d talk some more .
“ That was a great night for both of us , because we knew what was going to happen the next day when we went home .
He knew what direction it was going and so did I .
It was a special night for the two of us .
I said , ‘ Dad I wish I had something to tell you that I never told you but you know everything . ’ ”
Thanks to the humanity shown by the Jays , McDonald was home for the final 11 days of his father ’s life , alternately laughing and crying but always celebrating a life well lived .
McDonald recalled for the fans one of the highlight conversations from that final week .

“ One year I struck out only once in high school , ” he said .
“ We had a game where no umpires showed .
They knew my dad was an ump so they pulled him out of the crowd .
On a two - strike pitch , he punched me out on a curveball .
We were talking in the hospital with a bunch of his umpire friends .
I said , ‘ Dad , was that really a strike ? ’
He said , ‘ Son , it was a strike then and it ’s a strike now . ’ ”
Jack ’s torch of wisdom has clearly been passed to the next generation of McDonald .
'' Throughout my posting in New York , it was the UK and US assessment that while there were many unanswered questions about Iraq 's WMD stocks and capabilities , we did not believe that these amounted to a substantial threat .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Should Facebook limit landing tabs ?
Posted by Sean @ 17:37 GMT Roger Thompson of AVG , wrote an interesting post today about a scam involving a Facebook Page which asks folks to copy and paste JavaScript into the browser 's address bar .
Part of the JavaScript 's function appeared to automate the " liking " of the page , causing it to spread .
Sounds like an unlikely trick , right ?
And so how many people fell for this ?
According to Thompson , the page had nearly 600 thousand likes .
Unbelievable .
This piqued my interest so I searched for additional pages called : 99 % of people can't watch this video more than 25 seconds .
There are currently several pages with over 200 thousand cumulative likes :
Only one of the pages that I found uses JavaScript and the rest simply display a TinyURL link once the page is liked :
The links lead to annoying marketing surveys and other such CPA ilk .
Similar pages often lead to scams or malicious websites .
Unfortunately , it 's a rather simple task to create a page on Facebook and the bigger problem is that of " landing tabs . "
What 's a landing tab ?
It 's the first tab that 's shown to someone that does n't already like the page , in this case , the " Video Here ! " tab .
Back in May , All Facebook reported that landing tabs were going to be restricted to " authenticated pages " or to pages with more than 10,000 fans ( which are now likes ) .
One day later and Facebook backpedaled and did n't implement the limitations .
Facebook 's statement : " We 've removed the recently - added authentication requirement for setting custom landing tabs on Pages .
The requirement was instituted as part of a Pages quality initiative , however we are now re-investigating the situation .
We will not make any further changes without first giving notice and lead time . "
Why did Facebook back off ?
Because small business complained .
The 10,000 fan requirement was seen as too difficult to achieve .
The major use for landing tabs is to build the page 's base , so perhaps it was too much to ask .
But at this point , having nothing in place opens up a deluge of scams and spam .
Some kind of compromise must be possible .
Our own Facebook page occasionally uses a landing tab , such as our during Anti-Theft Phonehunt campaign , but we do n't rely on the feature .
If we had to jump through a couple of extra hoops to enable the feature , then so be it .
The folks that are currently falling for these scams would be better off and we 'd better happier for that .
Let 's hope that Facebook does n't take too much longer with its re-investigation .
TinyURL quickly disabled the six links that I abused .
Cheers to Gilby !

Game has made a big splash in the man - o - sphere in recent times .
And of late I have begun writing on the subject myself , to one degree or another .
As a primer to the uninitiated , Game is ostensibly the tactics and methods of scoring with women while placing yourself in the alpha position among other males .
I offer that definition simply from extrapolating what I have read on the subject , and as I have never found a concise definition from its main proponents .
On a slightly deeper level , Game purports to differ itself from Pick Up Artistry ( PUA ) in that it stems from an enhanced cognizance of human female sociobiology , and uses that knowledge to manipulate women into bed .
I have to admit that I have been frequently stuck when trying to sort this thing out .
Exploring the implications of Game in juxtaposition to my beliefs as a men ’s advocate drew me into an intellectual tug - of - war with myself that for weeks seemed to be a complete standoff .
It ’s been a frustrating time that until now had left me with about 10 incomplete essays and nothing to post .
But then it hit me .
The tug - of - war was self inflicted .
And the only reason I was in struggling was because I was blinding myself to the obvious .
Game does n’t really stem from PUA , it is PUA ( which is also nothing new ) , just warmed over and re-branded with a catchy lexicon and a “ new and improved ” label on the bottle .
In other words , it ’s male pussy centrism , just like it always has been .
HOWEVER ,
Roissy and the others have unearthed , or at the very least articulated an idea that has the potential for massive utility .
Understanding the Evo-psychology of women , and using it to your advantage , is an untapped gold mine for male sexual empowerment , and male protection from the gynocracy .
For all their work , they have introduced us to the possibilities of Game , and now it is time to take those ground breaking efforts and move forward with a model designed exclusively with male protectionism in mind , both in public and private life .
Let ’s face it .
Pussy is power .
It always has been .
Pussy power is so great that women can have an entire world of men working like dogs and handing over their money , yielding seats on life boats , opening their doors , acting like trained seals for their approval , agreeing with whatever bullshit comes out of their mouths , and at the same time have those men nodding and agreeing when women claim that men have all the power and need to do more to make things better for women .
True to their unfortunate nature , men will pass laws , lock each other up and brutalize each other to make sure that all these feminine biddings are done .
If that is n’t power , I ’ll eat my hat .
And if you do n’t believe me , ask Sampson , Dillinger , Bill Clinton , John Edwards , Tiger Woods , the Duke Three , The Hofstra Five or any of about a million men , from average to “ powerful , ” who have had their heads handed to them by even the weakest of women .
Clinton was outwitted by a 19 year old bimbo , with a little help from feminist governance .
And if he had been a republican , whoa Nelly , his ass would have been fried to a crisp .
Am I making this up ?
I think not .
Perhaps there was a time when the fake power of manhood worked .
Hell , it got us to the moon when I was 12 years old .
But we live in a different world than when I was 12 .
The average woman in today ’s western culture should have a manufacturers warning tattooed just below the naval at birth .
I used the one on the pic for the sake of brevity , but a more accurate one would read something like this :
MANUFACTURERS WARNING :
Use of this product can result in early death , suicide , clinical depression , imprisonment , false accusations , destroyed reputation , poverty , spousal support , child support , loss of property , joblessness and social isolation .
Those would do for starters .
And this is where Game , if we take out the 99 % bullshit focus on chasing pussy , can have a dramatic impact that can significantly improve the lives of men by helping them weed out the most destructive females , which they will more likely if not under the pressure and influence of perceived scarcity .
And that scarcity is just a perception because getting laid is the easy part .
Hell , women these days are so sexually available that the whole idea of PUA would seem to be moot .
There is no “ artistry ” to picking up women , and anyone who thinks there is should not be trusted with a box of crayons .
But the traditional methods for men to “ attract ” women are , in fact , a product of real historical scarcity .
And while the sexual landscape has changed dramatically , three million years of programming dies hard .
But the point of Game , which I now call Zeta Game , is in recognizing that while neither sex nor women are scarce , they can both be as dangerous as they are pleasurable , and that an intimate knowledge of the forces that unconsciously drive women , and the ability to exploit it , can help men meet sexual needs and stay out of harms way at the same time .
In the end , it ’s not about getting women , but in being able to select them at will , and dispose quickly and safely of the unwanted and / or dangerous ones .
You do n’t need a book or a series of articles on this .
If you are a quick starter , you can get everything you need to know about attracting women from these two eight minute videos .
It is n’t that I am that smart .
It is that women are that simple .
This is n’t rocket science .
You see , the important thing here is not that I succeeded in getting laid .
What was most important was that one , I put no real energy , or money , into the equation .
And two , I turned the power dynamic between myself and women a full 180 degrees from what I had always known .
I became the selector from a pool of willing women .
No need for bullshit pick up lines .
Why would I have wasted my time approaching women in bars and other places , trying to impress them or get their phone number when I could just pick among the women that were offering themselves up to have sex with me on a regular basis ?
Answer , I fucking would n’t .
And neither should you .
Picking one woman and “ going after her ” is for men who ca n’t get a room full of women to come after them .
And the truth is that almost any man can own that room , top to bottom , if he wants to .
And the advantage to this is monumental .
You find out things about women who are crawling into bed with you , and even before they do .
You can , and should , take the opt out when the danger signs show up .
Too entitled ?
Next .
Two kids and an attitude about the ex ?
See ya .
Whatcha gonna buy me ?
Hasta la vista , baby .
All these women are problems , and bigger problems waiting to happen , but you can adios any of them before or after having sex with them .
Why ?
Because there will be more waiting for you .
And the more of them you pump and dump , the more the others will tingle when you walk into the room .
They may hate you , or fear you , but they will want you just the same .
And why should you want to dump them so unceremoniously ?
Remember that warning label ?
Well , it was n’t made up out of thin air .
People always broadcast who they are …if you are listening .
If a woman you barely know thinks she is entitled to dig into your wallet just because she is going to sleep with you , then what do you imagine she would feel entitled to after sleeping with you for a year ?
After getting married ?
If a woman talks constantly about the abusive , horrible men in her life , and men in general , how do you think she will end up talking about you ?
And to whom , the police maybe ?
The thing is , contrary to popular feminist belief , men fall in love and dedicate to women at some point in their lives .
And their
tendency is to give everything .
Usually the routine goes along traditional lines .
Man spots girl , sets out to impress her and win her affections .
He leads with his wallet , puts on his best act and ignores every warning sign she is broadcasting because he views her as a scarce resource .
Because he feels like he has very limited options .
So if she accepts him , he considers himself lucky .
He has found the woman of his dreams , she has returned his love , and all is right with the world .
He may spend the better part of the rest of this life finding out just how wrong he was .
And in most cases , while he will find out that he was wrong , he will never know why .
He will usually be incapable of figuring out that when you fish with stink bait , you catch bottom feeders .
If you use your money to attract women , you get shallow materialists .
If you use your willingness to sacrifice to her whims , you get narcissism .
If you use deference and agreement , you get entitlement .
If you use all three , you get the typical western women .
The techniques for helping you avoid that pitfall , and perhaps find someone atypical to hang with for a while , are simple .
Once you have established yourself as a sexually in demand with the women in your group , there is a code , a list of four screening behaviors and attitudes that will help cull out the deadweight ( almost all of them ) and set you up to find what I call a “ manageable ” woman .
More on that in the next Zeta Game piece .
Da Rules
1. Leave your wallet in your pocket .
If you want a whore , go to a massage parlor .
They are guaranteed to put out for a fixed price , and they do n’t follow you around and talk when you ’re done .
2 . Do n’t “ date , ” women .
Ever .
Hang out with them .
Party with them .
Eat with them .
But it is never a date .
Dating implies financial responsibility on your part , and perhaps gives the impression of exclusivity before you desire it .
You owe women nothing for their company or their bodies .
Look at it this way .
You can “ ask a woman out ” and spend a lot of money on food and drink .
But if you take the social club route as I suggested in the video , she can eat and drink with the group on her dime ( or some beta‘s ) , vie with the other women for your attention , and then go home with you if you select her .
3 . Never make a pass at a woman .
Never .
Stay Zeta and they will make a pass at you .
4. Remember - Sleeping with a woman does not mean you owe her anything .
Not a relationship , not a call the next day , not even a promise not to sleep with her sister .
Notice something about these rules .
None of them govern anything you should do , but simply show you what you do n’t have to do .
There is nothing here that says do this or do that for women .
It is just the opposite .
You do nothing for them at all .
You simply live your life without regard to them one way or another .
They will show up offering their goods without you doing a damn thing .
It is just that simple .
When you join a social club , make it one that you would enjoy if it were just men .
Keep it in your own comfort zone .
Make it a group where you can and will make male friends .
It has to have some value to you without the female presence .
If you are a staunch conservative , do n’t join the Sierra Club thinking it is Zeta .
It ’s not .
Joining a group like that when you think they are all morons for the sake of being around women is fake , and it calls on you to start things off with a lie .
I know what some of you are saying .
Ha !
Joining any club , even one you would like , with the idea of women in mind is just more pussy begging .
All puns aside , I beg to differ .
Avoiding pussy centrism does not mean you have to crawl in a hole or only go places that you think women are n’t .
In fact , that can be as pussy centric , only in reverse , as practicing PUA .
Living a life that presents sexual opportunities is normal for any man .
Only a few are so jaded from being screwed over that they have ruled out any possibility of sex or relationship again .
Most men will keep trying .
Either to meet sexual needs , or find a “ partner . ”
And while I caution against the latter , I understand that it is going to happen whether I caution against it or not .
So unless your goal is the complete removal of women from your life , which is understandable given what many men have gone through with them , then a sexual empowerment and risk management program is in order .
When men do n’t operate out of a sense of scarcity , they have the opportunity to make better decisions .
When they make better decisions , they have a tendency to get screwed over a lot less .
Next in the Zeta Game series - OK , so you started something regular , what next ?

A class-action lawsuit against the City of Toronto and / or Toronto Police Services for misconduct during the G20 summit is looking more like a probability than a possibility .
During the G20 meetings in Toronto last weekend , the largest mass arrests in Canadian history took place .
It was a weekend marred by violence , vandalism , and an overzealous , overbearing , $ 1 - billion security blitz that categorically stripped Canadian citizens of some of their fundamental and most valued rights and freedoms .
It was a weekend that I 'll never forget , having left an indelible and negative mark on our city 's historical record .
The debates will no doubt rage on for a long time to come and for some people affected by all of this , the scars will be permanent .
Peaceful protesters that gathered at the designated protest zone of Queen 's Park were beaten and pepper - sprayed , trampled by police horses , and snatched up by plainclothes police officers and dragged behind police lines .
Citizens walking to work and having nothing to do with any protests whatsoever were forcefully tackled , arrested without cause , and detained for as long as 36 hours before being released without charge .
Accredited media were given ultimatums that prevented them from doing their jobs when they were explicitly instructed to stop reporting and leave the area or face immediate arrest .
All around the downtown core , far from the designated security zone , police conducted unlawful searches and property seizures and disallowed peaceful assembly -- unequivocally violating the rights bestowed upon us by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
Furthermore , coordinated corralling {or " kettling " ) by riot police and unprecedented , terrifying mass arrests occurred and were well documented outside the Novotel on the Esplanade , at Queen 's Park , and at the intersection of Queen and Spadina .
In all , over 1000 people were arrested and processed , and an additional indeterminate number ( possibly in the hundreds ) were held mercilessly in overcrowded , dark , rank police vehicles for hours on end and were only released without detention due to an overflow of detainees at the Eastern Avenue Detention Centre .
At the detention centre , reports of chronic logistics failures , confusion , and highly questionable behaviour on the part of police officials have been numerous .
To make matters worse , the vast majority of protesters who were brought there were guilty of absolutely nothing .
For two days , exercising our rights to free speech and in some cases , simply walking on our sidewalks , was an offence punishable by temporary detention without charge .
For most of the above reported incidents , the mounting evidence is so plentiful and so public that it seems inevitable that calls for a public inquiry will eventually have to be answered .
How exactly this will happen is not clear , given that , one by one , our politicians are failing us .
Toronto mayor David Miller has made it clear that he fully supports the actions of the police force , Premier Dalton McGuinty thinks an inquiry is unnecessary , and Stephen Harper is lauding his security team for having ensured that " thugs do n't rampage around the city wreaking more havoc , " completely ignoring the innocent casualties of the massive Integrated Security Unit 's indiscriminate , sweeping use of intimidation and force .
Supposing a public inquiry is n't called , in the very least the mounting evidences of wrong - doing will be virtually insurmountable when the many lawsuits -- which appear to be inevitable -- are carried forward in the courts .
The events that transpired in Toronto last weekend are strikingly similar to the a number of mass arrests that occurred in Seattle and Washington D.C. earlier this decade , all of which were found to be unlawful .
Successful class-action lawsuits followed the mass arrests in Seattle in 1999 .
Mass arrests also marked peaceful World Bank protests in 2000 , and the mass arrests at Pershing Park in Washington D.C. in 2002 .
After years of legal battling , $ 13.7 - million and $ 8.25 - million class -action lawsuits were awarded to the hundreds of peaceful protesters who were surrounded and detained , denying them of their First Amendment rights .
We all know that history repeats itself .
The citizens and politicians and police force in Toronto are in the early phases of a long lesson that will eventually be learned via arduous legal processes .
And it will take a long time for the wounds to heal .
So much of what happened in Toronto during the G20 is so fundamentally wrong , and much of what happened will , in the fullness of time , be deemed unjust via official channels .
Years from now , apologies will be issued and compensation will be paid .
But this is n't good enough .
We need to have a broad understanding of how this happened , why this happened , and what we can do to prevent it from happening again .
Only a full public inquiry will achieve this .
It would be nothing short of a travesty if one is n't carried out , and the cost to taxpayers will be immense with or without one .
When we 're forced to turn to lawyers , rather than our elected politicians , to ensure the upholding of our rights and freedoms as citizens , what does that say about the state of our democracy ?

An agreement by the Environmental Protection Agency that it will drop a policy under which it had sought to prevent two of its attorneys from speaking out against cap - and - trade legislation is being hailed as a victory for free speech and the rights of whistleblowers .
The dispute began as the result of an effort by two EPA attorneys , Laurie Williams and Allan Zabel , to argue that cap - and - trade is not only inadequate as a solution to climate change but potentially counterproductive .
ADVERTISEMENT
The EPA ordered Williams and Zabel last fall to take down a YouTube video in which they made their case and to receive prior approval for any future written publications .
They appealed to the Obama administration for support , and the staff of the White House Ethics Counsel worked out new guidelines which guarantee the right of free speech for government agency employees .
William and Zabel had begun arguing against cap - and - trade as early as 2008 , when they sent an open letter to members of Congress stating that “ attempting to address climate change through a cap - and - trade approach alone … is an inefficient and ineffective strategy to address the most pressing problem of our time . ”
The husband - and - wife couple suggested that the only workable alternative was “ escalating carbon fees on all fossil fuels at the point of importation or extraction , ” along with “ a ban on new coal - fired power plants without effective carbon sequestration . ”
Last October , after the House of Representatives had passed a climate change bill — the counterpart to which has since stalled in the Senate — Williams and Zabel posted a video on YouTube titled “ The Huge Mistake , ” which described the problems they saw in the legislation .
On October 31 , they followed this up with an op -ed for the Washington Post charging that both bills were fatally flawed by their reliance on a combination of cap - and - trade and carbon offsets , which meant they “ would undermine even their weak emissions - reduction targets and would lock in climate degradation . ”

At that point , the EPA took action against the two employees , whom it saw as violating conflict of interest rules by exploiting their official positions for personal advantage .
Even though they had received advance clearance to post the video and had made it clear they were expressing only their own opinions , they were ordered to take it down or face “ disciplinary action . ”
They were also told to edit out all references to their experience as EPA attorneys and obtain prior approval of any “ outside writing activity ” in the future .
The apparent censorship raised a firestorm in environmental circles .
One environmental law blog suggested that Williams and Zabel must be “ wondering if their message is cutting through the smoke of whether they are being ‘ silenced ’ by the EPA and showing how the Obama Administration is no different from any other administration in muzzling differing opinions about policy issues . ”
Rather than filing a lawsuit , however , the two appealed to the Obama administration for support , and the staff of White House Ethics Counsel Norm Eisen began discussions with EPA officials .
This led to the Office of Government Ethics issuing a guideline for all government agencies stating that employees have a First Amendment right to speak freely , as long as they make it clear they are expressing their own views and not those of the government .

The Government Accountability Project , which had represented the two attorneys , sent a letter ( pdf ) of thanks this week to President Obama , saying that the new interpretation “ will make a real difference for employees throughout government .
…
For decades , manipulation of ethics rules has been a highly effective tactic to silence or punish whistleblowers . ”
“ Equally significantly , ” the letter continues , “ the Special Counsel also convinced the EPA to implement the anti-gag statute , which requires agencies explicitly to qualify free speech restrictions by disclosing that they do not apply to the Whistleblower Protection Act or communications with Congress .
EPA has refused to implement this basic transparency law for 22 years . ”

William and Zabel have now celebrated their new - found freedom by issuing a paper ( pdf ) titled “ Disclosure of Unfixable Flaws of Greenhouse Gas Offsets in Proposed U.S. Climate Legislation ” that calls for a Congressional investigation of the financial hazards of carbon offsets .
As summarized by SourceWatch , the paper argues that “ the complexity and subjectivity of carbon offsets renders them impossible to certify , regulate or enforce , ” meaning that they are likely to become “ a new ‘ creative financial instrument ’ which carries the same deceptive potential to bankrupt markets as did the creative instruments peddled on Wall Street . ”

Five collected samples of water and sand from Orange Beach , Gulf Shores , Katrina Key and Dauphin Island .
To our eyes , the samples appeared normal , until we took them to a local lab to be tested .
Water and sand along Alabama 's coast should contain no more than five parts per million of oil or petroleum , according to Bob Naman , an analytical chemist .
But , the samples we collected tested much higher .
From 16 ppm to 221 ppm , our results are concerning .
Even more disturbing is what happened to a sample collected from the Dauphin Island Marina near oil containment boom .
Yes , it exploded .
Adding a common organic solvent to separate the oil from the water caused the water sample to explode on contact .
Whether from poisonous levels of methane or through the over -use of the dispersant Corexit , serious questions should be raised but mostly are n't .
Water should n't just " explode " * .
And children are still playing and swimming in this toxic soup .
(* Rapid release of gases in a sealed container , or offgassing , created too much pressure for the glass container . )
" ... We 're all connected : to each other , biologically ; to the earth , chemically ; and to the rest of the universe , atomically .
That 's kind of cool .
That makes me smile . "
The authors here get e-mail feedback on just about every article we write .
We 've not talked about it previously because the typical e-mailer is an angry , frothing - at - the - mouth Canucks fan , or an angry , frothing - at - the - mouth Avalanche fan that possesses a terrible hatred of math , especially as related to hockey .
But the e-mails received in response to the article I wrote about Father 's Day in the NHL were different .
Many people were thankful for the article and a few shared their personal stories of loss with me .
I was overwhelmed by the feedback - there were over thirty emails of encouragement or thanks - and many of them were extremely emotional .
Two e-mails in particular have made an impact .
The first was from a gentleman who told me he was writing to thank me because the article gave him hope .
He told me of his own son coming out of the closet and witnessing the struggles that he had to go through , even within their own family , on a daily basis .
His son passed away at a young age shortly thereafter .
He said that when he read , " The strength that Brendan showed in coming out is something that should make any father , actually , every father proud ... " he was given hope that life will be easier on gay kids as the next generation ages .
I choked up at my computer while reading the email .
The second was one of three I received in which I was called a homosexual because I supported Brendan Burke , and only a man regularly involved in homosexual acts could ever possibly support a homosexual in sports .
I 've both translated and paraphrased the original work as none of the three pieces of hate mail were written in what could be described as even passable English .
It was an anonymous email , of course , but the origin IP tracks to Edmonton , which is disheartening in and of itself .
This article is n't about the hate mail , but I will admit that the trolls behind those three e-mails spurred my response .
Shortly after my article was published , Brent Sopel of the Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks announced that he and his wife would be participating in the Gay Pride Parade in Chicago and that the Stanley Cup would be on board .
Sopel knew Brendan from the time that their paths crossed in Vancouver - Sopel was a player there when Brendan 's father , Brian Burke , was General Manager of the Canucks .
Sopel talked about his participation and how it related to Brendan Burke :
" I was n’t here to advocate ( anything ) , but if coming here helps break down walls in the meantime , so be it .
I was here for Brendan .
I hope he is smiling . "

Many in the sports media felt that Sopel 's participation was a response to the " Pronger is gay " pictures that came from the post - game celebration in the Blackhawks ' locker room , but Sopel said it was specifically for Brendan .
The " Pronger is gay " picture , however , speaks to a larger problem in hockey - the anti-gay culture that the players have created for themselves means that , even if there are gay NHL players , there is little chance of them coming out .
Brian Burke talked about gay men in hockey in response to his son coming out :
" There are gay men in professional hockey .
We would be fools to think otherwise .
And it ’s sad that they feel the need to conceal this .
I understand why they do so , however . "
They do so because of the culture that surrounds professional sports , one where the biggest possible affront to a man is to call him " gay " or some other homosexual epithet .
Brendan 's brother Patrick wrote an excellent column for Outsports on breaking the cycle of discrimination in the NHL .
In it , he recounts his experiences with scouts after Brendan came out and notes that all of them were positive , even if some were awkward .
Burke wants the NHL to take steps to bring their athletes around to that same mindset , and I agree with every word :
" It is truly a vicious cycle : Athletes who are never exposed to gay culture hold onto antiquated ( and often harmful ) stereotypes about homosexuality , which makes gay athletes afraid to come out , which means the athletes never confront the ignorance of their beliefs .
The cycle has been repeating itself for generations in pro sports .
It will take men of courage , gay and straight , to break this cycle .
The hockey establishment must do a better job of establishing a safe haven for gay athletes . "
While it 's a good sign that people at all levels in the NHL have begun to speak out , this is n't limited to professional hockey .
The anti-gay culture is pervasive throughout all levels of hockey and it's not likely to change any time soon without a giant push in the right direction from the NHL .
There are still over 15,000 near - adults playing higher - level amateur hockey in North America .
Of those , some 3,500 are playing Major Junior or NCAA Hockey .
As sure as Brian Burke is that there are gay men in professional hockey , I 'm sure that there are many times that number in the amateur ranks .
Yet these kids are left on their own , far from home , far from any support system , invariably alone , a gay kid playing a sport in which gay men are reviled , living in fear of being discovered .
There is nowhere to go , no one to talk to , and nowhere to turn but inside themselves , and that loneliness and fear almost certainly impacts their on - ice performance and , to a greater extent , their careers .
I do n't care if a player is gay , nor do NHL scouts .
Nor should anyone else in the hockey world .
Like the people that Patrick Burke talked to , what we all care about is a player 's ability to take to the ice with ferocity and finesse , strength and grace , determination and skill .
As Burke so eloquently said , the goal of everyone involved with hockey at any level should be the same :
" We need to make it clear to every hockey player – gay , straight , black , white , religious , atheist , tall , short , whatever – if you can play , we welcome you . "
The NHL has a chance to make an enormous impact on the lives of so many young men and women in their sport , an impact that would resonate in both the entire sporting world and society at - large .
The NHL , the franchises , the owners and the players are a well - funded group with access to every major media outlet in North America .
Brendan Burke blazed a trail , Brian Burke and Brent Sopel followed his ideals and ideas and showed the world how the NHL could act -- it 's time for the rest of the league and the media to follow suit .
Millions of kids spend each day feeling afraid , isolated , and alone for a myriad of reasons ; being attracted to people of the same sex should not be one of them .
Whether it's a superstar on the verge of being worth millions , or a Junior - B kid riding the buses on the Canadian prairie , no man or woman should have to live a life of scared solitude because of the person they 'd like to date .
Because we are not alone .
Not only we are connected to each other at the most basic levels of life ; we are connected to each other through our love of the sport , through our passion for our teams , through our mutual fanaticism .
Isolation is man-made , born of discrimination through differences , and differences have driven the NHL 's anti-gay culture and attitude .
It 's time for the NHL to take action against its anti-gay culture , to strengthen our connections to each other , and to resolve to eliminate the isolation of anyone involved with our game .
* Cap on leak , funneling fraction of oil to drillship
* BP hopes cap will eventually capture 90 pct of oil ( Adds comment from CEO , analyst , quotes , detail )
HOUSTON , June 4 ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc. ’s containment cap over its stricken Gulf of Mexico well is collecting about 1,000 barrels per day , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort said on Friday .
A top BP BP.LBP.N executive overseeing containment efforts told CNN earlier that as that collection rate increases , it could corral " 90 - plus percent " of the oil .
One thousand barrels is a small fraction of the 19,000 barrels per day that the U.S. government has estimated could be gushing from the well , but the amount should decrease as BP closes vents to trap more oil , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters in a conference call .
“ Sometime later today we ’ll probably be able to get ... an approximation of how much oil we are capturing , ” he said .
“ Generally progress is being made , and I think we need to caution against over - optimism here . ”
The containment cap is BP ’s latest attempt to trap oil , after its ’ “ top kill ” plan to plug the well failed on Saturday .
BP ’s strategy is now to trap most of the oil at the well and funnel it to a tanker on the surface until the company finishes drilling two relief wells to plug the leak .
Those wells are expected to be finished by mid-August .
Doug Suttles , BP ’s chief operating officer of exploration and production , told CNN earlier on Friday that the containment cap “ should work . ”
“ I ’d like to see us capture 90 - plus percent of this flow , ” Suttles said .
“ I think that ’s possible with this design . ”
Both Allen and Suttles said BP would continue working to seal the cap on jagged remnants of a pipe on equipment at the wellhead .
“ Of course what we have to do is work through the next 24 or 48 hours to optimize that .
But that would be the goal ...
We want to stop this oil from spilling to the sea , ” Suttles said .
Suttles was the first BP official to publicly discuss the cap -- its latest attempt after a series of failures to try to contain the gushing oil and gas leak in the Gulf .
As Allen addressed reporters , BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward sought to reassure investors in a conference call .
“ We will halt this spill and put right the damage that has been done , ” Hayward said in a statement .
“ We will rebuild the confidence of the American people and the world in BP . ”
BP spent Thursday lowering the cap onto the pipe that had been sheared from the top of equipment at the wellhead .
A rubber seal on the bottom of the cap is intended to capture most of the oil , but some is still expected to escape .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Even if you ’re past your prime and have a hard time getting an erection , you might still need to worry about unprotected sex , according to U.S. doctors .
A box of Viagra , typically used to treat erectile dysfunction , is seen in a pharmacy in Toronto January 31 , 2008 .

In fact , they report in the Annals of Internal Medicine , the rate of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) in older men taking erectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra is twice as high as in their non-medicated peers .
In both groups , however , the numbers are swelling .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there were more than six new cases of STDs per 10,000 men over 40 in 2008 , up almost 50 percent since 1996 .
“ Younger adults have far more STDs than older adults , but the rates are growing at far higher rates in older adults , ” said Dr. Anupam B. Jena of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , who led the study .
While the reasons for this development are n’t well understood , he said more divorces and better health might have conspired to boost sexual prowess and activity among graying heads .
The problem , however , is that older adults appear to flaunt safe sex practices .
For instance , the researchers note , 50 - year - olds are six times less likely to use a condom than men in their 20s .
“ We are typically unaccustomed to practice safe sex over the age of 50 , because the risk of pregnancy is eliminated , ” Jena told Reuters Health .
To test whether the introduction of Viagra in 1998 might explain some of the STD surge , Jena and colleagues examined insurance records for more than 1.4 million U.S. men over 40 .
The average age in the study was about 60 years .
The most commonly found STD was HIV , followed by chlamydia , syphilis and gonorrhea .
Among the few percent of men who had filled prescriptions for erectile dysfunction drugs , more than two in a thousand had been treated for an STD in the year before they got the drug .
A year later , the number dropped to half that , suggesting that Viagra and its chemical cousins did n’t fuel STDs .
However , the risk of contracting an STD turned out to be more than twice as high in men taking erectile dysfunction drugs compared with those who did n’t .
“ These users have a different sexual risk profile than non-users , ” said Jena , adding that the data did n’t reveal any good explanation .
In an editorial , Dr. Thomas Fekete , of Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia , noted that it would have been valuable to know more about the frequency of sexual encounters , sexual partners and orientation .
He added that prevention strategies should still be directed at younger age groups , whose STD risk is at least 10 times higher than in middle - aged and older adults .
Still , he said , the authors remind us “ that men older than 40 years remain sexually active , even if they need chemical assistance to do so .
This study also serves as a reminder that sex after age 40 years is not necessarily safe . ”
Jena recommended that doctors take a few minutes to discuss safe sex with older men when they prescribe Viagra .
His advice ?
“ Look , just realize that you are at higher risk for STDs , and try to be careful like you used to be 30 years ago . ”

Petit à petit , l’HADOPI fait son nid .
Les décrets d’application commencent à sortir ( on en attend quatre , les deux principaux étant la définition de la contravention de négligence caractérisée et la procédure , le premier est sorti ) .
Et on nous promet une mise en mouvement pour… bientôt .
Rappelons ici un point essentiel : l’HADOPI est une autorité administrative ne prenant aucune part à la répression du téléchargement illicite .
C’est une autre entité , la Commission de Protection des Droits ( CPD ) , rattachée administrativement à la HADOPI ( partage des locaux , budget unique de fonctionnement ) qui s’en charge , mais aucun membre de la HADOPI ne peut siéger à la CPD et vice - versa ( art. L.331-17 du Code de la propriété intellectuelle , CPI ) .
Ainsi , la HADOPI est présidée par madame Marie - Françoise Marais , tandis que la CPD , composée de trois membres ( un conseiller d’ État , un conseiller à la Cour de cassation et un magistrat de la Cour des comptes ) est présidée par madame Mireille Imbert - Quaretta , conseiller d’État .
La HADOPI proprement dite ne nous intéresse pas .
Sans vouloir vexer ses membres , elle ne sert à rien .
Pour vous en convaincre , lisez l’article L.331-13 du CPI qui définit son rôle .
Je graisse .
La Haute Autorité assure : 1°
Une mission d’encouragement au développement de l’offre légale et d’observation de l’utilisation licite et illicite des œuvres et des objets auxquels est attaché un droit d’auteur ou un droit voisin sur les réseaux de communications électroniques utilisés pour la fourniture de services de communication au public en ligne ; 2° Une mission de protection de ces œuvres et objets à l’égard des atteintes à ces droits commises sur les réseaux de communications électroniques utilisés pour la fourniture de services de communication au public en ligne ; 3° Une mission de régulation et de veille dans le domaine des mesures techniques de protection et d’identification des œuvres et des objets protégés par un droit d’auteur ou par un droit voisin .
Au titre de ces missions , la Haute Autorité peut recommander toute modification législative ou réglementaire .
Elle peut être consultée par le Gouvernement sur tout projet de loi ou de décret intéressant la protection des droits de propriété littéraire et artistique .
Elle peut également être consultée par le Gouvernement ou par les commissions parlementaires sur toute question relative à ses domaines de compétence .
Sa mission se résume à émettre des avis , son plus grand pouvoir étant la possibilité d’émettre un avis même si on ne le lui demande pas .
En tout cas sa consultation n’est jamais obligatoire .
Et tout ça pour la modique somme de 6,3 millions en 2009 , avant même qu’elle ne fonctionne effectivement .
Fermez le ban .
C’est au niveau de la CPD que ça se passera .
La CPD a en charge de recevoir et traiter les procès verbaux dressés par les agents assermentés des sociétés d’ayant - droits ( SACEM et autres ) qui relèveront que telle œuvre a été téléchargée par telle IP .
On parle de 10 000 œuvres surveillées , moitié musicales , moitié audiovisuelles , réparties entre des classiques indémodables et des nouveautés amenées à changer régulièrement .
La CPD , composée de trois membres , six en comptant leurs suppléants , doit délibérer pour chacun de ces cas avant d’envoyer un courrier électronique d’avertissement au titulaire de l’adresse IP repérée ( ce sera l’adresse de contact donnée au FAI ) , puis la lettre recommandée si malgré un e-mail , le même titulaire d’un abonnement se fait à nouveau repérer ( les modalités étant attendues dans le décret “ procédure ” ) .
Pour info , les représentants des ayant - droits , assoiffés de répression parlent sans rire de 50 000 signalements par jour .
La suspension de l’abonnement , menace suprême , ne pourra être prononcée que par un juge de police , prononçant une condamnation pour une contravention de « négligence caractérisée » , après saisine du parquet , après transmission du dossier par la CPD .
Et cette contravention , on en a désormais le texte ( Décret n° 2010 - 695 du 25 juin 2010 instituant une contravention de négligence caractérisée protégeant la propriété littéraire et artistique sur internet , JORF n°0146 du 26 juin 2010 page 11536 , texte n° 11 ) .
Comme disait la présidente de la CPD devant la commission des affaires culturelles de l’Assemblée nationale , qui avait pu lire le projet de décret , « le résultat est d’une étonnante subtilité .
» Traduire : “ Ça a été écrit par un Orc ” .
Accrochez - vous , et n’hésitez pas à lire à haute voix .
Article R. 335 - 1 nouveau du CPI :
I. ― Constitue une négligence caractérisée , punie de l’amende prévue pour les contraventions de la cinquième classe , le fait , sans motif légitime , pour la personne titulaire d’un accès à des services de communication au public en ligne , lorsque se trouvent réunies les conditions prévues au II :
1° Soit de ne pas avoir mis en place un moyen de sécurisation de cet accès ;
2° Soit d’avoir manqué de diligence dans la mise en œuvre de ce moyen .
II . ― Les dispositions du I ne sont applicables que lorsque se trouvent réunies les deux conditions suivantes :
1° En application de l’article L. 331-25 et dans les formes prévues par cet article , le titulaire de l’accès s’est vu recommander par la commission de protection des droits de mettre en œuvre un moyen de sécurisation de son accès permettant de prévenir le renouvellement d’une utilisation de celui- ci à des fins de reproduction , de représentation ou de mise à disposition ou de communication au public d’œuvres ou d’objets protégés par un droit d’auteur ou par un droit voisin sans l’autorisation des titulaires des droits prévus aux livres Ier et II lorsqu’elle est requise ;
2° Dans l’année suivant la présentation de cette recommandation , cet accès est à nouveau utilisé aux fins mentionnées au 1° du présent II .
III . ―
Les personnes coupables de la contravention définie au I peuvent , en outre , être condamnées à la peine complémentaire de suspension de l’accès à un service de communication au public en ligne pour une durée maximale d’un mois , conformément aux dispositions de l’article L. 335-7-1 .
Un petit mot à mes amis parquetiers .
Je sais que nous nous disputons souvent dans le prétoire .
Nous avons curieusement des visions irréconciliables des mêmes dossiers .
C’est ainsi , nous sommes adversaires .
Mais quel que soit le fossé qui nous sépare , je vous respecte et je pense que vous n’avez pas mérité ça .
Bon courage en tout cas pour caractériser les éléments de l’infraction à l’audience .
Mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu !
Mon Dieu !
Mais il y a un concours de mauvaise rédaction de textes législatifs , ou quoi ?
Quelle horreur !
Des éléments constitutifs repoussés dans un second paragraphe , et pas moins de six renvois textuels pour une contravention .
“ Étonnante subtilité ” : ce sont justement les mots que j’utilise quand ma fille me tend les yeux remplis de fierté l’ignoble gribouillage marron agrémenté de plumes roses collées au milieu qu’elle a fait pour moi au centre de loisir .
Tenez , je vais tenter de ré-écrire ce texte de manière plus lisible en ôtant les scories .
“ Constitue une négligence caractérisée , punie de l’amende prévue pour les contraventions de la cinquième classe , le fait , sans motif légitime , pour la personne titulaire d’un accès à des services de communication au public en ligne ayant fait l’objet d’une recommandation de sécurisation de cet accès par la commission de protection des droits en application de l’article L. 331- 25 , de ne pas avoir mis en place un moyen de sécurisation de cet accès ou d’avoir manqué de diligence dans la mise en œuvre de ce moyen si cet accès est à nouveau utilisé aux mêmes fins frauduleuses dans l’année qui suit cette recommandation . ”
Voilà .
Ça dit la même chose , mais en plus simple .
Et force m’est de constater qu’en l’état , cette contravention est inapplicable .
Cette contravention suppose au préalable que le prévenu fasse l’objet d’une recommandation par la CPD car son abonnement a été utilisé pour télécharger ( peu importe que ce soit par lui ou par un pirate , on ne se pose pas la question ) .
Cette recommandation s’entend de la lettre recommandée , et non du premier mail d’avertissement sans frais .
Si dans l’année qui suit la réception de cette recommandation , le même abonnement est à nouveau repéré en train de télécharger une œuvre protégée , la contravention peut être constituée .
Mais il faut encore au pauvre parquetier prouver que la sécurisation n’a pas eu lieu ou a eu lieu tardivement , ce qui revient au même .
Car dans sa rédaction actuelle , le décret a fait de ce défaut de sécurisation un élément constitutif et non une exception .
Et ça change tout .
Un élément constitutif doit être prouvé par le parquet ( présomption d’innocence oblige ) .
Une exception , au contraire , doit être prouvée par le prévenu pour échapper à la condamnation .
Pensez à l’exception de légitime défense pour des violences .
Il y a bien une exception dans la contravention : c’est l’exception de motif légitime ( notez les mots : “ est puni le fait , sans motif légitime , pour la personne titulaire … ”
Si le prévenu établit qu’il avait un motif légitime de ne pas avoir sécurisé son accès ( e.g. : il était en déplacement à l’étranger entre l’arrivée de la lettre AR et le deuxième usage frauduleux ) , il sera relaxé , mais c’est à lui de l’établir , et non au parquet d’établir l’absence de motif légitime .
Mais le défaut de sécurisation de l’accès n’est pas une exception , c’est un élément constitutif .
Au parquet de le prouver .
De même , la rédaction actuelle ne permet pas de dire que le renouvellement de l’usage frauduleux établit le défaut de sécurisation .
Ce sont des éléments distincts car un usage frauduleux peut avoir lieu malgré une sécurisation , et dans ce cas il n’y a pas négligence caractérisée du titulaire de l’abonnement — mais malveillance caractérisée du pirate .
Comment cette preuve pourra - t - elle être rapportée ?
En diligentant une enquête de police voire une instruction avec expertise .
Lourd et coûteux , et aux antipodes de la logique de la loi qui voulait une machine à suspendre les abonnements .
Ou à travers les auditions des abonnés concernés par la CPD , mais cette audition n’a lieu qu’à la demande de l’intéressé ( art. L. 331-21 -1 du CPI ) .
Heureusement pour le parquet , la CPD opère une opération de filtrage des dossiers .
Il ne devrait pas en voir arriver beaucoup sur son bureau .
Surtout quand on sait que le représentant judiciaire à la CPD est le Conseiller à la Cour de cassation Jean - Yves Montfort , que j’ai pratiqué comme président de la 17e chambre ( celle de la presse ) et de la chambre de l’instruction de Versailles .
C’est un excellent magistrat , très respectueux des droits de la défense , et rigoureux dans son application du droit .
Mes lecteurs ont déjà pu apprécier son style ici .
Il y aura donc filtrage , et les mailles seront serrées .
En tout état de cause , cette contravention me paraît de fait incompatible avec la procédure d’ordonnance pénale , qui suppose des faits parfaitement établis .
La machine à suspendre les abonnements pourrait bien être une machine à relaxer .
Quant en traiter 50 000 par jour …
Je citerai pour conclure la lucidité de la présidente de la CPD , qui devant la commission des affaires culturelles , rappelait que s’agissant d’une contravention , l’article 40 du Code de procédure pénale ne s’applique pas , et que jamais la CPD n’est obligée de transmettre : “ elle peut transmettre comme elle peut ne pas transmettre ” .
“ Elle peut ne pas ” .
Tout est dit .
Vous voyez qu’on pouvait faire simple , dans cette affaire .

And the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die : 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
6
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .
NOTES
What will you do with what you know about God ’s Will / Word Know God ’s Word to know sin Obey / Choose / Exalt God ’s Word to defeat sin
CHORDS
This passage of Scripture not only tells us the root cause of sin , but also how to triumph over it .
( NOTE :
The fact that the woman sinned before the man sinned is inconsequential in so far as understanding the origin of sin . )
It begins with the woman being confronted by the serpent while she is alone in the garden .
The serpent first challenged the woman ’s knowledge of God ’s Word .
And she resisted that initial maneuver by correctly recounting God ’s instruction .
The serpent then asserts ( without evidence ! ) that God lied and that there was benefit to eating the fruit ( i.e. , disobeying God ) .
Then , despite her knowledge of God ’s instruction , the woman considers the appeal of the fruit and decides to eat it , because the fruit was “ good for food ” , “ pleasant to the eyes ” , and “ desired to make one wise ” .
In this record of the first sin , God wants us to understand the root cause of sin and how to defeat it .
And so He gives us the two factors that , together , can be used to overcome sin and without which sin overcomes us : ( 1 ) Knowledge and ( 2 ) Supremacy of God ’s Word .
Knowledge of God ’s Word .
In his effort to ensnare the woman , the serpent ’s first line of attack was on her knowledge of God ’s Word regarding eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
If she did n’t know what God had said , then she would have little reason to resist the serpent ’s suggestion .
The woman passed this test because she knew what God had said about eating the fruit .
Thy word have I hid in mine heart , that I might not sin against thee .
~ Psalm 119:11
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet , and a light unto my path .
~ Psalm 119:105
If ye love me , keep my commandments .
~ John 14:15
Her knowledge of God ’s Word enabled her to recognize sin and ( initially ) avoid it .
Far too frequently , however , Believers slip - up because they are unable to recognize sin/ error due to unfamiliarity with God ’s Word .
Knowledge of God ’s
Word opens the eyes of Believers so that they can see where to go and not stumble .
Jesus amplifies this point even further by establishing a link between keeping ( i.e. , knowing and holding on to )
His commandments ( God ’s Word ) and fellowship between God and man .
That is , we cannot enjoy fellowship ( a love relationship ) with God without knowing what He says !
If we intend to walk in righteousness and NOT to walk in sin , then we must know how to walk and where to walk : we MUST know God ’s Word .
All scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness : ~ 2 Timothy 3:16
Supremacy of God ’s Word .
Having failed in his initial attack , the serpent tries a second , more insidious tactic : he attacks God ’s credibility .
The serpent , in essence , challenges the notion that God cared about the woman ’s interests / concerns as much as she did .
The serpent asserts that the woman had more to gain by charting her own course than accepting God ’s prescription .
It is at this point that the woman makes the pivotal error :
She decides to examine the authenticity of the serpent ’s claim from her human perspective .
For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
~1 John 2:16
The woman considered the fruit ’s appeal to
Her physical need ( it was good for food )
Her need for pleasure ( it was pleasant to the eyes )
Her need for validation / self - pride ( [ it was ] desired to make one wise ) .
Though none of these human desires are intrinsically evil , they have no place in the determination of right from wrong .
No decision on any matter should be made because of how well they please human desires .
Instead God ’
Word should be held as supreme .
Rather than making God ’s Word subject to our desires , we should subject our desires to God ’s Word .
Only God ’s Word differentiates sin from righteousness .
… for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name .
~ Psalm 138:2b
For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
~ Isaiah 55:9
However , we will only hold God ’s Word as supreme when we trust that He knows what is best for us , infinitely better than we do .
The serpent was successful because the woman , after reflecting on how appealing the fruit was , doubted the integrity of God and the supremacy of His Word .
This is the constant struggle for every Believer : our human nature tells us that we need several things : houses , cars , husbands , wives , children , money .
But , when those perceived needs are not met , can we trust God to sustain us ?
Or should we take matters into our own hands ?
Can a just and loving God withhold the things we feel we so desperately need to make our lives complete ?
When Jesus was tempted , He resolutely resisted ALL the devil ’s deceptive propositions .
Instead , Jesus relied on God ’s Word to overcome temptation .
Unlike the woman , Jesus not only knew God ’s Word , but also demonstrated that God ’s Word was supreme : more important than food ( physical need ) , more important than worldly gain ( need for pleasure ) and more important than world acclaim ( need for validation ) .
A Closing Word on the Serpent .
Contrary to popular belief , the serpent did not trick the woman into anything .
The serpent falsely accused God of lying , but that does not constitute a trick ; it is just a false accusation .
Notably , Scripture , does not involve the devil in its description of the sin process that takes place within a person :
But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
~ James 1:14 -15
Instead , Scripture places the responsibility squarely on the individual .
The devil will try to make us fall , but we can choose to trust God ’s Word ( if we know it ) and TRIUMPH !

Even given the current decibel level in politics , the nasty din surrounding the customarily snore - inducing rubber - stamping of local school board budgets in New Jersey last week was something to behold .
Let ’s go to the videotape .
There was that subtle memo from Bergen County representatives of the state teachers ’ union castigating Gov. Christopher J. Christie and ending with a prayer that seemed to want him dead .
“ Dear Lord , ” it read , noting that God had taken the author ’s favorite actor , Patrick Swayze ; favorite actress , Farrah Fawcett ; favorite singer , Michael Jackson ; and favorite salesman , Billy Mays .
“ I just wanted to let you know that Chris Christie is my favorite governor . ”
There was the governor ’s tactful accusation that teachers were “ using the students like drug mules ” to carry information about whether their parents planned to vote — this based on what teachers said was a third - grade teacher ’s civic lesson on voter participation that had nothing to do with how they would vote .
And after Mr. Christie urged voters to reject budgets in districts where teachers had not agreed to a one - year wage freeze and new contributions to health benefits , voters defeated 58 percent of the 541 proposed budgets , the highest rejection rate since school boards began keeping track in 1976 .
When my husband retired from the Navy and we set about gardening on Florida ’s panhandle , tomatoes were high on our list of things to grow .
We tried valiantly to rise above our soil , a highly acidic and wormless sand .
We built raised beds , added organic fertilizers , and spread rock powders .
We made compost as fast as we could gather leaves and grass clippings .
We planted our tomatoes and tended them carefully .
They grew , sometimes to astounding size .
But they always fell victim to the bacterial wilt endemic to our soil .
The tomatoes of our dreams , meaty and juicy with a balance of sweet and acid , always eluded us .
We knew that growing tomatoes in the usual way would never produce anything but frustration .
Thus we began to experiment with growing tomatoes in pots .
The work came to involve not just soil but also tactics to fend off high humidity , broiling heat , frosts , and insects , insects , insects .
Our efforts evolved into a system that works well in our small space .
Find the right container Cage tomatoes for their own good .
Concrete reinforcing wire provides sturdy support for tomato vines and a perfect frame to attach anti-bug netting .
We began with terra -cotta pots and whiskey barrel halves .
Both proved impractical .
Clay pots large enough to retain water for more than an hour in late July were too heavy to move and big trouble to sanitize at the end of the season .
The half - barrels were even more unwieldy .
They provided a haven for wood roaches , which like tomatoes almost as much as we do , and they were also susceptible to termites .
When the barrels fell apart in the third year , we sighed with relief and purchased 20 - in. plastic pots and saucers .
They are colored and styled to look like old fashioned terra-cotta .
At the end of each year , we scrub them to remove most of the dirt , mold , and algae , and then drop them into our heavily chlorinated swimming pool for cleaning .
Dollies my husband made allow us to move the potted tomato plants around the patio with ease .
Drainage comes first when filling the pot
Good drainage and healthy roots go together .
At first , we tried to achieve the goal by layering pebbles in the bottom of each pot .
However , at the end of the season we wanted to dump the exhausted potting mix into our raised - bed vegetable garden .
Deliberately adding rocks to our garden beds seemed perverse .
So we moved the river rock into the saucer instead .
But we also line the bottom of each pot with a layer or two of plastic window screening , cut to fit .
Our soil stays put and drains well .
In heavy rains , we siphon the nutrient - saturated liquid from the saucers with a turkey baster demoted from the kitchen .
We recycle the liquid , conserving nutrients and getting rid of the standing water mosquitoes love for breeding .
Cut - and - come- again tomatoes Photo / Illustration : Nancy King
I found an alternative to rooting tomato plant suckers for a late season crop .
When the plants seemed exhausted about the end of July , I pruned them to a few short stems sprouting suckers .
This removed the flea - beetle - and fungus - infested old growth .
Because it seemed impossible to improve the weary soil in each pot with my preferred organic amendments , I dissolved magnesium sulfate crystals in water , along with several tablespoons of calcitic lime , and poured a gallon of the solution into each pot .
A week later , I used a liquid commercial product with an N - P - K ratio of 20 - 20 - 20 to get the plants moving again .
In less than a month , small tomatoes formed on new growth .
And soon there was another crop , though not as tasty as the first .
Cutting weather - weary plants back is practical , however , only if the plant ’s vascular system is healthy .
The magnesium and calcitic lime treatment may need to be repeated if leaves lose color or growth seems slow .
If this does n’t work , try pounding on their chests .
Add a proper mix to every pot
Early in the year we purchase our potting mix and begin to improve it .
We want to provide the tomatoes with the calcium and magnesium they will need later , so we thoroughly blend 1 cup of dolomitic limestone into each 40 - quart bag of potting mix .
In addition , we stir in a half cup of iron and trace elements , supplied by a product called Perk .
We store the mixture in covered trash cans to mellow .
For the next several months , we turn our attention to growing our seeds to transplant size , with a stocky stem and four to six true leaves .
At planting time , we improve the potting mix again , drawing on a balanced organic fertilizer we ’ve already prepared and stored .
The recipe calls for 4 cups of soy meal and 2 cups of blood meal for nitrogen ; 3 cups of bone meal for phosphorous ; 2 cups of kelp meal and 4 cups of greensand for potassium .
This homemade blend provides slow - release nutrition .
We add 2 cups to each 40 - quart bag of potting mix .
We improve the potting mix in two stages because the dolomitic limestone can prematurely activate the nitrogen .
Fill the pots with soil as the plant grows Nutrients should be well mixed with the soil before the tomato containers are filled .
We fill each pot with 6 in . to 8 in . of potting soil and set a transplant at the bottom of the pot .
As the tomatoes grow , we trim the leaves from the stem and add more of the enriched soil mix until the pot is filled .
This practice helps build root mass along the stem as it is buried , which is similar to laying the stem in a trench .
This method also allows us to plant earlier .
Since the plants stay below the pot rim for a couple weeks , we can cozy the plants in old mattress pads if there ’s a cold snap or cover them with old shower curtains if there ’s a deluge .
Best of all , we can tie layers of nylon netting over each pot to keep early insect marauders at bay .
It was n't supposed to be like this .
The Higgs boson , dark matter , neutrinos — weird or poorly understood phenomena like these seemed the likely candidates to provide a surprise that changes particle physics .
Not an old standby like the proton .
But the big story this week in Nature is that we might have been wrong all along in estimating something very basic about the humble proton : its size .
A team from the Paul - Scherrer Institute in Switzerland that 's been tackling this for a decade says its arduous measurements of the proton show it is 4 percent smaller than the previous best estimate .
For something as simple as the size of a proton , one of the basic measurements upon with the standard model of particle physics is built , 4 percent is a vast expanse that could shake up quantum electrodynamics if it 's true .
If the [ standard model ] turns out to be wrong , " it would be quite revolutionary .
It would mean that we know a lot less than we thought we knew , " said physicist Peter J. Mohr of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Md. , who was not involved in the research .
" If it is a fundamental problem , we do n't know what the consequences are yet " [ Los Angeles Times ] .
Simply , the long - standing value used for a proton 's radius is 0.8768 femtometers , ( a femtometer equals one quadrillionth of a meter ) .
But the study team found it to be 0.84184 femtometers .
How'd they make their measurement ?
First , think of the standard picture of electrons orbiting around a proton :
According to quantum mechanics , an electron can orbit only at certain specific distances , called energy levels , from its proton .
The electron can jump up to a higher energy level if a particle of light hits it , or drop down to a lower one if it lets some light go .
Physicists measure the energy of the absorbed or released light to determine how far one energy level is from another , and use calculations based on quantum electrodynamics to transform that energy difference into a number for the size of the proton [ Wired.com ] .
That was how physicists derived their previous estimate , using simple hydrogen atoms .
But this team relied on muons
instead of electrons .
Muons are 200 times heavier than electrons ; they orbit closer to protons and are more sensitive to the proton 's size .
However , they do n't last long and there are n't many of them , so the team had to be quick :
The team knew that firing a laser at the atom before the muon decays should excite the muon , causing it to move to a higher energy level — a higher orbit around the proton .
The muon should then release the extra energy as x-rays and move to a lower energy level .
The distance between these energy levels is determined by the size of the proton , which in turn dictates the frequency of the emitted x-rays [ National Geographic ] .
Thus , they should have seen the specific frequency related to the accepted size of a proton .
Just one problem :
The scientists did n't see that frequency .
Instead , their x-ray readings corresponded to the 4 - percent - smaller size .
Now the task at hand is to check whether this study is somehow flawed , or is in fact a finding that will shake up physics
.
In an editorial accompanying the report in the journal Nature , physicist Jeff Flowers of the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington , England , said there were three possibilities :
Either the experimenters have made a mistake , the calculations used in determining the size of the proton are wrong or , potentially most exciting and disturbing , the standard model has some kind of problem [ Los Angeles Times ] .

If you thought you could hide your extreme porn stash in a secluded location north of the border – think again .
For this week , the Scottish Parliament finally fell into line with its English counterpart south of the border , passing laws - included within the Criminal Justice Bill - making it a criminal offence to possess images that were extreme and pornographic in nature .
Like the English law on this topic , passed in May 2008 , the Scottish law will focus on images that are realistic , pornographic and of an extreme nature .
In addition , however , the Scottish law adds an extra clause , bringing within this Bill images which are believed to depict " rape or other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity " .
Quite how useful this clause may turn out remains to be seen .
The Register has analysed nearly 50 cases that have been brought in the rest of the UK since the Westminster law went live .
Our analysis reveals that in the vast majority of cases , the extreme porn in question featured bestial imagery ( " human-on - animal " action ) and not " human - on - human " action of the sort that the law ’s proponents claimed it was designed to act against .
We believe that there are two reasons for the low incidence of such cases .
First , in the days after the law went live , the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) advised English police forces not to police this law pro-actively , so the majority of convictions have been in association with other offences : they have been " add - on " charges .
Second , while it is relatively easy to identify bestial images , the threshold for identifying human - human extreme porn is far more difficult , and hard - pressed police and prosecution may have better things to do with their time .
Few cases have been defended , but where they have the end result has been embarrassing for the authorities .
According to Becky Dwyer , Convenor for Consenting Adult Action Network ( CAAN )
Scotland , the fact that such a large number of cases have now been prosecuted in England would have been good grounds for the Scottish Parliament to wait a little longer .
As far as Becky is concerned , this is not a neutral law .
She told us : " The law does not appear to be doing what it is meant to do – but the negative side - effects are themselves extreme , with bdsm websites encouraging practitioners towards safer play being taken down over the last year and a half .
" It may not be too much of an exaggeration to say that this law has made the world a far less safe , more dangerous place . "
This call for a pause was echoed by Patrick Harvie MSP , one of the few Scottish politicians to publicly speak out against the extreme porn clauses .
Intervening toward the end of yesterday ’s parliamentary debate , he said : " [ Cabinet Secretary Kenny MacAskill ] will be aware that the measure [ on extreme pornography ] that exists in England and Wales is having no effect in reducing the production of genuinely violent or abusive images , but is being used just as a top - up charge in a small number of cases in which the most serious offence is rape or sexual assault , which attract a higher sentence .
" If we end up in a similar situation with the charge being used in a similar way in Scotland , as a mere top - up , will we not have to look again at whether it serves any purpose ? "
Responding for the government , MacAskill indicated that he would be happy to discuss that issue after the debate .
However , the fact that he then appeared to suggest that the legislation would " protect our children from sexual perverts " , has been described by Harvie as " unhelpful " .
Nonetheless , Harvie told us that he would take up the opportunity to discuss the extreme porn provisions with MacAskill , looking particularly at how the equivalent provisions are used south of the border .
He concluded : " It would serve no purpose whatever if we were simply to reproduce a situation in Scotland which seems to be failing elsewhere . "
Ironically , as the remainder of the UK now falls into line , the last censorship - free zone in the British Isles may be the Isle of Man - or even the Channel Isles - both areas that have in the past been lambasted on mainland Britain for their quaint approach to law - making . ®

MacDailyNews posts an unconfirmed rumor that Apple is planning to make its MobileMe syncing service free for all users .
We have received a tip that we cannot confirm , hence our " RUMOR " designation , that nonetheless has at least an air of credibility about it that says " Apple is planning to make MobileMe free . " . . .
No timeframe was given for MobileMe to go free , other than : " sooner than later ... depends on certain facilities going operational . "
Speculation about " certain facilities going operational " of course centers around Apple 's massive new data center under construction in North Carolina .
In late March , Apple began ramping up hiring for the data center , suggesting that an opening may be approaching .
MobileMe is currently priced at $ 99 per year , although Apple frequently offers discounts when purchased with Apple hardware , and lower prices can also be found though other vendors .
Due to the unconfirmed nature of this claim and MacDailyNews ' own caution , we are placing this rumor on Page 2 for interest and discussion .
What this latest move highlights is that government really has no clue when it comes to the Internet .
When ZDNet broke the story on Friday afternoon , a huge wave of discontent rose - Godwin's Law got a huge workout !
But the reality is that this new move by the government is just as misguided as the web filter and shows that the government really has no clue .
Here 's why it wo n't work .
Anyone connecting to a VPN can securely tunnel their browsing .
If I establish a relationship with an overseas VPN provider ( and there are many to choose from ) then I connect to them and they create a secure tunnel that can't be read as everything is encrypted .
So , I browse via VPN and to all intents and purposes , what I 'm doing is invisible .
The government might talk about banning VPNs but surely , they 're not that stupid .
After all , most large businesses rely on VPNs for their remote access .
For criminals determined to use the web the other option is to use a remote access protocol to access a computer that is outside the Australian monitoring regime .
It 's not that hard to set up VNC to a computer in another country .
All that the ISP might see , and this outside the scope of what 's been reported as being subject to monitoring , is someone using a specific protocol to access a computer .
As things are today , in order for the Internet usage of an individual to be captured and used in criminal investigations the relevant policing authority needs to apply for a warrant through the courts .
That basic protection of civil liberty to going to be one of the first casualties should this new policy make it to law .
A similar policy that was put in place by the European Union in 2004 to retain the Internet usage data of individuals .
However , that policy ( that can be read here [ PDF download ] ) was created in direct response to the terrorist attacks on London in 2005 .
It also stipulates that the data collected by service providers be kept for a period of between six months and two years .
One of the other considerations here is that such a data collection regime wo n't be cheap .
We 're left wondering if spending the money on more police and improved education and training for police dealing with crimes that use the Internet might n't be a better use of taxpayer funds .
Or perhaps the government plans to have the cost of Internet use increased and use the ISPs as quasi tax collectors ?
Only time will tell how this will be funded out of our $ 40 Billion deficit .
So , once again we are seeing our government , desperate to be seen to be doing something , talking about protecting us .
It 's like some of their other policy initiatives , like the Home Insulation Scheme and School Building Scheme , are n't working as expected and they need to get some runs on the board before an election .
But that would just be cynical would n't it ?
[ N] ot content with huge tax breaks on their income ; not content with massive corporate tax loopholes ; not content with trade laws enabling them to outsource the jobs of millions of American workers to low - wage countries and not content with tax havens around the world , the ruling elite and their lobbyists are working feverishly to either eliminate the estate tax or substantially lower it .
If they are successful at wiping out the estate tax , as they came close to doing in 2006 with every Republican but two voting to do , it would increase the national debt by over $ 1 trillion during a ten - year period .
At a time when we already have a $ 13 trillion debt , enormous unmet needs and the highest level of wealth inequality in the industrialized world , it is simply obscene to provide more tax breaks to multi-millionaires and billionaires .
That is why I have introduced the Responsible Estate Tax Act ( S.3533 ) .
This legislation would raise $ 318 billion over the next decade by establishing a graduated inheritance tax on estates over $ 3.5 million retroactive to this year .
This bill ensures that the wealthiest 0.3 % of Americans pays their fair share of estate taxes , while making sure that 99.7 % of Americans never have to pay a dime when they lose a loved one .
It also makes certain that the overwhelming majority of family farmers and small businesses never have to pay an estate tax .
This legislation must be passed because , with a $ 13 trillion national debt and huge unmet needs , we cannot afford more tax breaks for millionaire and billionaire families .
But even more importantly , it must be passed because the United States must not become an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy and powerful families control the destiny of our nation .
Too many people , from the inception of this country , have struggled and died to maintain our democratic vision .
We owe it to them and to our children to maintain it .

Privacy concerns have dogged the social networking site for some time German officials have launched legal proceedings against Facebook for accessing and saving the personal data of people who do not use the site .
Facebook could face fines of tens of thousands of euros under privacy laws .
The social networking firm confirmed it had received a letter about the action .
" We consider the saving of data from third parties , in this context , to be against data privacy laws , " said Johannes Caspar , head of Hamburg 's Data Protection Authority .
Mr Caspar said he had received a number of complaints from people who had not signed up to Facebook , but whose details had been added to the site by friends .
He accused Facebook of saving private data of non-members without their permission , to be used for marketing purposes .
Switzerland is also reported to be concerned about the use of third - party data .
Facebook has until 11 August to formally reply to the legal complaint against it .
The California - based company told the BBC in an email that it was " currently reviewing ( the complaint ) and will readily respond to it within the given time frame " .
" Millions of Germans come to Facebook each day to find their friends , share information with them and connect to the world around them , " wrote spokesman Stefano Hessel .
Facebook has nearly 500 million users worldwide but according to figures by ComScore is only the fourth biggest social network in Germany .
' Human right '
This is not the first time the social networking site has landed in hot water with data protection officials .
At the beginning of the year , Canada 's privacy commissioner launched an investigation into the site following complaints about privacy policies .
Facebook was started as a way for students to share information
And back in May , Facebook faced a storm of criticism for the way it handled members ' data after unveiling new privacy settings .
A number of US senators made public calls at the time for the company to rethink its privacy safeguards .
Consumer Watchdog said it was not surprised that Europe was driving this latest legal action against Facebook .
" There are much stronger privacy laws in Europe than here , where privacy is viewed as a consumer protection issue as opposed to a fundamental human right , " the group 's John Simpson told BBC News .
" We see that a number of Silicon Valley companies do n't really understand how seriously privacy issues are taken in Europe and they will continue to run afoul of data protection laws there .
I also think there is a growing reaction in the US that we should beef up our privacy laws along the lines of those in Europe . "
Street View Germany has some of the world 's most stringent data - protection laws , while the Hamburg Data Protection Authority has a reputation for taking possible privacy breaches by internet companies seriously .
The Street View car takes photos for the service
It was the first to launch an investigation into search giant Google for intercepting personal data from unsecured wireless networks while gathering photos and data for its popular Street View project .
That investigation is still going on , although last week Google said it was close to handing over the data it had collected to German officials .
A number of other countries have also launched investigations while more than 30 states in the US are considering pooling resources to investigate whether Google broke any laws .

Update .
The video of the talk can be found here : Galois Tech Talks on Vimeo : Categories are Databases .
On Thursday Dr. David Spivak presented Categories are Databases as a Galois tech talk .
His slides are here , and are dramatically more accessible than the paper Simplicial databases .
Here is a short attempt to introduce this idea to people who only have a passing knowledge of category theory .
An essential exercise when designing relational databases is the practice of object modeling using labeled graphs of objects and relationships .
Visually , this involves drawing a bunch of boxes representing the objects being modeled , and then drawing arrows between the objects showing relationships they may have .
We can then use this object model as the basis for a relational database schema .
An example model from a software engineering class is below :
With the image of a object model in your head , consider Wikipedia 's definition of a category :
In mathematics , a category is an algebraic structure consisting of a collection of " objects " , linked together by a collection of " arrows " that have two basic properties : the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object .
The rest of the definition may seem terribly abstract , but hopefully the bolded section seems to clearly correspond to the picture of boxes ( objects ) and arrows we drew earlier .
Perhaps ...
Database schema = Category .
Unfortunately , a directed graph is not quite a category ; the secret sauce that makes a category a category are those two properties on the arrows , associative composition and identity , and if we really want to strengthen our claim that a schema is a category , we 'll need to demonstrate these .
Recall that our arrows are " relations , " that is , " X occupies Y " or " X is the key for Y " .
Our category must have an identity arrow , that is , some relation " X to X " .
How about , " X is itself X " , an almost vacuous statement , but one most certainly true .
Identity arrow , check .
We also need to show associative composition of arrows .
Composition of two arrows is much like they showed you when they were teaching you vector algebra : you take the head of one arrow ( X to Y ) and smush it with the tail of another ( Y to Z ) , and you get another arrow ( X to Z ) .
If a " book has an author " and " an author has a favorite color " , I can say " the book 's author has a favorite color " .
This composed statement does n't care who the author was ... just what his favorite color is .
In fact ,
Arrow composition = Joins
That is , one of the fundamental features of a category , a feature that any nice result from pure category theory uses as if it were intuitively obvious , is one of the very techniques that does not seem obvious to someone reading about JOINs in the second half of a database tutorial .
( Aside .
A foreign key relationship is intrinsically many to one : a foreign key field can only point to one record in another table , but many rows can have that field pointing to the same record .
When doing relational modeling , we will frequently use many - to - many or one - to - many relationships .
Any database administrator knows , however , that we can simply rewrite these into many to one relationships ( reversing the arrow in the case of one - to - many and introducing a new table for many - to - many ) . )
When we have a schema , we also want to have data to fill the schema .
As it turns out , this also fits into a category - theoretic framework too , although a full explanation is out of scope for this post ( I suggest consulting the slides . )
Functor ( C -> S ) = data
Why do you care ?
There are some good reasons mentioned by Spivak :
I 'll mention one of my own : SQL , while messy , is precise ; it can be fed into a computer and turned into a databases that can do real work .
On the other hand , relational models are high level but kind of mushy ; developers may complain that drawing diagrams with arrows does n't seem terribly rigorous and that the formalism does n't really help them much .
Category theory is precise ; it unambiguously assigns meaning and structure to the relations , the laws of composition define what relations are and are n't permissible .
Category theory is not only about arrows ( if it was it'd be pretty boring ) ; rather , it has a rich body of results from many fields expressed in a common language that can " translated " into database - speak .
In many cases , important category theory notions are tricky techniques in database administrator folklore .
When you talk about arrows , you 're talking a lot more than arrows .
That 's powerful !

More than half of all eggs analysed have abnormalities
A new egg screening technique , which doctors hope will boost the success rate of IVF , can predict genetic problems in 90 % of cases , research shows .
However , it is not yet clear whether or not it increases pregnancy rates , European fertility experts warned .
Some clinics already offer the £ 2,000 test to older women who have failed multiple attempts at IVF .
A large trial is due to start next year to further assess the technology .
Up to half of the eggs in younger women and up to 75 % in women over 39 are chromosomally abnormal .
Fertility doctors want a reliable way of finding which eggs are genetically sound to try to boost the chances of IVF success .
Delegates at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology ( ESHRE ) conference in Rome heard that the egg - screening method may be safer and more accurate than other tests which look for genetic problems in cells taken from the developing embryo .
We need a randomised controlled trial to demonstrate this test is going to be of additional benefit on what we already do Tony Rutherford , British Fertility Society
It detects problems by testing a by - product of the egg called the polar body , which contains a carbon copy of the genetic material in the egg , enabling doctors to see if there are too many or too few chromosomes .
The latest analysis of around 200 eggs from 41 couples has proven that it is a reliable method for picking up genetic problems .
Trials needed
But as only eight pregnancies were achieved in the small study , it is not yet possible to say how successful the technique is in boosting birth rates .
Professor Joep Geraedts , who led the ESHRE taskforce on analysing the test , said they were now planning a large trial of several hundred women to see if it has the potential that some claim .
He said that he did have concerns about clinics offering the technique before it had been properly tested .
" I hope it will improve pregnancy rates but I can't say that - that 's why we need another trial . "
Professor Simon Fishel , managing director of Care Fertility , who pioneered the test and who has now carried out this treatment in more than 150 women , says his data shows it doubles the chance of pregnancy .
" What I 'm very pleased about is they have confirmed that what we started is the way to go forward .
" What we have n't yet got from the ESHRE taskforce is any assessment of clinical potential .
" If this technology proves as robust as we think it is , then logic tells us all patients should benefit , not just the older ones . "
The chairman of the British Fertility Society , Tony Rutherford , said the results were an important advance , but that women should only be given the test as part of a research study .
" We need a randomised controlled trial to demonstrate this test is going to be of additional benefit on what we already do . "
THE INSIDER : Blackburn eye Raul but Spain legend looks set to join MLS as Wigan set sights on South Africa star Siphiwe Tshabalala
By Simon Jones - The Insider for the Daily Mail
Simon Jones is Sportsmail 's man on the inside of all the major transfer moves this summer .
His column , published every weekday , offers an insight into the deals which will be done and those that wo n't - and why .
A 5/5 - rating means
The Insider reckons it 's a done deal ; 0/5 means The Insider has his mortgage on it not happening .
Do n't miss your daily instalment of The Insider every weekday through the transfer window here at MailOnline .
Raul
Real Madrid to Blackburn - The Insider says : 2/5
Real deal : Madrid legend Raul ( right )
Jose Mourinho is expected to do what other previous coaches have failed and tell Raul that it is time for him to move on from the Santiago Bernabeu .
The 33 - year - old will not be short of offers as his ability to nab a goal has not left him even if his speed of foot has .
Yet he will not come cheap and will be wary of taking too big a step down .
Blackburn made their move for him over a month ago - using his friend Michel Salgado as a point of contact - but believed they had more chance of luring his teammate Guti .
Both will be extremely difficult though as the club struggles to find suitable funding for transfers and remains unsure when a proposed takeover could be completed .
There are offers in Italy , Germany and America 's MLS with the latter being favourite at the moment .
Siphiwe Tshabalala
Kaizer Chiefs to Wigan - The Insider says : 1/5
One of the few shining lights to emerge from South Africa 's disappointing World Cup campaign , Tshabalala caught the eye of a few scouts and has had football luminaries such as Kevin Keegan singing his praises .
He is 25 , has more than 50 caps and is a free agent .
Shop window : Tshabalala has plenty of admirers after his World Cup displays
Wigan are in the market to find a few gems , notably in wide positions , and have taken note of Tshabalala .
They have Mauro Boselli signed up to play up front but are wary of ongoing interest in Hugo Rodallega and Charles N'Zogbia .
Birmingham will also show interest in the South African as they have in his team - mate Katelgo Mphela .
Deniz Yilmaz
Bayern Munich to Blackpool - The Insider says : 2/5
Seasiders swoop : Yilmaz is on Blackpool 's radar
Not the most likely destination for a player leaving Bayern Munich but Yilmaz is keen to play in the Premier League and , despite their financial restrictions , Blackpool have become attractive to players because of their new status .
They will struggle to bring in players and the lower leagues or foreign market will be easier for them to find a bargain or two .
Yilmaz is highly rated despite not being a first team regular at Bayern and other clubs are keen , but Blackpool could give him a stepping stone to a bigger stage .
His wages are not expensive and neither is his transfer fee which is still negotiable .
Rafik Halliche
Benfica to West Ham - The Insider says : 1/5
The Algeria centre half shot to prominence in the qualifiers for the World Cup when he was hit by stones prior to the decider with Egypt .
He has since gone on to prove he is a competent defender at international level with good , solid displays in the World Cup against Slovenia , USA and England .
Hammer time : Halliche ( right ) as been linked with a move to Upton Park
He has attracted interest in Germany from Stuttgart and Eintracht Frankfurt but is keen to move to England .
West Ham have been mentioned but have yet to show strong interest in the 23 - year - old and he remains open to offers .
Benfica loaned him to Nacional Madeira to gain experience last year and are willing to let him go for around £ 1 m .
It could prove a bargain if he develops like international team - mate Madjid Bougherra .
Madrid , Spain ( CNN ) -- A Spanish judge issued arrest warrants for three U.S. soldiers on Thursday in connection with the death of a Spanish TV cameraman in Iraq in 2003 , reopening a long - running legal battle , according to a copy of the court order viewed by CNN .
The judge , National Court Investigating Magistrate Santiago Pedraz , indicted the three U.S. soldiers in April 2007 , alleging they were linked to U.S. tank fire directed against the Palestine Hotel in 2003 , where Spanish cameraman Jose Couso was videotaping the U.S. assault on Baghdad .
Couso died from his wounds shortly afterward .
But in 2008 , other National Court judges closed the case , citing lack of evidence .
The cameraman 's family appealed to Spain 's Supreme Court , which recently ruled the case could proceed after all .
That led to Pedraz issuing the arrest warrants for the three soldiers Thursday .
The three , identified as Philip de Camp , Phillip Wolford and Thomas Gibson , were assigned to the U.S. 3rd Infantry , based in Fort Stewart , Georgia .
In addition to Couso , the tank fire on April 8 , 2003 , in Baghdad also killed a Reuters cameraman , Ukrainian - born Taras Protsyuk .
Couso 's family and some journalists have blamed the U.S. military , saying they should have known the Palestine Hotel , a tall structure in Baghdad , was a base for journalists , not combatants .
The then U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said American troops fired only after receiving hostile fire from the hotel and the matter received the highest attention , from former President George W. Bush and the Spanish Prime Minister at the time Jose Maria Aznar .
Couso 's lawyer has previously said it would be difficult to put the soldiers -- the tank commander , a sergeant , and a superior officer -- on trial in Spain .
The Pentagon , faced with similar charges from other national courts in the past , has not turned over American soldiers .
Earlier in the long legal battle , a three - judge panel at the National Court in 2006 ruled that Spain had no jurisdiction in the case .
The judges ruled that U.S. troops thought they were firing on Iraqis at the hotel serving as spotters for Iraqi artillery fire aimed at American troops , and that the civilian deaths were not intentional .
A 22 - year - old woman jailed two days in November after being arrested for filming two brief snippets of a motion picture is lashing back at the theater , claiming its manager demanded her arrest despite the police department 's reluctance .
In a civil suit lodged in federal court in Illinois , Samantha Tumpach claims local police and the Motion Picture Association of American recommended against arresting her .
A felony theater - filming charge that risked up to three years in prison was subsequently dropped .
The woman filed suit Monday , claiming emotional distress and malicious prosecution on behalf of Muvico Theaters , whose manager allegedly demanded her arrest in a bid to win a financial reward .
The MPAA , and the National Association of Theater Owners offers $ 500 rewards ( .pdf ) to movie - house workers who catch pirates .
The first person arrested for filming in a U.S. theater , a federal and state crime in most states , was a 19 - year - old woman who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in 2007 .
Jhannet Sejas paid a $ 71 fine for filming 20 seconds of Transformers in a Virginia theater .
Regal Entertainment Group pushed for her prosecution .
On Tumpach 's camera , the authorities found a host of pictures she took of her friends and sister in the theater , in addition to two clips of the motion picture Twilight : New Moon , according to the suit .
One was 114 seconds long .
The other was 85 seconds , the suit said .
One of the snippets was captured in hopes of filming Tumpach's " favorite actor taking his shirt off , " according to the suit .
The lawsuit , which seeks $ 50,000 in damages , claims the woman did not film with intent to pirate the movie , that instead she was having fun with her friends and family at a birthday party at the Rosemont , Illinois , theater .
The suit alleges :
Samantha , in the open theater area and in plain view of others , was subsequently placed under arrest , handcuffed and was walked through the theater and out to the officers ' vehicle where she was placed in the rear seat of the squad car , while numerous theater guests witnessed , pointed and gasped as Samantha cried with fright , humiliation and shame . ( . pdf )
The suit claims that , once local officers took the woman to the station , they called the MPAA for guidance .
The suit says the MPAA recommended destroying the footage and releasing her .
Linda Colangelo , a spokeswoman for Muvico Theaters based in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , was not immediately prepared to comment .

You can find garages of the standard car , bike and tool - storing variety all across America .
But perhaps only in Silicon Valley , that nebulous area cradling the southern half of the San Francisco Bay , have they become tourist destinations .
Within a 14 - mile swath near Stanford University there are three mystique - surrounded and era-defining properties that served as incubators for some of the most influential tech companies of our time : Hewlett - Packard , Apple and Google .
None of the garages are open to the public , but that has n’t stopped them from becoming go - to spots on geek tours , luring pilgrims to otherwise calm neighborhoods , some of them perhaps hopeful they might one day start a company of their own that will change the world , or at least make a ton of money .
The HP Garage ( at 367 Addison Avenue ) in Palo Alto — a wood - frame , pitched - roof 12 - by - 18 - foot building where William Hewlett and David Packard tinkered in 1938 and 1939 — is the granddaddy of the bunch , the “ Birthplace of Silicon Valley , ” according to a bronze sign out front .
Not only an official Palo Alto landmark , but also a California landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places , it is owned by Hewlett - Packard , which has painstakingly restored its 1930s look , complete with workbench and Craftsman drill press .
It opens the place only occasionally for business meetings , however , leaving tourists to peek through an iron - barred gate from the sidewalk .
Apple has no official relationship with the garage in Los Altos ( 2066 Crist Drive ) where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started their computer company in 1976 .
Meanwhile , Google ’s ranch - house garage in Menlo Park ( 232 Santa Margarita Avenue ) , which its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rented in 1998 and 1999 after conceiving their search - engine enterprise in a Stanford dorm room , was purchased by the company in 2006 , though it has n’t quite figured out what to do with the place .
“ The idea was simply to hang on to bit of tech history , ” wrote a Google spokeswoman in an e-mail message .
So ingrained in the culture of Silicon Valley is the idea of the garage as lab — a place not to house something but to hatch something — that local companies have taken to using the word “ garage ” in their names , and the Avatar , a hotel that opened last year in Santa Clara ( 408-235-8900 ; jdvhotels.com ) , has an executive conference room called the Garage — outfitted with supplies stored in a red rolling tool chest .

Since then central funding has been slashed and several other councils are looking to follow its lead .
So are fixed speed cameras about to be consigned to history ?

The rumored Charm has just gotten a proper unveiling from Motorola -- and while it's not getting nearly the media fanfare its Droid X corporate cousin did , it 's arguably even more unique .
The phone features a full portrait QWERTY keyboard placed directly below a 2.8 - inch landscape touchscreen , but for most operations , you do n't have to touch it if you do n't want to because you 've also got a touchpad mounted on the back of the phone ( the so - called " Backtrack " ) much like AT&T's Backflip .
Not only is this the first widely - launched Android phone to employ such a form factor , it 's also the first to run Android 2.1 with Blur -- and interestingly , they 've carried over the old version 's general look and feel rather than going with the Droid X's updated skin .
It 's got a 3 megapixel camera ( with Kodak co-branding , something we have n't seen on a Moto in a long time ) , WiFi , and a noise - canceling second microphone .
Pricing and availability have n't been announced , but T - Mobile customers can expect it " this Summer . "
Speaking today at a town hall meeting , President Obama declared that the military was “ overburdened ’ by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , say that is among the reasons for his record military budgets as he contends with growing deficits .
Of course , the president ’s solution to this is not to scale down those wars .
Rather , he is proposing to build a “ civilian expeditionary force ” that is as large as the military and can be deployed abroad for nation - building duties .
Absent from President Obama ’s call was any explanation of the legal basis for this and perhaps more importantly , how he intends to pay for another military - sized institution when the $ 700 billion plus annual military budget is already choking the budget .
But in fact the administration has been talking for awhile about dramatically increasing the State Department ’s budget to put it roughly on par with the military .
Though this would ostensibly be a “ civilian ” force , the State Department is already looking at acquiring its own military hardware to create its own “ combat force ” dependent on military contractors .
So having grown the military to a size unprecedented in human history and had its mission grow to include a failed campaign of nation building , the administration may wind up trying to create another , equally large force to take over this nation building campaign , only to find its mission grown to include combat .

I made this because a certain admin on my server kept doing it manually when the round ended , it sounded like a good idea to me once I found out and so I wrote this to relieve them of the chore , it also proved to be very popular with the regulars !
I also wrote this because my server 's waiting time is skipped once we get enough players and so the pre-game mayhem plugin is n't of as much use to me as this .
Have fun !

Google and Bing to provide Music search and Download
Google and Bing are boasting these days about their new addition , the much rumored , Live music streaming .
With the increase of competition in order to acquire more users and rule the internet , the net biggies like Microsoft and Google these days are trying hard to increase there search engine efficiency by making it more user friendly .
In an effort to raise the traffic , last year Microsoft launched a new entertainment segment into its search engine Bing , which made full track streaming from Zune possible , followed by which the Internet Maestro Google also brought in a similar entertainment tool which is planned to be launched soon , giving an extra edge to its search audience all over the globe .
It is also being rumored that Google will soon be launching its Music Download service , later this year , Which is kind of more advanced than the current music searches that are linked through MySpace music and twitter feeds .
Google and Bing turn to Music
There are still confusions though , regarding what exactly is this music search will be about , But at a developers conference in may , Google announced that there will be a new addition to its search engine recognized as Simplify Media , a technology that synchs content , which will be used for the automated synching and streaming of purchased music online to any Android Phone equipped wit the technology .
So far it has been referred as an aggressive effort by the music industry , and have already issued a takedown notice against Google , demanding to remove 17 links of its songs from third party websites under the infringement law .
Considering the current copyright and music infringement policies , Google ’s current developments can definitely lead to a lot more of such cases from many more music labels and publishers in the coming days , as predicted by the Net Onlookers .
With Microsoft ’s
Bing creating some interesting waves in the search algorithm , Google is also trying hard to match the standards .
According to a recent research from Experian Hitwise firm , Google ’s search engine backed a market share of 72 percent with yahoo at second place gutting around 15 percent followed by Bing on the third position by 9 percent .
But after all this hard work and efforts and new packages when it comes to music , all the biggies still are under Apple ’s Shade , which still has its hold over 70 percent of the digital music download sales all over the United States .

David Remnick interviewed hundreds of people , including President Barack Obama for his new book The Bridge .
It charts the life and political rise of Obama up to his inauguration as president .
Mr Remnick says President Obama 's aim to be a " conciliator " on the world stage has not worked out .
He says awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 was " completely ridiculous " and he thinks Obama is learning now that the world is a much more stubborn place than he perhaps thought .
You can watch this HARDtalk interview on Monday 21 June on the BBC News Channel at 0430 and 2330 BST and on Monday 28 June on BBC World News at 0330 , 0830 , 1530 and 1930 GMT .
A survey of 300,000 applications for both the iPhone and Android devices found that 14 percent of free App Store software has the ability to access a user 's contacts on their iPhone .
This week at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas , Nev. , security research firm Lookout revealed that it analyzed more than 300,000 free applications available on both the iPhone App Store and Android Market .
As noted earlier , the mobile security firm revealed a wallpaper application for Google 's Android mobile operating system that allegedly captures a handset 's SIM card number , subscriber identification and voicemail password , and reportedly sends it to the website www.imnet.us, owned by someone in Shenzhen , China .
In addition , Lookout also discovered that 14 percent of the surveyed free applications available for Apple 's iPhone have the capability to access a user 's contact data .
That 's more than on Android , where 8 percent of tested applications could view the contact list .
Additionally , 33 percent of free applications on the App Store have the ability to access a user 's location .
The difference is , Apple 's iOS mobile operating system requires third - party software to inform users when the application is accessing their location .
Such rules do not , however , exist for contacts .
For comparison , 29 percent of free Android software has the ability to access a user 's location .
Finally , Lookout also found that 47 percent of free Android applications include third - party code , such as mobile ads and analytics tracking .
That number is 23 percent on the iPhone .
The survey found that 28 percent of software on the App Store is free , compared with 64 percent on the Android Market .
Lookout 's findings were also publicized this week by the Associated Press , which reported that nearly a quarter of tested iPhone applications contained software code with the ability to access either pictures , text messages , or Internet and search histories , in addition to contacts .
Reporter Jordan Robertson reached out to both Apple and Google for comment on the survey , but neither company responded .
The wealth disparity between America ’s richest and the poor and middle class more than tripled from 1979 to 2007 , based on data that the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities examined from the Congressional Budget Office .
The information led the research organization to conclude that income concentration among the top 1 % of taxpayers was greater today than at any time since 1928 .
It was also reported that over the 28 years of study , “ average after - tax incomes for the top 1 percent rose by 281 percent after adjusting for inflation — an increase in income of $ 973,100 per household — compared to increases of 25 percent ( $ 11,200 per household ) for the middle fifth of households and 16 percent ( $ 2,400 per household ) for the bottom fifth . ”

Porn star Ron Jeremy caused a stir in The Great Porn Debate at the Consumer Electronics
Show last week by saying that studies have found that " violent video games are a much bigger negative influence on kids " .
CES at the Las Vegas Convention Centre coincides with the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo at the Venetian hotel .
In this case , Jeremy was also promoting tools that help parents control their children 's access to undesirable content .
He said : " Because we make porn , we are the bad guys .
We do n't want kids to watch porn but yes we recognise that it happens .
We are not in favour of that , " reports BBC News .
The porn industry is keen on products such as InternetSafety .com 's Safe Eyes as a way of making content inaccessible to those under 18 .
This is a problem because of the amount of " adult " material that is now widely available .
" The Internet has changed the game completely , " said Craig Gross , the activist debating ( not for the first time ) against Jeremy .
" What we used to have to work hard to find , you now have to work hard to avoid . "
Presumably , this ubiquity is not good for the porn business , which sees its products widely pirated .
In a blog post , the BBC reporter Maggie Shiels said Jeremy " heaped further scorn on the net because , he said , it is putting his industry out of business " :
" People can download stuff for free these days , so why the heck are they going to buy it ?
The only ones making money out of porn are the novelty companies .
I just hate the internet in general . "
Jeremy also offered views similar to those of Nicholas Carr , a former editor of the Harvard Business Review , who suggested that Google is making us stupid .
Sheils quotes Jeremy saying :
" I am a former school teacher , I have a masters degree and two BAs , and I think the internet is making people stupid .
" It 's good because you can research any topic .
In my day , we went to the encyclopedia for that .
Nowadays , though , kids can't memorise anything .
No dates , no times tables , no history .
If there is anything you need to know , you just press a few buttons .
We could be giving rise to a generation of idiots . "
Games companies also have problems with internet piracy though violent games are perhaps not as visible online .
Like the porn industry , the games industry has ratings systems that are intended to keep unsuitable material out of reach of minors .
However , it also has a perception problem : computer and video games are often considered as being " for kids " even though most players are adults , whereas pornography is considered unsuitable for children .
There may be cases where adults allow children to play 18 - rated violent games when they would immediately stop them from watching pornography .
But whether violent video games are actually a much bigger negative influence than pornography is another matter .
The influence of both types of material has been argued at length , and Jeremy did n't provide any reference sources for his observation .

Also I 'm honored that my list was included , though I 'd also warn to avoid reading the comment section if you have n't seen the show yet .
Some of them are spoilerific .
Would it be alright if I went ahead and made official threads for the mystery and thriller recs since nobody has done so yet ?
It would be mutually beneficial to other members as well as myself , since I 'm looking for more of them and have seen a few also .

Yes .
And while you 're at it , make one for everything else .
I do n't care if you just put one recommendation per genre , it 'd just be nice to get it all out of the way .

Might I suggest you put a warning in the header of each of your lists ?
That way when someone clicks in to view your list it will let them know right at the top that some of the comments include spoilers .

Also as per request I included the genre discriptions in the rec threads I created .

So let me see if I have this right .
I should n't ask " Is ______ good ? " on this thread ?
Is n't this a recommendations thread ?
I do n't understand .

To any mods or admins : I apologise for posting on hallowed ground such as this .
I 'm only doing so to reply to this person .
I thought it would be more productive to answer their question than simply report them as was my first impulse .
Because of this , if you wish to delete this post , feel free . )

I do n't understand .
This is a hub for recommendation threads , but it is n't a recommendation thread in and of itself .
If you wish to inquire about a specific title such as " Is Honey & Clover any good " , then your first bet is to find the link for the appropriate genre .
If you do n't know what the genre it is ( maybe you just overheard someone talking about it and were curious ) then Quote : comedy , drama , romance , slice of life
Then it is up to you to find appropriate recommendation threads .
Needless to say , if you see the title in anyone of those threads ( but especially multiple times in a single thread , or in two or more threads ) , then you can stop your search .
You may still end up disliking the title if you eventually watch it , but that 's only because people 's tastes are different .
Despite that , you know that at least someone liked it enough , certainly enough to stick their neck out and recommend it to others .
If you do n't find a single mention in the genre threads , then ( this is my interpretation ) you can make a thread - but not post here - and ask about the single title you are interested in .
What is definitely not allowed is just listing the Anime you have watched , and then asking for something similar .
We still get that in the forums , despite this thread being stickied .
And it drives us batty .
I have n't listed anywhere near all the tools available to you , mostly because if you look at the first three posts in this thread you will see all the hints , tips and suggestions you are likely to need .
But if you have exhausted all the avenues and a decent opinion on a specific Anime still eludes you , then by all means make a thread and ask .
There are quite a few people on this forum who are happy to help if you ask nicely enough .

Tony K's post clearly states that it is not a recommendations thread : Tony K. wrote :

As dtm42 has said , this thread is more of a resource to help people find information about anime that they might like .
It 's the " Teach a man to fish , and he will eat for a lifetime " principle .
If you want to ask about a specific title , you can make a thread for it .
Just be sure to observe Tony 's words on that matter : Quote : 1 . If asking for a ( single ) particular title , for example : " Is Azumanga Daioh any good , " make sure you tell everyone what you 've heard about that title so far ( if anything , even if it 's just a plot summary ) , what your expectations might be , and also mention series of the same genre you think could be a good reference source .

Just a quick notion here , do you group robot shows under action ?
I always kinda thought mech stuff was its own genre , but if not , well , sorry for the trouble .

Thanks , fellas .
I 'm glad you did n't report me .
I did read about it not saying it was n't a thread for recommendations , but I was just confused on how to go about starting a question for recommendations .
You see I just signed up to this cite and I have never been part of an active forum .
The funny thing was that I was so intimidated by this cite due to the administrators putting up that thread on how you will be banned for a week if you post the same thing that someone prior posted .
I actually read the whole thing and was little scared about being a part of this community at all .
You already mentioned that you could have reported me simply for asking , I suppose , a " dumb " question .
I 'm also very unfamiliar with alot of the terminology used on forums and the like .
Maybe I 'll learn , if I 'm not banned first .

Sorry guys did n't see the recomendation post , only looked at first couple of pages briefly after registering .
Must be really , really , really annoying for moderators , however I only need to be told once .
I have n't seen a thread for fan art to discuss what anime you like drawing with what techniques and why , or to talk about specific pieces posted .
If there is one would it be in general , if not is it allowed or even possible here ?
Or should I make my own site / ask this at a different ANN forum

We 've had threads about fan art before .
They 're hidden somewhere towards the latter pages and I do n't mind if you revive them .
If you have too much trouble finding them , however , feel free to start a new one .
What if your phone automatically went silent when you step into the movie theater ?
Texted your significant other when you finished your long commute ?
Or automatically turned down the volume when a particularly loud friend called ?
It can ; here 's how .
Advertisement
Android application Tasker gives you total rules - based automation for your Android phone .
It 's not free , but it offers a free 14 - day trial download .
In the Android Market , it 's £ 3.99 in UK money — a little over $ 6 U.S.
If you grab the trial , or shell out the cost of a Double - Double meal at In - N - Out Burger to buy it in the Market ( scan the QR code at left ) , you 'll discover it 's worth the cost , even if you only have one super - specific use for it .
Advertisement
Tasker can do nearly anything on your phone .
It 's mostly limited by your imagination .
Here are some up - front ideas about neat automations that come to mind :
• Set preferences for each application : Give the Kindle app a longer screen time - out .
Make Maps or Foursquare automatically turn on GPS , and have a file browser launch when you trade out SD cards .
Have your music and other audio apps lower the volume to 50 percent when you plug in headphones , so you never get a way - too - loud moment .
• Time of day automation :
Make your phone go into airplane mode overnight , but re-connect for a few minutes every 30 minutes to grab messages .
Set up your phone to play specific or random songs from your collection as an alarm , back up files from your SD card every day , load up an application at a certain time .
• Set up contact rules :
If you 've got a friend who talks too loud , make your call volume go down when they ring .
Create a home screen widget that sends an automatic SMS ( " In the car , " maybe ) to the last person who called .
Set your phone to pop up a more iPhone - style message box , rather than background notifications , when you miss calls or get SMS from certain people .
Have your phone always record messages from a certain caller .
Advertisement
Here 's a video demonstration of one of the Tasker apps I created , a " Face - Down Quiet Mode " that kills the volume on your phone , and shuts down Wi -Fi , Bluetooth , and GPS , when you turn the phone face - down :
Those use cases barely scratch the surface , really .
Take the developer 's tour , and you 'll see there are variables , hundreds of events and triggers , and nearly infinite setups .
Want to have Reddit.com launch on your browser if your alarm clock goes off on a Tuesday while Wi -Fi is on ?
You got it .
Advertisement
We 'd need to write a research - paper - length treatise to cover everything Tasker can do for you , so we 'll instead offer up a few examples of app models we 've found handy .
Task 1 : Turn on GPS / Bluetooth / Wi-Fi for Certain Apps Automatically
Advertisement
I do n't keep GPS positioning on all the time , both for battery efficiency and a niggling sense of privacy .
At the same time , I dislike when Maps , My Tracks , Navigation , or Foursquare ask me to turn on GPS , and I 'm required to click " OK , " then make the toggle in Settings , then head back .
For just those apps , I want my GPS to automatically click on .
When I 'm done with those applications , the GPS should shut off , too .
You can easily pull the same trick for Wi -Fi , Bluetooth , or most any system function , but we 'll just show how GPS works .
Advertisement
From Tasker 's main screen , hit " New . "
You 'll be presented with six options , or " Contexts " : Application , Time , Day , Location , State , and Event .
Think of " Context " as an " If " — " If X is happening ... "
In this case , we 're going to choose Application , then pick out the app we want to apply a rule to .
You can pick out apps one at a time and apply your " Tasks " to them , but you can also apply Tasks to all applications , or pick out apps you do n't want your Tasks to apply to with the " Not " button at bottom .
We 'll just pick out one app , Maps , which I almost always want GPS to be turned on for .
Advertisement
After you pick your Context , now it 's time to add one or more Tasks .
Thinking ahead though , we 're going to apply this kind of action — turn GPS on when the app launches , then turn it off when it 's moved away from — to a few different apps after this .
So hit the " New " button in the upper - right corner , then type in a name for your Task that you 'll easily grasp later , like " Auto - Launch GPS . "
Advertisement
Now it 's time to tell Tasker what Task we want to fire when this Context is happening .
As you can see at left , you basically get your whole system to play with .
The thing we want , GPS , is under " Misc . "
Advertisement
In the bar under the GPS " Set " option , you 've got three options :
On , Off , and Toggle , the last of which just flips the setting the other way , whichever way it is .
There 's also a checkbox for an " If , " which , if clicked , drops down a box where you can enter in a variable and make it a condition .
You could , for example , only have GPS turn on if airplane mode is set to off ( " %AIR - Is n't Set " ) .
Our needs , for now , are simple — just have GPS set " On , " no matter what .
Advertisement
Well , that was pretty easy .
Now you 'll see that " GPS Auto - Launch " has just one task : " GPS - Set On . "
Let 's say you were a little more protective of your GPS chip , though , and you wanted Tasker to ask you about GPS , Wi-Fi , or whatnot .
The gear - and - screwdriver logo in the lower - right corner gives you that option .
Set your " Task Type " to " Menu , " and you 'll get options to set how long the menu stays up , if there 's a default option selected , and even set a background image , if you 're feeling extra-custom .
But we 're just having Tasker take care of the GPS switch for us , so get back to the Tasks screen .
Advertisement
You could hit " Test " in the lower - right corner to see how Tasker handles launching Maps and turning on GPS automatically , but we 're going to specify one more detail of our auto - launcher .
Hit " Done " to get back to the main Tasker menu , then tap on the right - hand side of the process you created , the side with " GPS Auto - Launch " and a green arrow .
From the menu that pops up , choose " Add Exit Task . "
When we told Tasker to do something when Maps launched , we created an " Enter " task .
By adding an " Exit " task , we can have something else happen when Maps is closed down or put away .
You can add these Exits to all kinds of conditions — when you 're no longer near a certain location , when it 's no longer a certain time , etc .
Update : Not all Tasker tasks need an Exit task — in general , whatever settings you 've changed while a task is running will set themselves back when you 're done .
In this case , though , we 're getting a little more extra-cautious control over turning the GPS off .
Advertisement
After hitting " Add Exit Task , " you 'll run through the same process you used to create the GPS turn - on : create a new name template , add the task GPS from the Misc menu , then set it to Off and hit " Done . "
Now , back at the main screen , you can see that there 's a Context ( Maps launches ) , an Enter task ( GPS Auto - Launch ) , and an Exit task ( GPS Shutdown ) .
Hit the " Apple " button at the very bottom , and now Tasker will be watching for Maps to launch , then do its auto - GPS thing .
Advertisement
This trick worked fairly well on my Nexus One , despite Tasker providing a pop-up note that application exit watching was n't as stable on Android 2.0 and later .
Worst case scenario , it does n't launch GPS , and I do it myself .
Task 2 : Create an Ultimate Morning Alarm
The next step , adding multiple tasks to a time condition , is n't all that different , but it does show off how far Tasker can go in automating your phone .
So let 's create Kevin 's Ultimate Alarm .
Advertisement
Hit " New " and choose Time as the Context .
I 'll have this alarm go off at 6 a.m. and , if I do n't respond , play for 3 minutes .
You could just set 6 - 6 as your time to run until you take action , but I 'll be nice to my morning self .
We 're going to add another context , the days of the week , later , but for now , you 'll be moved into the Tasks section .
Advertisement
Here 's a video showing what it looks like when my Ultimate Alarm fires off :
Advertisement
For my own Ultimate Alarm , I 'm having a song play from my collection , make my Remember the Milk tasks load up on the screen , and have my phone say , in text - to - speech , " Good morning , Kevin .
It 's going to be a great day . "
Why ?
Because , why not ?
For these pieces , I added three Tasks :
Media — Music Play — Music Play Dir .
After long - clicking on the " Dir " field and choosing my Music folder , I also checked " Audio Only " and " Random . "
If you wanted a particular song , you could swap " Music Play " for " Music Play Dir . "

After long - clicking on the " Dir " field and choosing my Music folder , I also checked " Audio Only " and " Random . "
If you wanted a particular song , you could swap " Music Play " for " Music Play Dir . "
App — Load App — Remember the Milk .
Fairly simple , and I could set a different starting page in Remember the Milk 's own settings , if I liked .
— — .
Fairly simple , and I could set a different starting page in Remember the Milk 's own settings , if I liked .
Misc — Say .
Then just fill in the text you want , choose a language , and mess with any other fields you 'd like .
" Stream " sets the output you 'd like the audio to go through , which helps if you 've got other things , like songs , going too .
You can , of course , mess with the pitch and speed of the voice , too .
Advertisement
When you 're all done and hit " Done , " tap on the left - hand side of your Ultimate Alarm entry , where the clock is .
From the menu , roll down Context and hit " Add , " then choose " Date . "
From the pop -up chooser , you can get very specific about the months , days of the month , days of the week , and other selectors for when your alarm goes off .
Mine 's a basic Monday - through - Friday deal .
Advertisement
That 's all there is to that one , but it 's a pretty nice package .
Task 3 : Make Your Phone Quiet Down When Face - Down
Now I 'm going to create a kind of " Quiet Down " mode for my phone ( the video demo of which was posted higher up , or can be found on YouTube ) .
When I put it face down on a flat surface , like arriving at my desk for work , it should turn off GPS , Wi-Fi , and Bluetooth ( and , heck , you can turn off EDGE / 3G data , if you 'd like ) , and then turn the system , ringer , and media volumes all the way down but keep vibrate on .
By default , whatever you had on when you flipped over will come back up when you flip it back up , but that 's fine by me ; you can change that in each setting , if you 'd like .
Advertisement
For this Context , you would choose State , then pick Orientation .
You 'll get the options you see at left .
I like to stay away from " Face up , " " Standing Up , " and " Upside Down , " because they 're pretty common occurrences .
For this example , " Face Down " is a pretty deliberate action you take with your phone .
Advertisement
For the tasks , I added " Bluetooth " and " WiFi " from the Net menu , set to Off , " GPS " from Misc set to Off , and set the volumes for " Media Volume " and " System Volume " to 0 from the Audio menu .
" Silent Mode " with Vibrate could simplify your setup , but I like to be sure .
If you 'd like , you can re-order the tasks in priority by pressing and dragging them up the chain .
In this case , I moved the volume - to - 0 tasks up higher , since silencing the phone was the most important thing to do .
Hit Done , and you 're all set .
We 've only scratched the surface of what Tasker can do , but we know it can do many , many more cool things .
If you grab Tasker and give it a try , or just daydream a great if - then combination , by all means — tell us in the comments .
We 'll check back in on this post and include the great Tasker tasks in a follow - up .
Special thanks goes out to " Bloggerific Himself , " who turned us onto Tasker via email .
Aurora police chief Dan Oates defends a sting operation that led to the arrest of a doctor accused of writing medical marijuana recommendations without examinations .
But Sensible Colorado's Brian Vicente , who 's criticized law enforcement 's approach to medical marijuana in the past , questions the department 's actions , which he sees in the context of Aurora 's reputation for MMJ industry unfriendliness .
In this space yesterday , Oates described the investigation into the activities of Dr. Manuel Aquino - Villaman .
He said that numerous sources who came into contact with APD personnel talked about receiving medical - marijuana recommendations from the doctor " under circumstances we doubted . "
So on two occasions , undercover officers visited Aquino - Villaman .
Both times ,
Oates said , the doctor wrote them recommendations without examining them -- actions for which he 's been charged with attempting to influence a public servant and with conspiracy to distribute marijuana .
Aurora is among the largest communities in Colorado to have instituted a moratorium on medical marijuana businesses , and its city council has voted to put a dispensary ban on the November ballot .
As such , MMJ boosters tend to think of the city as hostile to their interests .
Nonetheless ,
Oates insisted that he 's " not interested in the politics of this . "
Likewise , he rejected the theory that Aquino - Villaman 's arrest signals open season on Aurora doctors who might recommend medical marijuana to patients .
" I see this as an isolated incident of an allegation that a doctor was committing criminal acts , and we investigated it , " he said .
Vicente 's take ?
" I would say the town government is hostile to sick medical marijuana patients , " he maintains .
" They have been for years .
And I think they 're now using the police to further discriminate against those patients by running undercover sting operations on doctors who may or may not be writing recommendations inappropriately .
I think it shows the level of their distaste for patients . "
Not that Vicente believes doctors who write MMJ recommendations need do nothing more than chat with individuals who ask for weed .
" Doctors need to establish a bona fide relationship with patients , " he stresses .
" The law 's clear on that .
They need to use their training and judgment to verify this person 's ailment is real . "
With that in mind , he declines to weigh in on the specifics of Aquino - Villaman 's case .
" I 'm not saying what this doctor did was appropriate or inappropriate .
The facts are n't all there .
But I can say this is a giant waste of taxpayer dollars . "
Although the initial release from the APD about the doctor 's bust noted that the investigation stretched over a five - month period ( see it below ) , Oates said the actual amount the sting cost was quite modest .
Even so , Vicente feels the money could have been better spent .
" I have to imagine that there are more important crimes the people of Aurora are suffering from than a doctor writing a recommendation to a police officer who 's lied about having a medical problem to derive sympathy from the doctor , " he allows .
" Essentially , they set him up , and that strikes me as a waste of resources .
" I just think it 's amazing that resources were not devoted to violent crime or stopping the spread of addictive or dangerous drugs and are instead focused on marijuana , which is by all scientific measures a very benign substance for adults . "
SB 109 , the bill clarifying the relationship between doctors and MMJ patients , was recently signed into law by Governor Bill Ritter .
But Vicente sees a number of areas that need to be tweaked .
" I think 109 overreached in terms of allowing the government to sort of come between doctors and patients , " he says .
" And I 'm hoping the legislature will realize that using patient dollars to prosecute doctors that are acting inappropriately is not what voters had in mind when passing a medical marijuana law . "
As Vicente points out , " when prosecutions occur , they 're paid for by patients out of their $ 90 annual licensing fees . "
When it comes to Aquino - Villaman , " I imagine the money for that sting is coming directly from the taxpayers of Aurora .
But the money for the actual prosecution would come from patient dollars . "
Despite Oates ' insistence that the operation was an " isolated incident , " Vicente suspects " there 's a good chance we 'll be seeing more of these investigations and arrests .
I think that shows how out of touch law - enforcement officers are in Aurora , and I think the people of Aurora should be outraged that the police are n't using their resources to stop real crime . "

It has been 12 years since Blizzard last released a StarCraft title
A row has erupted after Blizzard - the publishers of the popular online game World of Warcraft - announced that users on its site forums would have to post under their real names .
The firm say the move is to put an end to heated online arguments and topics started purely to cause trouble .
But users reacted angrily , citing concerns about safety and privacy .
Blizzard said they would start implementing the changes over the next few months .
A post , by Vaneras - one of the site community managers - said that the forums had become " a place where flame wars , trolling and other unpleasantness run wild " .
" Removing the veil of anonymity typical to online dialogue will contribute to a more positive forum environment , promote constructive conversations , and connect the Blizzard community in ways they have n't been connected before , " the post continued .
People talk
Blizzard 's new system - Real ID - means that users will have to post under their real first and last name .
The firm said it will implement the changes over the next few weeks , with the StarCraft II forums - a section dedicated to the forthcoming real time strategy game - making the switch by the end of the month .
The World of Warcraft forum will change soon after .
Within five minutes , users had got hold of his telephone number , home address , photographs of him and a ton of other information Jim Brand , Gamer Send us your comments
In addition to users now posting under their own names , the site will allow others to rate post and interact with other users , creating a " social - networking platform " .
" As the way gamers interact with one another continues to evolve , our goal is to ensure Battle .
net is equipped to handle the ever - changing social - gaming experience for years to come , " the post by Vaneras went on .
The online community was swift to respond , with more than a thousand replies in less than 24 hours ; the majority of which expressed their displeasure at the move .
" I ca n't even begin to fathom why you would do this " , posted one user , while another wrote that it seems " like someone who likes Facebook came up with it , while being blissfully unaware that an awful lot of people deliberately avoid Facebook " .
Real worlds
One World of Warcraft player , Jim Brand , contacted BBC News to say how disappointed he was over the change .
" I have been using the forums for over five years , reporting bugs and trying to be helpful .
Now , to have the privilege to help people on the forums I have to reveal my real name ; I 'm dead against it , " he said .
" I work in a charity and deal with governments officials .
If they do a search and see I am a gamer , it could affect my employment prospects , " he added .
Although most social networking sites have links to a person 's real world name , gaming sites have always used anonymous handles .
There have been a few rare cases of online gaming disputes spilling out into the real world , and users are mostly reluctant to reveal personal details , given that video games can sometimes elicit strong emotions .
Mr Brand said that one Blizzard employee posted his real name on the forums , saying that there was no risk to users , and the experiment went drastically wrong .
" Within five minutes , users had got hold of his telephone number , home address , photographs of him and a ton of other information , " said Mr Brand
Ever since it was announced in 2008 , Level - 5's upcoming Studio Ghibli - animated roleplaying gamehad only been known to be in development for Nintendo DS , but now the studio has revealed it has a PlayStation 3 version in the works as well .
Independent developer Level - 5 has steadily increased its profile over the last several years , having developed twogames for Square Enix and self - published its ownseries in Japan .
As for Studio Ghibli , this major Japanese animation studio co-founded by animation legend Hayao Miyazaki is known for films like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away , andis its first major video game collaboration .
Japanese print publication Famitsu -- as reported by Siliconera -- confirmed a PlayStation 3 version of , but did not give any indication of when it will be released .
Meanwhile , the Nintendo DS version of the title is said to be scheduled to ship this fall .
With development said to have begun about two years ago , was originally scheduled to release some time in 2009 , but has seen multiple delays .
Not only will the PlayStation 3 version of the game feature high - definition graphics , it will apparently also feature a significantly different game design and plot .
A batch of downscaled screenshots of the game demonstrate its visual style , which includes detailed 3D environments and flat - shaded characters reminiscent of traditional cel animation .
When Jill Miller reflects on her long , painful dance with veganism , anorexia , and bulimia , she remembers standing alone in her kitchen , binge - eating a tofu - cream pie .
These episodes of stuffing herself with whipped soy — when what she really wanted was a pint of Ben & Jerry ’s — stand out in her mind as a sign that her commitment to veganism was a cover for something darker .
As do the many times that she turned down food with the seemingly innocent , even noble excuse that no one could argue with :
Oh , sorry .
I ca n’t eat that — I ’m vegan .
“ No prime rib and Yorkshire pudding at New Year ’s with Grandpa , ” says Miller .
“ This happened at every family event . ”
The shame , discomfort , and self - loathing represented by her eating habits defined much of her early life .
When she was just 13 , Miller became a vegetarian , in part for philosophical reasons , but mainly as an excuse to avoid her mom ’s New Orleans - style chicken - fried steak and jambalaya .
As she forged a career in yoga instruction , she further restricted her diet by going vegan , all the while struggling with an eating disorder that she kept under wraps .
“ I seized on the food theory of veganism to justify my desire to restrict , ” she told The Daily Beast .
“ It was a convenient way to eliminate fat and calories . ”
A breakthrough came shortly after she turned 30 .
She realized that the only way to fight her illness — and be happy — was to stop saying “ no ” to so many foods , and begin saying “ yes . ”
She ’s now an omnivorous yoga guru , starring in dozens of instructional DVDs , and she ’s never felt better .
As veganism moves from the fringes to the mainstream of American culture , with A - listers like Natalie Portman and Jonathan Safran Foer loudly endorsing it , more Americans are giving it a whirl .
Five percent of people in this country identify as vegan , according to a 2002 Time / CNN poll .
And for most , becoming vegan can mark a healthy shift toward wholesome eating and concern for the welfare of animals .
But for those at risk of developing an eating disorder , it can mask or trigger an illness , providing a socially conscious excuse not to partake in family barbeques or dinners out with friends .
According to Dr. Angela Guarda , director of the Johns Hopkins Eating Disorders Program , many vegans ( and vegetarians ) who enter her treatment center initially deny an underlying problem — only to later confess that their efforts to avoid animal products were really an effort to avoid food in general .
“ In most of our patients , the vegetarianism is in the service of the eating disorder , ” she said .
For this reason , Guarda and her staff try to dissuade patients from observing any form of vegetarianism while undergoing treatment , encouraging them to broaden their food repertoire to include some meat .
Other eating disorder and nutrition specialists report similar approaches .
Dr. Marcia Herrin , founder of the Dartmouth College Eating Disorders Prevention , Education and Treatment Program and now a dietician in private practice , takes a stricter ( if potentially problematic ) approach : Herrin tells parents not to let their kids be vegetarian until they go to college , echoing that the diet can create a “ ruse ” that loved ones ca n’t see through .
“ Most families do n’t have the time to prepare vegetarian entrées , ” she said .
“ What ’s at risk is the child ’s growth and development , and potentially an eating disorder . ”
Herrin may be onto something : A 2009 study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association revealed that young adults ages 15 to 23 who reported being vegetarian were , at some point , more likely to have also engaged in unhealthy weight - loss behaviors like bingeing , purging , and using diet pills or laxatives .
And surveys show that the prevalence of vegetarianism among eating - disorder patients is higher than in the general population .
It ’s important to note that for most of the country ’s roughly 3 million vegans , who do n’t consume or wear any animal products , their eating habits never veer into mental illness .
Many consider veganism a lifestyle , says Annie Hartnett , an animal - rights activist and blogger for Change.org , or a protest against cruel farming practices .
And studies have found that the physical benefits of veganism , when observed in a healthy way , are extraordinary , including lowered risk of chronic disease , improved heart health , and increased energy .
Problems arise when individuals approach veganism primarily as a vehicle for weight loss , and indeed , more than ever , it ’s being marketed by certain proponents as an extreme diet .
Last month , actress Jessica Simpson tweeted that she ’s going vegan , along with drinking a popular weight - loss tea .
While she later claimed the veganism is n’t to shed pounds , tabloids have since treated it as if it were the next Atkins Diet .
Then there ’s the bestselling Skinny Bitch series , a vegan manifesto in diet - book packaging .
Even PETA is guilty :
This past May , the organization proposed placing an ad on the Great Wall of China , depicting an overweight American tourist , with the caption : “ It ’s the Wall That We Should See From Space , Not You .
Go Vegan . ”
At the most toxic end of the eating - disorder spectrum , “ Pro-ana ” websites pitch veganism as a trick of the trade , so to speak — as both a weight - loss plan and a front so no one will notice you ’re anorexic .
When Georgia Hollenbeck , 24 , was in her early teens and spiraling into anorexia and bulimia , the veterinary worker decided to give veganism a try after reading about it on one of these sites .
“ I ’m from Michigan , so we eat a lot of meat here , ” she said .
As such , becoming vegan allowed her to say “ no , thanks ” to meals much of the time , and allowed her eating disorders to flourish in secret .
Of course , some embark on vegan diets for all the seemingly right reasons , only to find themselves on a slippery slope to disordered eating .
As with alcohol or cigarettes , exposure combined with biological predisposition can lead to abuse .
“ Going on any kind of diet where you ’re paying a lot of attention to what you eat or do n’t eat puts you at risk for an eating disorder , ” says Herrin .
“ Especially when you label certain foods as ‘ bad . ’ ”
Recently , reports of “ orthorexia ” have captured headlines .
Those who suffer from the controversial new disorder compulsively avoid foods thought to be unhealthy or unnatural , including products with trans fats , artificial colors , or flavors , high - fructose corn syrup , and preservatives .
Often , orthorexics opt for a strict vegan diet .
Some say orthorexia represents this dangerous slide from health to pathology .
To ensure both physical and psychological health , emerging vegans should educate themselves on how to maintain balanced nutrition and weight , says Keri Gans , a spokesman for the American Dietetic Association and a practicing dietician in Manhattan .
Replacing meat and dairy with plant - based sources of protein and fat is crucial , as is taking certain vitamin supplements .
If they ’re not vigilant , vegans can become lethargic and malnourished ; they ’re particularly at risk for Vitamin B - 12 deficiency , which can lead to deterioration of the spinal cord .
“ A person who undertakes veganism as a lifestyle , not related to any kind of eating disorder , will know that they have to replace the foods they ’ve eliminated with new foods , ” says Gans .
“ If they ’re saying to me , ‘ Let ’s talk about ways to add more foods into my diet , I ’m not afraid of healthy fats , ’ I ’ll say to myself , ‘ OK , this person gets it . ’”
If not , the veganism may be a red flag .
Perhaps counterintuitively , some who are in recovery from an eating disorder say adopting a vegan diet helped to nurse them back to health .
After struggling with anorexia and drug use in her 20s , Mandi Babkes embarked on an all - raw , vegan diet .
She now runs a holistic health practice and raw - food vegan catering business in Pittsburgh , explaining that while her eating disorders were about self - destruction , her veganism is about self - love .
" Being a vegan and raw foodist really helped me to feel better , to feel cleaner , to feel more energized , ” she said .
“ I sleep better , and I have a brighter outlook . ”
Still , many dieticians and eating - disorder specialists hesitate to recommend a vegan diet as a path to recovery .
“ It ’s like an alcoholic who likes to spend time in bars , ” says Herrin .
“ It ’s very risky to take on any system of eating that ’s restrictive and passes judgment on food that ’s not founded on health principles . ”
Perhaps above all , clinicians and vegan advocates alike emphasize one underlying message :
At its most basic level , veganism is about practicing non-violence toward animals .
And in keeping with this philosophy , its followers should look out for their own well - being , too .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - George Steinbrenner , one of the most colorful and controversial figures in U.S. sports who helped the New York Yankees reclaim their place as the most successful franchise in baseball , died Tuesday at age 80 .

Known as “ The Boss ” for his tempestuous style , Steinbrenner was loved by Yankees fans , feared by his players and managers and hated by his rivals .
The long - time Yankees owner resurrected the team from a period of decline , returning it to glory in the 1970s .
His family and baseball club announced his death but did not give a cause .
Media reports said he had a massive heart attack at his home in Tampa , Florida .
“ Winning is the most important thing in my life , after breathing , ” Steinbrenner once said .
Willing to spend heavily to sign star players , he demanded results and got them as the Yankees won seven World Series titles and 11 American League pennants since he bought the fabled club in 1973 .
The Yankees won their record 27th World Series title in 2009 .
“ He took , literally , a dying franchise and turned it into arguably the greatest franchise in American sports and along the way probably saved baseball , ” said Sal Galatioto , president of Galatioto Sports Partners , a sports banking firm that has done business with the Yankees .
“ It ’s a great loss to the Yankee players and fans , ” said Easwall Semper , 65 , a lifelong fan wearing a Yankees cap in midtown Manhattan .
“ He was a fair man .
He had his own ways . ”
Steinbrenner was twice suspended from baseball -- once for making illegal contributions to President Richard Nixon ’s 1972 re-election campaign and then for hiring a private investigator to dig up information on one of his players .
To broader audiences , he was a running joke on the “ Seinfeld ” sitcom in which the George Costanza character went to work for the Yankees .
The Steinbrenner character -- voiced by Larry David and played by Lee Bear -- was always shown from behind , often rambling on while Costanza walked away .
A $ 10 MILLION BARGAIN
But Steinbrenner had mellowed in recent years , particularly after his club went on a streak of winning four World Series titles between 1996 and 2000 .
While he had once fired field managers in fits of anger , he let Joe Torre manage the team for many years without the constant meddling of the past .
With his health failing , Steinbrenner had handed over daily operations of the club to his sons Hal and Hank , who became co-chairmen in May 2008 .
Hal Steinbrenner assumed control of the Yankees later that year .
The team Steinbrenner bought for $ 10 million in 1973 is now worth $ 1.6 billion , nearly twice as much as any other in baseball , Forbes magazine estimated .
The Yankees also own around 40 percent of YES Network , a regional cable operation that broadcasts the team ’s games .
It was valued at around $ 3 billion in 2007 , when the Yankees and other stakeholders looked at selling it .
“ George was The Boss , make no mistake .
He built the Yankees into champions and that ’s something nobody can ever deny , ” former Yankees great Yogi Berra , who was fired by Steinbrenner less than a month into the 1985 season , said in a statement .
“ George and I had our differences , but who did n’t ?
We became great friends over the last decade and I will miss him very much . ”
‘ I AM TOUGH ’
Steinbrenner died on the same day as one of baseball ’s signature events -- the annual all - star game to be played on Tuesday night in Anaheim , California .
His death came two days after that of another Yankees legend , announcer Bob Sheppard .
The family said the funeral would be private but there would be an additional public service .
“ It ’s a difficult time , on a great day for baseball , the All - Star Game , something everyone looks to ; a great man in baseball passed , ” Yankees manager Joe Girardi told a news conference in Anaheim .

“ He ’s meant so much to not only this organization , but to the game of baseball , and to all of us personally . ”
Steinbrenner , who turned 80 on the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4 , was a well - known figure in popular culture , routinely pictured on the back pages of New York ’s tabloids wearing his familiar white turtleneck under a blue blazer .
His early days with the Yankees were chronicled in several books , including “ The Bronx Zoo ” by player Sparky Lyle and “ Ladies and Gentlemen , The Bronx is Burning ” by Jonathan Mahler , which was dramatized in a 2007 TV miniseries with Steinbrenner ’s character played by Oliver Platt .
“ I am tough .
Sometimes I ’m unreasonable , ” Steinbrenner said .
“ I have to catch myself every once in a while . ”
He would publicly chastise underperformers and was famous for his confrontations with manager Billy Martin , who he hired and fired five times , and star Reggie Jackson , who Steinbrenner signed to a big free - agent contract in 1977 , the year the Yankees won their first World Series since 1962 .
“ He had a real loyalty to people , even those people that he fired .
Bill Martin is the perfect example , ” Yankees executive Rick Cerrone told Fox News .
The son of a wealthy Ohio shipping magnate , Steinbrenner followed in his father ’s footsteps as a hurdler at school then earned a masters ’ degree in physical education and worked as an assistant college football coach .
He helped revitalize his father ’s shipbuilding firm and fed his love of sports by buying a pro basketball team , the Cleveland Pipers , before his defining opportunity came .
The Yankees , baseball ’s most glamorous franchise with a history of beloved players such as Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle , ran into hard times at the end of Mantle ’s career in the late 1960s .
In 1973 , Steinbrenner led a group of private investors in buying the Yankees from the Columbia Broadcasting System and threw himself into the day - to - day operations .
He would become as prominent as any of the highly paid stars on his team .
“ He ’s more than just an owner to me .
He ’s a friend of mine .
He will be deeply missed , ” Yankees captain Derek Jeter said .
“ I think he ’s a father figure to everyone that was in our organization in the past or present , because he really took care of his players . ”
Steinbrenner is survived by his wife Joan , his sisters Susan Norpell and Judy Kamm , his children Hank , Hal , Jennifer and Jessica , and his grandchildren .

Aralsk , Kazakhstan ( CNN ) -- Serik Duisenbayv was 17 when he first saw the Aral Sea .
" When I was born the sea was n't in Aralsk , I had only heard about it from my parents and from history books , " he told CNN .
" When I saw it for the first time I was very sad that people had had to live without the sea for almost 40 years .
But now we have hope .
Now the sea is only 50 km from Aralsk and maybe one day the water will be in the old harbor once again . "
The shrinking of the Aral Sea has been described as one of the world 's most shocking man-made environmental disasters .
The sea lost over 90 percent of its area after the rivers that fed it were diverted to irrigate cotton crops elsewhere in the arid region in the 1960s .
As the water retreated , the sea became too saline for fish to survive , killing off the people 's livelihoods and , with it , their hope .
The retreat of the Aral Sea has left the once - thriving port town of Aralsk , the town that bears its name , resembling nothing so much as a salty dustbowl .
In its heyday it supported a population of 25,000 people with , on average , at least one person from each household employed in the fish processing plants .
Now the fish processing plants and ship building factories stand derelict ; the train lines that once transported Aralsk 's precious cargo all over the former Soviet Union are abandoned , a ghostly reminder of the town 's former prosperity .
Unemployment forced many of the locals to migrate to the big cities in search of jobs .
Those who remained still remember when this ghost town was a bustling harbor , complete with a floating restaurant .
They still tell the story of how , during the Bolshevik Revolution , the fishermen of Aralsk worked through the night to provide fish for a hungry nation on the orders of Vladimir Lenin .
One hour 's drive across the steppe from Aralsk , on what was once the sea bed , we get a poignant reminder of the scale of the disaster .
Camels roam among the rusting husks of fishing vessels that jut from the cracked earth , abandoned where they once swayed at anchor before the sea disappeared .
The receding waters have left vast plains covered with salt , which is picked up and carried away by the wind as toxic dust .
As well as blighting the local population with health and respiratory problems , the change in geography has also caused the summers to become hotter and drier and the winters colder and longer as the sea no longer acts as a temperature moderator .
But there is now an ongoing effort in Kazakhstan , supported by the World Bank , to save the north part of the Aral Sea .
In 2005 work on the $ 86 million Kok - Aral Dyke was completed , separating the North Aral from the rest of the sea .
It has helped to raise the sea level by about 12 meters from its lowest level in 2003 .
It means that for the first time in decades , fishermen are returning .
Fishermen like Sahif Talgat , who has been fishing in the north Aral Sea for one year .
To go out fishing with Sahif and his colleagues is almost to step back into another time .
As he lowers his net into the water , Sahif utters a prayer of thanks for the fish he hopes to catch .
There are now thought to be some 15 types of freshwater fish in the north Aral Sea , including carp , catfish and bream .
The pike perch is the most expensive fish : one kilo can fetch up to 500 tenge ( around $ 2.50 ) , helping to explain why the fisherman have dubbed it the " golden fish " .
The outlook for the remnants of the Aral Sea remains uncertain .
But Serik is hopeful that the second phase of the project -- that aims to improve water management in the Syr Darya basin , which feeds the Aral Sea --- will help restore Aralsk to its former glory as a famous fishing port .
" People all over the world talk about the shrinking of the Aral Sea , that 's it 's totally dead , there there 's no fishing anymore .
But I say that it 's not dead , it was just resting , waiting for better days .
And now I think those better days have come . "
During the government 's preparatory discussions over how to handle the Gaza - bound aid flotilla , the Foreign Ministry advised that Israel 's security forces wait for the ships to reach the country 's territorial waters - which lie within 20 miles from the coast - before launching a takeover operation .
According to a senior official in Jerusalem , Foreign Ministry diplomats said that despite the legality of overtaking the ships in international waters , such an action would hamper Israel on the diplomatic and public relations front worldwide .

Yesterday the forum of seven senior ministers convened again to discuss the creation of an inquiry committee that would be tasked with probing the flotilla raid and easing the blockade on the Gaza Strip .
Following the meeting , the ministers did not release a statement regarding the formation of a panel , which is perhaps indicative of continuing disagreement with the Obama administration over the mandate and composition of the committee .
The Americans would like the committee to include an international entity to placate Turkey , which remains adamant in demanding an international investigation under the auspices of the United Nations .
Jerusalem is expected to announce the formation of a panel soon .
One of the key issues to be examined by the committee is the legality of the navy 's actions in the eyes of international law .
Speaking at a conference organized by TheMarker , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the world had focused too much on Israel without paying due attention to violent attacks by the activists .
" I want the whole truth to come to light , " he said .
" So it is important to include answers to questions that have until now been ignored by many actors within the international community . "
" We have to establish who stood behind this extremist group , who financed its members , and how knives , axes and other weapons were brought aboard , " Netanyahu said .
" We also need to ask what large sums of money found aboard the boats were doing there , and for whom they were intended . "
An Israel Defense Forces internal probe of the flotilla raid is already underway .
The head of the investigation , General ( res. ) Giora Eiland , will soon begin to compile the findings of the probe into a report .
In discussions that preceded the flotilla 's arrival and forcible takeover , legal experts with the Military Advocate General 's Corps and the Foreign Ministry offered similar opinions which stated that there was no legal impediment to stopping a ship whose operators have already announced an intention to trespass a blockade , even if the takeover is done in international waters .
The legal opinions were based on precedent - setting cases involving the American and British navies as well as citations of the San Remo international law manual of 1994 .
Nonetheless , Foreign Ministry officials cautioned representatives of the defense establishment that it would be difficult to justify a military operation outside of Israel 's territorial waters from both a political and public relations standpoint .
Thus , according to senior figures familiar with the details of the discussions , the Foreign Ministry urged defense officials to launch their operations to stop the flotilla only after the ships had crossed Gaza 's maritime boundaries .
The ministry 's diplomats repeated this request on more than one occasion .
" If somebody breaks into your home and you shoot him after he enters the doorway , there 's no problem in justifying this action in court , " said a senior ministry official .
" But if you attack the burglar while he is on his way to your house at a distance of two blocks away , then you have a problem . "
" It was made clear that we can ultimately prove that we acted according to international law , but this will be very complicated and we will absorb many denunciations along the way , " the official said .
Senior figures involved in the planning of the operation praised the improved cooperation between the defense establishment and the Foreign Ministry .
While the diplomats ' warnings were understood , their recommendation was not accepted due to " operational reasons . "
" The navy expressed concern that it would not be able to stop the flotilla once the ships reached within 20 miles of the coast , " said an official who had a hand in the planning of the operation .
" The IDF was fearful that the naval forces would not have adequate time to complete the operation .
The army wanted to overtake the ships gradually and at a relatively great distance from the coast . "
Defense and diplomatic officials began preparations for the flotilla 's arrival two months prior to its voyage .
The efforts were led by the IDF , the Defense Ministry , the Foreign Ministry , and the national media relations division of the Prime Minister 's Office .
While officials who took part in the discussions reported full cooperation between the agencies , the National Security Council - the body legally empowered to direct the bureaucratic end of the government 's diplomatic and security policy - first held a meeting on the flotilla just 10 days prior to its journey .
The NSC was not included in the primary preparations and response .
Image caption Some water sources are already feared to be contaminated
Hundreds more children could die of lead poisoning in northern Nigeria , a decontamination expert says , but officials have downplayed the fears .
Some 163 people - mostly children - have died in recent weeks after villagers started digging for gold in areas with high concentrations of lead .
The top layer of soil in the worst affected village is to be excavated .
Twenty - five children from the village have been hospitalised with another 80 set for treatment in the coming days .
Richard Fuller , from the Blacksmith Institute , which is trying to clean up the villages , told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that hundreds of children have tested with high levels of lead " that are likely to lead to them dying in the near future " .
LEAD POISONING
Children tend to fare worse than adults because they are smaller and are still growing
Symptoms include lethargy , abdominal pain , vomiting , constipation and headaches
Children in particular may develop encephalopathy - seizures , delirium and coma
For mild poisoning it may be sufficient to remove the patient from the source
More severe poisoning will need medical treatment , but may prove fatal
He said that children were more vulnerable to lead poisoning than adults .
But Zamfara State Director of Public Health Sa'adu Idris told the BBC that such fears were wrong .
He said that only one clinical death from lead poisoning had been recorded over the past three weeks , with the other deaths occurring earlier on .
He also assured that the villages would be cleaned up within the next four weeks .
However , the operation to dig up the top 5 cm ( 2in ) of soil in the remote village of Yar 'Gailma has been delayed until Tuesday because bad roads have delayed the heavy machinery , officials say .
The contaminated soil is to be replaced with clean earth .
The BBC's Haruna Shehu Tangaza in Zamfara State says that houses in the village will not be demolished - their floors are to be covered in cement to protect residents from lead poisoning .
Correspondents say the Zamfara state government is facing criticism that they were slow to notice the toxic pollution .
Last week , the spokesman for the local government denied to journalists that any lead poisoning had occurred at all .
Health authorities have set up two camps in the area to treat people who are suffering the symptoms of lead poisoning .
Some families are believed to have taken crushed rock ore into their homes .
In their attempts to extract gold , deadly amounts of lead were released - it is thought that soil containing lead deposits was dumped in water sources and in places where children played .
Rainy season fears
The deaths were discovered during the country 's annual immunisation programme , when officials realised there were virtually no children in several villages .
Villagers said the children had died of malaria and it was only when a team from international aid agency Medecins Sans Frontiers took blood tests from local people that the high concentrations of lead were discovered .
Zamfara State had recently employed a Chinese company to mine gold in the area , adds our correspondent .
But villagers had also attempted to capitalise by digging for the precious metal themselves - an illegal activity in Nigeria .
Some fear the contamination could spread during the rainy season which has just begun , if heavy rains wash the lead into new areas .
Amazon 's grocery service will offer 22,000 lines as it challenges Ocado for the position of pre-eminent online grocer

Amazon today launched a grocery division offering free delivery on thousands of household goods .
The online retailer , which launched in the UK in 1998 as a bookseller , will offer 22,000 top grocery lines including Pampers , Ariel , Uncle Ben's , Dolmio , Kraft , Schwartz , Kenco , Carte Noir , Walkers and Oreo , and leading pet food products Bakers and Purina One .
As well as selling individual items the Amazon.co.uk Grocery store allows customers to save money by bulk - buying items such as nappies , washing powders , pasta , rice , herbs , cooking oils and spices .
Goods on sale will also include a large selection of international and specialist items including organic , kosher , gluten free , sugar free and vegan ranges .
Products offered include Montana hot chocolate , Illy coffee , Clif Bar natural energy bars , and Loacker chocolate and wafers .
Shoppers will be able to use Amazon .
co.uk 's delivery options including unlimited free one - day delivery for an annual membership fee of £ 49 with Amazon Prime , and free super saver delivery where each product automatically qualifies for free delivery within the UK .
Customers will be able to shop via their computers or their smart phones .
Alternatively , iPhone and iPod touch users can download the Amazon app .
Grocery orders will be processed in all of Amazon UK's " fulfilment centres " in Milton Keynes , Swansea , Glenrothes , Gourock , Peterborough and Doncaster .
The move is likely to be regarded as a blow to Ocado , which is aiming to persuade investors to buy its shares for between 200 p and 275 p , valuing the firm at £ 1.18 bn despite failing to make a profit in its 10 - year history .
James Leeson , director of grocery at Amazon.co.uk Ltd , said : " Amazon .co.uk 's aim is to be the place where customers can find and discover any product they want to buy online , and with the introduction of this new store there are thousands of household , niche , ethnic and international grocery items , all available at the click of a button .
" With unlimited virtual shelf space customers can choose from a wide variety of products , all of which benefit from free delivery .
We will work tirelessly to increase the selection of grocery items available to be delivered directly to customers ' doors . "
However , the Amazon service does not a " shopping list " facility which allows customers to order the same basic goods every week without typing them in individually , and as yet it is not " scraped " by Mysupermarket .co.uk to compare its prices for a set shopping basket of goods with those of online supermarkets Asda , Tesco , Sainsbury and Ocado .
Amazon , which has 160 million customers worldwide and operates in the US , Canada , Japan , China , France and Germany as well as the UK , has sold groceries in the US since 2006 .
The move to sell groceries in the UK store follows its entrance in the musical instrument market last week .
American compulsive hoarders
For the creators of the Championship Manager series of computer games , see Collyer brothers ( game designers )
Homer Lusk Collyer ( November 6 , 1881 – March 21 , 1947 ) and Langley Wakeman Collyer ( October 3 , 1885 – c. March 9 , 1947 ) , known as the Collyer brothers , [ 2 ] were two American brothers who became infamous for their bizarre natures and compulsive hoarding .
For decades , the two lived in seclusion in their Harlem brownstone at 2078 Fifth Avenue ( at the corner of 128th Street ) where they obsessively collected books , furniture , musical instruments , and myriad other items , with booby traps set up in corridors and doorways to crush intruders .
In March 1947 , both were found dead in their home surrounded by over 140 tons of collected items that they had amassed over several decades . [ 3 ]
Since the 1960s , the site of the former Collyer house has been a pocket park , named for the brothers . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
Family and education [ edit ]
The Collyer brothers were sons of Herman Livingston Collyer ( 1857–1923 ) , a Manhattan gynecologist who worked at Bellevue Hospital , and his first cousin , [ 6 ] Susie Gage Frost Collyer ( 1856–1929 ) , a former opera singer .
The brothers claimed that their ancestors had traveled to America from England on the Fortune , the ship that arrived in Massachusetts a year after the Mayflower in 1621 .
[ 7 ]
The Collyers ' mother was descended from the Livingstons , a New York family with roots going back to the 18th century .
Robert Livingston was the first of the Livingston family to immigrate to America in 1672 — 52 years after the Mayflower . [ 8 ]
In 1880 , Herman and Susie had their first child , a daughter they named Susan .
She died at four months old .
[ 9 ]
The following year , on November 6 , the couple 's first son , Homer Lusk , was born .
In 1885 their second son , Langley Wakeman , was born . [ 6 ]
At the time of Langley 's birth , the couple were living in a tenement while Herman Collyer interned at Bellevue .
As a child , Homer attended PS ( Public School ) 69 .
At the age of 14 , he was accepted to the College of the City of New York as a " sub - freshman " , earning his bachelor 's degree six years later . [ 6 ]
Both Homer and Langley attended Columbia University , which had just relocated to its present - day Morningside Heights campus .
Homer obtained a degree in admiralty law , while Langley studied engineering and chemistry . [ 8 ] [ 10 ]
Langley was also an accomplished concert pianist ; he played professionally for a time and performed at Carnegie Hall . [ 11 ]
Langley was also a layman of the Trinity Church where the family had been parishioners since 1697 . [ 12 ]
In 1909 , Dr. Herman Collyer moved the family into a four - story brownstone in Harlem at 2078 Fifth Avenue .
Dr. Collyer was known to be eccentric and was said to frequently paddle down the East River in a canoe to the City Hospital on Blackwell 's Island , where he occasionally worked , and then to carry the canoe back to his home in Harlem after he came ashore on Manhattan Island . [ 11 ] Around 1919 , Herman Collyer and Susie Collyer separated .
Dr. Collyer moved to a new home at 153 West 77th Street while Susie Collyer stayed in the Harlem brownstone .
Homer and Langley , who had never married or lived on their own , chose to remain with their mother .
Dr. Collyer died in 1923 , leaving his sons all of his possessions , including items from his medical practice , which they brought to their home in Harlem .
Susie Collyer died in 1929 , leaving the brothers all her possessions and the Harlem brownstone . [ 13 ]
Seclusion and hoarding [ edit ]
After their mother 's death , the Collyer brothers continued to live together in the Harlem brownstone they inherited .
For the next four years , the brothers socialized with others and left their home on a regular basis .
Homer continued to practice law while Langley worked as a piano dealer . [ 14 ]
Both also taught Sunday school at the Trinity Church . [ 15 ]
In 1933 , Homer lost his eyesight due to hemorrhages in the back of his eyes .
Langley quit his job to care for his brother and the two began to withdraw from society . [ 14 ]
As time progressed , the brothers became fearful due to changes in the neighborhood ; the largely upper - class area changed dramatically due to the economic effects of the Great Depression .
The brothers were also uncomfortable with the shift in racial demographics , as more African Americans moved into the once - empty apartment houses that were built near a projected subway route . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
When later asked why the two chose to shut themselves off from the world , Langley Collyer replied , " We do n't want to be bothered . " [ 18 ]
As rumors about the brothers ' unconventional lifestyle spread throughout Harlem , crowds began to congregate outside their home .
The attention caused the brothers ' fears to increase along with their eccentricities .
After teenagers threw rocks at their windows , they boarded them up and wired the doors shut . [ 14 ] [ 19 ]
After unfounded rumors spread throughout the neighborhood that the brothers ' home contained valuables and large sums of money , several people attempted to rob the home .
In an attempt to exclude burglars , Langley used his engineering skills to construct booby traps and tunnels among the collection of items and trash that filled the house . [ 6 ] [ 20 ]
The house soon became a maze of boxes , complicated tunnel systems consisting of junk and trash rigged with trip wires .
Homer and Langley Collyer lived in " nests " created amongst the debris that was piled to the ceiling . [ 18 ]
Langley spent the majority of his time tinkering with various inventions , such as a device to vacuum the inside of pianos and a Model T Ford adapted to generate electricity .
He also cared for his brother Homer .
Langley later told a reporter that he fed and bathed his brother , read him classic literature , as he could no longer see , and played piano sonatas for him . [ 18 ]
He also tended to Homer 's health and was determined to cure his brother 's physical ailments through " diet and rest " . [ 14 ]
Langley concocted a diet for his brother consisting of one hundred oranges a week , black bread , and peanut butter , claiming that this regimen was curing Homer 's blindness . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
After Homer became paralyzed due to inflammatory rheumatism , he refused to seek professional medical treatment , because both brothers distrusted doctors .
The brothers feared that if Homer sought medical attention , doctors would cut his optic nerve , leaving him permanently blind , and give him drugs that would hasten his death .
Langley Collyer later told a reporter , " You must remember that we are the sons of a doctor .
We have a medical library of 15,000 books in the house .
We decided we would not call in any doctors .
You see , we knew too much about medicine . " [ 14 ]
Langley began venturing out of the house only after midnight and would walk miles all over the city to get food , sometimes going as far as Williamsburg , Brooklyn to buy as little as a loaf of bread .
He would also pick food out of the garbage and collect food that was going to be thrown out by grocers and butchers to bring back to his brother Homer . [ 23 ]
By the early 1930s , the Collyer brothers ' brownstone had fallen into disrepair .
Their telephone was disconnected in 1937 and was never reconnected , as the brothers said they had no one to talk to .
Because the brothers failed to pay their bills , the electricity , water , and gas were turned off in 1938 .
[6 ]
They took to warming the large house using only a small kerosene heater .
For a time , Langley attempted to generate electricity by means of a car engine .
Langley would fetch their water from a pump in a nearby park . [ 22 ]
Their only link to the outside world was via a crystal radio that Langley made . [ 14 ] [ 20 ]
Neighbors and shopkeepers in the area described Langley Collyer as a generally polite and rational man , but added that he was " crazy " . [ 24 ]
A reporter who interviewed Langley in 1942 described him as a " soft - spoken old gentleman with a liking for privacy " who spoke in a " low , polite and cultivated voice " . [ 14 ]
His appearance was disheveled ; he sported a droopy mustache , wore a 1910 boating cap and his tattered clothes were held together by pins . [ 24 ]
While Langley Collyer ventured out of the home and occasionally interacted with other people , Homer had scarcely been seen or heard from since he went blind and retreated from the world in 1933 .
Langley was fiercely protective of Homer and would not allow anyone to see or speak to him .
When he caught neighbors attempting to peek into their windows from a neighboring home , Langley bought the property for $ 7,500 cash .
When a small fire broke out in the home in 1941 , Langley refused to let firemen who extinguished the fire see or speak to his brother . [ 19 ]
Public scrutiny [ edit ]
In 1932 , shortly before Homer Collyer went blind , he purchased the property across the street from their house at 2077 Fifth Avenue , with the intent of developing it by putting up an apartment building , but after the onset of his blindness , any plans of profit from the real estate venture ended .
[ 25 ]
Since the Collyer brothers never paid any of their bills and stopped paying income taxes in 1931 , the property was repossessed by the City of New York in 1943 to pay the $ 1,900 in back income taxes that the Collyers owed the city . [ 26 ]
Langley protested the repossession of their property , saying that since they had no income , they should not have to pay income taxes . [ 27 ]
While rumors and legends abounded in Harlem about the brothers , [ 28 ] they came to wider attention when , in 1938 , a story about their refusal to sell their home to a real estate agent for $ 125,000 appeared in The New York Times . [ 19 ]
The Times repeated information about the brothers ' hoarding and also repeated neighborhood rumors that the brothers lived in some sort of " Orientalist splendor " and were sitting on vast piles of cash , afraid to deposit it in a bank . [ 29 ]
Neither rumor was true ; the brothers were certainly not insolvent , although eventually they would have been , since neither of them had worked for decades .
After The New York Times story ran , Helen Worden , a reporter from New York World - Telegram , became interested in the brothers and interviewed Langley Collyer ( Worden would release a book about the brothers in 1954 ) .
Langley told Worden that he stopped playing piano professionally after performing at Carnegie Hall , because " Paderewski followed me .
He got better notices than I .
What was the use of going on ? "
Langley explained that he dressed in shabby clothing , because " [ T ] hey would rob me if I did n't " . [ 13 ]
Langley Collyer arguing with police officers during the removal of his gas meters , 1939
The Collyer brothers made the news again when , in 1939 , workers from Consolidated Edison attempted to force their way into the house to remove two gas meters that had been shut off in 1928 , and were met with hostility from the reclusive brothers . [ 28 ]
The incident , publicized in the local press , reportedly drew a crowd of a thousand curious onlookers and was one of the few times Homer was seen to venture outside their apartment . [ 13 ]
The brothers drew media attention again in August 1942 when the Bowery Savings Bank threatened to evict the Collyers for failing to pay their mortgage for three years . [ 30 ]
That same year , New York Herald Tribune reporter Herbert Clyde Lewis interviewed Langley .
In response to a query about the bundles of newspapers that were kept in the brothers ' home , Langley replied , " I am saving newspapers for Homer , so that when he regains his sight he can catch up on the news . " [ 31 ]
In November 1942 , the Bowery Savings Bank began eviction procedures and sent a cleanup crew to the home .
Langley began yelling at the workers , prompting the neighbors to summon the police .
When the police attempted to force their way into the home by smashing down the front door , they were stymied by a sheer wall of junk piled from floor to ceiling .
They found Langley Collyer in a clearing he had made in the middle of the debris . [ 18 ]
Without comment , Langley made out a check for $ 6,700 ( 2019 equivalent of $ 104,839 ) [ 32 ] , paying off the mortgage in full in a single payment . [ 33 ]
He then ordered everyone off the premises , and withdrew from outside scrutiny once more , emerging only at night when he wanted to file criminal complaints against intruders , get food , or collect items that piqued his interest . [ 18 ]
Homer Collyer 's death [ edit ]
View of interior
On March 21 , 1947 , an anonymous tipster who identified himself only as " Charles Smith " phoned the 122nd Police Precinct and insisted there was a dead body in the house . [ 24 ] [ 34 ]
The caller claimed that the smell of decomposition was emanating from the house . [ 22 ]
As the police were used to calls from neighbors about the Collyer brothers ' home , a patrol officer was dispatched .
The responding officer initially had a difficult time getting into the house .
There was no doorbell or telephone and the doors were locked ; and though the basement windows were broken , they were protected by iron grillwork .
[ 21 ]
An emergency squad of seven men eventually had no choice but to begin pulling out all of the junk that was blocking their way and throwing it out onto the street below .
The brownstone 's foyer was packed solid by a wall of old newspapers , folding beds and chairs , half a sewing machine , boxes , parts of a wine press , and numerous other pieces of junk .
A patrolman finally broke in through a window into a second - story bedroom .
Behind this window lay , among other things , more packages and newspaper bundles , empty cardboard boxes lashed together with rope , the frame of a baby carriage , a rake , and old umbrellas tied together .
After five hours of digging , Homer Collyer 's body was found in an alcove surrounded by filled boxes and newspapers that were piled to the ceiling . [ 20 ]
Homer was wearing a tattered blue - and - white bathrobe , his matted , grey hair reached his shoulders , and his head was resting on his knees . [ 35 ]
The medical examiner confirmed Homer 's identity and said that the elder brother had been dead for approximately ten hours . [ 35 ]
According to the medical examiner , Homer died from starvation and heart disease . [ 36 ]
Police initially suspected that Langley Collyer was the man who phoned in the anonymous tip regarding his brother 's death and theorized that he fled the house before police arrived .
It was later discovered that , in fact , a neighbor had called police based on a rumor he had heard . [ 23 ]
A police officer was posted outside the home to wait for Langley , but he never arrived . [ 20 ]
Police began to suspect that Langley was dead when he failed to attend Homer 's funeral , held on April 1 . [ 23 ] [ 37 ]
Langley Collyer 's discovery [ edit ]
After the discovery of Homer Collyer 's body , rumors began circulating that Langley had been seen aboard a bus heading for Atlantic City .
A manhunt along the New Jersey shore turned up nothing .
Reports of Langley sightings led police to a total of nine states . [ 38 ]
The police continued searching the house , removing 3,000 books , several outdated phone books , a horse 's jawbone , a Steinway piano , an early X - ray machine , and more bundles of newspapers . [ 39 ]
More than nineteen tons of junk were removed from the ground floor of the brownstone .
The police continued to clear away the brothers ' stockpile for another week , removing another eighty - four tons of trash and junk from the house .
Although a good deal of the junk came from their father 's medical practice , a considerable portion was discarded items collected by Langley over the years .
Approximately 2,000 people stood outside the home to watch the clean - up effort . [ 13 ]
On April 8 , 1947 , a workman found the body of Langley Collyer ten feet from where Homer had died . [ 40 ]
Langley was found in a two - foot ( 60 cm ) wide tunnel lined with rusty bed springs and a chest of drawers .
His decomposing body , which was the actual source of the smell reported by the anonymous tipster , had been partially eaten by rats [ 22 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] and was covered by a suitcase , bundles of newspapers and three metal bread boxes . [ 40 ]
The medical examiner determined that Langley had died around March 9 . [ 36 ]
Police theorized that Langley was crawling through the tunnel to take food to his paralyzed brother when he inadvertently tripped a booby trap he had created and was crushed by debris . [ 43 ]
His death was attributed to asphyxiation . [ 36 ]
Both brothers were buried next to their parents in unmarked graves at Cypress Hills Cemetery , Brooklyn . [ 4 ] [ 44 ]
House contents [ edit ]
Police and workmen removed approximately 120 tons of debris and junk from the Collyer brownstone . [ 40 ]
Items were removed from the house such as baby carriages , a doll carriage , rusted bicycles , old food , potato peelers , a collection of guns , glass chandeliers , bowling balls , camera equipment , the folding top of a horse - drawn carriage , a sawhorse , three body forms , painted portraits , photos of pin-up girls from the early 1900s , plaster busts , Mrs. Collyer 's hope chests , rusty bed springs , the kerosene stove , a child 's chair ( the brothers were lifelong bachelors and childless ) , more than 25,000 books ( including thousands about medicine and engineering and more than 2,500 on law ) , human organs pickled in jars , [ 22 ] eight live cats , the chassis of the old Model T with which Langley had been tinkering , tapestries , hundreds of yards of unused silks and other fabrics , clocks , fourteen pianos ( both grand and upright ) , [ 40 ] a clavichord , two organs , banjos , violins , bugles , accordions , a gramophone and records , and countless bundles of newspapers and magazines , some of them decades old , and thousands of bottles and tin cans and a great deal of garbage . [ 24 ] [ 45 ]
Near the spot where Homer had died , police also found 34 bank account passbooks , with a total of $ 3,007 ( about $ 39,425 as of 2020 ) . [ 32 ] [ 46 ]
Some of the more unusual items found in the home were exhibited at Hubert 's Dime Museum , where they were featured alongside Human Marvels and sideshow performers .
The centerpiece of this display was the chair in which Homer Collyer had died .
The Collyer chair passed into the hands of private collectors upon being removed from public exhibit in 1956 .
The house , having long gone without maintenance , was decaying : the roof leaked and some walls had caved in , showering bricks and mortar on the rooms below .
The house was deemed " unsafe and [ a ] fire hazard " in July 1947 and was razed later that month . [ 47 ] [ 48 ]
Most of the items found in the Collyer brothers ' house were deemed worthless and were disposed of .
The salvageable items fetched less than $ 2,000 at auction ; [ 48 ] the cumulative estate of the Collyer brothers was valued at $ 91,000 ( equivalent to $ 1,193,094 in 2019 [ 32 ] ) , of which $ 20,000 worth was personal property ( jewelry , cash , securities , and the like ) . [ 49 ]
Fifty - six people , mostly first and second cousins , made claims for the estate .
A Pittsburgh woman named Ella Davis claimed to be the long lost sister of the Collyers . [ 50 ]
Davis ' claim was dismissed after she failed to provide a birth certificate to prove her identity ( years earlier , Davis claimed she was the widow of Peter Liebach , another wealthy recluse , from Pittsburgh , who was found murdered in 1937 ) .
[ 51 ]
In October 1952 , the New York County court decided that twenty - three of the claimants were to split the estate equally . [ 50 ]
In popular culture [ edit ]
A Collyer 's Mansion ( also Collyer Mansion or just Collyer ) is a modern firefighting term for a dwelling of hoarders that is so filled with trash and debris it becomes a serious danger to the occupants and emergency responders . [ 52 ]
The Collyer brothers ' story was first directly fictionalized by Marcia Davenport in her novel My Brother 's Keeper ( Scribners , 1954 ) , reprinted as a Popular Library paperback . [ 53 ]
In the 1955 – 1956 " Classic 39 " season of The Honeymooners ( " The Worry Wart " ) , affable neighbor Ed Norton , chiding Ralph Kramden for his thriftiness , quips " Congratulations on that 93 cent gas bill , Ralph ...
You broke the all - time low gas bill record , set by the Collyer Brothers in 1931 ! "
A 1973 episode of the television show The Streets of San Francisco titled " The House on Hyde Street " was inspired by the Collyers . [ 54 ]
The 1995 movie Unstrung Heroes features two uncles whose lifestyle and apartment are a direct homage to the Collyer brothers .
The film was based on a 1991 memoir by Franz Lidz , who in 2003 published Ghosty Men : The Strange but True Story of the Collyer Brothers , New York 's Greatest Hoarders .
Ghosty Men also chronicles the parallel life of Arthur Lidz , the hermit uncle of Unstrung Heroes , who grew up near the Collyer mansion and was inspired by the brothers . [ 2 ]
In the sitcom Frasier episode " Dinner Party " , the eponymous character and his brother are compared to the Collyer brothers by their father .
In September 2009 , Random House published E. L. Doctorow 's Homer & Langley , a work of historical fiction that speculates on the brothers ' inner lives . [ 55 ]
Taking considerable historical liberties , the novel extends their lifespans into the late 1970s and switches the brothers ' birth order . [ 56 ]
The brothers are also the inspiration behind Richard Greenberg 's play The Dazzle which played in London to excellent reviews in the winter of 2015 – 16 .
Andrew Scott and David Dawson played Langley and Homer respectively , in the production by Emily Dobbs , which was staged at the former site of the Central Saint Martins School of Art on Charing Cross Road . [ 57 ]
They were the inspiration for a Law & Order : Special Victims Unit episode called " Alta Kockers " .
Wallace Shawn and Judd Hirsch played the brothers . [ 58 ]
They were the inspiration in the TV series 9 - 1 - 1 Season 1 Episode 9 titled " Trapped " , in which two brothers ( one of which is blind ) are trapped in their own home which is filled to the ceiling with stuff as a result of being extreme hoarders .
The brothers had set up an elaborate system of tunnels to get around and booby traps to catch anyone trying to get in .
The story differs in this case as the firefighters are eventually able to navigate through the tunnels and booby traps and save the brothers .
Episode 3 , season 3 of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel has Abe and Rose Weissman discussing the Collyer Brothers as they contemplate where to move after losing their apartment .

I never thought I would see the day when a SyFy original movie would please me more than the Declan O’Brien helmed Rock Monster , but that ’s exactly what happened today when I spied the Roger Corman produced Sharktopus .
How could you possibly not want to watch a move where a shark is combined with an octopus that can spit ink and tear you apart with razor sharp teeth .
If that is n’t enough for you , there ’s a ridiculous “ plot ” and I use the word “ plot ” lightly with a ton of girls wearing pretty much nothing .
For the ladies there ’s also a bunch of hunky guys … unfortunately both sexes get equally torn apart .
Here ’s the official trailer :
So what do you think ?
Sure it ’s not the next Jaws , but I can already see the drinking games this movie is going to spur at college campuses around the country .
Thank you SyFy for not taking yourself serious in any way on this one .

Thai government extends emergency rule
By John Roberts
8 July 2010
The government of Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva this week extended emergency rule in Bangkok and 18 other provinces for a further three months .
The emergency decree had been due to expire yesterday .
The move indicates that seven weeks after the May 19 military crackdown on the Bangkok protests organised by the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) , the political situation remains tense .
Government and security forces operations are continuing against the protesters and any sign of anti-government unrest .
The UDD leaders , closely associated with exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and the Puea Thai party , had demanded the government ’s resignation and new elections .
The emergency measures provide draconian powers to the military and police , including detention for up to 30 days without legal redress .
The decree was first imposed in Bangkok and 23 of Thailand ’s 76 provinces on April 7 , after a month of UDD demonstrations .
It will remain in force in the capital and five other provinces in the Central Region , three provinces in the North and 10 provinces in the Northeast .
Five provinces have had the decree lifted .
The cabinet deemed that there remained “ situations that require close monitoring and surveillance ” , according to the prime minister ’s office spokesman Ongart Klampaiboon .
The degree of “ monitoring ” can be gauged from the fact that 200 companies of soldiers are still deployed in Bangkok the government ’s own Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation ( CRES ) reports .
CRES , run by the military and chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban , from Abhisit ’s Democratic Party , had recommended that the emergency be maintained in Bangkok and all 23 provinces .
To support its call , it prepared a list of dozens of grenade attacks and other acts of sabotage that have occurred in Thailand since the May 19 crackdown .
A week before Tuesday ’s cabinet decision there was a bomb attack on the Bangkok offices of the Bumjaithai Party , a partner in the ruling coalition that is made up of defectors from the People Power Party ( PPP ) , the predecessor of the pro-Thaksin Puea Thai .
The bombing occurred on the same day as thousands of Red Shirts , as the UDD supporters are known , gathered for the cremation of former army general and UDD member Khattiya Sawatdipol .
He died after being shot by a sniper while inside the UDD protest site in Bangkok ’s Ratchaprasong district .
He was among 90 killed and 1,800 injured during the three months of UDD protests , most of whom were unarmed demonstrators .
It is not clear who carried out the Bumjaithai attack .
The military itself has a long record of such provocations .
The subsequent arrest of suspects associated with the UDD has been used to promote the claim that the government and military are hunting down “ terrorists ” .
Puea
Thai officials immediately claimed that this incident and others were the government ’s way of justifying the continuation of emergency rule .
Abhisit backed the lifting of the emergency in five provinces , reflecting pressures on the government to end the measures altogether .
On July 4 Federation of Thai Industries chairman Payungsak Chartsutipol called for an end to emergency rule .
He said it was detrimental to private sector confidence and was making investors think twice about further commitments .
Thai Chamber of Commerce Vice Chairman Phongsak Assakul said the tourism industry would be hard hit if the measures were maintained .
Reflecting the concerns of international business , the Brussels - based International Crisis Group has called for the lifting of emergency rule as a means to restore stability and achieve the government ’s stated aim of “ national reconciliation ” .
South East Asia project director Jim Della - Giacoma warned : “ There is little prospect that genuine reconciliation will succeed when the offer comes from the same government directly responsible for the recent deadly crackdown on the red shirts and their ongoing repression . ”
On June 28 , the London - based Financial Times warned of simmering discontent in rural central Thailand because of the government ’s repression and worsening social inequality .
“ A veneer of calm may have returned to Thailand after the recent violent protests , but out among the dusty villages of the opposition heartland , a deep well of resentment seethes and bubbles , threatening a new eruption , ” Tim Johnston reported from the village of Baan Laan .
The government , however , is continuing its crackdown .
Far from agreeing to new elections , government spokesman have expressed public order concerns over a July 25 Bangkok by - election in which Puea Thai is standing one of the UDD leaders currently held on terrorism charges .
The Abhisit coalition government was installed — backed by the military , the royal court and the traditional establishment — in December 2008 following years of tumultuous faction fights within the Thai ruling elite .
These conflicts have remained unresolved despite the ousting of Thaksin by a military coup in 2006 .
The feuding between the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps of the ruling class stem from long - standing differences over economic policy , bound up with the impact of globalised production .
In the wake of the 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis , a previous Democrat Party government was defeated in an electoral landslide after it attempted to impose the “ open market ” and austerity demands of the International Monetary Fund .
The traditional elites initially backed Thaksin , a billionaire business tycoon , when he came to office in 2001 , but turned on him when he reneged on his promise to protect Thai businesses , and instead continued to open up segments of the economy to overseas investors .
The military junta that ousted Thaksin drew up a new constitution and held national elections in late 2007 , but despite 14 months of military rule the pro-Thaksin PPP won the most seats and formed the government .
Months of “ yellow shirt ” protests followed by the anti-Thaksin Peoples Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , tacitly backed by the army and the monarchy .
After the demonstrations culminated in the occupation of Bangkok ’s two airports , the pro-Thaksin government was ousted by a court decision that banned the PPP over alleged electoral law violations .
In an anti-democratic takeover , Abhisit formed a coalition with PPP partners and PPP defectors , who had been pressured to join with the Democrats by the military .
The turmoil also expressed , in confused forms , a growing social divide .
The Thaksin camp had won electoral support among the rural population of the north and northeast of the country .
Before the 2006 coup , the Thaksin government had introduced stimulus packages that included handouts to the rural masses in the form of cheap health care and village development fund loans .
Long neglected by the Bangkok - based elite and left out of Thailand ’s export industry based boom , sections of the farming and rural poor came to view the corrupt billionaire as their political champion .
The UDD was able to mobilise this support to challenge the Abhisit coalition .
However during the three months of the recent UDD protests the rural masses began to voice their own demands for social equality .
Poor urban dwellers and sections of workers also began to join the protests , threatening to trigger a social movement that went far beyond the limited aim of the UDD leaders for a new election and the return of a Puea Thai government .
As the June 28 Financial Times report warns , the resentment felt against the political establishment has proved to be very deep .
The newspaper also pointed to the worsening social inequality in Bangkok .
It cited a recent paper by Supavud Saichua of Phatra Securities in Bangkok showing the growth of a large low - wage workforce .
The paper found that although employment in poorly - paid sectors , including retail , hotels , restaurants and construction , has grown over the last decade from 24 to 29 percent of the total workforce , corresponding wages have declined from 11.8 to 10.6 percent of total wages .
Abhisit has made unsuccessful attempts to appease the rural and urban poor by extending free bus and train rides and gas subsidies .
A mocking article in the Bangkok Post on July 1 entitled “ Populist steps hardly help ” derides the government ’s attempts and accuses it of “ embracing populist policies it once held in contempt ” .
It is this social discontent that is the underlying target of emergency rule .
The issuing of an arrest warrant for Thaksin on terrorist charges and the laying of similar charges against 11 UDD leaders has created the conditions for a vicious witch hunt .
There are reports of wider numbers of detentions .
Sunai Phasuk , a researcher for the US based Human Rights Watch , told the Associated Press : “ A large number of protestors have been detained but no one knows the exact figures , or even their whereabouts . ”
Another researcher warned of parallels to the 1992 military coup .
Kritaya Archavanitkul , who authored a study “ Missing , Dead and Injured in the 1992 Political Crackdown , ” said conditions were more difficult than 18 years ago because the emergency decree obstructed fact - finding .
She told the Nation : “ We just have a blurred picture of how people died , got injured and disappeared . ”
She added that 2,030 people were still missing from May 1992 .

Background
Way back when I worked at Symantec , my friend Nick wrote a blog that caused a little bit of trouble for us : Attack of the Facebook Snatchers .
I was blog editor at the time , and I went through the usual sign off process and , eventually , published it .
Facebook was none too happy , but we fought for it and , in the end , we got to leave the blog up in its original form .
Why do I bring this up ?
Well last week @FSLabsAdvisor wrote an interesting Tweet : it turns out , by heading to https://www.facebook.com/directory, you can get a list of every searchable user on all of Facebook !
My first idea was simple : spider the lists , generate first - initial - last - name ( and similar ) lists , then hand them over to @ Ithilgore to use in Nmap 's awesome new bruteforce tool he 's working on , Ncrack .
But as I thought more about it , and talked to other people , I realized that this is a scary privacy issue .
I can find the name of pretty much every person on Facebook .
Facebook helpfully informs you that " [ a ] nyone can opt out of appearing here by changing their Search privacy settings " -- but that does n't help much anymore considering I already have them all ( and you will too , when you download the torrent ) .
Suckers !
Once I have the name and URL of a user , I can view , by default , their picture , friends , information about them , and some other details .
If the user has set their privacy higher , at the very least I can view their name and picture .
So , if any searchable user has friends that are non-searchable , those friends just opted into being searched , like it or not !
Oops :)
The lists
Which brings me to the next topic : the list !
I wrote a quick Ruby script ( which has since become a more involved Nmap Script that I have n't used for harvesting yet ) that I used to download the full directory .
I should warn you that it is n't exactly the most user friendly interface -- I wrote it for myself , primarily , I 'm only linking to it for reference .
I do n't really suggest you try to recreate my spidering .
It 's a waste of several hundred gigs of bandwidth .
The results were spectacular .
171 million names ( 100 million unique ) .
My original plan was to use this list to generate a list of the top usernames ( based on first initial last name ) :
129369 jsmith 79365 ssmith 77713 skhan 75561 msmith 74575 skumar 72467 csmith 71791 asmith 67786 jjohnson 66693 dsmith 66431 akhan
Or first name last initial :
100225 johns 97676 johnm 97310 michaelm 93386 michaels 88978 davids 85481 michaelb 84824 davidm 82677 davidb 81500 johnb 77800 michaelc
Or even the top usernames based on first name dot last name ( sorry , I can't link this one due to bandwidth concerns ; but it 's included in the torrent ) :

So , those are the top 10 lists .
But I 'll bet you want everything !
The Torrent
But it occurred to me that this is public information that Facebook puts out , I 'm assuming for search engines or whatever , and that it would n't be right for me to keep it private .
Why waste Facebook 's bandwidth and make everybody scrape it , right ?
So , I present you with : a torrent !
If you have n't download it , download it now !
And seed it for as long as you can .
This torrent contains :
The URL of every searchable Facebook user 's profile
The name of every searchable Facebook user , both unique and by count ( perfect for post - processing , datamining , etc )
Processed lists , including first names with count , last names with count , potential usernames with count , etc
The programs I used to generate everything
So , there you have it : lots of awesome data from Facebook .
Now , I just have to find one more problem with Facebook so I can write " Revenge of the Facebook Snatchers " and complete the trilogy .
Any suggestions ? >:-)
Limitations
So far , I have only indexed the searchable users , not their friends .
Getting their friends will be significantly more data to process , and I do n't have those capabilities right now .
I 'd like to tackle that in the future , though , so if anybody has any bandwidth they 'd like to donate , all I need is an ssh account and Nmap installed .
An additional limitation is that these are only users whose first characters are from the latin charset .
I plan to add non-Latin names in future releases .
Mass lawsuits against alleged file - sharers , such as those from the US Copyright Group and lawyers ACS : Law and Gallant MacMillan in the UK , are generally accepted to have been generated from evidence gathered from big public BitTorrent sites .
Now it appears that at least one other firm has jumped on the bandwagon , this time targeting a large private tracker .
Mass lawsuits against alleged file - sharers are spreading like a plague of locusts from Europe over to the United States .
By now , their action is clear .
Gather IP address evidence against as many alleged file - sharers as possible and take legal action in order to discover their names and addresses .
Once those details are learned , pressure the recipient by post with threatening financial ruination unless an early settlement of a few hundred dollars up to a couple of thousand is forthcoming .
While lawyers in Germany and the UK ( ACS : Law , Davenport Lyons and now Gallant MacMillan ) have been doing most of the pioneering work for this business model , it is the US Copyright Group and its pursuit of Hurt Locker file - sharers that has grabbed most of the headlines .
What all these lawyers have in common , is that none of them reveal where their evidence has been gathered from and since no cases have ever gone to court – that ’s none , zero , nada – then no one has ever forced them to .
From our dealings with specific and verified UK cases and from the scale of the US operation , it is fairly clear that the IP addresses used have been collated from public trackers .
Now it appears that adult movie company Lucas Entertainment have bucked the trend .
“ You only have to conduct a quick Google search to see the rampant piracy all over the internet , ” says Lucas Entertainment President / CEO Michael Lucas .
“ I am always surprised that users would deal with torrent sites and all the hassle that requires instead of streaming through LucasEntertainment.com , but I guess there are many people out there who have endless patience .
We appreciate our fans wherever they are but business is business and we have to make some money off our content . ”
To this end , not only has the company announced the filing of a lawsuit in Texas Northern District Court on July 19 which targets 65 defendants , but they have also uniquely revealed that they tracked the ‘ John Does ’ on a private BitTorrent tracker .
Although fairly niche when compared to the wide appeal of say , The Pirate Bay , Gay - Torrents.net ( GT ) is still a very big tracker .
In existence since 2001 with more than 235,000 members , its users have now become the latest target in these lucrative ‘ pay or else ’ schemes .
Copyright owners and lawyers want money from file - sharers , no matter where they live or what material they choose to obtain .
And Lucas Entertainment are no different , although they are yet to announce exactly how much money they want .
This case should be of unique and special interest to all private tracker users because it raises some very interesting questions .
GT , like all private sites , is a members only venue .
This means that either Mr Lucas in person ( or potentially one of his agents ) is an active member of GT and must have actively participated in swarms .
Of course , this is true of public trackers too , but private trackers keep records – lots of them – so discovering the account connected with that can prove a trivial process .
If it ’s discovered that the account in question has been uploading , the litigation waters could get muddied significantly .
In regular cases against file - sharers only anti-piracy groups carry evidence .
Evidence on private trackers cuts both ways .
TorrentFreak spoke with an admin at GT who told us that they “ would be somewhat displeased with any Member who sought to make a profit or take legal advantage of his torrenting activities via GT . ”
That said , we are told that other GT members are indeed connected with the movie industry .
“ Some GT Members are heavily involved in the same industry as Mr Lucas and also participate in filesharing because it is recognised that such activities are to their mutual benefit as movie producer , consumer and , in full agreement with GT and with our collaboration , as free advertiser and distributor , ” Torrent Freak was told .
“ The latter agreement would include a term that we advertise their new title and ban new productions for a specific period of time following release in order to encourage sales .
Rather strangely some producers such as Lucas Entertainment appear to prefer a more litigious route rather than one of mutual cooperation , ” explained a GT admin .
Nevertheless , more formal agreements aside , GT appears to be a somewhat considerate tracker .
“ As a general courtesy to ALL studios ( including our producer - Membership and their future uploads ) , we already impose a blanket ban on ALL pre-release titles regardless of Membership with GT .
Our aim is to work in cooperation with the industry , but if the recent stories of further litigation are well - founded it appears some poorly advised studios stubbornly choose to view our Membership as common thieves rather than with respect as potential customers , and as free advertisers and distributors , ” the admin concludes .
GT told TorrentFreak that they lay the blame for these lawsuits firmly at the door of outdated copyright laws applied to 21st century life , business and technology .
“ Quite simply , governments and businesses worldwide need to catch up but we fear ACTA ( the impending Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ) will apply 20th century principles and shall deter innovation and quash new business models otherwise fit for modern societies . ”
In the meantime copyright holders are making the best of it .
Show them the money .
An undersea cable that brought high - speed net access to East Africa for the first time has been hit by a fault , knocking many in the region offline .
The owners of the Seacom cable said the exact cause of the fault was " still being investigated " , but was thought to originate off the Kenyan coast .
The cable , finished in 2009 , connects South Africa , Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda and Mozambique to Europe and Asia .
Seacom said it has " initiated emergency repairs " , which may take eight days .
" This unexpected failure affects traffic towards both India and Europe .
Traffic within Africa is not affected , " it said in a statement .
Unpredictable time
The firm said it had been working since the fault was first reported on the 5 July to find alternative methods to route internet traffic , including alternative cables .
" These restoration solutions are now being actively implemented . "
When the cable was completed in July 2009 , it promised to bring down the cost of a connection and boost internet access across the region .
However , experts say that costs are still out of the reach of many people who live in the region .
The fault has so far mostly affected home users , as many businesses in the region have back - up plans for such faults .
It is the second major outage the cable has experienced since it went live .
Outages of this kind happen periodically .
A cable cut in the Mediterranean in 2008 temporarily disrupted up to 70 % of internet traffic to Egypt and 60 % to India .
The company has said a ship will be dispatched to repair the cable .
" Whilst the repair process itself will only take a few hours , the overall process may last a minimum of six to eight days , " it said .
" The actual duration is unpredictable due to external factors such as transit time of the ship , weather conditions and time to locate the cable .
For this reason , the estimated duration of this repair remains uncertain . "
The news comes , as another cable linking Africa to Europe was switched on .
The Main One cable links Western Europe with Ghana and Nigeria .
This is the account of the man who rescued the driver of a Cadillac Escalade from a sinkhole shortly before 8 p.m. at N. Oakland and E. North Aves . :
***
Mark Pawlik , 46 , was walking across the North Ave. bridge and talking to his friend on the phone when he noticed a traffic light had sunk into the ground .
Just the red , yellow and green lights were above street level .
He told his friend he'd call him back .
It was still pouring rain , but he wanted to stop and take a picture .
A moment later a man driving a black Escalade pulled up to the intersection at North and Oakland avenues , going east on North Ave .
" The Escalade just went wham ! "
Pawlik said .
" Everything went down .
The power line went like ' pow ' and then I think it was sewer water was just pouring into the hole . "
Pawlik leaned over the edge of the sinkhole , which was then about 15 feet by 15 feet .
" I said , ' Hey , man , are you OK , are you OK ? ' "
Pawlik said the man kept saying , " What happened ?
What just happened ? "
The driver pulled himself onto the hood and then fell down into the hole .
He pulled himself back up onto the hood , and Pawlik took his hand and then his belt loop to get him out of the hole .
He said he was the only person in the car .
By that time , several people had gathered around the edge of the hole .
Pawlik could see that the ground had given way beneath the asphalt and yelled at people to get back .
Pawlik said he and several others tried to reach 911 but got busy signals , so a few people flagged down a city bus and asked the driver to call in the emergency .
Police arrived and put emergency tape up , and an ambulance took the driver of the Escalade away .
Pawlik , who owns a towing company , said the hole was about 20 feet deep .
***
At a 9:45 p.m. news conference , Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said crews were still on the scene with the Escalade , which was still running because it had been filled with gas just before the incident .

The dark matter experiment could relocate to a deeper site in Canada 's SNOLAB facility
Scientists are looking to relocate an underground experiment searching for dark matter to an even deeper site .
Cosmic rays striking the Earth could completely mask the rare dark matter events sought by the experiment .
Team members want to cut out as much of this cosmic ray interference as possible , even if it means moving the experiment 2 km below ground .
This could help them positively identify the particles thought to make up dark matter .
Discovering WIMPs is a big deal and you 've got to be sure you 're looking at the right thing Dr Marek Kos , Syracuse University
Dr Marek Kos , who is a team member on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search II ( CDMSII ) project , outlined details at the International Conference on High Energy Physics ( ICHEP ) in Paris .
He said the experiment could be relocated from a mine in Minnesota to a deeper facility in Ontario , Canada .
The matter we can see makes up just 17 % of matter in the Universe ; the remaining 83 % is " dark " , meaning it does not reflect or emit detectable light .
The existence of dark matter has been inferred through the gravitational pull it exerts on luminous galaxies and stars .
Though scientists have no idea what it consists of , one popular theory is that dark matter is made up of WIMPs ( Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ) .
Supporters of the idea believe a large number of WIMPS pass through the Earth every second .
But , because they interact only very weakly with normal matter , detecting them is difficult .
Experiments such as CDMSII measure large numbers of particle interactions in their detectors in the hope of spotting one caused by a WIMP .
CDMSII operates at extremely low temperatures and detects the energy released when particles hit atoms in germanium and silicon crystals within the detectors .
Mystery events
CDMSII is currently housed at the Soudan mine in Minnesota .
The experiment resides on the 27th level - some 2,341 ft below the surface .
The original experiment was located in a tunnel on the Stanford University campus in California .
Dr Kos commented : " If we have another successful run at Soudan , we 're planning to go even deeper , possibly - to the SNOLAB in Sudbury , Ontario , in Canada .
" It is at 6,000 m water equivalent - a figure that 's used to compare it to other experiments - but it 's about 2 km underground . "
Image caption Improved detectors should boost the chances of detecting WIMPs from space
Going this deep would help reduce the background signals from cosmic ray muon particles .
This effect can only be reduced by moving deeper underground .
Last year , team members made headlines when they reported the detection of two signals which could have come from dark matter particles .
However , writing in the American journal Science , they also reported that the statistical likelihood these were due to WIMPs was low .
Dr Kos , from Syracuse University in the US , told BBC News : " We were critical of those events when we saw them .
Discovering WIMPs is a big deal and you 've got to be sure you 're looking at the right thing . "
Bigger and better
Scientists are in the process of installing improved detection equipment at the Soudan mine .
" We 're fabricating bigger detectors and some of those are already underground and operational , " said Dr Kos .
These will help exclude false positive signals .
The detectors pick up two types of particle interactions : electron recoils and nuclear recoils .
Image caption Nasa 's Fermi satellite has seen no evidence yet for dark matter collisions
WIMPs hitting the detectors are expected to produce nuclear recoils .
But certain electron recoils can look like nuclear recoils - these are known as " surface events " .
The new detectors are designed to be much better at distinguishing WIMPs from surface events .
Dr Kos said team members were pushing for the new detection equipment to be fully installed by the Autumn , but that there was as yet no firm timescale .
Meanwhile , several other experiments are joining international efforts to hunt for signals from these particles .
One of these is the Large Underground Xenon ( Lux ) experiment .
Like CDMS , this aims to make a direct detection of WIMP particles , but uses different technology .
It is being housed underground at the Homestake mine in South Dakota , US .
Meanwhile , Nasa 's Fermi Space Telescope is taking a different approach to try to pin down dark matter .
It will look for evidence of dark matter " annihilations " in space .
These annihilations are thought to occur when two WIMPs collide , generating gamma- rays which can be picked up by detectors such as those on board Fermi .
However , speaking at ICHEP , Dr Robert Johnson said team members had found no evidence as yet for these events .

Today on " This Week " with Jake Tapper , John Boehner and Steny Hoyer both agreed that BP 's liability cap should be raised .
Be afraid .
Be very afraid .
Here 's what I think it means :
Two corporatist lackeys want the ceremonial Kabuki dance of raising the liability cap because it will play well with voters -- but will actually make BP happy because it sets the stage for their eventual bankruptcy ( or that of whichever subsidiary they 'll designate as the liable party ) , and they 'll get to walk away and stick us with the entire bill .
BP will be happy , the politicians who take oil company money will be happy , and Wall Street will be happy .
Everyone will be happy -- except the people and creatures whose lives were destroyed by their criminal negligence .
Whee !
For many financial services companies , going global is the next step after meeting targets and achieving your goals at home .
Maybe your business is considering expanding internationally but feeling unsure of ...

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Key U.S. lawmakers investigating the BP
Plc oil spill have asked major energy companies for information on their response plans after it was discovered some companies ’ plans had errors including protecting species that do n’t live in the Gulf of Mexico .
In a hearing earlier this month , U.S. Representatives Henry Waxman and Edward Markey , both Democrats , blasted major oil company executives for “ virtually worthless ” and “ cookie cutter ” plans to handle a deepwater oil spill .
On Monday , they wrote a letter to the chief executives of Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell seeking more information about their plans .
“ No oil company appears to be better prepared for a disastrous oil spill than BP was , ” they wrote in the letter to the executives .
“ Each of the oil companies ’ oil spill response plans are practically identical to the tragically flawed BP oil spill response plan , ” they wrote .
The lawmakers said in the hearing on June 15 that company response plans included references to protecting walruses and other animals that do not live in the Gulf of Mexico in the event of an oil spill .
Markey had blasted the companies for mentioning walruses -- which have not been found in the Gulf of Mexico for millions of years -- in their plans and for including the name and phone number of a specialist who died in 2005 .
The lawmakers asked the companies to say if their response plans would protect the region from an undersea blowout similar to the one at BP ’s well .
It also asked them where they would expect to get equipment in case of a spill , whether they will update their response plans and when .
LOS ANGELES -- USC is cleaning house in its tarnished athletic department , throwing out much of what got the school in severe NCAA trouble .
Athletic director Mike Garrett and Reggie Bush 's Heisman Trophy are the first two items to go .
In a letter to school supporters Tuesday , incoming USC president Max Nikias said Garrett will be replaced Aug. 3 by Pat Haden , the former Trojans quarterback who became a successful businessman and a member of USC 's board of trustees .
The school also will return its copy of Bush 's trophy to the Heisman Trust , among several measures to disassociate itself from the tainted tailback .
The NCAA cited Garrett 's administration for a lack of institutional control while slapping the school with heavy sanctions last month , but Haden believes he can change the culture of a program that has been wildly successful and heavily scrutinized over the past decade .
" We 're going to do better , " said Haden , also the color analyst on NBC's Notre Dame broadcasts for the past decade .
" We have to do better .
We do n't have any choices here .
We stub our toe , there 's going to be some problems . "
USC was hit with four years of probation , a two - year bowl ban and severe football scholarship restrictions after the NCAA found serious rules violations in the athletic department , primarily around the football and men's basketball teams .
Most involved illegal benefits for Bush and O.J. Mayo , the talented basketball player who spent just one season at USC .
Reggie Bush has not been asked to give back his copy of the Heisman Trophy .
But USC 's copy will be returned next month .

Haden said the school 's plan to get rid of nearly all references to Bush and Mayo -- right down to scrubbing their images from school murals and removing Bush 's No. 5 jersey in its place of honor in the lobby of Heritage Hall -- are all part of the NCAA 's directive to disassociate the school from the athletes .
Bush 's Heisman has been on display alongside the trophies won by Garrett , O.J. Simpson , Matt Leinart , Carson Palmer , Charles White and Marcus Allen .
It was still in place Tuesday , but will be gone by the time students show up on campus next month .
Bush still has his own Heisman Trophy .
The Heisman Trophy Trust has not taken any action against Bush or made any request to have him return his copy of the trophy .
Though he does n't start his new job until Aug.
3 , Nikias is already at work reforming the Trojans ' image .
" The Trojan Family honors and respects the USC sporting careers of those persons whose actions did not compromise their athletic program or the opportunities of future USC student - athletes , " Nikias said .
After pledging support for new football coach Lane Kiffin , Haden said he realizes the enormity of his task in restoring credibility to USC , where the NCAA found numerous violations during the tenures of football coach Pete Carroll and men's hoops coach Tim Floyd .
After twice telling Nikias he did n't want to be considered for the job , Haden agreed to take it last week .
" We want to compete ferociously and win in every sport , but we want to do it ethically and within the rules , " said Haden , a former Rhodes Scholar who became a venture capitalist after an NFL career with the Los Angeles Rams .
" We 're going to have a culture of compliance around here .
Every meeting is going to start with the No. 1 item as compliance .
...
We 're going to try to be perfect .
When we make mistakes , we 're going to fess up , and we 're going to try to do better next time . "

Australia : Clean sweep for mining giants as Labor government capitulates on tax
By Nick Beams
2 July 2010
In the 109 - year history of the Australian federation it is doubtful there has been any clearer revelation of the real nature of so - called parliamentary democracy than the past week ’s events , which have culminated in a complete capitulation by the Labor government to the demands of the giant transnational mining companies .
Just eight days after the ousting of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a coup sparked by furious opposition from the mining giants to a proposed super profits tax , the newly - installed Prime Minister Julia Gillard has met all the main demands of BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto and Xstrata .
It can be said , without fear of exaggeration , that this is a government of , for and by the mining giants .
If some left - wing playwright or movie screenwriter had devised a plot where the prime minister in a supposed democracy was deposed in a parliamentary coup , following a multi-million dollar campaign by mining companies , and then a week later the new government acceded to their demands , it would have been dismissed as an absurd Marxist parody .
But this is precisely what has happened .
Gillard and her ministers spent most of the week locked in marathon talks with the three companies ’ most senior representatives , BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers , Rio Tinto Australia CEO David Peever and Xstrata chief executive Peter Freyberg , to meet their deadline of striking a deal by today or face the resumption of their $ 100 million advertising campaign against the government .
“ It looks as if the new PM has met the deadline , ” Malcolm Maiden noted in the Age .
Under the deal , announced by Prime Minister Julia Gillard at a press conference this morning , the government has dropped its plan for a resource super profits tax ( RSPT ) and replaced it with a minerals resource rent tax ( MRRT ) .
Previously , the 40 percent super profit tax rate had been declared “ non-negotiable . ”
Under the MRRT it will apply only to iron ore and coal projects , with nickel , gold and copper excluded , and be set at just 30 percent .
Under the RSPT , the new tax would have kicked in once the profit rate exceeded the long term bond rate — at around 6 percent .
Under the MRRT it will start at the long - term bond rate plus 7 percent .
One of the features of the RSPT most vociferously opposed by the mining companies was that the new tax would apply to existing ventures .
This meant that projects established many years ago , and enjoying a high rate of return , would attract a greater tax because their book value is lower than their current market value .
Under the MRRT , companies will be able to value established projects at current market value for the purposes of the tax , thereby lowering the rate of return .
The difference is substantial .
According to Rio Tinto , the depreciated book value of its operations in the north - western Pilbara region is $ US11.2 billion .
But the market value is calculated to be $ US64 billion .
Treasurer Wayne Swan declared this morning that the government ’s concessions would bring a reduction in expected revenue of $ 1.5 billion .
Accordingly , the overall company tax rate will be reduced from 30 percent to 29 percent , instead of 28 percent , as initially planned .
These figures are rubbery at best , given the volatility of global markets .
Moreover , the deal is not yet finalised .
As one commentator noted , the figure of $ 1.5 billion was probably plucked out of the air by some Treasury official .
If the shortfall is higher , the difference will likely be met through cuts to government spending .
The tax legislation is not expected to be finalised until some time next year , with the tax due to start in July 2012 .
Gillard announced that the process would be overseen by a Policy Transition Group under the leadership of former BHP Billiton chairman Don Argus and Resources Minister Martin Ferguson .
The prime minister stressed that she was “ delighted ” that the former BHP boss had accepted her invitation to consult with industry and advise the government .
The establishment of this new body means that , having dictated the broad parameters of the government ’s tax policy , the mining companies will now determine the complex details of its implementation .
And in matters of taxation legislation , where corporations devote massive resources to devising schemes to minimise or completely avoid payments , the devil will , most certainly , lie in the detail .
Preliminary calculations indicate that the mining industry , which is expected to pull in $ 60 billion in profits this year , with iron ore and coal prices rising by over 500 percent and up to 400 percent , respectively , since 2004 , will be paying significantly less tax under the MRRT than under the original proposal .
One initial calculation estimates that , under the proposed new regime , BHP may even end up paying no more tax than it does at present .
As soon as markets opened this morning , the share price of BHP and Rio went up by 1.5 to 2 percent , despite continuing global falls .
Not surprisingly , BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers declared that the company was “ encouraged ” by the agreement .
“ As we have previously stated , BHP Billiton believes that tax reform that is prospective , competitive , differentiated and resource - based will ensure that the Australian mining sector continues to grow through investment in the industry which benefits all Australians . ”
He said the MRRT design was “ closer to our frequently stated principles of sound tax reform . ”
Rio Tinto Australian managing director David Peever said the recognition of market value for existing mines and the reduction in the headline rate “ represent significant progress in achieving Rio Tinto ’s fundamental principles of tax reform . ”
In a joint statement , the three giant companies involved in the direct talks with the government said the MRRT represented “ very significant progress ” and that they would “ continue to work constructively with the government to ensure that the detailed design of minerals taxation maintains the international competitiveness of the Australian resources industry into the future . ”
Gillard ’s remarks at her press conference underscored that the speed of the government ’s changes was determined entirely by the mining companies .
While the tax plan was only announced two months ago , Gillard said that “ we ’ve been stuck on this question as a nation for too long . ”
It was “ essential that we have a stable and coherent government and a positive basis for trust . ”
The only instability was that created by the mining companies , which had threatened to resume their multi-million advertising campaign next week .
At the same time , the mining magnates made crystal clear that the only “ positive basis for trust ” was the government meeting all their demands .
Gillard also took the opportunity to send a message to big business and financial interests that her government was more than ready to accede to their requirements as well .
She took pains to emphasise her own role in achieving so - called “ reform ” , pointing to her implementation of a national school curriculum , her establishment of MySchool — the publication of league tables to compare schools — and her reactionary Fair Work Australia industrial relations legislation .
Answering a question on when the federal election would be called , she replied she had some more “ governing ” to do , and indicated her next priority would be to deal with “ anxieties ” in the “ community ” over asylum seekers and border protection .
Having been the architect of Labor ’s post -2001 policy , which aligned itself with the Howard government ’s inhuman anti-refugee measures , Gillard ’s comments point to the development of an even more reactionary agenda .
The meaning of the well - known aphorism that a week is a long time in politics is that processes that might , in another period , have taken decades to be revealed , emerge to the surface of political life in just a few days .
The working class must draw two vital lessons from the events of the past week :
First , that parliamentary democracy is nothing but a facade behind which powerful financial and corporate interests , backed by the forces of the state , determine the economic and political agenda .
Second , that the Labor government will stop at nothing to implement their dictates .
Speaking on the agreement with the mining companies , Swan claimed it was aimed at preparing for the next “ mining boom . ”
The truth is otherwise .
As the second anniversary of the eruption of the global financial crisis approaches , the world economy is moving towards another depression .
The theme of the G20 economic summit held in Toronto last weekend was not “ recovery ” but the imposition of deep budget cuts and austerity measures the like of which have not been seen since the 1930s .
The massive police operation against protestors outside the summit provides a stark demonstration of the kind of methods that will be used to implement such an agenda against workers in every country .
The Australian working class is set to enter major social and political struggles , which will bring it into direct confrontation with the Labor government .
The preparation for these struggles is the theme of the conferences being convened by the Socialist Equality Party titled “ The World Economic Crisis , the Failure of Capitalism and the Case for Socialism ” , to be held in Sydney ( July 4 ) and Melbourne ( July 11 ) .
We urge all World Socialist Web Site readers to attend .
A former transit police officer who fatally shot an unarmed man at an Oakland train station was convicted of involuntary manslaughter Thursday , capping a racially charged case that raised fears in the Bay Area of possible violence after the verdict .
Prosecutors accused the former BART officer of intentionally firing his handgun as he tried to handcuff Oscar J. Grant III on New Year ’s Day 2009 .
Johannes Mehserle , 28 , tearfully testified that the shooting was a tragic accident caused when he mistakenly grabbed his firearm instead of an electric Taser weapon during a struggle with Grant .
The shooting was captured on video by several witnesses .
Mehserle , who is white , fired a single round into the back of Grant , who was black and was lying face - down on the station platform .
Mehserle resigned a week after the shooting .
The killing provoked protests and violence in Oakland .
The case , which has drawn comparisons to the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King that ultimately triggered riots in Los Angeles in 1992 , was moved to Los Angeles for trial amid concern about the extensive media coverage of the killing in the Bay Area .
Many civil rights activists considered the case a test of how the justice system treats police officers accused of abusing minorities .
The trial also captured the attention of law enforcement officers who feared that a guilty verdict could raise the stakes for cops who make mistakes .
[ Updated , 4:25 p.m. : Mehserle faces a minimum of five years and a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison , authorities said .
Aidge Patterson , a spokesman for the L.A. Coalition of Justice for Oscar Grant , called the verdict a " perversion of justice that seeks to absolve Johannes Mehserle in his cold - blooded killing of Oscar Grant . "
Olis Simmons , executive director of an Oakland youth group that is advocating a peaceful reaction , called the verdict a miscarriage of justice .
" It is a walk for him .

But that 's not the important bit .
That 's not the important bit by a long shot .
Something much bigger andmore significantwassaid by Gabe at that press conference , but everyone seemed too excited by GlaDOS to notice .
Steam is coming to the PS3 , and depending on howit pans out , it could be an absolute game - changer for the console .
So join me now , as Iexplain what I think might reallybe behind Gabe 's appearance , what will happen next , and how it could meanhuge and very exciting changes for the PS3 .
Ken Kutaragi was right
Forget , for a second , Gabe ’s previous criticisms that the PS3 is an ungodly bitch to develop for .
Forget , for a second , that by most accounts it is .
Purely in terms of the culture of the machine , it makes sense for Valve to be working on the PlayStation 3 .
Unless you ’re the platform - holder , consoles are usually inherently closed platforms , standardised , regulated and controlled without any room for developers - or gamers for that matter - to add features or services of their own .
The PS3 is unique in that it allows a degree of hardware customisation , is far more open as a multimedia device than the 360 , and is managed with an ideology of openness to developer freedom .
That ’s what Crazy Ken meant when he described it as a PC .
We ’ve already seen that latter point proven with Unreal Tournament 3 ’s mod support .
As a pioneering PC developer with its own distribution platform in Steam , the PS3 is on paper the best cultural fit for Valve , as consoles go .
But big dealshave probably happened
That culture taken as given , I still doubt Gabe ’s showboating press conference support of the PS3was just a case of newfound PlayStation - love .
It ’s nice for extreme Sony fanboys to believe that he woke up from a nightmare one night screaming about how he ’d got it all wrong , or spent an unpleasant evening in the company of three ghosts who explained the past , present and future consequences of his lack of support .
But it just did n’t happen .
Above : Looks kind of at home , does n't it ?
What probably did happen was that Valve were beginning to look into the potential of the PS3 as an open platform just as Sony realised that it was n’t really going to have anything in the way of megaton announcements for this year ’s show ( sorry guys , but another GT5 trailer and an on - stage ice cream van did not do it for me ) .
So one called the other and questions were asked .
Questions like ‘ Gabe , aside from the big bag of money next to my desk , what would it take to get Valve ’s full support and endorsement on stage this year ? ’
And answers were put forward .
Answers like ‘ Total freedom to do whatever we want with your system . ’
And thus Portal 2 was coming to the PS3 , and thus Gabe was going to the Sony conference .
And this is where the really important and interesting stuff starts to happen .
It %26rsquo ;s more about Steam than Portal 2
The most important thing that was said when Gabe announced Portal 2 at Sony ’s press conference ?
‘ Steam will be part of that experience ’ .
Getting Steam on a console is potentially a much bigger deal than any one game release could ever be .
This , I suspect , is what Valve really wanted .
Steam is now , rightly , inherent to PC gaming culture .
From the perspective of gamers , devs and publishers alike , it just makes sense , being a great one - stop solution to all of the distribution , DRM , patching and multiplayer elements of PC gaming , in a way that ( mostly ) everyone is happy with .
Above : 1:58 .
That 's the bit that really matters .
Also note Gabe 's prolonged emphasis on the openness of the PS3 .
This speech was not about Portal
Steam is increasingly dominant in the PC space , particularly since Valve started allowing third parties to use all its components in their games via the release of the Steamworks publishing suite .
But with tens of millions of PS3s out there , it can go further .
The simple spread of brand awareness would be huge for a start .
Now I do n’t know to what extent Steam will appear on the PS3 .
It could just be that elements of it will work in the background , allowing Valve to handle game updates and manage cloud - based save data themselves as they do on the PC .
But it could also appear in some form as a proper Steam application in the XMB .
And from there , it could evolve and expand immensely , just has it has on its original platform .
Onethe next page , how Steam could change the face of the PS3
One change between NT5 and NT6 that many administrators overlook is the move away from ADM files and towards ADMX files .
Both are ways of loading templates for group policy settings into the AD , but the selling point for ADMX files is that they are XML .
ADMX files are billed as “ human readable , ” and they are .
To the kind of people that read XML , anyway .
But , by being XML , it ’s easy to create a program that will read or generate ADMX files .
There 's no shortage of companies offering software to parse or generate GPO templates like this .
Google them , too .
If you had previously put time into creating old NT5 ADM files , the newer ADMX files will supersede them .
ADMX files are also language - neutral .
They contain only the GPO and its value .
The descriptions are stored in an ADML file .
This is useful if you have admins who speak different languages .
" Starter GPOs " in NT6 are neat .
Think of them as a sort of template , though do n't confuse them with ADMX template files .
Say all of your GPOs are working just the way you want them to .
Turn your GPOs into starter GPOs , which will offer themselves as prepopulated templates the next time you go to add a GPO .
The limitation is that only “ administrative templates ” can be part of a starter GPO .
Starter GPOs are an excellent way to set up preconfigured template GPOs so your junior administrators have a smaller chance of making things go boom while they are learning the ropes .
They belong in the category of child ’s play system management , along with the rest of group policy from the NT5 era .
You can't unlock the real power of GPOs under NT6 unless you are a Microsoft volume licensing customer , and you get the Microsoft Desktop Optimisation Pack ( MDOP ) .
MDOP includes Advanced Group Policy Management ( AGMP ) , the real meat of which boils down to two words : change control .
It ’s nowhere near the robust versioning of other systems management tools like Puppet , but it ’s a step in the right direction .
Combined with offline editing and role - based delegation , AGPM is an exceptionally useful product .
It 's irritating that MDOP and AGPM are n’t available to all NT6 customers .
It 's upsetting I ca n’t even purchase it unless I 'm a volume licensing customer .
Starter GPOs are useful .
When it comes to putting some real power in the hands of systems administrators , AGMP is a good start .
But you simply can’t beat scripting for true administrative control .
For this , Microsoft offers the ability to use WMI filters or to deploy VB or Powershell scripts .
These features make Microsoft the equal of any Unix based operating system for scripting control .
Sadly when it comes to actually implementing the power of these scripting features , applications like Puppet walk all over Microsoft in terms of versioning , reversion and ease of use .
Ultimately Microsoft offers two options : “ easy to use but fairly limited ” and “ remarkably powerful but with nothing to help you keep organised ” . ®

Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are to reunite for a TV special to mark the 30th anniversary of their partnership .
The programme , to air on TV channel GOLD this autumn , will see the former double act reminisce about their friendship , careers and sketches .
The former double act met at Cambridge in 1980 and went on to appear together in Jeeves and Wooster , A Bit of Fry and Laurie and the Blackadder series .
Fry said it had been " a great joy " to be reunited with his old comic partner .

The one - off show - which has the working title Fry & Laurie : Re-United - was flilmed at Eltham Palace , an Art Deco home built on the site of a royal residence in south - east London .
It follows earlier GOLD retrospective programmes on Fawlty Towers and Blackadder .
Hugh Laurie is best known now for his role as a cantankerous doctor in House , for which he has won two Golden Globes and two Screen Actors Guild awards .

EDMONTON , Alberta , June 17 ( UPI ) -- A Canadian researcher suggests placing a faster worker among slower ones can improve workplace productivity .
Ken Schultz , a management - science researcher at the University of Alberta , analyzed production - line data from a General Motors plant .
The study , published in the journal Management Science , found an individual 's performance level may have a direct effect on what becomes " a good day 's work " for slower workers .

In his analysis of the production - line data , Schultz found changing production lines to introduce a higher - performing worker to an average or lower - than - average performing line , results in increased productivity for the whole line .
" You 'd look for the person who 's a good performer but does n't react to others around him ; that 's the person you want to move to the low - level team , " Schultz said in a statement .
" There 's a good chance he 's going to be a person who has proven to be a leader . "
However , the key is to arrange the work area so workers are facing each other when performing tasks , Schultz said .

Who ’s been the best driver over the first half of 2010 ?
It ’s time to reveal the final top five in the 2010 half - term driver rankings .
Find out where I ranked Jenson Button , Lewis Hamilton , Sebastian Vettel , Mark Webber and Robert Kubica below – and share your thoughts in the comments .
5. Jenson Button
Some expected the reigning world champion to suffer at the hands of Lewis Hamilton in 2010 .
Button has n’t been quite on his team mate ’s pace , but the gap is quite small and he helped himself to a pair of opportunistic wins at the start of the season .
At Melbourne he was helped by Sebastian Vettel ’s wheel failure , but not before he gained a load of places with a well - timed switch to slick tyres .
At Shanghai he ( and a few other drivers ) avoided the trap changing to intermediate tyres too early , and managed heavy wear on the tyres late in the race to claim win number two .
Shanghai was the last time Button out - qualified Hamilton .
But the pair remain the most closely - matched team mates on the grid – Button just 0.031s slower than Hamilton in qualifying on average .
He ’s been very consistent , with points finishes in all the races except Monaco , where a cover left on one of his radiators cooked his engine .
And he ’s raced well , passing Michael Schumacher on the first lap at Istanbul and nabbing second off Fernando Alonso in Montreal .
Against expectations Button ’s had a strong start to his McLaren career , one which would look even better if the guy in the other car was n’t Lewis Hamilton .
I must admit I never thought he ’d win another race again in his career , never mind two in his first four races at McLaren .
OK , so Hamilton has the edge on him in raw pace , but there ’s no shame in that .

4. Mark Webber
Webber ’s domination of the Spanish and Monaco Grands Prix – and a good portion of the Turkish Grand Prix , too – demonstrated what he ’s capable of and made Red Bull ’s decision to extend his contract a no - brainer .
Vettel had little response in those races , and it was clear from their notorious collision at Istanbul the frustration Vettel felt as he strived to stop Webber extending his championship lead even further .
Webber ’s pole position lap at Sepang – gambling on intermediates while everyone else sought the security of full wets – was exceptional .
And he looked good in the rain in Shanghai too before being bumped off the track during a restart .
Unfortunately Webber ’s also hit some duff notes .
He was scrappy at home in Melbourne , with several wild moments and an unnecessary collision with Hamilton .
And he made a truly horrendous start at Valencia .
But when he ’s been on top form this year Webber has proved too simply much for Vettel .
Hopefully there will be no after - effects from his shocking Valencia crash to prevent him doing more of the same .
A hell of a improvement over 2009 , when he only out - qualified Vettel twice .
I wonder how much was down to his leg injury .
He was flawless from Spain to Turkey and had some bad luck at Canada .
But his mistakes at Bahrain , Sepang , Australia and Valencia were costly to him , as Vettel now has a somewhat good advantage over him .
He is not as good over his team mate as everyone says – if he was , he would n’t be 12 points behind Vettel .

3. Sebastian Vettel
In the aftermath of Istanbul Vettel was rightly blamed by most of the portion of the world ’s population not employed by Red Bull .
His unnecessary move into the path of Webber ruined both their races .
But putting the incident – which will surely prove the nadir of his season – to one side , he ’s otherwise driven quickly , consistently and is unlucky not to be leading the world championship .
Exhaust failure in Bahrain .
Wheel failures in Melbourne and Barcelona .
His anti-roll bar in Istanbul and his gearbox in Montreal .
One could conservatively estimate the points Vettel ’s lost to car trouble this year running as at least 40 , enough to put him comfortably in the lead of the championship .
Vettel has continued to prove this year that he can scorch the opposition in qualifying and romp away to victory from the front row of the grid .
What we ’ve not seen enough of from him yet is his ability to fight his way past rivals .
Too much dithering behind Adrian Sutil in Shanghai allowed Hamilton to mug the pair of them .
That may ultimately prove the difference between whether he win the world championship this year or not .
Started off the season looking like he was going to get pole and win every race … if his car would actually finish .
Since Webber started to beat him he looks worried and seems that it ’s gone to his head a bit .

2. Robert Kubica
After an uninspiring 2009 the real Robert Kubica is back .
At the start of the season the Renault was the fifth - best car on the grid .
Now , with Mercedes ’ difficulties , it ’s usually fourth .
And Kubica has often exceeded the R30 ’s capabilities .
He ’s done it partly by avoiding some of mistakes made by the front runners – like the McLarens and Ferraris that failed to progress beyond Q1 at Sepang , or the many drivers who blinked and pitted too soon for intermediates at Shanghai .
He ’s done it with a breathtaking turn of speed , putting him second on the grid in Monaco and beating the Ferraris in Turkey .
The gap between him and rookie team mate Vitaly Petrov in qualifying makes painful reading – 9 - 0 to Kubica , 0.957s faster on average ( compare that to Rubens Barrichello ’s 0.222s margin over Nico H?�??lkenberg ) .
And he ’s done it with remarkable consistency , finishing every race in the points , except at Bahrain where he was delayed by a first - lap collision with Sutil .
Canada was his least impressive race , going off while battling with Schumacher and being fortunate to escape without a penalty for impatiently swerving around and hitting Sutil on his way to the pits .
Not being in one of the absolute front - running cars , he does n’t face the kind of pressure to bring home maximum points without risk that the championship contenders do .
But if he was driving for one of the top teams , on this form there ’s reason to believe he ’d do better than several of their drivers .
Massively impressive , though the cars a definite contender – by which I mean when it ’s not in Q3 , someone ’s doing it wrong .
Still , he is driving out of his skin , and outperforming the car .
Would certainly put him in the top three drivers .

1. Lewis Hamilton
In his first three seasons you could take it for granted that Hamilton would be on or very near the pace of his car , and he would fight hard for any advantage on the track .
The difference this year is how he ’s tempered his speed and aggression with a little more caution than before .
It ’s made him a more complete racing driver .
His battles through the field in Melbourne , Sepang and Shanghai were not only some of the most entertaining moments of the year so far , they were among the most impressive performances of any driver .
At Barcelona he was on course to split the Red Bulls – something that looked unthinkable when they ’d out - qualified the field by nearly a second – before a wheel failure caused by an inadequately secured nut .
His first win of the season was just reward for his dogged pursuit of the Red Bulls , spending lap after lap within a few tenths of Webber or Vettel at Istanbul .
In years past perhaps a careless move for position or one too many locked wheels would have scuppered his run .
But he kept it clean and capitalised when they self - destructed .
Montreal was a tour de force – an excellent pole position ( the only non-Red Bull driver to claim one so far ) and a pair of careful passes in high - pressure situations gave him his best dry - weather win to date .
Aside from his mystifying qualifying performance in Melbourne , and occasionally sailing close to the wind with the stewards , Hamilton is in first - class form this year .
He ’s not always had the faster car underneath him , but he ’s leading the world championship .
He had a slow start , but it seems he now has the measure of Jenson .
His recent consistency has also helped him take the championship lead .
He might want to avoid courting controversy , though .

Image caption Oudeh was buried in Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus
The mastermind behind the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre , in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed , has died , his daughter and Palestinian officials say .
Mohammed Oudeh died of kidney failure a day after he was taken to hospital in Syria , his daughter said .
He was 73 .
Oudeh - also known under his guerrilla name Abu Daoud - did not take part in the notorious attack .
He later said he had no regrets because he considered the athletes , as military reservists , to be legitimate targets .
Oudeh died at the Andalus hospital in the Syrian capital , Damascus , on Saturday , after being taken ill , Hana Oudeh told the Associated Press news agency .
The high - profile and audacious Munich attack , which unfolded live on television , shocked the world .
In the following years , Israel assassinated a number of top Palestinian officials whom it believed were involved in the massacre .
Oudeh survived an assassination attempt in which he was repeatedly shot at a cafe in Warsaw in 1981 .
Black September
Image caption Eleven Israelis died after being taken hostage in the Olympic Village
Two Israeli athletes were killed in the September 5 attacks , and nine more died in a botched rescue attempt by the German police .
A German policeman and five Palestinian gunmen were also killed .
Ms Oudeh said her father was to be buried at the Martyrs Cemetery in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp , in Damascus .
Oudeh was " a great , loving and sincere man whose dream was to go back to Palestine " , she told AP .
Oudeh was a leader of Black September , an offshoot of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's Fatah group .
The faction had been established to avenge the 1970 expulsion of Palestinian guerrillas from Jordan .
In a 2006 interview with AP , Oudeh said the Munich attacks were a turning point for Palestinians .
He rejected the term " terrorists " to describe Palestinian fighters , and said : " Before Munich , nobody had the slightest idea about Palestine . "
Oudeh admitted responsibility for the Munich operation in a 1999 book , Palestine : From Jerusalem to Munich .
It caused uproar when it was published , and Israel barred him from returning to the West Bank .
Not only has the economic downturn in the United States eliminated many of the jobs that used to lure immigrants , human rights groups say , but also the federal government has stepped up efforts to stop the underground railroad of migrants , building mammoth fences in several border towns and flooding the region with hundreds of new Border Patrol agents equipped with high - tech surveillance tools .
These tougher enforcement measures have pushed smugglers and illegal immigrants to take their chances on isolated trails through the deserts and mountains of southern Arizona , where they must sometimes walk for three or four days before reaching a road .
“ As we gain more control , the smugglers are taking people out to even more remote areas , ” said Omar Candelaria , the special operations supervisor for the Border Patrol ’s Tucson Sector .
“ They have further to walk and they are less prepared for the journey , and they do n’t make it . ”
Mr. Candelaria said the surge in discoveries of bodies this year might also owe something to increased patrols .
He noted that some of the remains found this year belong to people who died in previous years .
But Dr. Parks said that could not account for the entire increase this year .
Indeed , the majority of bodies brought in during July , Dr. Parks said , were dead less than a week .
Human rights groups say it is the government ’s sustained crackdown on human smuggling that has led to more deaths .
“ The more that you militarize the border , the more you push the migrant flows into more isolated and desolate areas , and people hurt or injured are just left behind , ” said Kat Rodriguez , a spokeswoman for the Coalición de Derechos Humanos in Tucson .

OK , so maybe it 's not fridge poetry .
It 's actually , er , concrete poetry .
Or meditative stone garden poetry .
Last Monday , July 12 , St. Mike 's installed its Word Garden .
It 's a circle 60 feet in diameter bordered by boulders and shrubs and filled with tiny pebbles .
And 350 words carved on shards of stone by artist Chris Cleary of Jericho 's On the Rocks Stone - Carving Studio .
The garden will also have " two stone chess / checker boards , with colored stones for checkers and chess sets stored nearby " and an outdoor chalkboard that instructors can use for their classes , according to a college press release .
But the word - stones are the star attraction .
You can arrange them any way you want -- and education prof Valerie Bang - Jensen , one of the forces behind the garden , says she trusts students not to make off with them .
Even most children know that taking things without permission is known as stealing .
There are three methods of acquiring property : homesteading , voluntary exchange , and theft .
The first two methods are just , while theft is inherently unjust .
Taxation involves taking things without permission and must be classified as theft .
However , before deciding on whether or not taxation should be considered theft , the term “ taxation ” must be defined .
I will define taxation as “ a government mandated extraction of resources from individuals and / or groups , paid to support the aims of the government . ”
The phrase , “ mandatory extraction ” is the key to understanding why taxation is theft .
A mandatory extraction , by nature , is taken through the use of force or coercion , and not paid voluntarily .
Theft is always theft , regardless of who does the theft , how the theft occurs , and what excuses the thief makes to “ justify ” the theft .
The ONLY exception to this statement is when things are taken as restitution for a prior wrong ( for example , if you stole $ 100 from a person , a court would be justified in taking $ 100 from you without your permission to repay the victim ) .
Before I go on , I must address a question that I will surely be asked by many readers : arent taxes special because they are taken by the government in order to provide people with their basic needs ?
The answer to this question is a flat NO !
People have certain inalienable rights which should never be violated .
It would be wrong of me to kill you , rob you , or physically harm you .
Governments are made up of people , and are often created by people to secure their rights .
Because governments are made up only of people , governments cannot have any rights that people themselves do not have .
It simply does not make sense for this to be untrue .
Rights are rights , people are people .
Any claims that the government has more rights than anyone else is arguing that some people ( the populace ) should be considered inferior and subordinate to others ( the government ) .
Taxation involves taking property from people without their consent ; taxation is theft .
To quote myself : “ If a man with a gun were to demand that unless you pay him 1 / 3 of your income he would lock you in a cage , he would be guilty of initiating the use of force with the intent of committing theft .
It would not matter if the man promised to use this money to pay for a school for your children , for a new highway , or for a missile defense program .
Taking things from a person without their permission is , by definition , theft .
Silver - tongued rhetoric may be employed to obscure this fact , but it can not change it .
Taking something from another person without their permission is always theft and should be condemned as theft .
It does not matter what the “ reason ” or “ justification ” for this action is .
It does not matter who committed this theft , what was stolen , or how many people told the aggressor to act . ”
Examples of taxation as theft
Some of the taxes described below are not traditionally thought of as taxes , but they are taxes — they all meet the above definition of being a government mandated extractions for the purposess of supporting the aims of the government .
A government imposed minimum wage law prevents a person ( a sovereign owner of him or herself ) from selling their labor to a potential buyer at a mutually agreed upon price .
This is theft of a laborer ’s future earnings .
A government imposed ban on the sale of alcohol on Sunday prevents a person from selling their justly acquired resources to an individual willing to purchase them .
This is theft of profits .
A government imposed business regulation prevents a business from using its justly acquired resources in the manner that it sees fit .
This is theft as well .
A mandatory income tax , imposed under penalty of imprisonment , enforced by men with guns is theft of the fruits of one ’s labor .
Stealing one ’s labor is called slavery .
A mandatory income tax makes the government a middle man in all labor transactions , and allows them to claim ownership of property that they did not justly acquire .
A mandatory property tax , imposed under penalty of imprisonment , enforced by men with guns is , by definition , a violation of property rights , and therefore is theft — no explanation should be necessary to prove this .
But … property taxes are fees on products that have already been paid for .
They are levied on the owner of a property .
A mandatory fee on residents for the continued use of their own house is no different than the government charging a person rent to stay on their own property .
Remember , a person who justly acquires property becomes the owner of that property , but if a person has to pay the government rent to occupy their own property , who is the real owner of the property , the homeowner , or the government ?
A mandatory sales tax , imposed under penalty of imprisonment , enforced by men with guns is theft as well .
A mandatory sales tax makes the government a middle man in all retail transactions , and allows them to claim ownership of property that they did not justly acquire .
Sure , they can argue that sales taxes are imposed in order to pay for police , but this does not change the fact that this money was acquired through theft , and not through voluntary means .
The mafia also forces businesses to pay a protection fee .
I would love to hear your comments on this article , but please dont post a comment or send me an email that says “ taxes are necessary because without them , the government could not provide services . ”
I have addressed this above : taking money from someone without their persmission and then using that money to buy they something that they may or may not want is still taking something without permission [ theft ] .
Please do not send me a message or post a comment telling me that taxation is “ voluntary ” and not theft because if I disagree with the taxes , I can move somewhere else .
When it comes to taxes , we have three choices : paying a tax , or refusing to pay the tax and being arrested by men with guns and then locked in a cage , or leaving one ’s family , friends , and property behind to search for a society that does not employ mandatory taxation .
This fact should make it clear that taxation is not voluntary .
A person who uses coercion to force another person to give up some of their property under threat of violence is guilty of extortion .
Governments can have no rights that people do not have , and are therefore just as guilty of extortion as would be a person who acted in this manner .
Furthermore , the argument that if a person does not want to pay taxes , they can renounce their citizenship and leave the US to avoid taxes is false .
The US government does levy a tax on people who give up citizenship :
“ Expatriation on or after June 17 , 2008 , may cause an expatriate to be subject to IRC § 877A , which was enacted as part of the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act ( HEART ) Act of 2008 .
Generally , IRC § 877A imposes income tax on the net unrealized gain on property held by certain U.S. citizens or green card holders who terminate their US residency as if their worldwide property had been sold for its fair market value on the day before the expatriation or residency termination ( mark - to - market tax ) .
The Treasury Department and IRS have authority to issue regulations under IRC § 877A so further guidance is expected soon , though it has not been released yet . ”
Finally , please do not send me a message or post a comment asking how things like schools , roads , or even national defense could be paid for without mandatory taxation .
There exists a long history of voluntary provision of all these goods and services ( check out this book for more information ) .
Furthermore , these items could be provided for through taxation in a purely voluntary manner if people were allowed to exercise their natural right to free association and choose their own government .
Under voluntary government , taxation could no longer be considered theft , as those who did not wish to pay a tax could simply drop out of one government and sign a contract with another government .
Economist Walter Block argues that under voluntary government , one would have “ the right to stay put , on one ’s own property , and either to shift alliance to another political entity , or to set up shop as a sovereign on one ’s own account . ”
Governmental services can be provided on the free market as can any other service ; a government would agree to provide certain services ( possibly protection , roads , health care , or whatever ) in exchange for a fee from a citizen .
Thus , the citizen would be paying a purely voluntary tax .
In contrast to voluntary , contractual government , our government does not allow citizens to withdraw their support from the State .
It levies taxes on people without their consent .
These non-consensual taxes must be recognized and exposed for what they are : THEFT .

A mother who lost a four - week - old baby to whooping cough has called on the state and federal governments to do more to promote vaccination .
The call came as NSW 's Health Care Complaints Commission ( HCCC ) issued a warning against the Australian Vaccination Network ( AVN ) , which campaigns against vaccination , after it allegedly used the baby 's death to promote its opposition .
Dana McCaffery ... died from whooping cough aged four weeks .
In March last year , Toni and David McCaffery lost their four - week - old baby Dana to whooping cough .
Shortly afterwards they learnt that Dana 's death was being used as part of an anti-vaccination campaign .
Missed this :
Just before sunset on April 10 , 2006 , a DC - 9 jet landed at the international airport in the port city of Ciudad del Carmen , 500 miles east of Mexico City .
As soldiers on the ground approached the plane , the crew tried to shoo them away , saying there was a dangerous oil leak .
So the troops grew suspicious and searched the jet .
They found 128 black suitcases , packed with 5.7 tons of cocaine , valued at $ 100 million .
The stash was supposed to have been delivered from Caracas to drug traffickers in Toluca , near Mexico City , Mexican prosecutors later found .
Law enforcement officials also discovered something else .
The smugglers had bought the DC - 9 with laundered funds they transferred through two of the biggest banks in the U.S. : Wachovia Corp. and Bank of America Corp. , Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its August 2010 issue .
***
Wachovia admitted it did n’t do enough to spot illicit funds in handling $ 378.4 billion for Mexican - currency - exchange houses from 2004 to 2007 .
That ’s the largest violation of the Bank Secrecy Act , an anti-money - laundering law , in U.S. history — a sum equal to one - third of Mexico ’s current gross domestic product .
“ Wachovia ’s blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations , ” says Jeffrey Sloman , the federal prosecutor who handled the case .
Since 2006 , more than 22,000 people have been killed in drug- related battles that have raged mostly along the 2,000 - mile ( 3,200 - kilometer ) border that Mexico shares with the U.S.
In the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez , just across the border from El Paso , Texas , 700 people had been murdered this year as of mid- June .
Six Juarez police officers were slaughtered by automatic weapons fire in a midday ambush in April .

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal state of emergency Wednesday , requiring most state employees to take three days of unpaid leave per month until a new budget is enacted .
Schwarzenegger said the state , which faces a budget deficit of 19 billion dollars , is on the verge of a “ fiscal meltdown ” and could be forced to issue IOUs starting in August to avert a new cash crisis .
“ Our cash situation leaves me no choice but to once again furlough state workers until the legislature produces a budget I can sign , ” he said in a statement .
He said the state has already taken “ extraordinary measures to conserve cash , ” such as deferring payments to schools and other local governments but that the crisis is deepening with no state budget for the 2010 - 2011 fiscal year expected soon .

July 23 , 2010 at 17:07 Tags Python , Version control
I 've been involved in open - source projects almost since the first days of my " serious " programming ( back in 1998 ) , but these were always projects I started myself .
I 've long been thinking about joining one of the big and established open - source projects , both to make a contribution and to improve my own skills by working with some great people on interesting things .
Once I started tinkering with Python around two years ago , it became the major candidate for my contribution - both because working on to Python can really make a difference for a huge amount of users , and because Python 's inner development circles include some of the brightest programmers I ever ran into .
Joining this clique , even as a humble minor contributor , is very appealing .
So , a few weeks ago , inspired a couple of articles , I 've finally made the plunge .
For now , my contributions are very minor : I 've been involved in a few issues , and made several patches .
A few were even committed into Python - one documentation patch and two patches fixing bugs in the trace .
py module in Python 3.x
I 'm also " in progress " on several other issues , dealing with the trace .
py module ( improving its documentation , adding unit tests and debugging some issues with 3.x ) , documentation fixes for some standard library modules and a bug fix for difflib .
Once you make the first step , finding more things to work on is quite easy .
Python 's code and documentation are of relatively high quality , but like in any major software project , there 's place for improvement almost everywhere you look , even if the improvements are very minor ( making the documentation more consistently formatted or clearer ) .
A few words on how I work on Python .
Although Python is well - supported on Windows and can be built on it without much trouble , Linux is the most convenient platform to use for development IMO .
I 'm using a Ubuntu VM running on VirtualBox on top of my Windows XP machine .
Python 's code is kept in a Subversion repository , to which you can get a read - only access when you 're not a core committer .
It means you can't really interact with the repository , and if you want to save your temporary work , you 're on your own .
Luckily , Python is in the process of moving to Mercurial , and already has a functional mirror set up .
Mercurial is a much better SCM tool for this purpose , because it allows you to work locally with your repository , only pulling changes from the official one when necessary .
Here 's my workflow with the Mercurial mirror of Python :
My local Mercurial repo is where I do all my hacking , occasionally backing - up to my personal clone at code.google.com .
This lets me explore various ideas , create temporary fixes , all of this with full version control .
From time to time , I 'm pulling a fresh snapshot from Python 's official Mercurial mirror to get back on track , but I will always be able to get back to my own changes , because everything is safely stored in the history of my repo .
However , I still keep the SVN checkouts around , because :
I want to make sure my changes work on a clean check - out from Python 's official repository , which is still SVN .
I create patches against the SVN repo ( with svn diff ) , because Mercurial creates slightly different diffs .
Since committers actually commit into the SVN repo , this makes their lives easier .
It 's easy to keep several versions of Python around .
For example , I have the repositories for the 3.x development branch ( both Mercurial for hacking and SVN for patches ) , plus the 2.7 and 2.6 maintenance branches .
To get a new version / branch all one needs is :
Check it out from SVN or clone from Mercurial configure and then make Create a link somewhere on PATH to the relevant executable ( for example I have in ~ / bin a link named py27 for the 2.7 version , py3d for the debug build of the latest 3.x , and so on ) .
The Python interpreter , once executed , knows where to find its own libraries , making it very simple to work with several versions of Python simultaneously .
To conclude , now you know what 's been keeping me busy in the past month or so .
Contributing to Python is something I 've long wanted doing , and I 'm happy that I finally started .
It turned out to be much less difficult than I originally expected , and I now firmly believe that any competent developer with the desire to help and some free time on his hands can become a contributor .
Swiss assisted suicide organisation Dignitas is under growing pressure , as questions about its finances and urns of ashes found in Lake Zurich coincide with plans for a law that would make it harder for foreigners to end their life in Switzerland .
Image caption Urns found in Lake Zurich have focused attention on assisted suicide
Existing Swiss legislation on assisted suicide is brief and extremely liberal .
The practice is permitted , the law states , as long as those involved in it are not selfishly motivated and do not make a profit out of it .
The lack of more specific regulations stems from a long - held and widely accepted belief among the Swiss that the right to make an end - of - life decision is personal and individual , and should not be the subject of interference by the state .
But as assisted suicide organisations such as Exit and Dignitas have grown , some concerns have emerged .
New proposals drafted by the Swiss government could force Dignitas , which - unlike Exit - has many foreign patients , to radically change its procedures .
Urns in the lake
The discovery of dozens of urns containing human ashes in Lake Zurich has served to focus attention once again on just what exactly assisted suicide groups are allowed to do .
It remains unclear who put the urns into the lake but there have been claims that Dignitas may have been involved : all the urns bore the label of the crematorium used by the organisation .
DIGNITAS FACTS
Has assisted 1070 people to commit suicide , since 1998
More than 100 Britons are believed to be among that number
Some 85 % of clients come from outside Switzerland
The largest groups , by nationality , are German , then British , then French
One German woman has come forward to say her stepmother 's ashes were put in the lake by Dignitas , despite her wish to be buried next to her husband .
And at least one former employee of Dignitas claims she was present when urns were dumped in the lake .
Soraya Wernli says she left the organisation five years ago , after becoming concerned that Dignitas had become profit - motivated .
" Dignitas has become a business worth millions , " she told the BBC .
Mrs Wernli , who says she remains a firm supporter of the right to choose the moment of death , has taken her concerns to the police , and she is in favour of more regulation for assisted suicide organisations .
More transparency
The founder of Dignitas , Ludwig Minelli , is firmly opposed .
Mr Minelli will not comment on the case of the urns , because it is the subject of an investigation , but , in a rare interview , he did agree to talk about how Dignitas works .
Image caption Ludwig Minelli has challenged every attempt to restrict the work of Dignitas in court
We are not working with public money , so there is no reason for us to answer questions Ludwig Minelli , Founder of Dignitas Dignitas boss :
Healthy should have right to die
" There are no state rules but we have our own rules , " Mr Minelli told the BBC .
" The first is that we never precipitate an assisted suicide , every step must be initiated by the member and not by us . "
Dignitas has helped more than 1,000 people die in the past 12 years , many of them foreigners who come to Switzerland precisely because their own countries do not permit assisted suicide , Mr Minelli explained .
Each individual pays an initial membership fee , typically around $ 200 ( £ 133 ) , followed by annual membership fees of $ 80 ( £ 53 ) .
Further fees for the consultation and the assisted suicide itself run to around $ 7,000 ( £ 4,700 ) .
Some clients , however , are believed to have donated much larger sums .
This is all perfectly legal under Swiss law , as long as Dignitas and Mr Minelli are not making a profit out of it .
But there have been allegations in the Swiss media that Mr Minelli has become a millionaire since he founded Dignitas .
Mr Minelli refuses to discuss the organisation 's finances .
" This is a private organisation , " he explained .
" Only the active members have a right to know the facts , and the public has no right at all .
We are not working with public money , so there is no reason for us to answer questions . "
The active members are Mr Minelli , and one other who prefers to remain anonymous .
Right to die for all
Mr Minelli and one of the doctors working for Dignitas , Alois Geiger , also defended the organisation 's policy of providing services not just to the terminally ill , but to those with chronic illnesses and even mental illnesses such as schizophrenia .
Dr Geiger , for example , provided the prescription for the young British man Dan James , who committed suicide in Switzerland in 2008 after being paralysed in a rugby accident .
Image caption Dan James ended his life in 2008 , after he was paralysed in a rugby accident
" Most people who come to me do n't just say ' I want to die ' " , explained Dr Geiger .
" What they say is : ' I do n't want to live THIS life anymore . '
" If you have a person who is mentally ill , and it has gone on for years , never getting better , always getting worse , a person who has tried eight times to kill himself , why not give him the possibility to end this horrible life ?
Schizophrenia is a horrible illness . "
Dr Geiger is referring to the case of a 39 - year - old Spanish man with paranoid schizophrenia who died two years ago with the help of Dignitas .
The Zurich authorities have now ruled that Dr Geiger , a gynaecologist by training , did not have the required competence to assist his suicide and have removed his power to prescribe for the mentally ill .
Mr Minelli and Dr Geiger are now challenging that decision in court .
Plans to regulate
Meanwhile the Swiss government has put forward two draft papers on assisted suicide , one of which would ban the practice altogether , and a second - the more likely to be approved - which would limit the practice to the terminally ill .
Patients would have to provide evidence from two independent doctors that their illness is incurable and that they are likely to die within months .
We really hope to raise awareness among the countries who send us the most patients - Germany and Great Britain ... it 's a call to these countries not just to export the problem Margrit Leuthold , Switzerland 's national committee on medical ethics
They would also need to show that they have made an informed decision , over a period of some time , to end their lives .
All these conditions would effectively end or fundamentally change the practices of Dignitas , whose foreign patients typically arrive in Switzerland , see a Dignitas doctor and die within 24 hours .
" The government has an obligation to protect , " explains Margrit Leuthold of Switzerland 's national committee on medical ethics .
" So these organisations should have some governance by the state .
It can not be that organisations which deal with the life and death of citizens are just free - acting , " she added .
Mrs Leuthold also argues that other countries should pay attention to the debate over assisted suicide in Switzerland .
" We really hope to raise awareness among the countries who send us the most patients , right now that is Germany and Great Britain , " Mrs Leuthold said .
" Why do these citizens come to Switzerland ?
Obviously they have a very strong will to commit suicide , and they have a very strong suffering .
" So I think it 's also a call to these countries to deal with this fact themselves , and not just to export the problem , " Mrs Leuthold added .
But any change to existing Swiss law is likely to be a long process .
Ludwig Minelli says he will take the government 's proposals to a nationwide referendum if necessary .
" I am persuaded that we have to struggle in order to implement the last human right in our societies , " he says .
" And the last human right is the right to make a decision on one 's own end and the possibility to have this end without risk and without pain . "
Designing AI Algorithms For Turn - Based Strategy Games
By Ed Welch
In action games the AI opponent always has the natural advantage : perfect accuracy and lightning fast reflexes , so the challenge in designing the AI for those games is making it act more human and to be beatable .
In turn - based strategy games the tables are turned .
Speed and accuracy are no longer important factors and the cunning and intuition of the human player will easily out match any AI opponent .
In fact , it 's nearly impossible to design a AI that can beat an experienced player , but that is not really the point anyway .
The challenge is to make the AI 's attack and defense strategy to appear intelligent and thought out , providing a challenge but letting the player win in the end .
Once the player has familiarized himself / herself with the tactics of the AI the game rapidly gets boring , so a certain amount of unpredictability is desirable .
Challenges Involved : Looking At A Typical Strategy Game
The AI design problem is easiest understood by taking a real life example , in this case we take a space based war game .
Our example is what 's called a 4X game , where you must expand and dominate the galaxy .
Each player has war ships and colony ships and starts with a home planet and can colonize habitable planets .
A first attempt at writing the AI would be a simple algorithm to assign orders to each resource ( i.e. a planet , or ship ) , starting with the most important first .
Defending planets with production queues has the highest priority , because they are the most valuable .
The next highest , is defending colonies without production queues , then attacking enemy home planets , then colonizing habitable planets , then attacking enemy ships , then repairing damaged ships and lastly exploring uncharted territory .
So , we take the highest priority task first , and check for any enemy ships that are close to our colonies .
As you can see in the image above enemy frigates X & Y threaten both the AI 's home world and colony .
So , we find the closest warships and assign them to attack .
You might see here the flaw here in our algorithm .
If by chance , frigate Y is handled first , destroyer A will be assigned because it 's the closest .
Then , when Frigate X is processed , the only ship left to attack is destroyer B , which is too far away to reach it and Frigate X succeeds in bombing our home planet .
It 's obvious that Destroyer B should be assigned to Frigate Y and Destroyer A to Frigate X .
Also , other problems can occur with this simple algorithm .
Have a look at a more complex scenario :
In this new scenario we have Destroyer A badly damaged from a previous attack .
It would be a futile sacrifice sending it into battle again .
It 's wiser to send it back to the home planet for repair .
So , that leaves Destroyers C and B to defend our colonies .
But destroyer C is too far away to reach frigate Y in time and would be better served to bomb the enemy colony , seeing as it's so close ( not to mention , that fuel conversation is important too ) .
Meanwhile , the AI colonizer is armed , and could be diverted from its primary colonization mission .
The Solution : The Resource Assignment Algorithm
Assignment Scoring
In order to solve the problems detailed above , firstly we design a scoring system .
Each task is assigned a general priority as follows :
Defending our colonies : 1
Attacking enemy colonies : 2
colonizing planets : 3
Attacking enemy ships : 4
Repairing damaged ships : 5
Exploring uncharted territory : 6
Each task also has a priority modifier , for instance the defense task gets a modifier for the value of the colony ( colonies with production queues get very high modifier ) .
Likewise , the repair task gets a modifier depending on the amount of damage and the colonize task gets a modifier depending on the " habitability " of the planet .
Finally the distance of the assigned ship is taken into account , as follows :
assignment score = ( 6 - general priority + modifier ) / distance to ship that is assigned
Therefore , in the previous scenario destroyer C would get a higher score for attacking the enemy colony , even though the defense task has a higher priority , just because it was so close to the enemy planet .
Also , the priority modifier of the repair task for Destroyer A is quite high because it 's so badly damaged .
Coupled with that it is close to a repair queue , and that means that it scores higher than the defense task .
Algorithm Outline
The overall algorithm is broken into 4 parts :
Gathering Tasks
The AI has a list of enemy ships and planets within sensor range , as well as a list of its own assets .
Tasks that need to be done are generated as follows :
Object present Task generated Enemy ship near colony Defend colony task Enemy ship Attack ship task Enemy colony Attack planet task habitable planet Colonize planet task Damaged ship Repair ship task Uncharted territory Explore task
Possible Assignments
The other part of the problem is that if we assign tasks in the wrong order the resource utilization will not be optimal .
This can be resolved by assigning the tasks in phases .
We use two special classes to help us : PossibleAssignment and Task .
Possible Assignment links a potential " task doer " ( e.g. a ship ) with a task and stores the " assignment score " .
Task stores the priority , priority modifier and objective .
Let 's just take a quick look at our class hierarchy to make things clearer :
We generate a PossibleAssignment object for each combination of " task doer " to task .
However , we eliminate impossible combinations .
For instance , an unarmed ship cannot carry out an attack task , nor can it do a task if it does n't have enough fuel to reach it .
This is how the code looks :
listAsset contains a list of all assets ( for instance ships )
for ( n = 0 ; n < listTask.size ( ) ; n++)
{
for(f = 0 ; f < listAsset.size ( ) ; f++ ) {
if ( listAsset[f].isTaskSuitable( listTask [ n ] ) ) {
listPossAssignment.add ( new PossibleAssignment( listTaskn ] ) ) ;
}
}
}
Next , we calculate assignment scoring for each PossibleAssignment and sort the list in order , highest scores first .
And finally , in the last stage , we physically make the assignments .
Because the list has been sorted , the most effective assignments occur first .
Once an assignment is made the task doer is marked as busy and also the task is marked as assigned , preventing double assignments .
Here is part of the code :
for ( n = 0 ; n < listPossAssignment.size ( ) ;n++)
{
listPossAssignment[ n].assign ( ) ;
}
public void PossibleAssignment : : assign ( )
{
if ( task.isAssigned ( ) ) return ;
possibleTaskDoer.assign( this ) ;
}
public void Ship : : assign ( PossibleAssignment possAssign ) {
if ( task != null ) return ;
task = possAssign.getTask ( ) ;
possAssign.getTask ( ) .assign ( this ) ;
}
Reusing The Algorithm For Planet Production Assignment
The AI should manufacture new star ships if there are any leftover tasks that could n't be taken care of by the existing fleet .
For example , if we have spotted an enemy ship and there are no available warships to attack , then we need to build a new warship .
Similarly , if there is a habitable planet and no available colonizers , then we need to build a new colonizer .
In fact , the build priorities for production queues are exactly the same as the task priorities for star ships .
As you can see in the class diagram , both the classes Ship and Planet are derived from SpaceObject , so they both can be used in the same algorithm with little modification .
This is a good example of code reuse in object oriented design .
The below diagram shows this in action :
Keeping Things Simple : Discarding Old Tasks
As this is a turn based game , at the start of each new turn all the tasks from the last turn become out - of - date .
For instance , that enemy frigate that your destroyer was about to attack could suddenly retreat , or you could discover - to your horror - that the planet you were about to colonize has already been occupied by the enemy .
The easiest thing to do is just discard all tasks and call the resource assignment routine at the start of each turn .
This may seem inefficient , because not all tasks need to be updated , however it does makes the AI code considerably less complicated , as you do n't need to maintain tasks from previous turns .
Keeping the code uncomplicated is especially important in the case of AI algorithms , because these have a tendency grow overly complex very quickly , making debugging and maintenance very difficult .
As well as that , all optimization tasks should be done at the final stage , after the algorithm has been completely finished , and then only if there is real evidence that the algorithm is to slow in the first place .
Mid-turn Surprises
During the course of our turn one of our ships may discover a new enemy colony , or ship .
We could just assign a new attack task to the ship , but that would cause problems if it already had an existing task that was important .
Again , the simplest and most fool - proof thing to do is just run the resource allocation routine again , as this guarantees the most optimal resource assignment .
Conclusion : How Does The Algorithm Work In Real Life ?
This AI algorithm was designed during the development of a 4 x strategy game ( as you may have guessed from the example ) .
In practice one got the impression that there was some sort of real intelligence behind the control of the enemy fleet .
Ships would change tactics unexpectedly .
If an enemy ship ran out of ammo , it would suddenly break off battle and go back to base to re-arm .
If it did n't have enough fuel to make it to base , then it would try to explore uncharted territory ( the only useful task left ) .
As new ships came out of the shipyards , the orders could change for the whole fleet .
Some ships would return for repair and leave the fresh warships take up the attack .
Basically the algorithm provides good " bang for buck " ratio , a fairly uncomplicated algorithm that 's easy to implement and debug , but yet provides a challenging AI opponent .
Even though , the algorithm was designed for one specific type of game it should be easily adaptable to other types of strategy game .

DECATUR , Ga. , March 11 ( UPI ) -- A Georgia judge blocked the release of crime scene pictures of a woman 's nude , decapitated body to Hustler magazine .
Hustler 's effort to obtain pictures of Meredith Emerson , 24 , a University of Georgia graduate abducted while hiking and killed in January 2008 , outraged lawmakers and the woman 's family .

DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Dan Coursey
Wednesday ruled release of the photos could cause irreparable harm in response to a suit filed by Emerson 's family , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported .
It followed a legislative committee 's approval of a measure that would have prevented the pictures from being released through the state 's public disclosure law .
" The death scene photographs are some of the most graphic and horrible photographs I 've ever seen in my 37 years in law enforcement , " Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan said .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel was prepared to intercept another ship bound for Gaza carrying aid and activists Saturday , increasing fears of more international tension over its blockade of the Hamas - run Gaza Strip .
Israel faces an international outcry after its naval operation Monday in which nine Turkish activists were killed on a ship bound for Gaza .
Israel says its blockade of the Gaza Strip , imposed after Hamas seized the territory from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah faction , is meant to prevent arms and military supplies from reaching the territory ’s Hamas rulers .
In Washington , the White House said Israel ’s blockade of the Gaza Strip was unsustainable but urged the Gaza aid vessel to divert to an Israeli port to reduce the risk of violence .
“ We are working urgently with Israel , the Palestinian Authority , and other international partners to develop new procedures for delivering more goods and assistance to Gaza , ” Mike Hammer , spokesman for the White House National Security Council , said Friday .
“ The current arrangements are unsustainable and must be changed .
For now , we call on all parties to join us in encouraging responsible decisions by all sides to avoid any unnecessary confrontations , ” Hammer said in a statement .
The Irish - owned Rachel Corrie -- a converted merchant vessel bought by pro-Palestinian activists and named after an American woman killed by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip in 2003 -- pressed on despite the earlier ship ’s violent interception .
One of the activists on board , Irishman Denis Halliday , a former U.N. assistant secretary - general , told Irish radio on Friday they expected to reach the Israeli - imposed exclusion zone overnight and aimed to continue toward Gaza in daylight .
Friday , Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said : “ We will stop the ship , and also any other ship that will try to harm Israeli sovereignty .
There is no chance the Rachel Corrie will reach the coast of Gaza . ”
The Israeli military declined to give prior details of what it planned to do in the event the navy had to intervene .
In Dublin , Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said in a statement : “ Those on board the Rachel Corrie have indicated that they are ready to accept inspection of their cargo at sea , prior to docking in Gaza . ”
GUNSHOTS AT CLOSE RANGE
Autopsy results on the nine dead Turkish activists from Monday ’s raid showed they had been shot a total of 30 times , many at close range , Britain ’s Guardian newspaper reported on Saturday .
Five were killed by gunshots to the head , it said .

Turkish - American activist Fulkan Dogan was shot five times from less than 45 cm ( 18 inches ) away , in the face , the back of the head , twice in the leg and once in the back , the paper said .
In addition to those killed , 48 others received gunshot wounds and six activists were still missing .
In his angriest rhetoric yet , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan accused the Jewish state Friday of violating its own biblical commandments .
“ I am speaking to them in their own language .
The sixth commandment says ‘ thou shalt not kill ’ .
Did you not understand ? ” Erdogan said in a televised speech to party supporters .

“ I ’ll say again .
I say in English ‘ you shall not kill ’ .
Did you still not understand ?.
So I ’ll say to you in your own language .
I say in Hebrew ‘ Lo Tirtzakh ’ . ”
Turkey , Israel ’s only Muslim ally , has threatened to rethink its entire relationship .
Thousands of protesters sang Turkey ’s praises at demonstrations in Egypt and Lebanon Friday .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a forum of senior ministers Friday to discuss the arrival of the Rachel Corrie and actions to be taken following the international criticism Israel faced after Monday ’s events .
A foreign ministry statement said Israel wanted to avoid confrontation and invited the Rachel Corrie to dock in Israel ’s own port of Ashdod , where its cargo could be unloaded , inspected and transferred to Gaza if it contains no contraband .
“ We in Israel have no desire for confrontation ...

North Korea vows ' physical response ' to US exercise Published duration 23 July 2010

The US - South Korean war games will involve 200 aircraft and some 8,000 personnel
North Korea has promised a " physical response " to joint US - South Korean military exercises this weekend .
The comments came as Asian foreign ministers met in Vietnam for a regional security forum .
The forum has been dominated by the crisis resulting from North Korea 's alleged sinking of a South Korean warship in March .
The US has accused Pyongyang of " provocative " behaviour and on Wednesday announced new sanctions .
North Korea 's delegation spokesman at the Association of South East Asian Nations ( Asean ) Regional Forum ( ARF ) in Hanoi said the military exercises - which begin on Sunday - were an example of 19th century " gunboat diplomacy " .
" It is a new century and Asian countries are in need of peace and development , and DPRK [ North Korea ] is also moving to that end , " said Ri Tong -il .
He said the exercises went beyond defensive training and would involve " sophisticated weapon equipment " .
" It is a threat to the Korean peninsula and the region of Asia as a whole .
And the DPRK 's position is clear : there will be a physical response to the threat imposed by the United States militarily . "
Washington and Seoul say the war games - involving the aircraft carrier USS George Washington , 20 other ships and submarines , 100 aircraft and 8,000 personnel - are intended to deter North Korean aggression .
China has criticised the plans and warned against any action which might " exacerbate regional tensions " .
But Japan is sending four military observers , in an apparent endorsement of the drills .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who is attending the forum , declined to comment directly on North Korea 's comments , but said the door remained opened for it to return to talks if it committed to irreversible de-nuclearisation .
In comments earlier in the day , she accused Pyongyang of launching a " campaign of provocative , dangerous behaviour " .
On Wednesday , the US announced it was to impose new sanctions on North Korea , aimed at halting nuclear proliferation and the import of luxury goods .
The Asean Regional Forum was attended by foreign ministers from 27 nations , including China , Japan , North Korea and the US .
The BBC's Rachel Harvey in Hanoi said there had been hopes that the forum could be a chance to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula .
But if anything , the proximity of the protagonists seemed to inflame sentiment , our correspondent adds .
South Korea sought to rally support behind a statement condemning North Korea over the warship sinking .
But a closing statement from the forum only expressed " deep concern " over the incident , echoing a UN statement that fell short of blaming Pyongyang .
China - which is North Korea 's closest ally - has been reluctant to take strong measures against its unpredictable neighbour .
The Cheonan warship sank in March near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border with the loss of 46 South Korean sailors .
An international investigation said it was sunk by a North Korean torpedo , but Pyongyang has rejected the charge and demanded its own inquiry .
In a separate development on Friday , North Korean and US - led UN Command military officials held rare talks on the sinking in the truce village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) between the two Koreas .
Disney Pictures is gearing up for a December release of Tron : Legacy with a line of cutting edge toys that defy gravity .
Most are beautiful dark - chrome replicas of vehicles and gizmos from the film , complete with neon - glowing trim , but to really feel like Kevin Flynn barreling through cyber space , we recommend the zero gravity light cycles .
These are n’t your father ’s Hot Wheels–as the name implies , these futuristic remote control vehicles can actually climb walls .
“ One of the things the light cycles can do in the movie is ride in the third dimension , ” says Chris Heatherly , VP of Disney Toys and Electronics , who gave Fast Company a sneak peak at the upcoming Tron toy line .
“ We recreated that using Spin Master ‘s zero G technology that lets you ride up the walls and upside down on the ceiling . ”
In addition to the zero gravity tech , the cycles also feature six - foot light emitting trails .
When two bikes are racing against each other , and one crosses through the other ’s light trail , it ’ll fall off the wall or ceiling , just as in the film .
Russia has come out this morning against the actions of the U.S. and EU , which have just put new sanctions against Iran in place , according to Ria Novosti .
Those EU and U.S. sanctions against Iran come outside the plans of the UN Security Council and the Iran Six , of which Russia is a part .
Iran and Russia had previously been at odds over comments Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made suggesting that Russia was in the pocket of its Western partners .
But now that conflict has been minimized in the wake of the U.S. and EU adopting unilateral sanctions against Iran .
Such fracturing of consensus in the fragile Iran 6 group , which includes the U.S. , Britain , France , Germany , China , and Russia , could have an impact on future negotiations with Iran and attempts to control their nuclear ambitions .
Certainly , Iran is doing everything they can to split up the group , including posturing against Germany and Russia .

Obviously , many of those in the “ Freedom Flotilla ” were not engaged in a humanitarian mission .
Had that been their prime motivation , they would have accepted Israel ’s offer to escort them to Ashdod Port and arrange for the delivery of their supplies to Gaza , after security checks , over land .
They also would have agreed without hesitation to convey a package from the family of the Israeli soldier held hostage by Hamas for almost four years in Gaza , Gilad Schalit .
RELATED:Obviously , too , many of those who sailed toward Gaza were not “ peace activists . ”
While those aboard five of the vessels in the flotilla did not violently oppose the IDF soldiers who came to intercept them , the video footage released by the IDF in the course of Monday confirmed earlier official descriptions by Israel of soldiers being premeditatedly and ruthlessly attacked as they tried to board the largest of the vessels , the Inexplicably , only a small contingent of naval commandos was dispatched to take control of a ship carrying hundreds of activists .
And the commandos came on board carrying paintball guns , apparently under the misconception that the takeover of thewould be , if not a game , then certainly not a confrontation with an enemy .
The IDF ’s intelligence was clearly deeply flawed .
As the footage showed , the outnumbered , under - equipped and incorrectly prepared commandos found themselves not grappling with unruly peace activists or demonstrators , to whom they had been ordered to show “ restraint , ” but being viciously attacked before they had barely set foot on deck .
The clips showed clusters of people swarming around each of the commandos , and beating them over and over with clubs and bars in scenes sickeningly reminiscent of the lynching of IDF reservists in the Ramallah police station 10 years ago .
There was footage of one of the “ activists ” stabbing a soldier , of a petrol bomb being thrown at the troops , a stun grenade .
And the troops themselves reported being sprayed with tear gas , attacked with iron bars , knives and sticks , and of efforts , reportedly successful in at least one case , to grab the pistols some were also carrying .
There were reports of gunfire directed at the troops , and of soldiers jumping into the sea to escape attack .
Soldiers were fighting for their lives , said the IDF spokesman , Avi Benayahu ( in Hebrew ) .
“ It was a lynch .
It was an ambush .
” The navy chief , Eliezer Marom , told an early afternoon press conference that the resulting toll of the dead and injured could have been “ much worse , ” that the confrontation could have ended even more unhappily .
But it also could have ended a great deal better .
At this writing , Israel is facing a battle to maintain diplomatic relations with the flotilla - sponsoring Turks , condemnation from much of the Arab world , milder expressions of concern and criticism from Western nations , a concerted diplomatic campaign against it at the UN , and exacerbated fears of internal and regional violence .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak noted that thewas under the control of the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation ( the IHH ) , which he described as “ a violent , extremist organization that supports terrorism . ”
Both he and Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon stated with good reason that the entire “ Freedom Flotilla ” had been a deliberate “ provocation .
”
In such circumstances , facing such hostility , it is hard to fathom why the IDF so underestimated the challenge its soldiers would face , and thus erred so strikingly over both its choice of how to thwart the flotilla , and over the number of soldiers , and the equipment , it sent into the battle at sea .
That Israel would lose the “ media war ” – against what were largely depicted internationally as well - intentioned human rights activists trying to defy the Israeli blockade by bringing supplies to Gaza – was a given .
Successive governments refuse to take the “ second battlefield ” seriously – criminally ignoring the imperative to allocate the appropriate resources so that Israel is equipped to effectively articulate its various challenges ahead of time , and in real time , in international , diplomatic and legal forums .
Israel is being further overwhelmed day by day in the newer world ofsocial media :
Those aboard the flotilla , and their supportersworldwide , are proving to be expert exponents of Twitter and otherinstantaneous social media channels ( as my colleague Amir Mizrochdetails in an op - ed elsewhere in these pages ) .
Official Israel , bycontrast , could barely manage to depart from Hebrew long enough tomanage a statement and an answer in English at its major pressconferences during Monday .
Israel was also further hampered by the absence of its prime ministeroverseas .
When Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was finally heardlater Monday , speaking to the press with Canada ’s Prime MinisterStephen Harper alongside him , his powerful descriptions of the way IDFsoldiers were confronted on the– “ theywere mobbed , clubbed , beaten and stabbed , ” he said – showed howeffective a carefully articulated narrative can be .
But so much for the arenas in which Israel is routinely inept .
What wasso worrying about Monday ’s performance was the military misjudgment andmisassessment – and the potential impact on Israel ’s deterrentcapability of the failure to efficiently overwhelm the forces arrayedagainst it on what amounted to an enemy vessel .
Israel is concerned with eminently good reason about the smuggling ofweaponry into Hamas - controlled Gaza .
It may have felt it had no choicebut to intercept a flotilla carrying it knew not what to the Hamasterror state .
Why did it not anticipate that the activists andsupporters of “ a violent , extremist organization that supportsterrorism ” would act precisely according to type ?
Des Moines , Iowa ( CNN ) -- When Rep. Ron Paul walked into Hy - Vee Hall last month , a single blue sign with a simple message was placed near the escalator that took him upstairs to a fundraiser attended by 300 Republican activists .
It read : " President Ron Paul 2012 . "
The sign was symbolic in many ways : Even as Iowa Republicans are focused on midterm elections , the 2012 presidential contest is not far from their minds .
And it was just three years ago that Paul did not receive an invitation to participate in a presidential candidate forum held in this very building .
The sight of the Texas congressman riding the escalator up to address this group of influential Republicans was illustrative of how he has risen from a little - known congressman and afterthought presidential candidate to the national spokesman on libertarian philosophy .
All of this comes from a man who has no illusions that he can win his party 's presidential nomination , but that wo n't stop him from running again in 2012 if he decides to do so .
" It is probably hard to believe , but I look at it a little bit differently than others , " Paul said in an interview during his recent visit to Iowa .
" I do n't expect to be president .
I do n't expect to be .
That does n't mean I wo n't run for president , but I am really energized when I think we make inroads ... to broaden the outreach on the philosophy I have been talking about for 40 years . "
His advocacy of limited government , disdain for the Federal Reserve and belief that the U.S. should withdraw its troops from Afghanistan has attracted an eclectic following of young people , anti-war activists and those wary of government intrusion .
Paul began his 2008 White House run as a third - tier candidate , a gadfly with little support and even less money .
Paul was never considered a serious frontrunner for the GOP nomination , but an explosion of support in the fall of 2007 , fueled by online contributions , carried him into Iowa .
There , he received 10 percent of the vote in the caucuses .
He officially ended his presidential campaign in June 2008 , well after Sen. John McCain had received enough support to win the Republican nomination .
" I do n't ever take personal credit as much as being in the right place at the right time and maybe saying the right things , " Paul said .
" I have said the same things for 30 years when it came to financial bubbles .
See , the business cycle theory is what motivated me to get into politics . "
On this night in Des Moines , Paul stuck to his talking points .
He never mentioned a possible presidential run in 2012 .
Instead ,
Paul spoke of limited government and the need for government officials to follow the Constitution , which just so happened to be the theme of the Iowa GOP 's fundraiser .
Paul 's address was bookended by standing ovations .
" I have been excited about and what he is talking about , " John Bowery , a Republican from Shenandoah , Iowa , said after Paul 's speech .
" I am sorry he did n't get more attention in 2008 .
I do n't know if he is going to run in 2012 .
If someone like him does , I will be all for it . "
Paul is an enigma in the Republican Party .
He champions less government and a socially conservative philosophy , which would seem to play well with GOP base voters such as Bowery .
Yet Paul , who was the Libertarian Party 's presidential nominee in 1988 , does n't embrace the Republican brand .
Party leaders and the GOP establishment types are not so smitten with him either .
This is problematic in a presidential run , where well - oiled political machines are needed in key states to help build support and get - out - the - vote efforts in primaries and caucuses .
He does credit the Republican Party for sharpening its focus on the economy , but he does n't speak in terms of " we " but rather " they . "
" I think that the Republicans have , whether it is out of merit or accidental , they are in a good position right now mainly because they have talked about economics , " Paul said .
" And their talk is good about watching the spending and watching the deficits and people are concerned about runaway government . "
But Paul does express some skepticism that GOP promises of reforming Washington and cutting government might just be talk .
" I think they have the subject right , and they talk about it , " he said .
" I think where they are going to come up short maybe not before the election , but afterwards .
" Where are they going to cut ?
Do they have a plan to cut ?
It is easy to vote against the spending when you are in opposition .
But where are they going to cut ?
And I think that is what I have talked about ... especially these past four years .
And that is where we challenged the Republicans . "
Last month 's trip to Iowa was his third to the state since November 2009 , so it begs the question :
Is Paul trying to lay the groundwork for a 2012 White House run ?
" I am very serious about thinking about it all the time , " Paul said about his possible presidential aspirations .
" My answer is always the same thing :
You know I have n't ruled it out , but I have no plans to do it . "
For now , Paul will continue to travel the country to promote his philosophy , while his 2008 presidential campaign operation has morphed into the Campaign for Liberty , a 500,000 - member organization that promotes libertarian views .
Paul also has a small political action committee that doles out contributions to " liberty - based candidates , " a spokesman said .

Why has n't Joseph Ratzinger ( nick : benedict16 ) , a criminal and the don of an international pedophile mafia been arrested ?
Why is n't he tried before an international court , like the Nazi leaders , Slobodan Milosevic and so many others were ?
It has been proven that uncounted members of his unholy gang put their anointed penises in the anuses of equally uncounted , underage , non consenting boys and girls or performed other sexual acts with children entrusted to their care .
It has been proven that officials of this organization of perverts knew that these crimes were going on , but covered them up .
It has been proven that they threatened their victims into silence .
Why is this criminal organization , the Unholy Catholic Church of Rome , still active ?
Why are n't the chief criminals , to begin with Joseph Ratzinger , behind bars pending further investigations ?
Just some questions .

Obesity levels among pregnant women have reached epidemic levels , putting the health of their babies at risk , experts say .
The health watchdog NICE has issued new guidelines encouraging women in England to attain a healthy weight before they get pregnant .
It also advises them against eating for two once they conceive .
It says almost half of women of childbearing age are overweight or obese , which could harm their child .
Many women feel they are offered confusing and conflicting advice about their health during pregnancy .
The guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence are aimed at cutting through that .
They discuss weight and exercise before , during and after pregnancy .
Celebrity culture
If a woman is obese during pregnancy , she has an increased risk of developing serious complications like pre-eclampsia , gestational diabetes , miscarriage and stillbirth .
She is also more likely to have a Caesarean section .
It can set a worrying example , by encouraging new mums to embark on drastic weight lost programmes , which are not only unrealistic , but can also be very unhealthy Belinda Phipps , NCT
NICE says women with a body mass index of more than 30 should be encouraged to lose weight before they become pregnant .
During pregnancy , losing weight can be harmful to the unborn child , so women are advised to eat healthily and to do gentle exercise .
After they have given birth , women are told they should lose their baby weight gradually .
Experts from NICE say celebrities who regain their pre-baby figures very fast can put unrealistic pressure on ordinary mothers .
" Women should understand that weight loss after birth takes time , and physical activity and gradual weight loss will not affect their ability to breastfeed , " said Professor Mike Kelly , NICE public health director .
" Losing weight gradually can actually help women maintain a healthy weight in the long term . "
NICE also wants local authorities to offer women more opportunities to exercise , at an affordable price , and with creches for their children .
" There 's been an exponential increase in obesity among pregnant women , " said Professor Lucilla Poston , from King 's College , London , who helped develop the guidance .
" It 's very worrying , as there are so many potential risks for the mother and her baby . "
The National Childbirth Trust welcomed the move to bring clarity to the issue .
Chief executive Belinda Phipps said women were presented with a lot of conflicting advice about exercise .
" It can set a worrying example , by encouraging new mums to embark on drastic weight lost programmes , which are not only unrealistic , but can also be very unhealthy , " she said .
Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran , president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said he hoped the new guidelines would be actively promoted by the government .
" We need to support women who are overweight by encouraging them to lead healthier lifestyles .
This includes providing them with advice on diet , nutrition and exercise .
" These healthy behaviours should occur throughout a woman 's lifetime and not just when she is considering starting a family or during pregnancy . "
Some things speak for themselves .

Basil Davidson , the radical journalist whose books introduced a mass audience to Africa ’s history , died on July 9 at the age of 95 .
Davidson was a participant in , witness to , and chronicler of people ’s struggles against imperialism , fascism , and racism .
He battled alongside partisans in Europe during World War II , traveled with guerrillas fighting for independence in Portuguese colonies , and campaigned against apartheid in South Africa .
Davidson was a true scholar - activist who was as determined in the combat zone as he was behind a desk .
Born in Bristol , England , Davidson left school at 16 to pursue a career in journalism .
He worked as a foreign correspondent for notable London publications such as the Economist , before joining Britain ’s anti-Nazi Special Operations Executive in the late 1930s .
Multilingual , imposing , and daring , Davidson coordinated resistance activities in several countries .
He parachuted into Yugoslavia , where he joined Tito ’s Communists in 1943 - 44 , then led a band of partisans who liberated Genoa in neighboring Italy .
After the war , he returned to reporting , based in Paris and writing for leading British newspapers , and he was active in labor causes .
In the 1950s he traveled to Africa , the continent to which he devoted his research skills , literary talents , and political militancy for the remainder of his life .
Inspired by the anti-colonial movement sweeping Africa and committed to the Pan - Africanist program of Africa ’s new leaders , Davidson immersed himself in writing about Africa ’s present and past .
His early , now classic , studies of Africa were published at a time when much of the continent was under colonial occupation , Jim Crow racism prevailed in the American South , and most Western intellectuals dismissed African history as nonexistent .
Davidson highlighted the magnificence of Africa ’s distant past , from the ancient city of Meroe to the powerful empire of Mali , in award - winning books such as Lost Cities of Africa ( 1959 ) .
In his effort to counter Western ignorance and stereotypes about Africa , Davidson emphasized its role in world history , educating readers about the invention of iron - working in sub-Saharan Africa , for example .
An Afrocentrist , he rejected colonialist scholarship which separated ancient Egypt from the rest of the continent , showing that Egypt was an African civilization .
His books also explored the negative consequences of Africa ’s more recent engagement with Europe , most notably in The African Slave Trade ( 1961 ) , one of the first comprehensive studies of the subject .
Davidson covered current events in Africa , too , especially the fight for self - determination .
His articles and books written on the front lines of the anti-colonial struggle in Africa helped raise awareness around the world .
He shaped British public opinion in favor of decolonization and his publications were devoured by civil rights activists and proponents of ethnic studies in the U.S .
His first African monograph , A Report on Southern Africa ( 1952 ) , was an eyewitness account of the implementation of the newly enacted policies of racial segregation known as apartheid .
His 1951 trip was arranged by the Garment Workers ’ Union of South Africa and during his visit he met with Nelson Mandela , Oliver Tambo , and other leaders of the African National Congress .
Later he was deemed a “ prohibited immigrant ” by the apartheid government and denied entry to South Africa and other white - ruled colonies .
Unbowed , he continued to speak out about the crimes of apartheid and he served as vice - president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Britain from 1969 to1984 .
Davidson celebrated the independence of Ghana in 1957 and the policies of its president , Kwame Nkrumah , who welcomed liberation fighters from throughout Africa to study and train in his country .
In 1964 , Davidson taught at the University of Ghana and later he published a biography of the Ghanaian leader entitled Black Star : A View of the Life and Times of Kwame Nkrumah ( 1973 ) .
Davidson was the first Western journalist to travel to the liberated zones of the Portuguese colonies of Guinea - Bissau and Angola .
Amilcar Cabral , the leader of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde who in 1967 invited him to the freed areas of Guinea - Bissau , wrote that Davidson “ accepted every risk and fatigue that could bring him into personal touch with the way our people live now . ”
Davidson later recounted his trip in the book No Fist is Big Enough to Hide the Sky ( 1981 ) .
At the height of the armed struggle , Davidson walked 300 miles on foot to eastern Angola to visit the zone liberated by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola .
His account of this epic journey , called In the Eye of the Storm : Angola ’s People , was published in 1972 .
In more recent years , Davidson explored the problems of postcolonial Africa which he principally attributed to the imposition of Western institutions such as multiparty liberal democracy .
His most important work on this topic was titled The Black Man ’s Burden : Africa and the Curse of the Nation - State ( 1993 ) , in which he argued the solutions to Africa ’s troubles must come from Africans themselves rooted in a keen sense of their own history and cultures .
Although Davidson was never a member of any communist party , he often was labeled a “ communist ” and at times he was blacklisted like many leftists during the Cold War era .
A decorated military veteran , his own country nevertheless vetoed his appointment as an editor at UNESCO , as punishment for his radical politics .
But , Davidson remained true to his principles .
He once described his work as “ obviously anti-imperialist . ”
He championed Marxist organizations and leaders – including Nkrumah and Cabral – who fought against colonialism and apartheid .
And he condemned the hypocrisy of Western liberals who turned a blind eye to the crimes of imperialism .
Davidson is remembered for the sacrifices he made and the role he played in liberating Africa .
The MPLA , which now governs an independent Angola , issued a statement this week mourning his death .
“ At this moment of grief and sorrow , ” it reads , “ the Politburo , on behalf of all party members , bends before the memory of so eminent personality and forwards to the bereaved family and the Mozambique - Angola Committee , of which he was a member , the deepest condolences . ”
At the presentation of an honorary degree from the University of Bristol in 1999 , Davidson was recognized as “ one of the great radical figures of the 20th century . ”
The presentation continued , “ He has pursued , throughout his life , a just cause , without fear for his own personal safety .
He has provided an inspiration for millions , through his books and television work , and by his academic writings gave us African history , when many denied there could be any African history . ”
Davidson ’s impact is evident in the high school and university classrooms across Africa and beyond where his textbooks , such as West Africa before the Colonial Era : A History to 1850 ( 1998 ) , as well as his acclaimed eight - part documentary series , Africa : A Voyage of Discovery ( 1984 ) , are required learning materials .
Enter any bookstore or library with a section devoted to Africa , and you certainly will find several of Davidson ’s works on display .
Pay homage to this great scholar - activist by reading one of those books , and follow his example by committing yourself to the struggle against imperialism in its many forms today .

It ’s been ages since I ’ve eaten at Red Lobster but the memory of those yummy Cheddar Biscuits lives on .
Since I was making a hearty , healthy soup for dinner ( recipe tomorrow ! ) , I decided that I ’d try to find a recipe for these decadent biscuits ( since I was having a healthy soup , I figured I could splurge a bit ) .
Unfortunately , every recipe I found called for Bisquick ™ which is something I do n’t regularly buy .
Luckily , I found a substitute for the boxed mix and I must say , these biscuits were fabulous !
And it was n’t any more trouble than using that boxed mix .
( I used unbleached all - purpose flour , 1 % milk and fresh parsley ) .
Print This !
Summary :
These cheddar garlic biscuits are very similar to those biscuits you might have enjoyed at that certain seafood restaurant .
Cheesey and buttery , they go great as a side for any meal .
Ingredients 2 cups all - purpose flour ( unbleached or regular )
3 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/3 cup butter , cold , cut into chunks
1 heaping cup grated cheddar cheese ( sharp flavoured is best )
1/2 – 2/3 cups milk
2 Tbsp. canola or vegetable oil
Topping :
3 Tbsp. butter
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. dried parsley flakes or 1 Tbsp. fresh parsley , finely chopped Instructions Preheat oven to 400° F .
In a large bowl , combine flour , baking powder , salt and garlic powder .
Whisk together to combine thoroughly .
Add chunks of butter .
Using a pastry cutter or two knives , cut butter into flour until it is coarse , pea-sized ( does n’t need to be fine ) .
Add grated cheddar cheese and stir in .
Add the 2 Tbsp. oil to the 1/2 cup milk .
Add milk / oil mixture to the dough and stir until the dough is moistened and no longer dry and powdery .
( Should n’t be sticky , just moist enough to hold together )
You may need to add a bit more milk if your dough is dry .
Drop approximately 1/4 cup portions of the dough onto an un-greased cookie sheet using an ice cream scoop or large spoon .
Bake for 15 - 17 minutes .
While biscuits are baking , melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small bowl in your microwave .
Stir in 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and the parsley .
When biscuits come out of the oven , use a brush to spread this garlic butter over the tops of all the biscuits .
Use up all of the butter .
Serve warm .
Makes one dozen biscuits .

• Gunners had turned down € 35 m bid for captain • ' Arsenal do n't want to sit down and negotiate with us '

This article is more than 10 years old
The Barcelona board spokesman Toni Freixa says the Catalan club are doing all they can to sign the Arsenal captain Cesc Fábregas but revealed the Gunners are simply unwilling to negotiate the sale of their midfielder .
Since having a € 35 m ( £ 29.3 ) bid turned down earlier this summer , Barça have made several attempts to speak to Arsenal , but Freixa says the London club are unwilling to budge .
" Arsenal do n't want to sit down and negotiate with us .
It 's not a problem with the wishes of Cesc or of Barça – they simply do n't want to negotiate , " he said .
Fábregas still has five years to run on his Arsenal contract .
However , the Barcelona midfielder Xavi claimed last week that the 23 - year - old told his Spain team - mates he wants a return to Catalonia .
The Barça coach , Pep Guardiola , has also recently reiterated his desire to sign Fábregas , although he conceded the final decision rests with the Gunners .
Meanwhile , Barcelona are looking to bring in a defensive midfielder as cover for Sergio Busquets and as a replacement for Yaya Touré , who recently joined Manchester City .
" The technical secretary is working hard on that , " Freixa said .
This project took 18 days from this Russian guy to accomplish .
It all has began after he has watched that cartoon .
An idea sparked thru his head “ I want to build such thing to hold my computer stuff in it ” .

In his recent biography of Lyndon Johnson , Flawed Giant , Robert Dallek writes ,  During a private conversation with some reporters who pressed him to explain why we were in Vietnam , Johnson lost his patience .
According to Arthur Goldberg , LBJ unzipped his fly , drew out his substantial organ and declared ,  This is why !
Way back then , President Johnson could be confident that the reporters would not share this moment of presidential bonding with the public .
Quaint questions of taste aside , it might not have struck them as news anyway .
The presidents fascination with his substantial organ was an old story to the White House press corps .
I first heard of it when I was working on a profile of White House press secretary George Reedy for The Saturday Evening Post .
Everybody in the press room had a glancing acquaintance with the Presidents privates , which he was forever prodding and redistributing through his pants .
And ambassadors calling to present their credentials sometimes had a closer acquaintance than that .
It was Mr. Johnsons occasional practice to invite new envoys for a swim in the small indoor pool built for FDR .
Skinny - dipping was the long - established tradition , which allowed the President to establish genital dominance at the start of a diplomatic relationship .
And down on the LBJ ranch near Johnson City , Texas , Mr. Johnson liked to go fishing and whisky - drinking on Johnson Lake with the Secret Service and a few close friends .
The small boat had no facilities , which meant that the president had to relieve himself over the side like everybody else .
As Mr. Johnson was zipping up , one of the agents told me , he always made the same little joke :  It aint too cold , but it sure is deep . 
Back in the White House , the President was well known for sharing the most private moments with his staff .
Rather than interrupt himself , he would leave the door open when he went to the toilet so that cabinet members could watch him as he sat on the throne , issuing orders and so forth .
None of this made it into my George Reedy piece , of course , those being simple and innocent times except for race riots , draft resistance , campus revolt , drug - taking , free love , urban terrorism , and the carpet - bombing of small Southeast Asian nations by giant , eight - engined , Guam - based B - 52s .
The George Reedy piece didnt make it into the magazine either , its subject having jumped or been pushed from his White House job before the article could run .
The same disaster was to happen soon enough to Lyndon Johnson himself , allowing Mr. Nixon and his trusty sidekick , Dr. Kissinger , to take over the war in January of 1969 .
The next month I became a very minor sidekick of Mr. Nixon myself , having been posted as press attaché to our embassy in Laos .
The first person I met when I got off the plane was my former editor at The Saturday Evening Post , Don Schanche , who was in Vientiane to do research for a book .
Too much later , in a saloon called The Third Eye , I was going on about how pathetic it was for a big boy in his sixties like Johnson still to be bragging about his whopper .
I wandered off into a confused thesis to the effect that the former presidents compulsion to live up to his penis might even have been what got all of us stuck over here in the Big Muddy , where it aint too cold but it sure is deep .
 Johnson doesnt have a particularly big one ,  Schanche said , stopping me from further foolishness .
The Saturday Evening Post , it turned out , had once been planning a special issue on the Vietnam war .
When the president heard about this he invited Mr. Schanche and another editor to Washington for the famous Johnson treatment .
It included the Full Monty , poolside .
 I dont remember being impressed ,  Mr. Schanche told me .
 If anything , it was a little smaller than average . 
There went my thesis , which in any case had begun sounding shaky even to me .
We werent in Southeast Asia because the presidential organ was bigger than average , but because it was smaller .
Another inch or two and -- who knows ?-- Mr. Johnson might have had enough self - confidence to pull out harmlessly from Vietnam as General De Gaulle had earlier withdrawn from Algeria .
In any event Johnsons disturbing fondness for flashing raised a character issue of real consequence , and one which should have been reported at the time .
The Presidents in - your - face immodesty and puerile boasting suggested personal insecurities so crippling that they should not have been left to future historians like Mr. Dallek .
President Clintons more recent exposures , on the other hand , could have been ignored by the press and the special prosecutor with perfect safety to the Republic .
Never mind how tacky Mr. Clintons behavior with Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky may have been , it pointed to no character flaw that really mattered much to the nation or the world .
The difference lay not in the two presidents  acts of exposure , which were equivalently low - rent , but in their choice of audience .
Mr. Clinton , needing above all to be loved , exposed himself to women ; Mr. Johnson , needing above all to dominate , chose men .
The lust for love is arguably private business , but the lust for bullying can lead , in a president , to the very public business of war .
The Giants expect to have safety Kenny Phillips on the field for the start of the regular season , but they wo n’t take any chances with his surgically repaired knee and plan to hold him out of the start of training camp .
“ We just want him to take it slow because we want him to be our starting safety when we line up against Carolina on [ September ] 12th , ” General Manager Jerry Reese told the New York Daily News .
Phillips , who played in only two games last season , is recovering from microfracture surgery , and Reese and coach Tom Coughlin are in agreement that the prudent course of action is to have Phillips open training camp on the sidelines .
“ He will work with the training staff and he ’ll be observed on a practice by practice , morning , noon and night basis , ” Coughlin said .
“ How he recovers and how fast he comes back from the extended exercise they ’re going to put him through , that will determine when he comes on the field . ”
Phillips has said he wants to get on the field as soon as possible .
But as long as he’s on the field by early September , Coughlin and Reese will be happy .
Divorce means different things to different people .
For some , it is a highly emotional process that comes unexpectedly .
For others , it is the legal step that must be taken to move forward .

Gold Rushes : A Playful History
Lego Gold Rush
Recently , a great friend referred Toy Tech to an animation entitled Lego Gold Rush .
This one minute , twenty - eight second video poignantly portrays the golden hopes and granite disappointments associated with miner 's fever .
Life - giving and death - dealing circumstances are set within the Earth 's heart , at once a king 's chamber and robber 's tomb .
The video also features our favorite Lego theme - Western .
Watch it here :
When history promises climbs to wealth 's highest mounts , but , too often , alas , delivers breathtaking plummets to valleys of ruin , a certain fascination lingers well after the events themselves .
( It is estimated that during the last 400 years , less than 5 % of gold prospectors have netted wealth from their search activities in excess of personal expenses . )
Gold Rushes , in archetypal fashion , provide drama without limit .
They carry with them a reputation virtually synonymous with high adventure , comic relief , and , desperate adversity .
It is this marriage of golden dreams and shaded nightmares that is the subject of this essay .
Language
The term " rush " itself in modern parlance is used in a variety of ways .
" What a rush it was to finally understand that organic formula , " Samantha might say .
Or , " It was a real rush when Billy was named team captain , " a proud parent interjects .
And , " Terrell rushed for over 150 yards for the Cowboys last week , " a delighted fan announces .
Or , " It is " rush " week for the sororities , " a campus tour guide explains .
" Sorority hopefuls are striving to impress the upper- class women of Delta Nu . "
As important in a personal sense that these kinds of rushes might be , most have little life - changing impacts beyond the individuals involved .
However , that was not always so .
When the word " rush " was whispered prior to the 20th century , the very soughing of the term seemed to sweep from depths unknown images of the sweetest kind .
The indefatigable spirits of adventurers heard once again the siren sound .
Yukon Gold Rush
The following two film clips portray the playfulness of the human spirit .
The ability of man to see comic relief in the face of the harshest realities is captured by Charles Chaplin in his own inimical way .
Chaplin 's subject : The Yukon Gold Rush of 1897 .
See :
- and -
At least one million persons planned to abandon their desperately poor lives to trek to the Yukon .
In actuality , it is estimated that the number of persons finally arriving in the Northern Territories ( 100,000 ) was uncannily similar to the total of hopeful souls who had trekked to California just 37 years earlier ( 1848 -53 ) .
The difference was that , in California , Europeans comprised the bulk of the adventurers , while in the Canadian rush , the majority of prospectors were Americans attempting to escape the economic misery that was all too common in the US during the 1880's .
The Yukon Trail Summit Today
Some would - be miners were well provisioned , carrying with them as much as a ton and a half of equipment and supplies .
Others arrived with nothing more than the summer clothes upon their backs .
Often young men , impoverished by the American economic downturn , were staked by their families who had sold everything to invest their hopes upon the shoulders of their sons .
Thousands died of the cold , found frozen with eyes open in the snow and ice .
Others fell from high ridges that gave way or from which they simply tumbled , a consequence of the treacherous footing .
( In many cases , what actually happened to loved ones was never determined .
They simply disappeared . )
There were very few women who made the journey north .
However , those who did were , for a variety of reasons , much more likely to " strike it rich " than their male counterparts .
See excellent Yukon Rush period photos with voice - over :
See 1958 Yukon Rush historical film :
It is estimated that five million ounces of gold were taken from the North during the Yukon Gold Rush .
As impressive as that number is , even today , large quantities of gold are still being harvested from the land .
Near Fairbanks , Alaska , for example , the Fort Knox mining operation removes three hundred thousand dollars worth of gold per day .
That 's approximately three standard gold bars , depending upon the world price of gold .

California Gold Rush
The rush to gold that had the most lasting impact on the political face of the North American continent was the California Gold Rush of 1848 - 53 .
It was as a consequence of this rush to gold ( combined with 12,000 of General Scott 's American troops occupying Veracruz , Mexico , and a 15 million dollar purchase offer from the US to Mexico that Mexico was not allowed to refuse ) that California became a US territory in 1848 , and subsequently a State in 1850 .
( See colorful sketches )
Approximately 100,000 persons responded to the news that gold had been discovered at Sutter 's Mill in California .
Most of those who did respond were from places other than the United States , primarily Latin America , China , Europe and Australia .
Life was hard .
However , since the weather in California is substantially better on average than that of the Arctic , far fewer corpses turned up , although the numbers lost to disease and violence were still depressingly large .
Miner and author Franklin Langsworthy summed it up when he wrote , " .... the California Rush was a pilgrimage in a strange land , a banishment from good society , a living death , and a punishment of the worst kind , and the time spent here ought to be considered as a blank period in existence , and accordingly struck from the record of one 's days . "
( The name Langsworthy is probably not destined to be affixed upon the logo of the California Chamber of Commerce . )

Arltunga Gold Rush
Finally , in order to give credit due to rushes beyond the confines of North America , let us not forget a particular gold rush set in a location that could n't be more different from , but assuredly equally as harsh , as the two locations thus far discussed .
This was the rush to gold at Arltunga , Central Australia in 1886 .
Central Australia is not one of the most dreary places on Earth , if one is unconcerned about maximally parched stony land for hundreds of miles , heat well in excess of 100 degrees for days on end , and , oh yes , the most poisonous and aggressive snakes on the planet .
( Except for those sometimes cited impediments , Arltunga , Australia is a virtual Disneyland . )
See :
Snakes you ask ?
Yes , snakes we respond .
The interior of that great Island harbors perhaps the most aggressively venomous snake in the world , the Inland Taipan ( Photo ) , sometimes known simply as the Fierce Snake .
One nip from a grumpy Fierce Snake contains enough venom to kill over 100 persons .
The venom acts upon every system .
It contains neurotoxins as well as hemotoxins in abundance .
However , just in case one does n't wish to wait for the Interior , the Coastal Taipan ( Photo ) is even more deadly , if that were possible .
There is also something else we need to know .
That is , these snakes are swift , traveling up to 19 miles per hour in bursts .
The fastest human foot speed on record is ( 27.79 mph ) , seen during a 100 meter sprint ( average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter ) by Usain Bolt in 2009 .
Let 's hope that the Taipans do n't know that we can't keep it up for much more than 100 meters .
To be fair , despite their fierce appearance , no RECORDED human deaths have been attributed to the Taipan .
On the other hand , if a miner were alone in the heart of the Outback , and tripped upon what he at first believed to be another inconveniently placed stone ................ well .
See Taipan video ( does not play on the sensational ) :
Cookies and milk are looking better and better .
We must admit that gold rushes are exciting .
They involve high expectations , and high adventure .
And , they inevitably inspire a certain level of play , a universal phenomenon among creative men and women .
In that vein , next time in this space , we are going to discuss just that aspect of gold seeking , that is , play , and how in today 's world , gold prospecting , the kind that can be done with just a pan , hammer , and scoop may serve as a wonderful outdoor recreation at a time when all too often we of the developed world prefer to seek adventure in front of computer screens .
However , before leaving the subject today , in case those who have read this article sense somehow that we have exhausted the material relative to gold rushes , you might wish to consider that the following gold rushes were every bit as exciting as those we have discussed thus far .
The Brazil Gold Rush of 1695
North Carolina Gold Rush of 1799
Georgia Gold Rush of 1829
British Columbia Gold Rush of 1850
Victorian Gold Rush of 1850 ( Australia )
Northern Nevada Gold Rush from 1850 onward
Rock Creek Gold Rush ( British Columbia ) of 1858
Pikes Peak Gold Rush ( Colorado ) of 1859

Cassiar Gold Rush ( British Columbia ) of 1871
And , 27 ( twenty - seven ) more not listed , culminating with the Apui Gold Rush , Brazil of 2006 .
Please return to this space for part two of Lego Gold Rush .

Too cute ... enjoyed especially the rush of gold .
My kids keep asking to make stop motion videos of some of their toys ... but now that they have a camera and can borrow my tripod , they finally GET how much work it is .
Bleak does n't begin to describe the picture painted by this morning 's news coverage of a 35 - page government report scoring - and excoriating - the nation 's ongoing inability to protect critical network operations from cyber attack .
From an Associated Press story :
The federal agency in charge of securing the government 's computer systems is unable to monitor the networks or analyze threats in real time , and it lacks the authority and staff it needs to do its job , according to an internal report .
The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness
Team must share information about threats and trends more quickly and in greater detail with other federal departments so they can better protect themselves , the audit said .
Wired.com , unrestricted by the journalistic conventions of Associated Press , put the matter more succinctly in a story headlined : " DHS Geek Squad : No Power , No Plan , Lots of Vacancies . "
Back in 2003 , the Department of Homeland Security set up with U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US - CERT ) to spot vulnerabilities in the government 's networks , and coordinate responses when those flaws are exploited .
But seven years later , US - CERT is still " without a strategic plan , " DHS Inspector General Richard Skinner tells the House Homeland Security Committee .
The group is working at less than half - strength , with 45 of 98 positions filled .
And when US - CERT finds holes in the networks , all it can do is gently suggest recommendations to other federal agencies .
Those other groups do n't have to listen .
Federal Computer
Week has more on the hiring challenges :
( Greg Schaffer , DHS ' assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications ) said that DHS is moving quickly to hire more cybersecurity staff .
He said that at the start of fiscal 2009 , US - CERT only had 16 DHS staff members compared to today 's 55 with plans to hire 25 more staff by the end of September .
US - CERT is supported by many more contractors .
" The type of people that we need to hire ... are not easily found .
The skill sets that we are looking for are very specific and are very high - level , " Schaffer said .
" They are sought after by every department and agency that is trying to implement their program , by the private sector players who are anxious to ensure that their systems are defended . "
The Wall Street Journal delves into some of the detail :
The department 's implementation of its flagship cybersecurity program , dubbed Einstein , has been particularly rocky , ( Inspector General Richard ) Skinner found .
Einstein is supposed to identify possible intrusions into government computer systems and provide agencies information to repair the security breach .
But it and other tools are n't collecting information fast enough to protect government systems .
" US - CERT is unable to monitor federal cyberspace in real time , " according Mr. Skinner 's prepared remarks .
" As a result , US - CERT will continue to be challenged in protecting the federal cyberspace from security - related threats . "
And , toward the end of its story , the Wall Street Journal quotes an anonymous source who suggests that the inspector 's general 's scathing report was actually a bit sugar - coated .
" US - CERT is buried deep within [ Homeland Security ] with no authorities , period , " said a former U.S. cybersecurity official .
" Anything buried that deep within an organization is just riddled with politics . "
Mr. Skinner 's report " only said 50 % of what was wrong , " the former official added .
" It 's just a shame that it 's in that bad a shambles . "
Now the only question that matters is whether anyone in Washington will be able to do anything about it .

Cell - phone gabber in fast - food line gets his just deserts
PHOENIX ( AP )  Minutemen groups , a surge in Border Patrol agents and a tough new immigration law are not enough for a reputed neo - Nazi who is now leading a militia in the Arizona desert .
Jason Ready is taking matters into his own hands , declaring war on what he calls “ narco - terrorists ” and keeping an eye out for illegal immigrants .
So far , he said , his patrols have found only a few border crossers , who were given water and handed over to the Border Patrol .
Once , they found a decaying body in a wash , and alerted the authorities .
But local law enforcement officials are worried , given that Mr. Ready ’s group is heavily armed and identifies with the National Socialist Movement , an organization that believes that only non-Jewish , white heterosexual people should be American citizens and that everyone who is not white should leave the country  “ peacefully or by force . ”
“ We ’re not going to sit around and wait for the government anymore , ” Mr. Ready said .
“ This is what our founding fathers did . ”

As promised , Nokia and Intel have revealed the pre-alpha version of MeeGo for handsets today , supporting the Intel - powered Aava reference phone and the Nokia N900 .
What 's most interesting at this early stage is the UI , which appears to have taken a big Nokia - influenced step away from the Intel - designed MeeGo netbook and tablet UI -- and we 're definitely detecting some hints of Android and webOS here and there .
Seriously , just check out that task switching interface .
Of course , MeeGo is open - source , so we 're sure Nokia has some deeper UI customizations in store -- like homescreen widgets , which are notably missing here .
On a deeper level , this build of MeeGo includes the base MeeGo APIs , including Qt and the MeeGo touch frameworks , the Firefox - based browser , a photo viewer , and some basic UI elements like the status bar , app launcher , and virtual keyboard .
There are pre-built images for the Atom - based Aava handsets available now , but N900 owners will have to do a little building until someone makes an image available .
Be warned , though : there 's a long enough list of known bugs , and while that 's totally fine for pre-alpha code , it might not be too fine for your device .
That 's not going to stop us from installing this thing , but you be careful , alright ?
And let us know how it goes .
Video of the UI after the break .
P.S. Given that the N8 is destined to be the last Symbian N Series device , we can't help but feel it 's being overshadowed by MeeGo before it 's even out .
Can we pre-pour one out ?
Is that a thing ?
It is now .
" With close - out games , you have a tendency to lose focus , " said Kobe Bryant , who scored 32 for the Lakers .
" We kept our concentration and paid attention to detail . "
Pau Gasol added 33 points and 14 rebounds for the Lakers , who are off until hosting the Phoenix Suns next Monday in Game 1 of the West finals .
The Lakers quickly ended Utah 's hopes of extending the series by dominating the second quarter both offensively and defensively , holding Utah to just 17 points in the period .
Utah 's push in the third made it at least competitive and exciting for a little while , but the Jazz could n't sustain the comeback against the defending NBA champions .
" We 're a playoff team and they 're a championship team .
They 're just better than we are , " said Deron Williams , who had 21 points and nine assists for the Jazz .
The Lakers made very few mistakes and did n't give the Jazz many chances to rally .
Los Angeles had just six turnovers and made 29 - of - 36 foul shots while knocking Utah out of the playoffs for the third straight year .
" We had one of our better games tonight , " Lakers coach Phil Jackson said .
" This is the first really consistent game we have played , except for a six - minute stint in the third quarter .
We controlled the game and forced our will on our opponent . "
Carlos Boozer had 10 points and 14 rebounds , and Kyrylo Fesenko added 12 rebounds for Utah , which was swept for the first time in 21 years .
The Jazz lost the first three games by single digits but never found a way to slow down Bryant , who scored 30 or more in all four games .
The Lakers finally got a blowout in the final game and by doing so earned a week of rest .
Shannon Brown scored 12 and Lamar Odom added 10 points for the Lakers .
C.J. Miles scored 15 , Wesley Matthews had 12 and Paul Millsap scored 21 off the bench .
Utah fans started leaving early and the small contingent wearing gold Lakers ' jerseys chanted " Sweep ! Sweep !
Sweep ! "
The Jazz had n't been swept since Golden State knocked them out 3 - 0 in the first round of the 1989 playoffs .
GSTAAD , SWITZERLAND —
In a stunning ruling , Roman Polanski was declared a free man Monday — no longer under house arrest after Swiss authorities rejected a U.S. request for his extradition because of a 32 - year - old sex conviction .
The decision left the Oscar - winning director free to return to France and the life of a celebrity , albeit one unable to visit the United States .
Hours after the ruling was announced , Polanski ’s assistant said he had left his multi-million dollar chalet with his family .
Half - empty glasses seen on a back porch testified to a hasty exit .
“ Mr. Polanski can now move freely , ” Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf declared .
“ He ’s a free man . ”
Switzerland , which arrested the 76 - year - old Polanski last September as he arrived receive a lifetime achievement award at a Zurich film festival , blamed U.S. authorities for its decision , citing a possible “ fault in the U.S. extradition request . ”
The United States failed to provide confidential testimony to refute defence arguments the filmmaker had actually served his sentence before fleeing Los Angeles three decades ago , Widmer - Schlumpf said .
The U.S. State Department dismissed Switzerland ’s argument and said it would continue to pursue justice against Polanski , who has been a fugitive since fleeing sentencing for having sex in 1977 with an underaged girl .
“ A 13 - year - old girl was drugged and raped by an adult .
This is not a matter of technicality , ” State Department spokeswoman P.J Crowley said .
“ The United States believes that the rape of a 13 - year - old child by an adult is a crime and we continue to pursue justice in this case , ” Crowley told a Washington news briefing .
He said the decision to free Polanski “ sends a very important message regarding how women and girls are treated around the world .
To push this case aside based on technicalities we think is regrettable . ”
Beyond the legal issue , the extradition request was complicated and diplomatically sensitive because of Polanski ’s status as a cultural icon in France and Poland , where he holds dual citizenship , and his history as a Holocaust survivor whose first wife Sharon Tate was murdered in 1969 by followers of cult leader Charles Manson in California .
France , where the filmmaker has spent much of his time , does not extradite its own citizens and Polanski has had little trouble traveling throughout Europe — although he has stayed away from Britain .
The U.S. cannot appeal the decision , but Polanski is still a fugitive in the United States .
“ That warrant remains outstanding , ” Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini said , adding that Polanski could be arrested and sent to the U.S. if he travelled to another country that has an extradition treaty with the United States .
The decision drew cheers and jeers on both sides of the Atlantic .
“ The great Franco - Polish director can now freely rediscover his loved ones and devote himself fully to the pursuit of his artistic activities , ” said French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
His Polish counterpart Radek Sikorski expressed satisfaction with the Swiss decision , saying that “ a solution was found that respects the complex legal considerations and personal circumstances of the case of Mr. Polanski . ”
At Polanski ’s multi-million dollar Alpine chalet the shutters were open but there was no sign of movement inside hours after the Swiss decision was announced .
A woman who answered the intercom and identified herself only as “ Mr. Polanski ’s assistant ” said the director had left with his wife and two young children , Morgane and Elvis .
She declined to say where Polanski had gone or whether he would return .

Glasses stood half - empty glasses on the porch , where neighbors say Polanski was having a meal around noon .
Asked whether Polanski had left the home after being freed Monday from the electronic tags that monitored his movements during his house arrest on $ 4.5 million bail , a police spokeswoman , Ursula Stauffer , said : “ Mr. Polanski is a free man .
It ’s not the job of the police to keep track of his movements . ”
Widmer - Schlumpf , the Swiss justice minister , said the decision was not meant to excuse Polanski ’s crime , adding the issue was “ not about deciding whether he is guilty or not guilty . ”
The government said extradition had to be rejected “ considering the persisting doubts concerning the presentation of the facts of the case . ”
In justifying the decision , Switzerland also invoked what it called the “ public order ” — a lofty notion meaning that governments should ensure their citizens are safe from arbitrary abuse of the law .
The Justice Ministry cited the fact that U.S. authorities had n’t pursued Polanski in Switzerland previously , even though he ’s often visited the country and bought a house here in 2006 .
It also stressed that the victim , Samantha Geimer , who long ago publicly identified herself , has joined in Polanski ’s bid for dismissal .
The acclaimed director of “ Rosemary ’s Baby , ” “ Chinatown ” and “ The Pianist ” was accused of plying his victim with champagne and part of a Quaalude during a 1977 modeling shoot and raping her .
He was initially indicted on six felony counts , including rape by use of drugs , child molesting and sodomy , but pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse .
In exchange , the judge agreed to drop the remaining charges and sentence him to prison for a 90 - day psychiatric evaluation .
However , he was released after 42 days by an evaluator who deemed him mentally sound and unlikely to offend again .
The judge responded by saying he was going to send Polanski back to jail for the remainder of the 90 days and that afterward he would ask Polanski to agree to a “ voluntary deportation . ”
Polanski then fled the country on the eve of his Feb. 1 , 1978 , sentencing .
The office of Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley did not issue any statement about the Swiss decision and he did not return a message seeking comment .
Reaction was varied among Los Angeles ’ legal community , ranging from those who saw the Swiss decision as a slap in the face to others who thought the efforts by Cooley ’s office to prosecute Polanski were too late .
“ Polanski got away with a lot , but it ’s not all black and white , ” said Loyola Law School professor Stan Goldman .
“ I do n’t see the D.A. rushing to investigate the very palpable evidence of misconduct in the original case .
And the victim said they were hurting her every time they brought this up .
So there are many shades of gray . ”

Passengers ’ remains were badly damaged in the crash and DNA tests would be used to identify the victims , he said .
Two Americans were among the victims , a U.S. embassy spokesman told Reuters .
He had no further details .
While thick fog and rainy weather are considered the most likely reasons for the crash , Kaira declined to rule out sabotage and said all possibilities would be investigated .
Kaira said the plane ’s “ black box ” data recorder had yet to be recovered .
The plane lost contact with the control room of the Islamabad International Airport at 0443 GMT .
It was carrying 146 passengers and six crew members .
“ The pilot was given directions to land either on runway I or II , ” Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters .
“ The plane was at 2,600 feet before landing but suddenly it went to 3,000 , which was unexplained . ”
“ If the visibility to the runway was so poor then it should have been diverted . ”
Defense Minister Ahmed Mukhatar said the control tower at the airport had been sealed and a team would examine the data recorder and radio traffic between the plane and the tower .
“ If you look at the position of the wreckage it ’s clear that the plane went beyond safety margins .
It should have maneuvered within five miles of the runway but it did not happen , ” said Ejaz Haroon , managing director of state - run airline PIA .
The crash site is on the Margalla Hills facing Islamabad , about 300 metres ( yards ) up the side of the hills .
Smoke could be seen from some districts of the city after the crash .
While Wednesday ’s crash is the worst aviation accident on Pakistani soil , PIA has had two worse disasters .
In 1979 and 1992 , PIA jets crashed in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia and Kathmandu , killing 156 and 167 people , respectively .
Within Pakistan , the last major aviation accident was in 2006 when a PIA plane crashed near the central city of Multan killing 45 people .

NEW PLANE
The military sent three helicopters to the site and troops also were deployed .
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani surveyed rescue operations from the air and the government declared Thursday a day of mourning for the victims .
AirBlue began operations in 2004 with a fleet of Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft , according to its website www.airblue.com.
It flies primarily domestic routes as well as to the United Arab Emirates , Oman and Manchester in Britain .
Spokesman Raheel Ahmed said this was the first crash for the airline and that an investigation was being launched .

“ It ’s too early to speculate , ” he said about the cause of the crash .
“ The civil aviation authorities will also be involved . ”
Airbus confirmed one of its planes was involved in the AirBlue crash .
“ We regret to confirm there has been an accident with an Airbus aircraft and we will provide more information when we have more confirmed data available , ” said Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath .
At Islamabad ’s international airport in the moments after the crash , passengers in the departure lounge scanned the television screens for news .
“ I ’m not surprised something like this has happened , ” said Ahmed Fairuz , a passenger awaiting departure .
“ The weather is just too bad for flying . ”
Aviation industry sources in Europe said the aircraft was leased from International Lease Finance Corp , the leasing unit of U.S. insurance giant AIG
Los Angeles - based ILFC was not available for comment and there was no immediate confirmation of these details .
The A321 is the largest of the A320 family of single - aisle jets produced by EADS subsidiary Airbus .
This particular type of aircraft , which can seat up to 185 passengers , has been in service since 1994 .

' At the start of the tournament , I was standing at the top of the arena near the players , listening to the sound and crying tears of joy '
I invented the vuvuzela 35 years ago but , of course , it 's only since the start of the World Cup that it has become quite so well known globally .
Whatever people may say about the sound it makes , it has never been so popular .
That makes me proud ; I see so many visitors taking vuvuzelas home with them , to Europe , South America and beyond .
I know people have complained in the past .
One football squad objected to the noise when they played in South Africa , but I think it 's only polite to accept the customs of any country you visit , and this is our culture .
Our players expect it and the sound encourages them – it's the sound of our support .
Many people say they do n't like the noise , but I 've been blowing the vuvuzela for decades now and I 've never heard of anyone going to hospital or dying because of it .
I do recommend some basic rules when it comes to using it , though – you should n't blow one directly into anyone 's ear , for example , nor should you ever sound a vuvuzela during a country 's national anthem .
There has been talk of a ban , but that will never happen while I 'm still alive – no government will stop it .
The vuvuzela is my baby and I 'd happily go to jail for it .
Actually , I have been locked up already , for 20 minutes – in 1992 , I took my vuvuzela to Zimbabwe , but only after falling foul of the authorities at the airport , who initially insisted I could n't take it on to the plane .
I have been dedicated to popularising the vuvuzela since 1965 , when I was 10 .
My brother bought me a bicycle to ride to school on .
It had a big aluminium hooter with a rubber bulb on the end – I realised if I took off the ball and blew into the horn , it made a more exciting noise .
I used to take it along to local football matches played on gravel or in the street and play it to encourage my team .
My horn became better known a few years later when the Kaizer Chiefs football club was born – I never missed a game and I 'd always take it along .
I used to call it a lempororo , after the area in South Africa where I grew up .
Other supporters would ask where I 'd got it , but because the lempororo was made of metal , it was considered dangerous and I was banned from taking it into the Orlando Stadium where the Chiefs used to play .
I approached someone who ran a manufacturing company and he made the first plastic version – a yellow one very much like those you see today .
We called them Boogieblasts and sold them at games .
I changed the name to vuvuzela in 1992 , after Nelson Mandela was released and South Africa was allowed to compete internationally again – the name means three things in Zulu : " welcome " , " unite " and " celebration . "
People assume my invention has made me rich – in fact , big companies have taken the idea and the name , and do n't give me a penny .
I struggle to feed my nine children .
Most of my earnings come from selling an album I made in the 90s that features the vuvuzela , and I 've been touting the second volume at the World Cup games .
Of course I 'd be happier if my invention allowed me to support my family more easily , but I 'm not bitter that others are benefiting .
I still want to encourage others to enjoy them .
When South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup , I had vuvuzelas made in all the teams ' colours and taught people in the crowd how to play .
In my culture , it 's hard to gain recognition when you do something good – not while you 're alive , anyway .
When I do pass away , I want people to blow vuvuzelas at my funeral .
It gives me great joy to know that I created an instrument that has been played by everyone from tiny children to Nelson Mandela .
Even now I spend a lot of time thinking of ways to improve it ; I want everyone to play the vuvuzela , beyond Africa .
At the start of the tournament , I was standing at the top of the arena near the players , listening to the sound and crying tears of joy .
People from all over Africa were there , united by the vuvuzela .
As for players saying they can't hear on the pitch because they 're drowned out by the noise – well , footballers have never been short of excuses when things go wrong , have they ?
Whatever happens tomorrow , you 'll never hear the winning team complaining .

The Washington Post ’s Dana Milbank has a splendid / witty column on the Obama - Netanyahu meeting characterizing it as a " surrender " by Obama , pointing out that a reporter had to bring up settlements , Obama did n’t .
And this :
Four months ago , the Obama administration made a politically perilous decision to condemn Israel over a controversial new settlement .
The Israel lobby reared up , Netanyahu denounced the administration ’s actions , Republican leaders sided with Netanyahu , and Democrats ran for cover .
So on Tuesday , Obama , routed and humiliated by his Israeli counterpart , invited Netanyahu back to the White House
This is significant .
A few years back Milbank disgraced himself by attacking Walt and Mearsheimer as whiteknuckled Teutons , code for Nazis .
Now he ’s making the Israel lobby –correctly –the villain of the piece .
It shows : a , how the conventional wisdom has changed in D.C. , b , how ambitious journalists now regard the Israel lobby as a subject on which careers are made not lost , c , how desperate liberal Zionists , which is the rough camp I would put Milbank in off the cuff ( he worked for the New Republic , he ’s Jewish ) , are to see real pressure to save the Jewish state from the crazies , d , how competitive writers are with Peter Beinart , e , all the above .
Of course there ’s only one way this sort of inquiry goes : it brings you inevitably to the amount of Jewish money in the political process and the pro-Israel identity construction of American Jews .
Why is Obama so scared ?
And can Milbank give him base ?
BP has said repeatedly that it will pay for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
But its actions show that it does not intend to go it alone .
Newly released documents show that on June 2 , BP sent out demands for nearly $ 400 million to its partners in the well , the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and the Mitsui Oil Exploration Company of Japan , or roughly 40 percent of the $ 1 billion BP spent in May .
The amounts demanded by BP  $ 272 million from Anadarko and $ 111 million from Mitsui  reflect the provisions of each company ’s joint operating agreement with BP , which gives a share of liability equal to each company ’s share of ownership .
BP owns 65 percent of the well , Anadarko owns 25 percent , and Mitsui 10 percent .
The bills include costs of drilling the relief wells , responding to the spill and the reimbursements already sent to the federal government , as well as the claims BP has already paid for economic loss to people along the Gulf Coast .
One of the first things that anatomy students learn is that the brain is divided down the center .
In most people , one half , or hemisphere , plays a dominant role .
Handedness has long been a crude measure of hemispheric dominance , because each side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body .
Right - handers , for instance , are likely to have dominant left hemispheres .
Today researchers are realizing that studying ambidextrous children ( who have no dominant hand ) could yield insights into the consequences of an unusually symmetrical brain .
A team of European researchers recently assessed nearly 8,000 Finnish children and showed that mixed - handed children are at increased risk for linguistic , scholastic and attention - related difficulties .
At age eight , mixed - handed kids were about twice as likely to have language and academic difficulties as their peers .
By the time the children were 16 , they also were twice as likely to have symptoms of ADHD — and their symptoms were more severe than those of right - or left - handed students .
Ambidexterity is not causing these problems .
Rather “ handedness is really a very crude measure of how the brain is working , ” says Alina Rodriguez , a clinical psychologist at King ’s College London and the study ’s lead author .
In typical brains , language is rooted in the left hemisphere , and networks that control attention are anchored in the right — but brains without a dominant hemisphere may be working and communicating differently .
Consistent with this theory , a 2008 study by scientists at the University of California , Los Angeles , found anomalies in cross - hemisphere communication in children with ADHD .
On tasks that should be the domain of the left hemisphere — such as linguistic processing — children with ADHD seemed to be getting too much input from their right hemispheres .
Rodriguez is quick to point out , however , that mixed handedness does not , by itself , indicate a malfunctioning brain and is “ just one risk factor among many others . ”
So why do some kids have overly symmetrical brains ?
The answer may lie in epigenetics — the mechanism by which environmental influences affect gene expression .
In 2008 Rodriguez found that women who experienced stressful life events or depression during pregnancy were more likely to give birth to children who became mixed handed , adding evidence to the idea that the experiences of a mom - to - be affect her fetus ’s brain development .
[ For more about prenatal influences on mental health , see “ Infected with Insanity , ” by Melinda Wenner ; Scientific American Mind , April / May 2008 . ]
That means that handedness , Rodriguez says , “ can be used with other markers to predict who ’s going to have problems with behavior ” and give parents , teachers and doctors the opportunity to intervene at the first sign of trouble .
Ralph Nader denounced President Obama 's lack of leadership on Monday and said he was leaning against , but would not rule out , a 2012 presidential bid .
In a radio interview with liberal activist Mark Green , Nader said that Obama had resorted to " mealy - mouthed , well - composed rhetoric " on the BP oil spill but has n't backed it up with real action , like banning BP from doing business with the government .
He added that a stubborn Congress is no excuse for not passing a strong climate bill .
" That 's a cop out .
Would LBJ not be able to get it through when he had 59 Democrats and an independent ?
[ Obama ] does n't know how to deal like LBJ did .
He does n't have that fervor , " Nader said .
As for his own 2012 prospects , Nader said he would rather have another liberal run in his place but would not rule out the possibility of a fifth presidential campaign .
" I want the progressive agenda to be on the ballot .
I 'd rather have someone else do it like Jim Hightower or Mark Green , " Nader said .
Green chuckled and said he " probably " would not be on the ballot .

Anybody who works an office job knows that every day is nearly identical to the one before it – the same cubicle , the same desk chair , and the same restless feeling that you ’re doing your body an injustice .
Let ’s face it : working in an office is n’t physically ideal .
Most people crane their necks to their computer monitor .
Their chair is n’t high enough , they slouch , they roll their shoulders .
Cube farms just are n’t how humans were designed to spend their days .
If you prefer to run after work , you ’re facing a challenge .
After sitting for 8 - 9 hours in the same position , your body is very far from being ready to run .
If you ’re like me , your neck is sore , you feel stiff , and your hip flexors are tight .
Your body is simply not ready to run .
Aside from the long - term negative effects of prolonged sitting and slouching , the immediate aftermath of a day spent in front of a computer make you ill - equipped to handle a post - work run .
God help you if you ’re attempting a fast workout .
Fortunately , there are numerous tactics you can implement to limit the damage you ’re doing to your musculoskeletal system .
These tactics limit the negative effects of sitting while you ’re at the office and also help you compensate for them before and after your workout .
Let ’s take a look at what you can do during work hours to avoid getting stiff .
These are tactics I try to implement every day and they work very well at helping me to stay loose during a typical day at the office .
Staying Flexible at the Office
I ’m not going to suggest you start doing yoga during a team meeting , but there are numerous practical strategies that wo n’t alienate you from your coworkers and make your boss think you ’re a total weirdo .
Tip # 1 : Stay hydrated .
This is a double - whammy .
Not only will staying hydrated make you feel better , flush left - over junk from your system from previous workouts , and prepare you for your run after work , but it will force you to use the restroom at least once an hour .
This makes you get up from your desk , walk , and get out of the sitting position .
Tip # 2 : Use your lunch hour productively .
Your lunch hour ( or half - hour ) is a perfect opportunity to stay loose and avoid any strained neck or back muscles .
With a previous job , I went to the gym and either lifted or did a core workout .
These days , I often go for a walk or shoot a basketball at a park across the street .
I ’ve even gone to a playground during my lunch hour ( this is great for you physically and mentally ) .
Not only will you avoid chronic tightness , but you ’re adding more exercise ( and fitness ) to your weekly schedule .
Tip # 3 : Do everything the hard way .
Do n’t call or email your colleagues – walk to their desk and talk to them ( stand up while you ’re talking to avoid even more sitting ) .
If you can , take the stairs and skip the elevator .
Take the long way to the restroom .
If you need to read a document , get a conference room and read it while pacing around the table .
Stand up when you ’re on the phone .
Get crazy and elevate your monitor and keyboard so you can work while standing .
The more you can replace sitting with activity , the better you will feel when you ’re getting ready for your run .
If you work from home , you can even use a standing desk .
( Side note : I once competed with a colleague on who could stand the longest at work .
We both lasted all day and it was the most tired I ’ve ever been after work .
Do n’t try this – instead , continuously alternate sitting with standing and walking for best results . )
Tip # 4 : Get creative .
I had a previous boss who instituted a five - minute workout break during the day .
We would do lunges , body - weight squats , planks , and push - ups continuously before going back to work .
I played a game with a former colleague to do 15 push - ups whenever he said “ like ” on the phone with a client .
Not only are you staying active , but you ’re improving your language skills !
The options are unlimited so get creative to incorporate small bursts of activity during your day .
Tip # 5 : Make your work station ergonomic .
This is a no- brainer , but I ’m surprised how many people do n’t fix their desk area the way it should be .
There are better resources for this sub-topic , so learn more about ergonomic computer work stations here .
Flexibility Before and After the Office
What happens before and after your day at the office can have a large impact on your running performance , how you feel during your run , and your susceptibility to injury .
If you run in the evening , it might be a good idea to take five minutes in the morning to get loose .
Starting your day at the office already tight or stiff is n’t ideal to feeling your best .
Tip # 6 : Before work , get dynamic .
Take five minutes before you take a shower to do a short dynamic flexibility or core workout .
One or two sets of leg swings , lunges , body - weight squats , and other dynamic exercises will jump start your legs and make you feel better all day long .
Tip # 7 : If you can , walk to work .
Jump start your blood flow in the morning by walking to work or taking the long way from the bus or subway station .
If you drive to work then walk down the stairs in the parking garage .
Tip # 8 : After work , get dynamic again .
The same type of workout that you do before work is just as useful after work .
Before you head out for your run , spend 10 - 15 minutes doing body - weight exercises and dynamic stretches .
This may be the most important part of your flexibility routine as it directly prepares your body to run .
Tip # 9 : When you start running , go slow .
Even if you take advantage of all of these strategies , you may still be a little stiff after sitting down all day .
The key to feeling good is to start your runs at a slower pace than you are going to run .
If you typically run 9 minutes per mile , start at 10 minutes per mile .
Gradually ease in to your run and you ’ll feel great after 10 - 15 minutes .
Flexibility , and avoiding the tightness that comes with sitting in a cubicle all day , is something that must be worked on every day .
With these strategies , the benefits are enormous : increased flexibility , better fitness , and a reduced chance of injury .
What strategies did I miss ?

Can Amateurs Solve P=NP ?
What is an amateur mathematician , what have they done , and what might they do ?
Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the most remarkable mathematicians of the last century .
He discovered countless beautiful theorems in both analysis and number theory .
With almost no formal training , he was able to discover results that other mathematicians found amazing , even magical .
Sadly he died at the age of 32 ; one wonders what further great things he could have discovered if he had lived longer .
Today I want to talk about the role that formal training plays in solving open problems in mathematics .
When people discuss open problems , sometimes the P=NP question is raised as one that might be solved by an amateur .
Is this realistic or not ?
I have a read Keith Devlin ’s book “ The Millennium Problems : The Seven Greatest Unsolved Mathematical Puzzles of Our Time ” — of course the count is now six thanks to the brilliant of Grigori Perelman .
I recommend it to you , with the proviso that I could only follow the chapters on the Riemann Hypothesis and the P=NP question .
The others on the Hodge Conjecture , the Yang — Mills existence and mass gap , the Navier — Stokes existence and smoothness , and the Birch and Swinnerton — Dyer conjecture , were very hard for me to follow .
I do not think this is Delvin ’s fault — he is an outstanding science writer — I think it is an inherent feature .
Problems such as the Hodge Conjecture require , even to just understand their statement , quite a bit of technical background .
In his third chapter , on the P=NP question , Devlin states that perhaps this problem is one that could be solved by an amateur .
I have heard this claim before , and I have mixed feelings about it .
Of course we cannot predict who will solve any open problem , and that includes the Millennium problems as well as all other open problems .
My mixed feeling comes from saying P=NP could be solved by an amateur seems to mean it is “ easier ” than the other problems .
I do not think this is the case , but ranking the difficulty of open problems is probably impossible .
Let ’s take a look at what amateur mathematicians have done in the past , and what they might be able to do in the future on these and other open problems .
Who Is An Amateur ?
I think that one of key issues is : who is an amateur ?
Is an amateur someone who is a completely untrained in mathematics , or is an amateur someone who is not an expert in a particular area of mathematics ?
According to the dictionary , amateur is from the old French and means “ lover of . ”
Thus amateurs often work on problems without any formal reward or pay .
Curiously Perelman was essentially working for “ free ” when he solved the Poincaré Conjecture , but I think no one would consider him an amateur .
Was Ramanujan an amateur ?
He was basically self taught , yet capable of discovering formulas that amazed even Godfrey Hardy .
For example ,
was one identity that greatly impressed Hardy .
Ramanujan shared one trait with many amateurs : his “ proofs ” were often nonstandard and difficult to follow .
This is perhaps one of the hardest issues for an amateur mathematician to overcome — the formally trained world of mathematics has certain rules and styles of how to present mathematics .
An amateur may use nonstandard notation , may create new definitions for existing concepts , and may re-prove basic facts .
For example , Ramanujan ’s first published paper was on some new properties of Bernoulli numbers .
The journal editor , Narayana Iyengar , noted :
Mr. Ramanujan ’s methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision , that the ordinary [ mathematical reader ] , unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics , could hardly follow him .
Some Results of Amateurs
Here is a partial list of some of the results obtained by amateur mathematicians .
Some had no formal training , while others had training but worked on mathematics only as a “ hobby . ”
Thomas Bayes :
He was a minister by training , yet he introduced in the 1764 the now famous formula that is named after him :
This formula is the basis of Bayesian analysis .
Most of the credit — although not the name — of the consequences of this formula go to others .
Quoting Wikipedia :
Bayes was a minor figure in the history of science , who had little or no impact on the early development of statistics ; it was the French mathematician Pierre - Simon Laplace who pioneered and popularized what is now called Bayesian probability .
This comment seems a bit harsh to me .
I agree more with Bill Bryson ’s opinions about its foundational nature expressed here and in the new book Seeing Further of which he is the editor .
Alfred Kempe :
In 1879 , while he was a barrister , Kempe discovered a “ proof ” of the Four Color theorem for planar graphs .
This stood until 1890 when Percy Heawood discovered Kempe ’s proof was flawed .
Heawood did use Kempe ’s ideas to give a correct proof of the Five Color theorem .
In particular , he used Kempe ’s notion of chains of alternating colors .
Such chains — - now called Kempe chains — play a key role in both current proofs of the Four Color theorem .
Oliver Heaviside :
He invented in 1880 ’s the notion of operator calculus — a theory that can be used to solve linear differential equations .
His methods work and give the correct answers .
Correct answers or not , operator calculus was not well received by mathematicians .
Yes it worked , but there were issues with some of the liberties he took that upset professional mathematicians .
Heaviside could solve linear differential equations , yet the “ theory ” was not sound .
Much later , Thomas Bromwich found a correct way to justify the operator calculus of Heaviside .
William
Shanks :
In 1873 there were no computers , yet he was able to compute to many more places than anyone had previously .
He claimed it was correct to places — it was correct to places .
Still an incredible feat for his time — he did this work as a hobby when he was not running his boarding house .
Marjorie Rice :
She found new ways to tile the plane in pentagons — she did this as a hobby .
Doris Schattschneider , a professional mathematician , helped make Rice ’s results known to the math community .
Kurt Heegner :
He was a radio engineer and published in 1952 a claimed solution of one of the great , then — open problems in algebraic number theory .
As with many amateurs his proof was not accepted , due to mistakes in his paper .
In 1969 the eminent number theorist Harold Stark solved the problem .
Apparently , Stark went back to look once more at Heegner ’s paper , and he saw that it was essentially correct .
The “ errors ” were minor and could easily be fixed .
Problem Statements
In order for anyone , amateur or not , to be able to solve an open problem they must understand the problem statement .
This is almost silly to state , but it is important .
It is hard to hit a fuzzy target .
One of reasons some think that P=NP is more approachable than many other open problems is that an amateur is more likely to be able to state P=NP correctly , than many other conjectures .
This is the reason so many amateurs have worked on the Four Color Theorem , the P=NP question , Fermat ’s Last Theorem , and Graph Isomorphism : they have relatively simple statements .
A simple statement does not mean that a problem is easy , but it does mean that anyone can start thinking about it .
An interesting question is which problems have simple statements ?
P=NP ?
This does have a relatively simple statement .
See my discussion for my take on the problem statement .
Riemann Hypothesis Jeff Lagarias has a surprisingly “ simple ” problem that is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis .
Let .
Then , the following is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis .
For all ,
Hodge Conjecture I do not know how to even state this and the other Millennium problems in a simple way .
No doubt this makes them unattractive to non-specialists .
Can Amateurs Help ?
Can amateurs help make progress on modern problems ?
I think that it is possible .
Their lack of fear , the ability of thinking out - of - the - box , the ability to think against the conventional wisdom , all make it possible for them to contribute to science .
One of the reasons the pros usually get the credit is that amateurs often do not write their work up properly .
They often write papers that have errors , and once we see an error we stop reading and skip the rest —
Heegner is a prefect example .
It may be useful to look at the type of contributions amateurs have made in the past .
Definitions : Bayes , Kempe , and partially Heaviside ’s contribution was in defining new concepts .
Computations : Shanks contribution was certainly a computation .
Examples : Rice ’s contribution was in the discovery of new examples .
Proofs : Kempe , Heaviside , and Heegner ’s contributions were in proofs .
This suggests there are several ways amateurs can help advance our understanding .
Open Problems
What do you think ?
Is P=NP the problem most or least likely to be solved by an amateur ?
Can amateurs still make contributions to mathematics and complexity theory ?
A related question : are there relatively simple statements of all the Millennium problems ?
Such a statement would not necessarily advance their solution , but I would find it interesting if they could be made more accessible .
Even experts might be helped by short equivalent statements .

Zeus Trojan - Targeting Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode Security Programs during Online Banking Sessions
Secure browsing services provider Trusteer , warned today that the Zeus ( Zbot ) continues to attack and is targeting online banking customers of 15 leading US financial institutions by exploiting two trusted credit card security programs .
When an online banking customer has initiated a secure online banking session , the Zeus Trojan injects a fake version of the familiar Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode enrollment screen .
It then prompts users to enter their social security number , credit or debit card number , expiration date , and PIN or CSV code .
The information gathered by Zeus is used by fraudsters to commit ‘ card not present ’ transactions with retailers that employ Verified by Visa and SecureCode protection .
This stolen data allows criminals to impersonate their victims and register with these programs to ensure fraudulent transactions pass through fraud detection systems undetected .
“ Advanced , stealthy Trojans like Zeus that are detected less than 46 % of the time are readily available to online criminals who are interested in stealing information for illegal gain , ” according to Uri Rivner , Head of New CyberCrime Technology at RSA , The Security Division of EMC .
Trusteer discovered this new in - session phishing attack , and was able to collect Zeus configurations and code samples from infected computers .
This version of Zeus attempts to trick online banking customers into surrendering their personal and credit / debit card data by claiming new FDIC rules require that they enroll in the Verified by Visa / MasterCard SecureCode program to protect their accounts .
“ While some users may become suspicious when prompted to enter their credit / debit card information as part of the online banking login process , this attack uses the familiar Visa and MasterCard online fraud prevention programs to make the request appear legitimate , ” said Amit Klein , CTO of Trusteer and head of the company ’s research organization .
“ Fortunately , online banking customers protected by Trusteer Rapport are not vulnerable to this attack since it blocks HTML injection and prevents Zeus from presenting the fraudulent enrollment request . ”
Zeus , also known as Zbot , WSNPOEM , NTOS and PRG , is the most prevalent banking malware platform for online fraud , and has been licensed by numerous criminal organizations .
Zeus infects PCs , usually without users knowing or causing any other “ noticeable ” harm .
The program then waits for the user to log onto a list of targeted banks and financial institutions , and then steals login credentials and other data which are immediately sent to a remote server hosted by cybercriminals .
It can also modify , in a user ’s browser , the genuine web pages from a bank ’s web servers to ask for personal information such as payment card number and PIN , one time passwords , etc .
Anti malware detection of Zeus has a poor track record .
In a 2009 report based on information gathered from 3 million desktops in North America and the UK Trusteer found that the majority of Zeus infections occur on antivirus protected machines .
Specifically , Trusteer found that among Zeus infected machines 55 % had up - to - date Antivirus protection installed .
The population of machines infected with Zeus is enormous -- one in every 100 computers according to Trusteer research .

A joint venture between Tulsa - based Syntroleum Corp. and Tyson Foods is about ready to start converting animal fat into high - quality diesel fuel .
Dynamic Fuels LLC has taken possession of a new processing plant in Geismar , La. , after the primary contractor on the $ 150 million project indicated last week it had achieved mechanical completion .
Some " punch list ” items are being addressed by construction and maintenance workers as the plant is prepared to begin operations .
The first shipments of animal fats have been delivered to the plant , which Syntroleum officials have said is the first of its kind in this hemisphere .
Dynamic
Fuels currently expects to begin fuel production during the third quarter , once workers have flushed all lines , verified operation of the control system and installed of catalysts and absorbents .
The new plant is designed to convert fats , greases and oils supplied by Tyson Foods into as much as 75 million gallons of renewable fuels per year .
" We 're pleased with customer interest in our fuel and the sales arrangements we 've made so far , ” said Bob Ames , Tyson 's vice president of renewable energy .
" We 're anxious to begin producing and selling our renewable fuel products , which have measurable performance and environmental advantages over conventional petroleum - based fuels . ”
Officials have said the plant 's fuel will have a higher cetane rating than traditional diesel , meaning it burns more efficiently .
The renewable fuel will be compatible with any diesel engine .
Dynamic Fuels has filled the 44 permanent full - time positions on site , with an additional 13 full - time startup support personnel .

It 's only been about three weeks since we posted six songs from Scarlett 's Tom Waits covers compilation , Anywhere I Lay My Head , but now that the entire album is available as a full stream , we can't resist falling under Scarlett 's starlet sway once again .
Combine Esquire's " sexiest woman alive , " the much - loved music of Tom Waits and producer Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio fame with guests like David Bowie and members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration , and you have pretty much the perfect recipe for a much - anticipated release .
As of early Tuesday morning , the entire album – all 11 songs – is available for free listening courtesy of imeem , which has an exclusive on the album in advance of its May 20 release .
It 's embedded below for your free listening pleasure .
Some of these songs were spotted briefly on imeem last month , and Warner Music Group owns Atco / Rhino Records , which will release the album , so this was a logical development .
Warner and imeem have a " strategic partnership " for handling such promotions , among other things .
However it happened , we 're still sort of impressed that a major label decided to let imeem stream every song on this record for a week before its release .
Back to the music .
The more I listen to this album , the more I 'm reminded of the Cocteau Twins ( when I 'm not being reminded of Scarlett Johannson , that is ) , and that has me feeling really nostalgic .
It 's not an emotion I admire .
( I ca n't listen to much early Yo La Tengo either , for the same reason . )
I know people have been giving Johansson a hard time about her voice onsome of these songs , and I can't get behind every track on the album ( " Fannin Street , " for instance , is a bit of a dirge ) .
But if that goodold Cocteaus sound still has access to a secret , backstage area of your heart , some of these songs will get to you , as they did to me :
video no longer available
Here 's the tracklisting correlated with the Tom Waits album each song came from ( with one exception ) :
1. " Fawn " ( from the Tom Waits ' album Alice )
2. " Town with No Cheer " ( from Swordfishtrombones )
3. " Falling Down " ( from Big Time ) [ Listening Post favorite ]
4. " Anywhere I Lay My Head " ( Rain Dogs )
5. " Fannin Street " ( Orphans : Brawlers , Bawlers & Bastards )
6. " Song for Jo " ( Scarlett Johansson original )
7. " Green Grass " ( Real Gone )
8 . " I Wish I Was in New Orleans " ( Small Change )
9 . " I Don't Want to Grow Up " ( Bone Machine )
10 . " No One Knows I'm Gone " ( Alice )
11 . " Who Are You ? " ( Bone Machine )

This morning , I went to my local cinema palace to see the stinkfest that is “ > The Twilight Saga : Eclipse ( and if that opinion offends ye , feel free to avoid my Eclipse : A hater ’s guide post ) .
The one part of the experience I did enjoy was watching the trailer for Paranormal Activity 2 , which scared me as rigid as the adventures of Whiney , Glittery , and Would - you - like - to - see - my - abs ? -y would later bore me stupid .
In fact , I remember thinking at the time that the clip might be a tad too frightening for younger Twilight fans .
I have a question to ask you .
I would then like you to ask it of others , particularly of Christians :
How many innocent people would you be willing to kill — purely to defend yourself ?
For example , let 's say you are well armed and an armed robber is shooting at you — but the robber is holding a hostage directly in front of him .
Or , suppose someone is shooting at you from within a crowd .
Maybe some in the crowd do n't like you .
Let 's push it even further and say that most of them hate you , and sympathize with the attacker .
To shoot back , you would be aiming at the attacker , but you know you would also hit others .
I repeat :
How many of them would you be willing to kill , even absolutely and purely in self - defense ?
I asked this question of someone fairly high up in military intelligence recently .
I had to press the point as he beat around the bush for a while .
His ( eventual ) response ?
" I 'm not sure I know the answer to that question . "
Well , at least he was thinking about it .
If your own answer is unclear — or anything greater than zero — you have a moral problem .
Your hope is in murder to save your own life .
The choice is either to face it or to deceive and justify yourself .
I want it to be absolutely clear what I am saying :
If you are knowingly willing to kill even a single innocent person , for any reason whatsoever , there is murder in your heart — not faith in God .
I asked him one more question :
If it would be wrong to kill even a single innocent person in self - defense , why would it be OK to support a government that did so ?
Christian Leaders and War
The title of this article refers to one by the now deceased Jerry Falwell , who wrote " God is pro-war . "
The " war on terror " was justified in that article and by its main proponents as a war of self - defense .
But in justifying self - defense there is always silence or dismissal on the subject of innocent bystanders .
The concept is most often morally sterilized by using preferred terms like " collateral damage . "
WorldNetDaily ran the article by Falwell .
Its founder , Joseph Farah , pushed the envelope even further in two later articles literally advocating the mass nuclear bombing of Muslim cities , writing in January 2005 , " …we do n’t need to be specific about which major cities and installations will be vaporized . "
That same month Farah wrote an article advocating torture , making up for the complete absence of any Biblical support by recommending a couple of Hollywood films .
Later in 2008 , he presided over the faith - based " Values Voters " election debate , where US House representative Ron Paul was jeered for mentioning Jesus as the " Prince of Peace . "
In 2005 , Farah also wrote that if “ we ” did not torture sufficiently or “ do everything necessary to win ” , “ we might as well sue for peace . "
So after all the innocent blood , if his recent reversal on Iraq and Afghanistan , while welcome , is for anything more than strategic reasons in the face of military failure and national bankruptcy  until the next pre-emptive war  I look forward to hearing it publicly .
No mention yet of anything but American soldiers ’ blood , but a major step in the right direction .
In contrast , it was Hitler who said :
" Terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death . "
Exactly the same principle of fear , not faith , was used to drive the people of the US , the UK and other countries into moral compromise — spearheaded by US Christian leaders .
Once the " fear of sudden death " had galvanized the people into demanding political action , this required that the inevitable death of innocents be swept under the moral carpet .
At this stage , at least one Christian leader , Pat Robertson , was against invading Iraq and apparently asked George W. Bush about those innocent victims — and was told there would n't be any .
Robertson was " overruled " and evidently chose afterward to be quiet and get aboard the " war on terror " bandwagon .
Thank God at least the Pope and the Catholic Church did stand by their clear statement :
" … criminal culpability is always personal and cannot be extended to the nation , ethnic group or religion to which the terrorists may belong . "
Of course , it is easier to speak when a government and its critic are in different countries and many Catholic leaders disagreed , particularly in the US .
So , if we will all have to stand on our own on Judgment Day , then let us beware following leaders like lemmings .
Even the great apostle Peter , having had a marvelous ministry of miracles recorded in the Book of Acts , years later had to be publicly rebuked , as recorded in the book of Galatians .
Leaders are our fellow human beings , even if genuinely called or gifted .
It may sound obvious to say so , but many Christians do not act as if this were true .
Christians and Allegiance
The pro-war position was and still is the prevailing position amongst many Christian leaders who , while claiming to be Bible believers , in reality are also in allegiance to a kingdom / government other than the Kingdom of God — a subject covered in my earlier article " The Exclusive Kingdom of God . "
Ask yourself where your own allegiance lies .
" God and Country " is at best an ambiguous phrase — the best thing anyone can do for their fellow countrymen is to have no other allegiance than to God .
Those who choose otherwise will soon see no wrong in murdering for their country .
As a result of this " supplementary " allegiance , in any conflict between the laws of God and of government , Christians are vulnerable to the deception , spin and false doctrines the State specializes in — for both Left and Right .
Very often , the consolidation of " Christian " support requires little more than an appeal to patriotism and running some minor socially conservative legislative distraction up the political flagpole ( for later retraction ) .
" Minor " certainly , relative to the mass murder of innocents .
The New Testament and War
I remember hearing a story about a judge who had his own guilty daughter brought in front of him .
Though he loved her , he could not justly judge her innocent but he did , upon her plea of guilty , divest his judge 's wig and pay the fine in full .
There is some similarity there with the New Testament , which unveils the Prince of Peace .
The strict justice of the Old Testament , while remaining true and just , has been tempered and satisfied with mercy — our deserved punishment being overwhelmingly paid in full by another , the Lord Jesus Christ .
With this prevailing theme , it is quite hard to make a case for pre-emptive war in the New Testament .
The most that could be argued is that when Jesus commanded Roman soldiers not to brutalize the innocent or steal ; he did not require them to face death by immediately deserting .
However , when the disciples asked Jesus if they should call down fire from heaven on their enemies , His answer was , " you do not know what Spirit you are of . "
Some might argue the suggestion was just — they were plotting to kill Jesus — and something similar did occur once in the Old Testament when Elijah faced some pagan priests .
But at that time , God as Judge had little choice but to execute justice , as redemption was not fully available .
Then , Jesus came to show us the real nature of God the Father and said , " If you have seen Me , you have seen the Father . "
Today , many Christians are baying for blood and calling for fire in the form of bombs and missiles on the heads of anyone who could possibly be an enemy .
This is not even based upon proper standards of evidence but upon whispers , rumor and analysis from mysterious sources in failed secret police agencies .
Moreover , they do not care — I repeat , they have abandoned any care — about how many innocent people will die .
I say they do not know what Spirit they are of .
The Old Testament and War
The absence of a pro-war doctrine in the New Testament forced Jerry Falwell and others to dig into the Old Testament .
There they found all the blood they were looking for .
The Old Testament is still the Word of God and therefore preemptive war with innocent casualties was fully justified in the Bible , right ?
Wrong .
I am going to show — using multiple unequivocal scriptures — that killing the innocent , even just one and even in self - defense or for an otherwise righteous cause would never and has never been advocated by God , Old or New Testament .
I am not promoting pacifism or opposing self - defense .
On the contrary , I believe in strong defense — even that according to Jesus , every Christian should be armed and that it is the most basic duty of every father to defend his family .
For all who choose evil and knowingly spurn the free pardon purchased by the blood of Jesus , I also believe there is a literal hell ( here are some documented NDE's ) .
So I would hate to send even an armed robber into the wrong side of eternity .
But I would not hesitate to do so if there were no other choice .
But I am targeting pre-emptive war — killing people in advance , because you think they might be a risk .
Or , killing innocent people because there are others around them that are guilty and it is too difficult to decide who is who .
I also include so called " freedom fighters " or actual terrorists bombing government buildings , where there may be ignorant and / or innocent individuals among some actual violent criminals of the State .
Old Testament Case 1 — Abraham
Both the Old and New Covenants begin with the " father of faith , " Abraham .
Abraham had a well - armed household with several hundred servants under his command .
He knew what a battle was , and when his goods were plundered , took up arms and recovered the lot plus the booty from his slain foes .
They got what was coming to them , in rich Old Testament style .
Abraham was in a covenant with God ( based on faith , not law — there was none ) .
In Genesis 20 , God chose to visit His friend Abraham when justice could no longer be put off regarding extreme homosexually related violence and murder in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah .
More than just a few guilty individuals ; the whole society had become morally corrupt and committed to perversion and violence .
Any half - decent individuals would have long since departed , if they had not been raped and murdered .
Why did God even mention this to Abraham , let alone record it at length in the Bible ?
The subsequent dialogue makes clear that although God is the ultimate Judge , He is always looking for a " legal " way out .
It also serves to demonstrate that His justice is a last resort and most of all , that He never condemns the innocent along with the guilty .
Note the pleading of Abraham :
" Will you consume the righteous with the wicked ?
What if there are fifty righteous within the city ?
Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it ?
Be it far from you to do things like that , to kill the righteous with the wicked , so that the righteous should be like the wicked .
May that be far from you .
Should n't the Judge of all the earth do right ? "
Abraham continued pleading the case of Sodom and Gomorrah all the way down to just ten innocent people .
Far from being angry , God agreed each time .
Finally , all that remained in the city were those in the family of Abraham 's nephew Lot and these innocents were removed before any judgement took place .
So , the question I asked at the beginning of this article is directly from the Bible and was asked of God by the " father of faith " Abraham himself .
It is worth repeating yet again :
" Will you …. kill the righteous with the wicked , so that the righteous should be like the wicked .
May that be far from you .
Should n't the Judge of all the earth do right ? "
God 's answer was a definite and repeated no .
Therefore , any interpretation of the later wars of Israel to condone the mass murder of innocents would make God out to be either a liar or a schizophrenic .
He is neither .
I strongly suggest , even if you do not understand those later events , that caution is advisable before either condemning God , or else using those events to justify mass murder today .
Old Testament Case 2 — Israel
Before Israel ever entered into the Promised Land , they had to wait because the inhabitants , though in moral decline , had not become sufficiently wicked .
When finally they did enter , the Bible says that the land literally had vomited the inhabitants out , their level of wickedness being so great .
Despite this wickedness , in Joshua 2 , the case of Rahab the prostitute in Jericho serves to illustrate the lengths
God will got to in order to preserve just one innocent person , along with all their family , even when amongst others who are guilty .
For years it had been known to the Canaanites that the Israelites were coming .
They knew about Pharaoh 's army being destroyed and , according to Rahab , they knew they were to leave and that the God of Israel was with the Israelites .
The times were nomadic or semi-nomadic and the less wicked had left long ago .
Note also that the term " Israelites " included a large " mixed multitude " — individuals or families from pagan societies that freely chose to make the God of Israel their own God .
The whole book of Ruth is about this .
There were many others , including an Amalekite mentioned in 2 Samuel 1 .
Those who remained in Jericho were a hard core that preferred to scorn and defy the God of Israel ( along with any moral restraint ) and trust in their own gods and their king / government .
You may think this reasonable — until you look at the available historical records of their culture ( see here and here ) .
Child molestation , mutilation , and sacrifice by fire were pervasive , with all kinds of vile perversions and occult initiation perpetrated upon them .
Basically , the longer these people remained alive , the more of their innocent victims there would be .
Yet in Jericho , an individual — a prostitute — turned to God in faith .
Her only recorded good " work " was to confirm her faith by helping the spies , in defiance of her governing king — but she was spared , along with her family .
The Bible records God supernaturally preserving the portion of the wall of Jericho where she lived .
This was right at the beginning of entering the Promised Land — and a key feature of the narrative is the preservation of a single innocent life .
Old Testament Case 3
The normal practice in a conflict was for women and children to be absorbed through marriage or domestic service , into Israel — with special protection for these women in marriage law .
Yet , in some specific cases , God did order women and children to be killed .
This subject is beloved both by Christian warmongers and conversely , by Biblical sceptics .
Both are hypocrites : Sceptics , because many advocate assisted suicide , euthanasia and / or healthcare rationing — they want their god , the State , or its " experts " to decide when mercy killings should take place .
But equally so are warmongers of the Christian right , who support pre-emptive war and the mass murder of innocents , yet claim to oppose abortion and euthanasia on the basis of being " pro-life . "
In the case of the Canaanites , God the ultimate Judge did rule — in a very public way , and confirmed visibly by many miraculous signs — that their wickedness was so great that the land had " vomited them out . "
They were served notice of eviction , a fact well known on the " grapevine " of the Canaanites , according to the testimony of Rahab in Jericho .
In the semi-nomadic times , Israel was instructed many times that the primary task was to " drive them out " and " see their backs . "
Those who remained were a hard core , committed to their local king , their local gods and their vile practices .
But what of the women ?
To remain with the Canaanites , they would have to be participants — sacrificing their own or other 's children alive in fire .
The longer they lived , the more innocent children would die or be abused .
As adults and in nomadic times , they were also free to depart in advance of Israel 's arrival and had many years notice to do so .
If they were unable or unwilling to do so , the story of Rahab at Jericho shows that even then , there was a way out for any individual .
The main question for many is regarding the children .
I believe this was the last of a last resort for God in dealing with the free and sovereign will of their parents .
Here are some points :
Killing children was not an accepted or universal military practice .
It applied only to specific tribes and required the unique and specific instruction of God , the giver of all life .
God , not an army , was the decider in this matter .
It was not a punishment or judgement .
Due to the extreme wickedness of their parents , young children would be in a physically , sexually and emotionally abused condition — and offered , from birth , to occult spirits .
Deliverance from this was not freely available until demonic forces were completely routed at the cross and resurrection of Christ .
Successful adoption of such disturbed children would be an impossible task , and instead cause mayhem within Israel as they grew up .
To leave them alive would mean they would starve or be eaten by wild beasts .
Whatever the reasons , one certain conclusion is that no one but God can judge such conditions and that absent a specific command of God ; any killing of women and children was not permitted .
This is underlined in the case of Abigail the wise wife of the wicked and foolish Nabal , in 1 Samuel 25 .
This man set himself against the militia of David despite their protecting and saving his flocks .
His wife entreated an enraged David , who had resolved to destroy Nabal 's household .
David listened and was thankful at being saved from " blood guiltiness . "
In addition to all this , in the Old Testament there were of course no weapons of mass destruction , or means of indiscriminate killing .
Note also that there is not a single example of torture by Israel 's army , let alone its acceptance .
Conclusion
Christians would do well to consider the actions of Israel when their militia army was not victorious , or their soldiers were killed :
They immediately got on their face before God to find out what they were doing wrong .
Soldiers are today dying by the thousands .
Yet , in the name of " God and country , " the bloody slaughter and horrendous maiming of innocent men , women and children by the hundreds of thousands , is still supported by a large portion of the Christian church and its leaders .
In order to get into this morally blind condition Christians had to be rooted not in faith , but in the " fear of sudden death " and in a lifelong confession of allegiance to their State rather than to God alone .
They were therefore open to being told , " Our man in the Whitehouse " George W. Bush and in the UK Tony Blair , had heard from God on the Iraq war .
" End-times " prophecy teachers perpetuated the delusion , by distracting away from the simple ABC's of loving our neighbor to the complicated XYZ's of Armageddon .
But according to the New Testament , a Christian should not even go to lunch with someone like George W. Bush — a man called a Christian , but who worshipped at a Shinto temple in Japan ; promoted Muslim holy days ; and holds membership in the occult " Skull and Bones " ( Thule Society / Order of Death ) and Bohemian Grove organizations .
Tony Blair and his wife are also apparently enamored with the occult , even while claiming to be Christians .
So , if there were no miraculous signs — where was the clear evidence that God had really spoken on Iraq ?
In particular , that it was okay — contrary to scripture — for innocents to be indiscriminately slaughtered ?
How can Christians have been so dumb ?
Actually , large portions of the New Testament are written to Christians in error …
What else is new ?
In their anger and fear ; and in their love for and allegiance to the State as protector , they have believed what they chose to believe .
One thing God will not violate is our free will .
You may be a Christian who has advocated killing innocents , or may even be a soldier .
If so , there are only two ways forward :
One is self - deception , the other is forgiveness .
The second option requires the acknowledging of wrongdoing and then doing no more .
The past cannot be undone , but there is hope .
Even after killing many people , the apostle Paul went on to write much of the New Testament .
Abraham also had many shortcomings , but " believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . "
The least we can do is believe God who loved us and gave Jesus for us , in order to receive the same gift .
Most of all , I hope all readers will see through the blinding evil of false allegiance , and renounce any dedication to a power other than God .
For some , that may mean renouncing a verbal pledge , for others it may just mean renouncing blind support for the State 's constant violations of God - given life , liberty and property .
For much more in depth analysis of the many issues surrounding this subject , I recommend the Laurence M. Vance archives at LewRockwell.com , with classic articles like " Should a Christian Join the Military " and also the book , Christianity and War .

CBO chief : Budget outlook ' daunting '
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Douglas Elmendorf , chief budget cruncher for Congress , got to play the role of bad - news bear before the president 's bipartisan fiscal commission on Wednesday .
His job : Present the Congressional Budget Office 's latest assessment of the long - term federal budget .
The gist of his testimony went something like this :
The outlook is bad under current law and daunting if many current policies are extended as expected .
And even that may understate the fiscal problem the country faces , because it does n't factor in potential effects of debt on economic growth .
Under the rosiest scenario painted by Elmendorf , the debt held by the public is on track to rise to 80 % in 2035 from 62 % at the end of this year .
At that point , interest payments on that debt would jump to 4 % of GDP , up from roughly 1 % today .
That 's the equivalent of a third of all federal revenue .
From there , the increases are stark under an alternative policy scenario , which includes an extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for most people , permanently protecting the middle class from the Alternative Minimum Tax and a permanent increase in Medicare payments to doctors .
Based on current policies , debt held by the public would hit 185 % of GDP in 2035 .
And interest payments on that debt would jump to nearly 9 % of GDP .
Focus on health spending : Spending on health care remains the federal budget 's biggest problem , even after accounting for the estimated impact of the health reform law enacted in March .
The health care law " made a dent in the problem but did not significantly reduce the challenge , " Elmendorf said .
" If all the health law measures are implemented , we end up with slightly lower federal health spending by the end of the 2020s . "
Specifically , Elmendorf noted that spending on major mandatory health care programs such as Medicare is on track to double by 2035 , up to 10 % of GDP from 5 % today .
That increase is the equivalent of $ 700 billion this year in additional spending , Elmendorf said .
Add in the less dramatic increase in Social Security spending , and the cost to federal coffers of mandatory entitlement programs will reach 16 % of GDP by 2035 .
That 's not very far below what the government has spent on all federal programs and activities on average over the past 40 years .
A few Democratic members of the commission registered their concerns that the CBO 's assumptions about the effects of the new law are understating its potential to reduce costs .
The 18 - member fiscal commission , , which includes 12 members of Congress and 6 presidential appointees , will submit a report by Dec. 1 recommending ways to bring down deficits and stabilize the country 's long - run debt .
Debt can sap growth :
The larger the debt burden grows , the less money there will be for domestic investment .
That , in turn , can suppress income growth and economic growth , which then reduces tax revenue .
The only way to bring the federal budget into better balance would be to sharply reduce U.S. spending , drastically increase taxes to rates never before seen in the United States or some less dramatic combination of the two , Elmendorf said .
The challenges are great , and the longer policymakers wait to stabilize the debt , the harder their task , Elmendorf said .
He gave an example : Say Congress started implementing measures next year to bring public debt back to what it was before the financial crisis .
They would immediately and permanently need to cut spending by or increase taxes by 5 % of GDP .
That 's $ 700 billion a year .
And if they wait until 2020 they 'd need to make changes worth 8 % of GDP .
The hearing touched on one of the trickiest fiscal questions facing Congress :
When to pivot from economic stimulus to fiscal restraint .
Elmendorf said that most economists believe cutting spending and raising taxes this year or next could slow economic recovery .
But he added that " reaching agreement as quickly as possible would support the economic recovery because it would provide some clarity [ in policy ] . "
While deficits can help boost the economy in a recession , over time government debt can drag it down , he said .
" If debt grows unchecked , " Elmendorf said , " it means declines in people 's standard of living . "
The Hubble space telescope examined a turbulent star - forming region , NGC 3603 , ten years after Hubble first surveyed it .
And the repeat observation showed that stars were moving in ways that startled and amazed scientists .

According to Hubble 's site :
With a mass of more than 10 000 suns packed into a volume with a diameter of a mere three light - years , the massive young star cluster in the nebula NGC 3603 is one of the most compact stellar clusters in the Milky Way [ 1 ] and an ideal place to test theories for their formation ...
The results for the motion of these cluster stars were surprising : this very massive star cluster has not yet settled down .
Instead , the stars ' velocities were independent of their mass and thus still reflect conditions from the time the cluster was formed , approximately one million years ago ...

Wolfgang Brandner adds : " This is the first time we have been able to measure precise stellar motions in such a compact young star cluster . "
Team member Andrea Stolte from the University of Cologne adds : " This is key information for astronomers trying to understand how such clusters are formed , and how they evolve . "
Here 's a close - up of the star - forming region that the team studied :

Starting this autumn , non-European Union immigrants wishing to marry British citizens must pass an English test , Britain ’s Conservative government announced in early June .
The new ruling applies to marriage visa applicants as well as those seeking civil partnerships , and is expected to significantly affect Indian , Pakistani , and Bangladeshi immigrants .
UK Home Secretary Theresa
May said on June 9 that this rule is the first step in an effort to introduce “ English language requirements across the visa system . ”
Announcing the policy change , she said , “ I believe being able to speak English should be a pre-requisite for anyone who wants to settle here .
The new English requirement for spouses will help promote integration , remove cultural barriers and protect public services .
“ It is a privilege to come to the UK and that is why I am committed to raising the bar for migrants and ensuring that those who benefit from being in Britain contribute to our society . ”
Critics of the ruling call it discriminatory .
Migrants ’ Rights Network spokesperson Don Flynn said , “ The issue here is that the right to marry and found a family is a basic human right and is it proper , is it right , that that right to marry should be made conditional on passing a test in English ?
Our view is that it should n’t be . ”
“ The problem for me with this measure is that I do n’t think the English language is a prerequisite for love , ” added Danielle Cohen , a British immigration lawyer .
“ If you can communicate in your own language , what business is it of the state to interfere ? ”
“ These new rules are likely to hit people from South Asia and Africa , where English is not the main language .
It may also hit women harder and discriminate most against the poorest , ” said the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrant ‘s Hina Majid in an National Public Radio report .
Immigration Minister Damian Green expressed a different view in 2007 , when talk of an English language requirement began .
“ Too many young women are brought to England to marry when they cannot possibly integrate with our society , ” he said .
“ Families where English is not spoken are much more likely to have children who struggle at school , and adults who cannot engage in work . ”
Prime Minister David Cameron , who took office in May , has a history of encouraging immigrant “ integration ” .
In 2007 , he spoke out against the “ cultural separatism ” he believed existed in the British Muslim population .
He suggested lessons on “ being British ” and English language requirements for all UK citizens .
Currently , marriage visa applicants must demonstrate the authenticity of their partnerships and the ability to support themselves financially .
Beginning in the fall , they will also have to be able to speak English at the A1 level , or as well as a seven - year - old native speaker .
This level of proficiency is already required of those who immigrate to the UK as skilled workers , and the government is considering increasing it .
Approximately 38,000 British marriage visas are issued annually and , due to the new ruling , this number is expected to decline by ten percent .

The University of California , Irvine has taken a step toward suspending a Muslim student organization over it says was the group ’s role in orchestrating the disruption of a campus speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren .
A disciplinary report by a university administrator recommended that U.C. Irvine ’s Muslim Student Union be suspended for a full year .
The report argues that the campus group organized the protest at Oren ’s February speech , in which students repeatedly shouted at the ambassador , accusing him of “ propagating murder ” and being “ an accomplice to genocide . ”
The MSU , which maintains that the students involved in the protest were acting independently , has appealed the finding .
The proposed sanction still requires approval from a number of university administrative bodies .
“ I think the university has taken an important step that will be precedent - setting , that not only deals with free speech issues but talks about the kind of campus climate that is expected , ” said Shalom Elcott , president and chief executive officer of the Jewish Federation of Orange County .
The federation obtained the disciplinary report , which was originally issued in May , via a public records request and released it to the press .
The report was posted online by The Orange County Register on June 14 .
During the February incident , video of which circulated widely on the Internet , protesters repeatedly interrupted Oren ’s speech by rising one at a time at various points in the address and shouting at the ambassador , before being escorted peacefully out of the room by campus police to a mix of cheers and jeers from audience members .
Eleven students were arrested , including eight from U.C. Irvine and three from the University of California , Riverside .
At one point during the disruptions , the ambassador left the hall .
He eventually returned and finished his address , but a planned question - and - answer session was canceled .
The Israeli Embassy said that Oren had no comment on the U.C. Irvine administrator ’s report .
A spokesperson at Israel ’s consulate in Los Angeles said : “ The consulate respects the decision of the campus . ”
The MSU at U.C. Irvine has been a longtime target of criticism from Jewish groups , particularly for its annual week of anti-Israel events .
At campus MSU events , one regular speaker , Amir Abdel Malik Ali , has praised Hezbollah and Hamas and vowed that Muslims will fight Israel “ until we are either martyred , or until we are victorious . ”
Some Jewish students at the school also have complained of harassment by MSU members .
In 2004 , the Zionist Organization of America filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education alleging that U.C. Irvine had violated Jewish students ’ civil rights by not taking action against the MSU .
And in 2009 , U.C. Irvine asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into allegations that an MSU - sponsored event had been used to raise money for Hamas .
No action was taken against the MSU in either case .
The Oren disruption , however , further raised the public profile of the ongoing controversy at U.C. Irvine .
In a press release , the MSU stated that the protesters at Oren ’s speech were acting independently of the student group .
But evidence cited in the university disciplinary report , issued May 27 by Lisa Cornish , senior executive director of student housing at U.C. Irvine , appears to suggest that the disruptions were planned by members of the MSU .
Citing e-mails circulated within an MSU Google Group , or listserv , and other documents , the report says that members of the MSU discussed plans for the disruption at a meeting five days before Oren ’s speech .
According to the report , minutes of the meeting included the determination that “ our goals should be that he knows that he ca n’t just go to a campus and say whatever he wants . ”
The report says that the MSU “ planned every detail of the disruptions , ” citing documents that laid out plans for the protest .
Protesters were to be split into four groups , and the head of each group was in touch with a coordinator via cell phone .
Some protesters were chosen to disrupt the speech regardless of the reaction of the administration and campus police , others were instructed to interrupt only if disruptors were simply asked to leave the premises .
A third segment of the protesters was supposed to remain in the room and cheer the disruptors .
Phrases shouted by protesters were scripted and written on index cards .
Reem Salahi , an attorney representing the MSU in the disciplinary proceedings , told the Forward that she could not comment on the specific evidence referred to in the report due to the ongoing nature of the proceedings , but she said that overall the evidence presented was “ problematic . ”
“ It was definitely not indicative of the entire story at all , ” Salahi said .
She said that some of the report ’s findings of fact would be contested during the appeals process , and that new evidence would be submitted .
Salahi also criticized the Jewish Federation of Orange County for releasing the disciplinary report , since a number of administrative steps remain before the suspension can be invoked .
“ It ’s unfortunate that the Jewish federation decided to get that information and release it at this point , ” Salahi said .
The recommended suspension of the MSU could begin September 1 , but university disciplinary procedures provide a series of recourses for the group .
The MSU has already filed an appeal of the “ informal resolution ” made in the report with the dean of students .
Further , the sanction can also be appealed to the university ’s Judicial Review Board , which will recommend a course of action to the dean of students .
The decision of that dean can be appealed to the vice chancellor for student affairs .

A new listing on the French Amazon website indicates that a collection of Team ICO games may be forthcoming on the Playstation 3 .
The Team ICO Collection , as the listing is named , currently does not have a description but Amazon .
fr is already taking pre-orders for the game .
The game is listed at a price of € 69.65 , which constitutes a minor premium over regular Playstation 3 titles in France .
Over the recent months , rumors surrounding a possible HD re-release of Team ICO games such as Ico and Shadow of the Colossus have grown more persistent .
These games were released for the Playstation 2 in 2001 and 2005 respectively , and are generally considered to be amongst the most iconic games of the previous console - generation .
Though HD remakes have never been confirmed to be in production for these two games , Sony indicated that it is interested in releasing more of such remakes for Playstation classics .
A similar collection was released in the God of War series several months ago , to tie in with the release of God of War 3 .
It is unclear whether The Team ICO Collection will also be released in tandem with Team ICO ’s upcoming game The Last Guardian .
Amazon.fr lists the collection for a release on June 30th , 2011 , while The Last Guardian is officially still scheduled for a release later this year .
The actual listing can be found here .
The Moscow metro bombings left 40 dead and dozens injured
Three alleged organisers of the March suicide bombings on the Moscow metro have been killed after resisting arrest , Russian officials say .
It was not immediately clear when or where the killings happened .
All those involved in the bombings have now been identified , officials said .
Russian leaders previously warned that the masterminds of the attacks , which killed 40 people , would be " destroyed " .
Two young women from Dagestan were identified as carrying out the attacks .
The 29 March bombings targeted two of the Moscow metro's commuter trains .
The three alleged planners died during " an attempt to detain three members of an illegal group " , said the head of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , Alexander Bortnikov .
" To our great regret , we were unable to detain them alive because they put up fierce armed resistance and were killed . "
' Matter of honour '
Mr Bortnikov said the suspects included a man who had escorted the suicide bombers to Moscow and another who had accompanied one bomber to the station .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said there had been no option but to kill the " terrorists " .
" Those who put up resistance have to be eliminated - you cannot show pity , " the Russian leader was reported as saying at a meeting with Mr Bortnikov .
The FSB head said that efforts to find other identified planners of the attacks were continuing .
The suicide bombers were identified as a 17 - year - old thought to be the widow of a Caucasus militants , and the 28 - year - old wife of an Islamist rebel commander .
A Chechen militant leader , Doku Umarov , said he ordered the bombings .
Shortly after the attacks , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Russian investigators should view catching the organisers of the bombings as a " matter of honour " .
He said the security services , who had been widely criticised in the media , should drag them " from the bottom of the sewers " .
BP will this week reveal that it has cleared itself of gross negligence after an internal inquiry into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon explosion .
The company believes evidence will emerge of the role that other oil companies and contractors on the project had in causing the worst environmental disaster in US history .
But this is unlikely to satisfy its critics .
During congressional hearings in the US , politicians have laid the blame for the disaster squarely on BP , accusing it of ignoring standard oil industry safety practices to save money .
Pressure is also mounting on the company to clarify the position of chief executive Tony Hayward at its half - year results meeting on Tuesday .
There is growing speculation that , alongside the figures , BP could announce Hayward 's departure , although he could stay on until a relief well is in place in the gulf .
A board meeting is scheduled for tomorrow , but a BP spokesman refused to comment on whether the succession issue was on the agenda or whether there would be an announcement about Hayward at Tuesday 's results .
The company will publish the full findings of the inquiry into the causes of the gulf oil spill when it is completed next month .
BP accepts that it will have to shoulder some blame for the accident .
But it is understood that the company has found no evidence of gross negligence and does not expect any to come to light in the future .
It will robustly defend itself against such claims .
If investigators rule that BP is guilty of gross negligence , the firm would face a far heftier bill : under the US 's Clean Water Act , BP currently faces fines of $ 1,100 ( £ 715 ) for each barrel of oil spilt , but a such a ruling could see the figure rise to $ 4,300 .
If BP were the sole party to be found grossly negligent , it would also be liable for the entire clean - up and compensation bill .
BP owns 65 % of the Macondo well on which the Deepwater Horizon was operating , with 25 % held by Texas - based Anadarko and the remainder by the Japanese company Mitsui .
Anadarko has so far refused to pay any costs , while Mitsui has not made its position clear .
BP will continue to pay for the clean - up – which now totals $ 4bn – and bill its partners for their share .
A US oil lawyer said most indemnity agreements and insurance would protect BP against claims even it was found guilty of ordinary negligence , but would be void in a case of gross negligence .
Such a finding would have " far - reaching consequences " for BP and its partners ' and contractors ' liabilities , he said .
BP will also give the City guidance on the likely costs from the disaster this week .
Analysts at Barclays Capital believe the provisions could exceed $ 25 bn .
Stripping out the costs relating to the disaster , BNP Paribas forecasts BP 's net income for the second quarter at just under $ 5bn , up by 68 % compared with the previous year – the biggest rise of all its European oil industry peers .
Hayward will also indicate which assets are core , and which peripheral , for the company in the future .
BP is looking to sell more assets to shore up its balance sheet .
It will continue to focus on its three core areas : deepwater oil and gas , " unconventional gas " ( for example , from shale or coalbeds ) and using new technologies to squeeze more oil and gas from major mature fields .
Next month BP is expected to finish handing over responsibility for compensation claims to Kenneth Feinberg , who has been appointed by the White House to administer a $ 20 bn fund paid for by the company .
BP does not expect to have to pay out the full $ 20 bn .
Damages arising from other legal action , and from the completion of formal investigations into the accident , are likely to be more costly .
The economic crisis has brought out the populist in many politicians and others .
Among the more unlikely ones may be a silver - bearded federal judge who has wasted no chance to tell the country ’s biggest banks what he thinks about how they operate .
When Bank of America Corp. was trying to settle civil charges over its conduct in its purchase of Merrill Lynch , U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff wrote that the bank ’s executives had led what “ could have been a bank - destroying disaster if the U.S. taxpayers had not saved the day . ”
Addressing how the firm pays its top people , the judge spoke in February of “ the incredibly bloated compensation of too many executives in too many American companies . ”
In another case , Rakoff called JPMorgan Chase & Co. 's handling of a major client improper at the very least , “ if not a downright sham . ”
Advertisement
He condemned not only big banks but also their regulators , saying the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s enforcement in the Bank of America case did “ not comport with the most elementary notions of justice and morality . ”
“ He has tapped into some of the national and populist outrage that has followed the economic meltdown , ” said Anthony Barkow , executive director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University .
“ He ’s made an intellectual and legal case for what a lot of people are thinking based on their own common sense . ”
Rakoff has even become a reference point in the legal world .
In chastising the SEC last week in the online magazine Slate , Eliot Spitzer , who as New York attorney general took on Wall Street , pointed to Rakoff ’s rulings .
When another judge criticized the SEC recently , a Wall Street Journal blogger said that judge had “ pulled a Rakoff . ”
Some defense lawyers privately describe Rakoff as a publicity - seeking maverick .
Even fans say he is not a fun judge to appear before .

“ He certainly gave me , as a prosecutor , a little lecture , which I did n’t often get , ” said Steven Feldman , a former assistant U.S. attorney .
“ You know that you have to be on top of your game with Judge Rakoff -- ready to take it to the next level . ”
In an interview in his chambers in Lower Manhattan , not far from Wall Street , Rakoff , 66 , spoke cheerfully about the controversy that surrounds him .
He compared his judicial philosophy to the values underlying baseball , a passion of his along with bridge and ballroom dancing .
( One of his opinions in the Bank of America case quotes Yogi Berra . )
“ One of the many things I like about baseball is how it combines individual talent and teamsmanship , ” Rakoff said .
“ In baseball you have individual responsibility , and if you fail it , you get an error .
But at the same time your focus is on the common goal of the team to win .
This is part of what resonates with people about baseball .
This is how they would like society to work . ”
The Philadelphia native and Harvard Law School graduate joined the federal bench in 1996 after being appointed by President Clinton .
He spent seven years early in his career in the financial crimes unit of the U.S. attorney ’s office in Manhattan .

“ Once I really got into securities fraud prosecutions , ” Rakoff said , “ I came to realize how central they were to the maintenance of a free market and how , in many ways , they are far more important to the welfare of our society than many of the more sensational criminal cases that one hears about . ”
Rakoff may retain some of his prosecutorial attitude .
“ Deep down I think this is someone who is primarily a prosecutor , ” said John Coffee , who teaches a law school course with Rakoff at Columbia University .
“ He ’s got a strong moral perspective that there is right and wrong , and there are things that should n’t be done . ”
Relying on that perspective , the judge has consistently pushed the SEC to take action against the people responsible for financial misdeeds , not just the companies .
Advertisement
“ If crimes are committed they are committed by people , they are not committed by some free - floating entity , ” Rakoff said .
“ These companies and other entities do n’t operate on automatic pilot .
There are individuals that make decisions -- and some make the right decisions and some make the wrong decisions .
If the decisions they make break the law , they are the ones who are responsible . ”
Lawyers say Rakoff approaches every case seriously , regardless of its scope .
In one criminal case , a defendant complained about his treatment during a routine traffic stop .
Rakoff had the entire court travel at 10 p.m. on a Friday to the Bronx intersection where the incident occurred .
“ I was n’t a huge fan of doing that , but I respected it , ” said NYU ’s Barkow , who was the prosecutor in the case .
Rakoff has also made some notable rulings in nonfinancial cases .
In 2002 , he found the federal death penalty unconstitutional .
An appeals court overturned his ruling later that year .
In 2006 , he compelled the U.S. government to release information about detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
Advertisement
But because Rakoff works in Manhattan , he gets a steady stream of cases dealing with high finance .
On Monday , saying he needed more information , Rakoff refused to approve an SEC settlement with a securities trading firm tied to a high - profile case of alleged hedge fund insider trading .
Late last month , he rejected Citigroup Inc.'s bid to have a lawsuit against it thrown out .
Last week , he dismissed a case brought by pension funds against rating firms Moody ’s and Standard & Poor’s .
For now , Rakoff ’s greatest long - term effect is likely to come from the Bank of America case .
Last year the judge rejected the company ’s first settlement with the SEC , saying the $ 33 - million payment that had been negotiated was insufficient .
He ultimately approved a revised accord that called for a $ 150 - million payment .
Advertisement
The case has sent a clear message to the SEC , securities lawyers say .
“ What he was trying to do in part is to shake up the agency and prod them to work harder -- to do better investigations , ” University of Cincinnati law professor Barbara Black said .
SEC enforcement chief Robert Khuzami told the Washington Post last week that the agency , as part of an effort to be more aggressive , might detail its findings of wrongdoing in cases that the agency settles .
Rakoff says he gave up any hope of moving to a higher court when he ruled against the death penalty -- and says he has no desire to be anywhere else .

“ To have the thrill of seeing actual people testifying in hotly disputed matters -- to see a jury at work -- I cannot tell you how enticing it is , ” he said .
“ I love my job .
That ’s the bottom line . ”

Former Bundaberg - based surgeon Jayant Patel has been remanded in custody after being found guilty of three counts of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm .
The jury took six - and - a- half days to reach the verdict and handed down its decision in the Supreme Court in Brisbane this evening .
Patel , 60 , had pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of 75 - year - old Mervyn Morris , 77 - year - old Gerardus Kemps and 46 - year - old James Phillips .
Patel stood with his head slightly bowed and appeared calm as the verdicts were read out , while his wife Dr Kishoree Patel looked on from a packed public gallery .
The wife of Mr Kemps and patient advocate Beryl Crosby also looked on .
For Ms Crosby , the outcome brings a sense of closure to what has been a long journey .
" This was n't just about these five cases this was about all the people that died , all the people that were harmed by him and this is justification and justice for all those people , " Ms Crosby said .
Warning to others
There were cheers and hugging inside the Bundaberg court house as the verdicts were read out via live video link .
Whistleblower nurse Toni Hoffman says she feels vindicated by the decision .
" It 's vindication and it 's relief , but the price that you have to pay is too great and we should n't have to do that , " she said .
Ms Hoffman says says it is the end of a chapter she can now close , but the verdict is a warning to others .
" This is a message to dodgy doctors everywhere , " she said .
" Just so , so grateful that in Australia we can still have justice - this is a huge victory for patient safety , " she said .
" For patient advocacy and for standing up and for speaking out for what 's right and I think there 's huge lessons to be learnt for all of us . "
Sentencing
Patel will again face court on Thursday when the sentencing process begins .
His lawyer Michael Byrne is expected to seek bail for his client pending an appeal of tonight 's decision .
The prosecution had argued Patel was criminally negligent in operating on all three men , who later died .
Patel was also charged with causing grievous bodily harm to 62 - year - old Ian Vowles while a surgeon at Bundaberg Hospital .
His defence claimed Patel had always acted in the best interests of his patients , who had consented to the operations .
But prosecutor Ross Martin , who characterised Patel as a " bad surgeon motivated by ego and suffering from lack of insight " , urged the jury to return guilty verdicts on all charges .
He told the jury the trial was about " judgments " and that Patel 's negligence extended to his poor decisions about when to operate , and his choices about appropriate post - operative care .
In summing up last Wednesday , Justice John Byrne reminded the jury that Mr Martin neatly summarised the crown 's allegations when he said : " Over 19 to 20 months there had been poor decision - making , misdiagnosis , performing surgery on patients who could not withstand it , performing surgery at the wrong hospital and the removal of healthy organs " .
However , Patel 's defence team had urged the jury to find Patel not guilty , saying he always acted in the best interests of his patients .
Defence barrister Michael Byrne , QC , told the jury much of the evidence presented by the crown during the marathon trial had been fuelled by " a great deal of second - guessing and use of hindsight " .
" With hindsight it may have been the wrong call [ to operate on Mr Kemps ] but that does not make the decision criminally negligent , " Mr Byrne said .
Justice Byrne warned the jury against using the benefit of hindsight in making their judgment about whether or not Patel was criminally negligent in proceeding with the operations .
Long - running case
Patel arrived in the sugar town of Bundaberg in early 2003 and began work as a surgeon at the Bundaberg Base Hospital .
The controversy surrounding him flared when the Member for Burnett , Rob Messenger , raised concerns about his competence in State Parliament in 2005 .
Mr Messenger had been told about the concerns by senior nurse Toni Hoffman at the hospital .
In April that year Patel resigned and left the country to return to Portland in the United States .
Intense media scrutiny began after it was revealed the 60 - year - old had been banned from performing some surgery in the United States because of negligence .
As the public pressure mounted , the State Government , led by former premier Peter Beattie , announced an inquiry to be headed by Tony Morris QC .
That inquiry was axed in September 2005 after the Supreme Court ruled Commissioner Morris showed ostensible bias .
A second inquiry headed by former Court of Appeal Judge Geoff Davies AO then began .
In November 2006 warrants were issued for Patel 's arrest on 16 charges including manslaughter , grievous bodily harm and fraud .
Extradition proceedings began in 2007 and Patel arrived back in Brisbane in July 2008 .
He faced a committal hearing in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in February 2009 and was committed to stand trial on 13 charges including three counts of manslaughter .
His Supreme Court trial began in Brisbane in March 2010 and has become one of the longest Supreme Court criminal trials in Queensland 's history .

Offshore Drilling : Years of Lax Oversight , Small Fines for Serious Violations
Gov't agency collected just $ 21 mil in fines over 20 years from giant industry .
June 24 , 2010  -- President Obama has all but guaranteed that a catastrophe like BP 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will never happen again , but months after the start of the disaster , government regulation of offshore drilling remains a shambles , and it maybe be impossible for the president to keep his pledge anytime in the near future .
New information reveals that oil drilling in the Gulf has been far more risky than previously thought for both the environment and rig workers , but the federal government 's Mineral Management Service provided questionable oversight and punishments that amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist for giant oil companies .
Working on a rig is hazardous and sometimes deadly .
From 2006 to 2009 , 30 platform employees working in the Gulf of Mexico were killed in accidents and 1,300 people injured .
Workers died in fires , fell through holes in platforms , and were crushed and killed by falling pipes .
" There was no watchdog in place , " said Rep. Nick Rahall , ( D - W. Va. ) , the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources .
" There is no reason whatsoever why any individual in this country should have to put their life on the line to earn a livelihood . "
But an ABC News review of federal records shows that despite chronic safety problems , the Minerals Management Service , or MMS , imposed paltry fines that often took years to collect .
In the overwhelming majority of cases where workers were actually killed , there was no record of fines being paid .
Where fines did occur , the maximum penalty was only $ 25,000 .
" It 's totally ridiculous , insane that such circumstances were allowed to exist , " said Rahall .
In a 20 - year period , MMS has only fined the oil drilling industry $ 21 million for hundreds of serious safety violations -- about a million dollars in fines per year for an industry that made $ 800 billion in profits in that timeframe .
Just $ 21 Million in Fines for Multi-Billion Dollar Oil Drilling Industry
" There 's no doubt about it , the fines that have been leveled upon the oil industry are just a slap on the wrist , " Rahall added .
MMS records paint a detailed and disturbing picture of the agency 's own lax punishments .
In 2006 , MMS inspectors investigated an off - shore oil spill stretching 16 miles long and nearly a mile wide .
They discovered that operators of the platform had " bypassed basically the entire ... safety system . "
Still , the fine was only $ 505,000 .
In 2002 , inspectors found that workers at one of BP's Gulf platforms were not competent to " perform assigned well control duties . "
The fine was $ 41,000 , and the government took five years to finally collect it .
60 Inspectors for Thousands of Platforms
Congress is partly to blame for the low fines because it has n't changed penalties dramatically since the 1970s , but critics say that the problems at MMS should have been obvious .
" If I understand it correctly , MMS currently employs 60 inspectors to look after 3,800 platforms in the Gulf , " Sen . Dianne Fienstein , ( D - Ca. ) said .
And of those inspectors , many are still not properly trained , according to Congressional investigators .
As the nation looks to the government for tougher off - shore drilling oversight , it appears that officials are literally starting from scratch .
Secret trove of Kafka papers forcibly opened by Dennis Johnson
“ After months of legal wrangling , one of the 10 safe deposit boxes in which documents belonging to the writer Franz Kafka ( 1883 - 1924 ) and his close friend Max Brod ( 1884 - 1968 ) were hidden for 40 years ” was opened last Monday in Tel Aviv , according to a report by Ofer Aderet in Haaretz .
It was , apparently , an emotional scene :
Witnesses who had been inside the bank at Kikar Hamedina when the team of lawyers arrived said Eva Hoffe burst into the building in an attempt to prevent the safe from being opened , shouting “ It ’s mine , it ’s mine ! ”
Hoffe is the legal owner of the documents , according to the report , having inherited them from her mother , who had been Max Brod ’s secretary and friend for decades and had inherited the Kafka documents from Brod , who had in turn inherited them from Kafka .
She was reportedly in discussions with the German national archives about selling the collection to them .
The Haaretz story does n’t reveal any more of what happened to Hoffe after she tried to disrupt the opening , and other key aspects of the report that are murky — it seems to establish that Hoffe legally owns the documents and question that simultaneously .
Nor does it explain upon what grounds the state of Israel could thus declare a kind of cultural eminent domain to take away Hoffe ’s private property .
Yet Haaretz is no disinterested party :
The boxes are being opened as the result of a lawsuit to make them public filed by Haaretz itself .
Now , it reports ,
The team of lawyers will draw up an inventory of the documents they find in the boxes and present it to the Tel Aviv court .
Judge Talia Pardo Kupelman will then determine the documents ’ status – whether they are the private property of the Hoffe sisters , who can then do with them whatever they want , or whether they constitute a literary treasure that must be transferred to a public archive .

The Los Angeles Sheriff ’s Department is investigating claims that Oksana Grigorieva extorted ex-lover Mel Gibson AND lied to officials .
But Oksana ’s lawyers are adamantly saying she did NOT extort Mel !
Even though Oksana Grigorieva managed to get ex-lover Mel Gibson ’s horrifying rants on tape and thus provide evidence for a criminal investigation , her execution may have been flawed .
The Los Angeles Sheriff ’s Department says it is now investigating claims from Mel ’s camp that Oksana tried to extort the Braveheart actor for millions of dollars in order to keep the tapes secret .
But Oksana ’s attorney is coming out swinging against the claims that his client tried to extort Mel .
“ Extortion allegations have been brought to our attention and we are certainly going to be looking at that , ” LASD spokesperson Steve Whitmore said July 21 .
But Oksana ’s lawyer Stephen Jaffe tells TMZ that all of these allegations are completely untrue !
“ My client , Ms. Grigorieva , has repeatedly stated that there is no credibly evidence whatsoever of extortion by her , and she stands steadfastly by that statement . ”
Sources close to the case say that Mel ’s lawyers have hard evidence against Oksana that will prove said claims , including a text message she sent to the Australian actor about the tapes leaked onto RadarOnline .
“ You broke your agreement with me , ” one message says .
Even if Oksana is charged with extortion , Mel is n’t off the hook from his criminal and civil investigations , says Los Angeles - based criminal defense attorney Steve Cron .
“ Prosecution can still go after him , even if she ’s extorting him , ” Cron tells HollywoodLife.com .
“ The trouble is whether or not she tape - recorded him legally or not .
It ’s against the law to tape - record somebody without their consent , unless it ’s for the purpose to document the crime . ”
While the Sheriff ’s Department begins their investigation on Oksana , the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Service will continue its investigation to make sure Oksana and Mel are fit parents for their eight - month - old baby girl , Lucia .

Google has announced a " new approach " in its ongoing battle with China over censorship .
Until recently , the firm automatically redirected Chinese users to its unfiltered search site in Hong Kong to get round censorship issues .
Google has said it will now stop this after Beijing warned it could lose its licence to operate in the country .
Instead , Chinese users will be sent to a " landing page " .
Clicking anywhere on it sends them to the Hong Kong site .
In practice , this will make little difference to Chinese internet users as searches for sensitive topics are still blocked by China 's great firewall .
However , Google said that the subtle change - where users have to actively click on a link to access unfiltered search results rather than being automatically redirected - was " consistent " with its approach not to self - censor search results and was hopeful it would allow it to continue operating in China .
Chinese law demands that companies use web servers based in China and that they agree to censor certain sensitive information .
BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones said there was no guarantee the Chinese authorities would accept the new arrangement .
' Sophisticated attack '
Google announced the changes one day before the deadline to renew its Internet Content Provider ( ICP ) licence , necessary to operate in the country .
Analysis
It 's called the " Google Dance " .
To show up at the top of Google 's search pages , companies regularly have to change the way their websites work , fine - tuning them as Google constantly updates its search algorithm .
Right now , Google is doing its very own Google Dance , but to the tune of the Chinese authorities .
Google can't afford to be kicked out of China - not commercially , because China already is the world 's largest internet market , and not ideologically , because you cannot claim to " organise the world 's information " if you have one massive black hole right in the middle of it .
While search engine optimisation is relatively straightforward , Google will find it much harder if not impossible to please China 's political algorithm .
The Chinese authorities want to control what their citizens watch and read .
Google 's latest move does n't meet this goal .
But yielding control would critically damage Google 's brand in the rest of the world .
" Without an ICP licence , we can't operate a commercial website like Google.
cn — so Google would effectively go dark in China , " said David Drummond of the firm in a blog post .
" That 's a prospect dreaded by many of our Chinese users , who have been vocal about their desire to keep Google.cn alive . "
A spokesperson for the firm said Google was about to submit its new ICP application to the government and had made the changes in an effort to continue operating in the country .
It has already begun to channel some Chinese web users to the new page .
" Over the next few days we 'll end the redirect entirely , taking all our Chinese users to our new landing page — and today we re-submitted our ICP licence renewal application based on this approach , " said Mr Drummond .
Google has had a long history of run-ins with the Chinese authorities .
However , these escalated in January when the search firm announced that it was considering withdrawing from China altogether following a " sophisticated " cyber attack originating from the country .
The attacks targeted the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists , along with the computers and infrastructure of Google and several other US firms .
The firm eventually decided to stay in the country , but offer Chinese users unfiltered search results through its Hong Kong servers .
The latest move was part of the firm 's ambition to " make information available to users everywhere , " said Mr Drummond .
" This new approach is consistent with our commitment not to self censor and , we believe , with local law .
We are therefore hopeful that our licence will be renewed . "
China hopes that nearly half the population will have access to the internet within five years .
That figure is nearly 30 % at the moment .
Losing business in the country could harm Google 's future growth prospects .
However , unlike in other markets , Google is not focused on search in China , which is currently dominated by Baidu .
Instead , experts say , Google aims to develop its music and maps services in the country .

Is there a valid reason at this point why BP is still calling the shots on anything ?
What kind of democracy allows BP to decide who can go where and what can be photographed ?
We ’re well past the point of another speech full of tough talk .
Action , please .
Here ’s what President Obama did n’t see when he visited the Gulf Coast : a dead dolphin rotting in the shore weeds .
“ When we found this dolphin it was filled with oil .
Oil was just pouring out of it .
It was the saddest darn thing to look at , ” said a BP contract worker who took the Daily News on a surreptitious tour of the wildlife disaster unfolding in Louisiana .
His motive : simple outrage .
“ There is a lot of coverup for BP .
They specifically informed us that they do n’t want these pictures of the dead animals .
They know the ocean will wipe away most of the evidence .
It ’s important to me that people know the truth about what ’s going on here , ” the contractor said .
Brooklyn yuppies are cooking up more than just artisanal pizza and nuclear reactors these days .
Looking to cultivate their Great Depression chic schtick , " hipster kids " and " foodie enthusiasts " are making illegal moonshine .
Ride the Williamsburg White Lightning !
The BBC today digs deep into the murky world of " high - end mixologists " — distillers of illegal alcohol .
And you may be shocked to learn that some of them are operating in , of all places , Brooklyn !
One anonymous Brooklyn resident told the BBC , " Growing up , me and my brothers watched our dad make moonshine in the bathtub .
Now we do it . "
But these wily bootleggers are keeping one eye on their hooch , and the other on Johnny Law : " You 've got to be careful about who you tell .
I would n't go blabbing about it to someone I 'd just met . "
Not a bad idea , since producing illegal booze can bring along a $ 15,000 fine and up to five years in jail .
So where do these new moonshiners buy their stills ?
Many look to Colonel Vaughn Wilson , who can ship you a copper still from his home in Arkansas for anywhere from $ 300 to $ 11,000 .
For instance , if you 're looking to make good sized batch of booze , you can buy a 10 - gallon copper Ozark Mountain still from Colonel Wilson for $ 895 .
Add in the ingredients , and you can be the coolest person at the next slow food dinner party when you bust out some homemade 180 proof liquor , and all for just over $ 1,000 .
With this hot trend in full gear Colonel Wilson says demand for his products has doubled in the past few years , and he has a message for law enforcement : " The authorities will never stop moonshine .
They are wasting their time trying . "

A Queensland Government official has been stood aside for not acting sooner on concerns about water contamination caused by an underground coal gasification trial in state 's South Burnett region .
Cougar Energy has been ordered to shut down its underground coal gasification trial at Kingaroy and landholders in the area have been told not to use bore water pending test results .
The company detected carcinogenic chemicals , benzine and toluene , in monitoring bores in April but did not notify the department until the end of June .
The Queensland Government has promised a full investigation into the water contamination at the South Burnett gas project .
The company cannot reopen its operation until further tests are conducted .
The Government says the low levels of benzine and toluene do not pose a health risk , but nearby property owners are being told not to drink bore water .
Energy Minister Stephen Robertson says other bores in the area will be tested .
" What I want to do is assure landholders and the community more generally that we will leave no stone unturned in terms of investigating the discovery of these chemicals in the water supply , " he said .
DERM director - general John Bradley says the company took too long to report the test results .
Residents were not told until last night and Mr Bradley says a departmental officer has been stood aside for not acting sooner .
" They were looking at levels that were below Australian drinking water guidelines and I think they have taken that into account , " he said .
" Nevertheless our commitment is to make sure that we 've transparency in relation to any exceedence or detection in relation to these kinds of chemical compounds .
" We have stood the officer aside . "
DERM has asked Carbon and Linc Energy to also carry out an environmental evaluation their Dalby and Chinchilla operations .
Carbon spokesman Andrew Dash says they will cooperate .
" It certainly wo n't change our operation , " he said .
But Kingaroy resident Wendy Buttsworth says locals have been vindicated .
" Obviously our concerns have been well founded , " he said .
DERM officers are currently in Kingaroy talking to residents .
Cougar Energy has been contacted for comment .

Pop star Pink was rushed to hospital last night after being catapulted into the crowd during a gig in Germany after a stunt went wrong .
The star fell from a harness that suspended her above the stage onto a steel barricade during last night 's show concert in Nuremberg , Germany .
The show was ended immediately following the incident .
The 30 - year - old later assured fans that she that she was expected to make a full recovery following the accident .
“ Ok all my lovers out there - nothings broken , no fluid in the lungs , just seriously sore , ” she wrote .
“ I made that barricade my b*tch !!!!
Thanx nurnberg : ( ( sic ) . ”
Pink had earlier tweeted from the ambulance on the way to the hospital , telling fans that she was “ embarrassed and very sorry ” .
Moore 's on - again , off - again husband Carey Hart also showed his support via Twitter , adding that his gal was out of the hospital and on the mend .
" @Pink is all good , " he tweeted .
" Just got the sh-- kicked out of her by the barrier .

The big news of the Visionaries panel was Joss Whedon announcement that he is officially directing the Avengers movie , but the purpose of the panel was to give Whedon and Abrams an opportunity to talk about their experiences and influences as film and television storytellers .
In the spirit of Comic Con , moderator Doc Jensen asked them to share their own moments of extreme fandom , and Abrams revealed the odd prop he received after writing a fan letter to The Exorcist makeup artist Stan Smith :
Whedon and Abrams both explained what inspired them to become storytellers :
When asked about Super 8 his Steven Spielberg - produced project , Abrams talked about his first glancing encounter with Spielberg , when he was asked to repair the 8 mm movies Spielberg made as a teenager :
In the wake of Lost 's end and the cancellation of Dollhouse , the pair discussed serialized television versus self - contained episodes , and network television executives ' reluctance to look at serialized shows :
They offered a bit of writing advice — or at least advice about dealing with writers — when an audience member asked about her brother , who has trouble accepting criticism :

Efforts to tackle illegal destruction of the world 's rainforests have been a success , according to a new report that details a significant fall in unauthorised logging .
The Chatham House study , released today , says that illegal logging has dropped by between 50 and 75 % across Cameroon , Indonesia and the Brazilian Amazon over the last decade ; globally it has dropped by one - fifth since 2002 .
The study credits actions taken by governments and pressure groups for the improvement , as well as greater responsibility across the private sector .
Sam Lawson , associate fellow at Chatham House and lead author of the report , said : " Up to a billion of the world 's poorest people are dependent on forests , and reductions in illegal logging are helping to protect their livelihoods . "
The fall in illegal logging , if continued , could save billions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and help the fight against global warming , the report says .
The change over the last decade has seen 17 m hectares of forest saved from degradation , preventing the release of 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 emissions .
Viewed another way , if the trees saved were legally logged and sold , this could bring an extra US $ 6.5 bn in additional income to the forest nations .
Stephen O'Brien , international development minister , said : " In the world 's poorest countries , illegal logging fuels corruption and results in billions of pounds in lost revenue every year .
For the hundreds of millions of people across the globe who depend on forests for their livelihood , curbing illegal logging means vital sources of income remain protected .
This groundbreaking report sets out the success stories brought about through international efforts in reducing illegal logging , which encourages us all to pursue these efforts further . "
In 2000 , the UK , US , Japan , France and Netherlands imported more than 20 million cubic metres of illegally logged timber .
By 2008 , that dropped to 17 m cubic metres .
Although illegal logging has declined , it remains a major problem , the report says .
Where progress has already been made , additional gains are likely to be increasingly hard to achieve .
A new approach will be needed to halt completely the illegal timber trade , it adds .
The report , which compared records of wood imports to legal exports , says : " If they are to be effective , mechanisms to encourage developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation will require secure control and sound governance of forest resources .
Efforts to tackle illegal logging and improve forest governance have already proved to be successful and cost - effective , and it is essential that the climate change agenda for forests serves to reinforce this response , rather than distract from it . "
“ I ’ll be a different kind of governor for Florida .

When I ’m elected governor , those are the people who will be front and center .
And they are the ones I ’ll think about when it comes time to make the hard decisions . ”
Lua Semantic Highlighting for Emacs
One potential source of errors in Lua programs is the unintended use of global variables .
The lua2 - mode Emacs mode aims to show how improved editors can help programmers to avoid these errors , without changing the Lua language itself .
When writing Lua code , it is all too easy to forget to declare a certain variable as local .
In all likelihood , the program will still work as expected , but problems will occur if the affected code is called recursively or from co-routines .
Another code fragment might mistakenly use the same global variable , too .
Traditional approaches for detecting unwanted global variables use separate tools external to the editor , typically based on bytecode scanning .
Obvious advantage is editor independence and integration with build processes .
The downside is a lack of immediate feedback to programmers .
lua2 - mode is an experiment to see if such immediate feedback is helpful when writing Lua programs .
When lua2 - mode is loaded , global variable references are shown in bold .
Assignments and bindings are underlined .
Assignments to global variables are also shown in italics .
You can change the appearance of variable references by customizing the lua2 -* faces .
If you drop the references to font - lock - variable - name - face , globals stand out even more clearly , but this might be considered excessive .
If the point is at a reference to a local variable , pressing C-c C -d jumps to its definition .
You can rename a local variable ( and all its occurrences within its scope ) by pressing C - c C-r .
I wrote the parser by hand , and it is still not quite right .
In particular , some invalid programs are accepted .
The current implementation is too slow for actually editing medium - sized files with it .
It might be possible to improve its speed by switching to syntax tables instead of regular expressions for lexing .
Better editor support is possible if we execute Lua code in a sandbox and extract information from that .
Microsoft has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for Javascript ( Scott Guthrie , JavaScript Intellisense Improvements with VS 2010 , April 2010 ) .
We would have to embed a Lua interpreter into Emacs , but Emacs lacks a plug - in interface , so we would have to create a private fork for this purpose .
For this reason , the current approach based on Emacs and a parser written in Emacs Lisp is a dead end .
lua2 - mode is free software , available on the GNU General Public License , version 2 or later .
lua2 - mode has only been tested with GNU Emacs 23.1 .
It depends on lua -mode , which must also be installed .
I recommend to byte - compile lua2 - mode , in order to get somewhat better performance .
Please send problem reports to fw@deneb.enyo.de and include the string lua2 - mode in the subject line .
Problem reports should include Lua source which exhibits the problem , and a short description what is going wrong .
Please also indicate if I may put your source code into the test suite .
Revisions
2010 - 07 - 25 : Version 0.1 published .
2011 -10 -09 : Released version 0.2 , using a bold , black face for global variable references , and fixing a bug in for scope handling .

Sony is showing off a new prototype display capable of 360 degree 3D images at Siggraph in LA .
The new 360 º autostereoscopic display allows users to view full colour volumetric objects from all angles , as if objects really exist , but no 3D glasses are required to see the image .
The RayModeler 3D display uses LED light forces and can show 360 unique images , in 24 - bit full color , to all directions in one - degree separations .
The device uses a series of cameras that circle the object being recorded , allowing broadcasts to have true depth , unlike current 3D offerings .
A Sony spokesperson said : " We can sense the depth of the object because our left and right eyes see different images . "
The display has a digital - video input port for connection to computers or other devices .
It is also equipped with a gesture sensor to allow users to move and interact with the object inside the cylindrical display .

Washington ( CNN ) --
A severe thunderstorm packing high winds blew through the Washington metro area Sunday afternoon , downing trees and power lines , and leaving tens of thousands of residents without power .
The storms claimed the lives of two people .
Electricity provider Pepco reported that as of Sunday evening , about 280,000 residences across the District of Columbia , Maryland and Virginia were still in the dark -- and without air - conditioning -- on one of the hottest days of the year , with temperatures reaching 99 degrees at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport .
" The AC is not running , the stove is not working , the refrigerator is running , and I 'm able to plug a fan in , " said Leah Schklar , who lives in southeast Washington .
" But nothing else is working . "
Kerry Heidcamp in the Washington suburb of North Kensington , Maryland , said she was doing what she could to keep cool .
" My house has tiled floors , so I 've been laying on the tiled floor because it 's actually cold , " she said .
Several trees were blocking roads in the district , and live power lines were creating potential hazards , according to the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency .
The agency was urging motorists and pedestrians traveling around the city to use caution .
The storm was part of a slow - moving front that struck parts of the Northeast before moving south .
One person was killed and another injured in Beltsville , Maryland , when a tree fell on the car in which they were riding , according to Cpl. Clinton Copeland , a spokesman for the Prince George 's County Police Department .
The injured person 's condition was unknown Sunday night .
One person was killed in Millersburg , Pennsylvania , after being electrocuted by a downed power line , according to the National Weather Service .
The system was expected to continue moving toward the Southeast Monday , but the severe weather threat was expected to expire Sunday night .
CNN 's Angela Fritz and Jonathan Helman , and CNNRadio's Matt Cherry contributed to this report .
Image copyright AFP Image caption The Amalthea was forced to divert after being shadowed by Israeli vessels
A ship loaded with aid supplies for Gaza has docked in an Egyptian port , ending the latest attempt by activists to break Israel 's Gaza blockade .
The vessel was intercepted by Israeli naval ships off the coast of Gaza and forced to head south , the charity which chartered the ship said .
The charity , headed by Col Muammar Gaddafi 's son , said it wanted to reach Gaza , but would not risk violence .
In May , Israeli forces clashed with another convoy , killing nine on board .
On Monday , an Israeli military inquiry said it had found mistakes were made at a senior level during the operation , which sparked international outrage , but the troops had been justified in using force .
' Blocked '
The Libyan - chartered Amalthea left Greece on Saturday , carrying food and medical equipment , as well as 15 pro-Palestinian activists and 12 crew members .
Egyptian officials at El - Arish , some 50 km ( 30 miles ) to the west of Gaza , said the ship docked at the north Sinai port late on Wednesday .
Analysis According to the ship 's owner , Alex Angelopoulos , the Amalthea did not suffer a mechanical breakdown - the story about engine failure was a ploy , invented by the Cuban captain , after the Israelis surrounded the vessel and gave him an ultimatum to change course away from Gaza .
The captain was trying to buy some time for the Libyan charity to muster international diplomatic support to pressure the Israelis to let the vessel through .
He restarted the engines around midday local time and is now underway .
Mr Angelopoulos earlier said this expedition was a risky venture , although he prided himself on taking chances .
He said he was motivated by humanitarian reasons , but he is also acting in the tradition of Greek shipowners like Aristotle Onassis , who made fortunes by breaching embargoes .
" As soon as the ship arrives in El - Arish , Egyptian authorities will unload its cargo and hand the aid to the Egyptian Red Crescent , which will deliver it to the Palestinian side , " Egypt 's Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said earlier .
The vessel was intercepted by Israeli navy boats some 100 km ( 60 miles ) off the coast of Gaza and blocked from heading any further towards the east .
An Al - Jazeera correspondent on board said that Israeli navy boats had formed a " wall " on one side of the Amalthea and forced it towards El - Arish .
Israel 's navy began shadowing the vessel overnight , after warning that it would not be allowed to break the naval blockade of Gaza .
The Amalthea resumed its voyage mid-morning on Wednesday after idling for a few hours in international waters .
The Israeli military said the ship had run into engine trouble , but the ship 's owner later told the BBC that it was a ploy by the captain to buy time for the Libyan charity to muster international support .
A spokesman for the Gaddafi Foundation said those on board would not resort to violence .
" First and foremost , we want to arrive in Gaza , " Yussef Sawani told Al - Jazeera TV .
" If this is impossible , we do n't want to subject anyone to danger . "
Israeli officials denied the group 's reports that they were given an ultimatum to change course by midnight or face a forceful takeover .

The 92 m ( 302ft ) Amalthea , renamed Al - Amal ( Hope ) for the mission , is loaded with 2,000 tonnes of food , cooking oil , medicines and pre-fabricated houses , the group says .
For the past three years , Israel has enforced a tight economic blockade on the Gaza Strip , only allowing in limited humanitarian aid .
It says this is necessary to stop weapons for Palestinian militant groups inside Gaza being smuggled in , and to put pressure on the Islamist movement Hamas , which controls the coastal territory .
Egypt has also closed its border with Gaza , only opening it occasionally .
The blockade , maintained by Israel and Egypt , was widely described as " collective punishment " resulting in a humanitarian crisis for Gaza 's 1.4 million people .
Last month , Israel announced it would ease restrictions by allowing consumer goods into the territory while banning or restricting trade in weapons and materials that could have a military use .

Meanwhile , Israel 's parliament voted on Tuesday to strip an Israeli Arab lawmaker of some key privileges for joining the flotilla of aid ships that tried to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza in May .
The Knesset decided to remove Hanin Zuabi 's diplomatic passport and funding for legal defence .
Some MPs complained that by penalising an Arab member , the parliamentarians were endangering democracy , but others said that it was her actions which threatened freedoms and rights in Israel .
Ms Zuabi , an MP with the left - wing Arab nationalist Balad party , said the Knesset was punishing her out of vengeance and was threatening co-existence between Jews and Arabs .

When 8 - year - old Nathan Kuhns saw a man trying to abduct his 4 - year - old sister during a family vacation in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , he just did what came naturally .
" I screamed because of the fact someone was trying to pull her in the car and I went down there and beat the crap out of this guy , " the Pittsburgh - area boy told a local TV station .
South Carolina police credit Nathan 's heroics Friday with rescuing his sister , Josie , who had run off while they were walking near a beach access .
The suspect snatched the girl from behind and was trying to put her in his car when Nathan came running .
The man fled and is still at large .
Nathan said he scratched the suspect to get some forensic evidence .
" It 's called DNA and I saw it on ' NCIS ' on TV , " he said in an interview with KDKA .
Erin Kuhns related her son's story .
" He said , ' Mommy , I just kicked and I punched and I hit , and I just kept doing it , ' " she said .
The suspect " kept grabbing her , and he kept pulling her and kept trying to put her back in the car . "
The family and police are hoping the DNA evidence will help catch the suspect .

ATLANTA , July 12 ( UPI ) -- A
Texas law student who took a defense lawyer 's $ 1 million challenge from a " Dateline NBC " interview is suing for the money he claims he is owed .
Dustin Kolodziej of the San Antonio area said attorney James Mason offered in a " Dateline NBC " interview he would pay $ 1 million to anyone who could prove him wrong in claiming his client , Nelson Serrano , could have made it from Atlanta 's Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport to a La Quinta
Inn three miles away in less than 28 minutes , The Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported Monday .

" I challenge anybody to show me .
I 'll pay them $ 1 million if they can do it , " Mason told the interview .
Serrano was convicted of killing four people from Bartow , Fla. , in 1997 and the prosecution 's case hinged on his ability to reach the inn in the time frame .
Kolodziej said he got off a plane at the airport , took his car from the parking garage and made it to the inn in just 19 minutes , capturing the whole experience on a camcorder .
However , Mason refused to pay the $ 1 million reward , claiming the offer was a figure of speech .
Kolodziej 's lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta , alleges breach of contract , claiming Mason 's statements on " Dateline " constituted a verbal contract .
" What this case boils down to is would a reasonable person believe that this is legitimate , " said David George , a lawyer for Kolodziej .
" Think about the context .
He 's on ' Dateline , ' national TV , and his client is on death row .
That is not a joking context . "
For years she picked up trash , tidied picnic tables , manned the snack bar and set up park events for the city of Bell .
Rosario Torres ’ $ 9 - an - hour job came with no benefits , but it helped support her family of seven .
When she was laid off in 2008 , she applied for another city job but never heard back .
Now , reports that Bell city officials are among the most highly compensated municipal employees in the nation has left Torres disgusted .
The 36 - year - old said she cannot fathom how the city manager earns nearly $ 800,000 in the same tiny working - class town where she struggles to find employment .
“ They said there was no budget for me , ” Torres said Thursday afternoon , sitting with her children at one of the parks she used to clean .
“ Now I ca n’t pay my bills .
I only pay for water , gas and electricity , and those are late .
I ’m angry .
There need to be changes ; they need to find jobs for people here . ”
The Times reported Thursday that Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo earns nearly twice the salary of President Obama , Police Chief Randy Adams about 50 % more than Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia more than the chief executive for Los Angeles County .
Rizzo was unapologetic , saying he could earn just as much in private business .
Several council members said Rizzo had saved the city from near bankruptcy and was worth every penny of his salary .
A community of 36,000 , Bell is predominantly Latino , its ethnic roots evident in the markets and panaderias that line its main thoroughfares .
Mom - and - pop auto businesses , coin laundries and beauty salons dot the city , located southeast of downtown , where the Los Angeles River cuts beneath the 710 Freeway .
Here , the notion of six - figure incomes contrasts sharply with modest neighborhoods of simple one - story homes and worn - out , littered strip malls .
The median income is about $ 40,000 , and 65 % of residents over 25 do not have a high school diploma .
Many said they were forced to look for jobs in neighboring cities or get by on part - time work .
“ It ’s a blue - collar city .
A lot of people are just trying to make ends meet , ” said Bell resident Victor Munoz , who said he was laid off from his telecommunications job last year and is now taking pharmacy technician classes .
Munoz , 42 , has lived in the area for decades and says the immigrant community is largely unaware of what happens at City Hall .
“ They do n’t know or they do n’t understand it , ” he said .
“ Because of the language barrier or their schooling , they do n’t always comprehend what ’s going on . ”
Bell is being investigated by the Los Angeles County district attorney over the compensation of its City Council members , who receive about $ 100,000 a year for their part - time positions .
In a city the size of Bell , a council member is typically paid about $ 400 a month , according to state records .
Assemblyman Hector De La Torre ( D - South Gate ) , who wrote a 2005 bill that limited some city council salaries , expressed outrage over the salaries of Bell ’s top administrators .
“ The president of the United States and other public servants who oversee much more complicated and sophisticated operations make much less than these city officials , ” he said .
“ I think that makes it really clear these salaries are overdone . ”
The City Council , he said , “ is completely avoiding their fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayer . ”
Bell city employees are tight - lipped , saying they ’re not allowed to speak about the subject , and employees of a grocery owned by Mayor Oscar Hernandez asked a reporter to leave .
Residents , however , have no problem expressing what they think about their city ’s budget , which pays the police chief — who oversees a 46 - person department — $ 457,000 a year .
By contrast , Los Angeles ’ police chief oversees 12,899 people and earns $ 307,000 .
Maricela Morales , a single mother of three who works as a medical assistant at a clinic , said the news about her city was disheartening at a time when she was seeking a second job to help make the rent .
“ That is too much for them , ” she said .
“ And I wonder how I ’m going to support my children . ”
Christian Andrade , 32 , who earns $ 10 an hour as a waiter at a Mexican restaurant , said that he often worried about making the out - of - pocket health insurance payments for his wife and himself , and that lately he had sensed more crime in his neighborhood .
As he left a laundromat with a bag of clothes over his shoulder , he shook his head at the Times front page that illustrated the steep climb of Rizzo ’s salary to $ 787,637 over more than a decade .
“ If you ’re making that much money , ” Andrade said , “ it should be a better city . ”

Times staff writer Jeff Gottlieb contributed to this report .
She lives in northern India and dreams of moving to a city called Toronto .
She has some family there .
And she knows how to get there with no long wait and a minimum of paperwork :
All she has to do is find a Canadian to marry her .
Once married , she is granted permanent resident status .
Once in Canada , all she needs to do to begin her new life is abandon him .
The entire ugly process can be completed in a matter of months .
That ’s how easy it is .
And the consequences ?
Almost none .
Those who marry fraudulently are rarely deported .
“ It ’s one of the biggest challenges for immigration , ” said Richard Kurland , Vancouver - based veteran immigration policy analyst and immigration lawyer .
“ The problem knows no colour , no language . ”
“ The only people getting hurt are Canadians — in their hearts and their wallets , ” he said .
Hundreds of fraudulent marriages take place every year .
Citizenship and Immigration Canada acknowledges roughly 1,000 such cases are reported annually .
In 2009 , nearly 45,000 people immigrated to Canada as spouses .
“ These are complicated cases , ” said Doug Kellam , an immigration spokesman .
“ It is tough to prove bad faith by a sponsored partner . ”
A bad - faith relationship must meet two criteria — that it is not genuine and that it was entered into to obtain immigration status .
CIC and Canada Border Services Agency do investigate immigration - related fraud but fraudulent marriages are n’t really a priority .
Their main focus is on issues of national security .
CBSA has eight officers to investigate bad - faith marriages .
There are about 350 immigration enforcement officers across Canada .
Last year , CBSA deported 14,762 people , said Patrizia Giolti , spokesperson for the agency .
But there are no statistics on how many people are deported because of “ misrepresentation , ” she added .
The Toronto - based non-profit organization , which boasts almost 200 members across Canada , came into being after Benet ’s son , Saranjeet Benet , was allegedly abandoned by his wife days after she arrived in Canada from India .
The organization launched a class - action lawsuit in 2009 against the federal government for failing to investigate and deport foreigners who trick Canadians into marriages of convenience .
At least 70 per cent of the cases are from South Asia , he said .
“ It ’s not a new phenomenon . . . foreigners have been defrauding us for years but what has the government done ?
Nothing , ” said Benet , whose family is still scarred by what happened years ago .
“ She divided our family .
. . it can never be the same again for us . ”
Abandoned spouses are angry about what happened to them but they also worry they could be on the hook for thousands of dollars .
Fraudulent marriage or not , a Canadian sponsor remains obligated financially to a foreign spouse for up to three years under the terms of sponsorship .
That means if the spouse ends up on government assistance , the sponsor must repay the government and risks being denied future sponsorships .
Even if they divorce , the Canadian sponsor remains financially obligated if the spouse goes on welfare .
The sponsorship period was 10 years but it was reduced to three years a couple of years ago .
In some cases , the government has asked sponsors to cough up as much as $ 100,000 .
“ Imagine being asked to pay money for a fiancée who has abandoned you ? ” said Jeff Vanderhorst .
“ That would be brutal . ”
The Amherstburg , Ont. - native met Yennis Escobar Pompa in Cuba in 1999 .
Four years later , he sponsored her to Canada as his fiancée .
In three weeks , she disappeared , said Vanderhorst , now 48 .
He complained to immigration and border services numerous times that Pompa had broken the terms of sponsorship , which specified the couple had to marry within 90 days .
Nothing was done , he said .
In the next couple of years , he discovered that she had obtained permanent residency and was living on welfare in Montreal .
No claim has yet been made on him but Vanderhorst , who is still angry about how immigration handled his case , is on the hook until 2013 .
Seven years after she disappeared , he ’s still very bitter .
“ I do n’t trust women .
. . .
Yes , I am still hung up about it , ” he said .
“ Until it happens to you , you 'll never know how it hurts . ”
One proposal is to introduce a provisional visa valid for two years for new spouses .
“ Australia has it , so does the U.S. , ” pointed out Julie Taub , an immigration lawyer .
Under this provision , if the marriage is still intact after the second year , the immigrating spouse can apply for a permanent visa .
It does n’t eliminate the problem “ but does make it slightly tougher for people to plan elaborate marriage frauds , ” said Richard Kurland .
Not everyone agrees .
There are concerns that a temporary visa would force women to stay in abusive relationships .
“ It creates a class of vulnerable people living in Canada , ” said Rudolf Kischer , a well - known immigration lawyer in Vancouver .
He believes people need to be educated about the pitfalls of marrying outside Canada .
Those who get permanent status in Canada through fraud are eventually able to sponsor their own family members , said Taub .
It ’s what she calls chain migration based on an original fraud .
Citizenship and Immigration Canada is planning to tighten policies to prevent people from gaining permanent residency through marriage fraud , said spokesperson Doug Kellam .
The sponsorship program is hard on some people and “ minister ( Jason ) Kenney is looking at changes , ” said Kellam .
“ He is consulting with different groups and looking at how the law might be structured to deal with this kind of a situation . ”
Vanderhorst says he ’ll be very happy if the law is overhauled .
“ It wo n’t change anything for me personally but it ’ll be a deterrent for foreigners who play with our emotions , make fools of us , ” he said .
“ We ca n't let them get away with it . ”
His was a fairy tale wedding .
Markham ’s Kashmir Janagal flew to Punjab , India , with his parents and a half - dozen relatives in early 2008 .
There were three pre-weddings parties , hundreds of guests and on Feb. 16 , he married Parveen Kumari , a woman he and his family had known for years .
Janagal , now 34 , returned home and filed his wife ’s sponsorship papers .
She flew to Toronto on Feb. 8 , 2009 .
Janagal says his wife ’s uncle , who lives in Montreal , was also at the airport .
Eventually , everyone went to Janagal ’s home .

“ She did n’t want to talk to me but only to her uncle , ” said Janagal , who was then training to be a primary school teacher .
He left for work the next day .
When he returned , she was gone .
Janagal says he tried calling dozens of time — there was no answer .
Finally , he filed a missing person ’s report .
A few days later , she filed assault charges against him .
He next saw Kumari this January at the trial , where charges against him were dismissed .
It was vindication but not enough .
“ She has taken two years of my life .
. . .
The emotional pain is unbelievable , ” said Janagal .
“ You fall totally in love and realize you ’ve been used .
I ’ve lost faith in people . ”
Janagal , who is still married to Kumari , has complained to CIC , CBSA and the Prime Minister ’s office .
“ I ’ll keep at it until I know what ’s happening with her . ”
She was devastated when it happened ; now she ’s at peace .
“ I know the government works slowly but I have faith . . . he will be deported eventually . ”
Cindy Green , now 52 , met Francisco Vargas while on holiday in Punta Cana , Dominican Republic , in 2003 .
They got married in October 2004 , 18 months after they had first met .
Vargas came to Canada in December 2005 .
Green , who lives in Woodbridge , says everything was fine the first month and he even started working at a local restaurant .
“ In January , he started to change , ” she said .
He got upset at the slightest reason and “ tried to provoke me into fights at every opportunity . ”
On Jan. 31 , 2006 , seven weeks after landing in Toronto , he left without an explanation .
When Canada Border Services Agency did n’t do anything , Green hired a private detective in Punta Cana .
Within weeks , he found that Vargas had a common - law wife and four children with her .
Armed with proof , she went to the border agency .
Privacy issues still prevent her from knowing what exactly is going on “ but I know that he has a deportation hearing soon . ”
Green says she ’s not bitter any more .
“ I just feel that we have to keep fighting to change our immigration system .
Why is it that very few people are deported even though it ’s proven they used marriage as a way to get to Canada ? ”
Evan Wilson , 36 , of St. Thomas , Ont. met Yaemin Garcia Gonzalez while holidaying in Havana in September 2008 .
There was an instant connection with the 23 - year - old .
He spent about five days with her and then returned to Canada .
One thing led to another and they were married in Havana in December 2008 , her young daughter by her side .
In January 2010 , she arrived in Toronto .
The two lived happily for some weeks .
Then Wilson said he happened to see her email .
“ She had written to her friend that her ex-boyfriend wanted her to claim abuse against me and go to a shelter , ” he said .
He says he begged her to come clean .
She said she wanted to go home .
He bought her a ticket but she never boarded the flight .
Wilson does n’t know how but Gonzalez somehow wound up in Miami and then in Louisville , Kentucky .
“ She ’s illegal there and they will deport her . . . but to Canada and she ’ll go on welfare here , ” said Wilson .
“ She should go back to Cuba . ”
Wilson has called and written to Citizenship and Immigration Canada and Canada Border Services Agency dozens of time .
He says the two government agencies do n’t care that she was charged with prostitution in 2005 and 2007 or that she circumvented the law here .
“ There are too many such stories , ” said Wilson .
“ Something needs to be done and quickly . ”
He had heard stories of brides and grooms abandoning their spouses once they reached Canada but Deepinder Mann never thought it would happen to him .
“ I was marrying someone very close to my family in India , ” said Mann , 36 , a Brampton realtor .
He married Ranjit Kaur , 31 , in Punjab , India , in January 2009 .
Mann says he spent two weeks with her but they did not consummate the marriage .
He says he sensed something was wrong but she convinced him that she would be more comfortable once she lived with him in Canada .
She came to Canada in September but did n’t stay with Mann for long .
She went to her aunt ’s place , said Mann .
When he went to talk to the aunt , he says he was told that his wife did n’t want to live with him .
“ It slowly unravelled that she had a boyfriend in India . . .
I was even given a letter in which she had admitted to it all , ” said Mann .
Kaur returned to India within weeks and Mann wrote to Citizenship and Immigration Canada and Canada Border Services Agency , warning them against letting her into Canada again .
He also went to India and registered cheating cases against Kaur and her family .
In March , he discovered that she had come to Canada again .
“ I complained to everyone and she still managed to come here , ” said Mann .
“ The system is so soft and easy to abuse .
It does n’t happen anywhere else . ”

ARPA -E backs a " Smart Metal " to Cool Future Climate Hell
July 23rd , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
As part of the new ARPA - E program designed to bring “ game - changing ” technologies to market , one of the 43 breakthroughs the Department of Energy has funded is the invention of a metal alloy for use instead of refrigerant in air conditioners and advanced refrigeration systems .
The completely new thermally elastic metal alloy makes possible a fundamental technological advance in cooling technology .
Used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems instead of liquid coolant , it would increase cooling efficiency 175 % , and cut climate - changing CO2 emissions to practically nothing .
[ social_buttons ]
Researchers at the University of Maryland are about to begin testing this prototype , built of the “ smart metal ” alloy with funding of $ 500,000 from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( the stimulus ) .
If their test succeeds , it would create a world leadership opportunity for the US , reduce climate changing greenhouse gases , and lower energy costs .
Air conditioning costs are already the biggest portion of home energy bills , and with climate change resulting in more heat wave days each summer over the next decades , these hits to the family pocketbook will only increase as temperatures rise .
The “ smart metal ” , a solid coolant to take the place of fluids used in conventional refrigeration and air conditioning compressors was developed by materials science engineers Ichiro Takeuchi , Manfred Wuttig and Jun Cui at Maryland ’s A. James Clark School of Engineering .
Eric Wachsman , the lead researcher , and director of the University of Maryland Energy Research Center ( UMERC ) says the grants will help the state of Maryland develop ‘ green ’ economy .
Wachsman who has been on the job at Maryland for about eight months has also submitted a proposal to the Department of Energy to locate a $ 130 million multi-institutional research hub in the Washington , D.C. region , focusing on a broad array of green building research ( including technology such as this ) .
Next the team will test the commercial viability of their smart metal for space cooling applications .
“ These grants are highly competitive and require a demonstration that the technology has genuine commercial potential , ” says Wachman .
The 0.01 - ton prototype is intended to replace conventional vapor compression cooling technology .
Instead of fluids , it uses a solid - state material — a thermoelastic shape memory alloy , that alternately absorbs or creates heat in much the same way as a compressor - based system , but uses far less energy .
General Electric Global Research and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are partnering with the University of Maryland on the project .

( CNN ) -- Ethnic Tibetans ' ability to thrive in high altitudes with low oxygen is the fastest genetic change ever observed in humans , according to a study published Friday in the journal Science .
Researchers at the University of California - Berkeley said their comparison of the genomes of ethnic Tibetan and Han Chinese could help scientists understand how the body deals with decreased oxygen and diseases associated with oxygen deprivation in the womb , according to a news release on the university 's website .
The evolutionary biologists say the results of their study , which compares the genomes of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese , shows that Tibetans rapidly developed a unique ability to survive in altitudes above 13,000 feet , where oxygen levels are about 40 percent lower than at sea level .
The study said that Tibetans evolved to adapt to high altitudes after splitting off from the Han about 2,750 years ago .
The study identified more than 30 genes with DNA mutations that have become more prevalent in Tibetans than Han Chinese , nearly half of which are related to how the body uses oxygen .
" For such a very strong change , a lot of people would have had to die simply due to the fact that they had the wrong version of a gene , " said Rasmus Nielsen , a professor of integrative biology at Berkeley who led the statistical analysis .
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott is refusing to back the deal made between the Federal Government and the resources sector over its redesigned resources tax .
Mr Abbott is not rescinding his calls for a new tax on the mining industry to be dumped and has declared that the next election will be a referendum on it .
The Government has backed down on several key areas in a bid to end the damaging stoush with the resources sector , dumping its Resource Super Profits Tax for the Minerals Resource Rent Tax ( MRRT ) .

Oil and coal seam gas to be rolled into the existing Petroleum Resources Rent Tax and taxed at 40 pc Changes mean the Government loses $ 1.5 billion of expected revenue
The industry has welcomed the deal and share prices soared in early trade in the wake of the announcement .
Prime Minister Julia Gillard has hailed the breakthrough as a win for the Government as it prepares to go to the polls in the coming weeks and consolidate its position in the wake of Kevin Rudd 's ousting as prime minister .
The Opposition has said it would block the tax and the deal struck has not swayed Mr Abbott .
" I think it 's clear form the Prime Minister 's comments this morning that battlelines are drawn for the coming election , " he said .
" The next election will be a referendum on tax .
" The Government wants a new tax , the Coalition does n't .
It 's as simple as that .
" Any commitment that the Prime Minister made to the industry are as believable as her previous protestations to Kevin Rudd .
" This tax has to be dumped . "
Opposition Treasury spokesman Joe Hockey says the new regime will be the most complicated in the world .
He has accused Wayne Swan of being the most incompetent Treasurer Australia has ever had .
" This is not tax reform , this is tax confusion , " he said .
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson has told The World Today Mr Abbott is now alone in his opposition to the tax .
" They 're the only ones out there in splendid isolation at the moment opposing the mining companies who are now accepting of the need to pay higher taxes , " he said .
" If Tony Abbott and the Opposition want to completely oppose reform in Australia they will stand condemned . "
Treasurer Wayne Swan says any legislation is unlikely to enter Parliament this year .
The Greens support the tax but will seek to make amendments .
The Greens are tipped to hold the balance of power in the Senate after the election but those changes would not take place until the end of the Senate term in July next year .
Mr Ferguson says the Government wants to get the tax through Parliament unchanged .
The new tax will result in a loss of $ 1.5 billion in revenue for the Government which means it will not be able to fund its proposed 2 per cent cut in company tax .
The rate will instead be cut by 1 per cent to 29 per cent .

Hunter S. Thompson , an infamous writer and social figure who impacted generations of avid and sometimes obsessive readers , is a primary source of America ’s most humorous , reckless , revelatory , and sometimes offensive quotes .
In an attempt at capturing the vast essence of his genius I have assembled a list of 10 memorable quotes spanning the many eras of his seemingly endless repertoire of material .
Thompson , a sportsman , writer , athlete , and all - around exceptional human being was a wildly acclaimed journalist who enjoyed and pursued not only writing but many other fine professional and non-professional engagements including politics , rifling , pistol shooting , military service in the US Air Force , and deep sea fishing .
His exploits in every field were documented , often by himself or other reputable news agencies , and have stood the test of time as iconic representations of the American Dream .
While his most infamous quotes are often linked to works such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or high - profile interviews with magazines like Playboy , there are uncountable gems lurking within the volumes and collections of his essays , news articles , and letters .
These hidden treasures often escape the narrow eyes of the public , making them the rare fruits of a somewhat over - devoured island of unmatched literary talent .
We have attempted , with this compilation , to stir up a medley of better - and lesser - known quotes which will accurately depict the various styles of writing , as well as the various stages of life , of this smashingly successful American writer .
10 . The Armed Forces
“ Be a beachcomber , a Parisian wino , an Italian pimp , or a Danish pervert ; but stay away from the Armed Forces . ”
( March 10 , 1957 in a letter from Eglin Air Force Base )
Thompson ’s obvious disdain for the American armed forces came from his problematic service period in the United States Air Force .
While he did not receive a dishonorable discharge , Thomson did not complete his contractual tour of duty with the USAF .
His unwillingness to conform to the rules and regulations of the military led to the abrupt discontinuance of his service in November of 1959 .
There are numerous rumors about Thompson “ speeding toward the guard station in a convertible with no breaks ” and “ hurling a full wine bottle at the window of the checkpoint whilst ramming the gate . ”
9 . The Absolute Truth
“ If I ’d written all the truth I knew for the past ten years , about 600 people — including me — would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today .
Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism . ”
( May 14 , 1967 in The Great Shark Hunt )
The accuracy of Thompson ’s work is often questioned by readers and critics .
Pulling a quote directly from the text of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Thompson himself stated “ Only a damn lunatic would write a thing like this and then claim it was all true . ”
Is journalism a craft of truth ?
Or perhaps creative confession of already warped information ?
Only you can answer that question for yourself .
8. Hitchhiking
“ At age 22 I set what I insist is an all - time record for distance hitchhiking in Bermuda shorts : 3,700 miles in three weeks . ”
( July 22 , 1963 in an interview with The National Observer )
One of Thompson ’s issues with his career as an American writer was that , in many instances , his vibrant and excessive personality was the focus of national attention whilst his writing , at times , was missed by the figurative paparazzi flash .
Despite his disdain for this , he contributed largely to the popularization of his almost mythic character by penning personal experiences as his primary bodies of published work .
7. The Writer
“ As things stand now , I am going to be a writer .
I ’m not sure that I ’m going to be a good one or even a self - supporting one , but until the dark thumb of fate presses me to the dust and says , ‘ you are nothing ’ , I will be a writer . ”
( June 3 , 1959 , in a letter to Roger Richards in The Proud Highway )
Dedication to his career ( he always considered writing work , at times stating that he would “ rather mine coal than write this article ” ) was a pillar of his success in the journalistic field .
Thompson realized from an early age that he would be a writer , and he held true to his craft until death .
6. The Tenant
“ I have been evicted from every place I ’ve ever lived except the one where I live now .
I finally had to buy that so I would n’t get evicted . ”
( 1985 , in Wild Sex in Sausalito )
When Thompson purchased his home in Colorado he was , for the first time , his own landlord .
Some have said that a sense of unseen responsibility was the result of land ownership , while others , mostly those infatuated with his persona as a reckless badass , state that having his own land did nothing to curtail his behavior and instead turned loose a spirit which had otherwise been hampered by the conventional world of rental housing .
Regardless , buying the Woody Creek residence was a pivotal point in the writer ’s career , allowing him to move forward with his next round of projects .
5. Nixon
“ Nixon had the unique ability to make his enemies seem honorable , and we developed a keen sense of fraternity .
Some of my best friends have hated Nixon all their lives .
My mother hates Nixon , my son hates Nixon , I hate Nixon , and this hatred has brought us together . ”
( 1994 , in a Rolling Stone interview )
Thompson ’s explicit infatuation with Richard Nixon was comical as well as revelatory ; two men from opposite sides of the social spectrum , one belittling the other night and day and the other running the nation .
It was an affair that forged some of Thompson ’s most memorable insights and left America reeling in the wake of a non-politically - educated journalist with a penchant for smelling out blood .
4. The Athlete
“ I never claimed to be anything more than a nice guy and an athlete . ”
( 1990 , on Sound Bites from the Counter Culture , a spoken word CD compilation – various artists )
It ’s true , he did not ever claim to be anything other than these things .
Thompson was a simple , honest , working man at the heart of his being , and this honesty is blaringly evident in concise quotes like this one .
3. Strange Rumblings
“ I was standing in the kitchen watching Frank put some tacos together and wondering when he was going to start waving the butcher knife in my face and yelling about the time I Maced him on my porch in Colorado ( that had been six months earlier , at the end of a very long night during which we had all consumed a large quantity of cactus products ; and when he started waving a hatchet around I ’d figured Mace was the only answer … which turned him to jelly for 45 minutes , and when he finally came around he said , ‘ If I ever see you in East Los Angeles , man , you ’re gonna wish you never heard the word ‘ Mace ’ , because I ’m gonna carve it all over your f–ckin body . ’ ”
( 1974 , in a segment of Strange Rumblings in Aztland that appeared in Rolling Stone )
A lengthy quote from a very early work shows Thompson ’s ability to capture the essence of a scene by spanning the bridges between time and bringing characters to life through quotation .
The sharp contrast between his dialogue and journalistic writing highlights both , and makes for a read that is addictive and full of a twisted humor only Thompson himself could truly create .
2. The Sheriff
“ [ When elected as Sheriff I plan to ] change the name Aspen , Colorado to Fat City .
This would prevent greed heads , land rapers , and other human jackals from capitalizing on the name ‘ Aspen ’ .
These swine should be f–ked , broken , and driven across the land . ”
( 1970 , while running for Sheriff of Aspen County on the Freak Power ticket )
When Hunter Thompson ran for Sheriff of Aspen , Colorado on the fabled “ Freak Power Ticket ” his aim was to secure the vote of society ’s degenerates , low - lifes , and drug users .
He hoped to instigate a brash wave of underground insurgency so large as to overthrow the conventional voting population .
Unfortunately for Aspen , his plan backfired .
The traditional community was enraged by the Freak Power Ticket , and a wave of angry conservative and liberal citizens united to quell the potential candidate ’s rush for office .
1. A World of Thieves
“ In a closed society where everybody ’s guilty , the only crime is getting caught .
In a world of thieves , the only final sin is stupidity . ”
( 1971 , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , in Rolling Stone / published as a book in 1972 )

We have now reached the truly dangerous point where we cannot even be warned about the lethal , fanatical , and suicidal hatred of our Islamic extremist enemies in our midst , because to do so here would be politically incorrect - and in some European countries , would be a violation of laws against inciting hostility to groups .
Operators of tours to the Holy Land are defending their services , yet proceeding with caution , in response to reports that one of the holiest sites in Christendom may pose serious health concerns .
Israeli officials are reassuring Christian pilgrims that the Jordan River , where many Christians go to be baptized , poses no health risk , despite reports from environmentalists that the waters are dangerously polluted .
The environmentalist group Friends of the Earth contends that high levels of coliform bacteria from sewage in the river have made it unsafe for bathing .
But water tests released this week prove otherwise , Eli Dror of Israel 's Nature and Parks Authority told Reuters .
" There 's absolutely no problem with the quality of the water .
People can come and baptize here as much as they want , I guarantee it , " Dror said .
Israeli officials strongly denied any problem and pointed out that they had received no health complaints .
Tour operators , meanwhile , said they were not alarmed by the report .
" This destination has increased in popularity in the last few years , and [ the baptisms ] are such a small component of our tour that people focus on a lot of other things , " Lael Kassis of Go Ahead Tours said .
" Israel has a religious history dating back thousands of years , so people will go for the incredible history and culture .
And parts of the river are cleaner than others , so I do n't hear any comments . "
The Lower Jordan is a murky stream cut off from its source in the Sea of Galilee by the needs of towns and agribusiness and topped with waste water and runoff .
But Israeli officials and tour providers say they work hard to provide a safe experience for people coming to be baptized in the river , and they say Friends of the Earth 's claims should not scare visitors away .
" This site is one of the most important , most holy sites of the Christian people and they come from all over the world , so we 're investing a lot of money to prepare it , " Raphael Ben-Hur , an official with the Senior Ministry of Tourism , told Reuters .
" It would be crazy to allow pilgrims to immerse themselves in pollution . "
Jocelyn Pimm , managing director of Worldwide Christian Travel , agrees .
" People go just to be baptized in the River Jordan so the site is well - managed , specially designated for baptism with proper facilities , and I 've never had complaints about pollution , " Pimm said .
" We have more people traveling to Israel now than we have ever had . "
She said people will continue to go to the river regardless of the pollution reports , because there are so many historical and religious aspects to the pilgrimage .
" People will go just go to see the site without being baptized , " Pimm said .
" One person in about every 10 groups asks to be baptized .
It 's a very small number . "
But Friends of the Earth insists the Jordan River is no place for a baptism .
" We 've known for a long time that these waters are not healthy , " Friends of the Earth 's Gidon Bromberg told Reuters .
" For most of the year they are four times more polluted than Israeli standards would permit .
" People who baptize in these waters presently , if they have a cut in their skin , could quickly develop a rash .
If they swallow any of the water they could develop a stomach upset and start vomiting , " he said .
Friends of the Earth alleged that competition for tourism may have persuaded Israeli authorities to bend health norms in the interest of keeping the industry booming there .
But Dror said the group 's health risk allegation was a scare campaign designed to promote its wider agenda -- to get Israel and Jordan to restore a third of the river 's inflow from Galilee and return the river to better health .
" Of course it could be much better , " Dror told Reuters .
" But we need the water .
We do n't have any other choice . "
Dror , referring to water quality assessment statistics , explained that the Lower Jordan contains large quantities of saline water from the upper Galilee , farm runoff , water from fish farms and partially treated sewage from a buried pipe -- but not " raw sewage " as charged by environmentalists .
Manatee
Manatees ( family Trichechidae , genus Trichechus ) are large , fully - aquatic marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows .
The name comes from the Spanish manatí , which itself comes from a Carib word meaning " breast . "
They comprise three of the four living species in the order Sirenia , the other being the dugong .
The Sirenia are thought to have evolved from four legged land mammals over 60 million years ago , with the closest living relatives being the Proboscidea ( elephants ) and Hyracoidea ( hyraxes ) .

Katie Piper :
After my horrific acid attack , I 'm giving other burns victims a chance to face the world again
Strolling into a glittering party at Sony 's offices in London accompanied by music mogul Simon Cowell , former model Katie Piper looked happy and confident rubbing shoulders with the celebrity guests .
In her designer dress , 5 in heels and perfect make - up , Katie drew gasps of admiration as she stepped on to the podium to launch her charity to improve rehabilitation facilities for burns survivors in the UK through the Katie Piper Foundation .
Moments later the shocked silence of everyone in the room was palpable as a video revealed the horrific injuries Katie suffered on March 31 , 2008 , after her face was destroyed following an acid attack instigated by her former boyfriend , Daniel Lynch , now 33 .
Brave : Katie Piper is setting herself the task of helping others who have been victims of severe burns
He had already raped Katie two days before and held her captive in a London hotel for eight hours , but his revenge for being rejected seemingly knew no bounds and under his direction , accomplice Stefan Sylvestre , now 22 , threw a cup of industrial - strength sulphuric acid in her face .
In May 2009 , Lynch and Sylvestre were told by the judge that they were ' the face of pure evil ' .
Both were jailed for life and Lynch will serve a minimum of 16 years .
Katie 's surgeon , Mr Mohammad Ali Jawad , now candidly admits : ' I took one look at Katie 's face and said to myself , " How do I deal with this ? "
I was a respected plastic surgeon with 16 years ' experience but I knew that I was in trouble .
I 'd never dealt with anything like this .'
Rushed to the burns unit of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital , Katie was showered with tap water for ten hours as medics fought to neutralise the effect of the acid on her skin and prevent further damage .
Eye drops were also administered every few minutes to try to wash the acid away .
Model ambition : Katie before the acid attack
But her injuries were unimaginable .
The left side of Katie 's face was burned away to the fat layer - the only thing beyond it was muscle and bone .
She lost the sight in her left eye and acid also dripped down her neck , ears and hands as well as slipping into her nose and throat , with further terrible consequences .
For more than a year she had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and now , every few weeks , has surgery to dilate her oesophagus - which narrows to just one centimetre - as scar tissue at three separate sites reforms , restricting her ability to eat or drink .
Largely because of the oesophagus problems , Katie , now 27 , has had more than 40 operations since the attack .
General anaesthetics are now very safe , but Mr Jawad admits that the long - term effects on her liver are unknown .
While the first days remain hazy in Katie 's memory , not least because she was given strong painkillers , for her mother Diane , 51 , they will be forever etched in her brain .
When she saw her daughter , Diane secretly believed Katie would be better off dead .
' I could n't see a way back for her , or imagine what sort of future she 'd have , ' says Diane .
' Everything she 'd hoped for and dreamed of , being a model and TV presenter , depended on her face and it was gone . '
Mr Jawad began the first of Katie 's facial surgeries the day after she was admitted , in a process called debridement - removing the damaged or dead tissue and preserving what was healthy .
Further debridement followed two days later and , a week after she was admitted , the process of rebuilding Katie 's face began .
' Because the burn was so deep , we had to rebuild layer by layer .
Initially we used cadaver skin which was stapled to her face .
To preserve the healthy tissue , cadaver skin is removed from donors after their deaths and preserved in deep freeze at - 70C and is stored at the Liverpool Skin Bank .
The skin can then be used on any patient without being matched to suitable recipients .
Katie Piper and patron Simon Cowell share a moment at the launch of The Katie Piper Foundation at Sony
' We used it to preserve what we could of Katie 's face until we were able to use grafts of her own skin .
But the damage was so great that to replace all the layers of facial skin from her own donor site , her lower back , would have meant severe further scarring , ' says Mr Jawad .
After discussions with colleagues here and in America and Germany , the surgeon embarked on the first operation of its kind using a synthetic skin substitute called Matriderm , made of collagen and elastin , and in one procedure layered it on to Katie 's face to slowly rebuild its foundations and give it shape .
Mr Jawad admits :
' We pretty much took her face off and then recreated what was missing , layer by layer , in a single operation which had never been done before . '
It was crucial that the results of the six - hour surgery , once dressed , were allowed to settle , so Katie was put into an induced coma for 12 days .
There were three further dressing changes while Katie was asleep to stop movement and infection and to ensure she did not suffer pain .
' By using the combination of Matriderm and Katie 's own grafts , the quality of the skin was immediately obvious to me , ' says Mr Jawad .
' It was more pliable and not irregular as many burns scars are . '
Katie was woken from her coma and began six weeks of intensive scar - management , which involved daily massage of the injured areas , use of silicon gel ( Kelo- cote ) on healed areas , along with constant applications of moisturising creams .
Massage and physiotherapy helped strengthen her limbs , which had become weakened by more than a month and a half in a hospital bed .
Daily sessions with a psychologist helped Katie cope with her ordeal , but when she saw her face for the first time , seven weeks after being attacked , she was left reeling .
' When I held up the mirror I thought someone had given me a broken one or put a silly face on it as a joke , ' she says .
' I knew that they 'd taken my face away and that it was put somewhere in a bin , but in my head I assumed I 'd look like the old Katie , just with a few red blotches .
' I was so embarrassed that people had seen me like this .
I wanted to tear the whole thing off and make it go away .
There was nothing about me that I recognised .
My identity as I knew it had gone . '
After being discharged from hospital in May 2008 , Katie returned to her parents ' home in Hampshire and relied on the support of mum Diane , dad David , 60 , a businessman , and sister Suzy , 23 , a student .
To try to even out the scar tissue , Katie had to wear pressure garments 24 hours a day to cover her burns , including a balaclava - style mask .
" If a drop of cream fell on to my skin unexpectedly , I would scream as it reminded me of the acid dripping down me "
After a year she began wearing a clear plastic mask during the day .
' They were uncomfortable and I did n't want to wear them , but there is a two - year window of opportunity to work on scar - management after a burn and I knew that I had to do whatever I could to help myself .
' It was difficult , not just for me but for my family .
They would take it in turns to moisturise my skin and massage me four times a day to try to flatten the skin .
If a drop of cream fell on to my skin unexpectedly , I would scream as it reminded me of the acid dripping down me .
We 'd all try to pretend that everything was OK when all the time we were treading on eggshells - them so that they did n't hurt or upset me , and me because it is all too easy to lash out at those you are closest to , ' says Katie .
In August 2008 , Mr Jawad told Katie about a special burns rehabilitation unit , Centre Ster in France .
Because there is no facility like it in the UK and due to the extent of her injuries , she was given funding for five three - week therapy sessions .
Endermologie machines , usually used to get rid of cellulite , have rollers that provide deep - tissue massage .
They were used around Katie 's eyes and nose as well as on her neck and hands to help align scar formation and soften the scar .
She also had hydrotherapy , using a high - pressure jet of water on her scars to reduce the vivid red scarring that is common to all burns victims .
Gym sessions , stretches and facial exercises also helped bring back elasticity to her damaged skin .
' It was a nine - to - five regime and it not only gave me a new lease of life , I firmly believe that it , combined with Mr Jawad 's pioneering surgery , gave me my smile back and facial expressions , ' she says .
' The results were amazing .
My skin looked paler and smoother and more like normal skin .
' Psychologically it gave me my confidence back , too .
I never thought I 'd wear a bikini again , but I was with other people like me who were disfigured and I did n't feel out of place .
I felt normal .
For the first time in months I did n't feel embarrassed .
' I was incredibly lucky to get the help and funding that I did but I know better than anyone that it is n't enough just to have brilliant surgeons for burns victims .
Therapy is also vital and can change people 's lives .
They may never be as perfect as they once were but they can be the best they can possibly be .'
Katie Piper , with surgeon Mohammad Jawad who treated her following the acid attack
With the help of Simon Cowell , who has become patron , The Katie Piper Foundation aims to raise £ 1.5 million to start a clinic , similar to Centre Ster , in Britain .
For Katie , the operations to her oesophagus continue but now every eight weeks instead of every two .
' I want to eat but it is like having reflux .
The scar tissue wo n't allow even little bits of food to go down so I have to rely on protein shakes for nourishment when it 's really bad . '
For her scars , she uses a shop bought massager and moisturises her skin with an aqueous cream twice daily to help keep it pliable .
In January last year , Mr Jawad and colleague Professor Erol injected microfat graft cells from Katie 's inner thighs into her face around the cheeks , eyes and lips to make the face appear fuller and smoother .
The effect is permanent .
She says : ' What happened to me made me a different but a better person and I have a role to play in helping others .
If I can do that , the suffering my family and I have been through wo n't have been in vain . '

— Raleigh police temporarily closed part of Hillsborough Street near North Carolina State University and evacuated several buildings in the area following a natural gas leak on Thursday morning .
Angie Townsend , a spokeswoman for PSNC Energy , said a contractor working in the 2500 block , near Pogue Street , hit a three - quarter - inch service line .
The leak has since been capped , and repairs were under way , she said .
Police closed part of the road for a little more than an hour and detoured traffic until repairs were complete .
Several businesses and buildings , including some on the N.C. State campus , were evacuated as a precaution .
At least 10 restaurant owners said they were preparing for the lunch rush when they had to leave .
" Police immediately showed up , very responsive , and had us evacuate until at least noon , " business owner Alan Lovette said .
Police allowed employees back inside but businesses did not reopen immediately , until air levels could be checked .
Thursday 's leak comes just a week after an underground gas leak in downtown Raleigh forced more than 160 people from nearby buildings for several hours .
In that case , a contractor drilling a cable line ruptured a 4 - inch gas line beneath Wilmington Street .
We ’ve just been informed that Justin Beiber might not be heading to North Korea after all .

An estimated five percent of the one million women incarcerated each year are pregnant when they enter jail .
Cases of fatal medical neglect of incarcerated pregnant women highlight the need for protecting their health , rights , and lives .
The month of May brought two disturbing news stories that illustrate the needless and sometimes tragic suffering inflicted on pregnant women in jail .
By suffering , I do not mean the deprivation of comfort and companionship that women might experience if they were at home instead of in jail .
I mean the deprivation of basic constitutional and human rights , including the right to be treated as a human being .
Without a baseline of respect for human dignity , being taken into custody puts people ’s lives and rights in danger .
The first story makes this painfully clear in its recounting of the death of a young woman in jail .
What makes this news all the more upsetting is that her death was preventable .
The second story recounts an all too familiar struggle between a woman seeking to exercise her reproductive rights and a sheriff standing in her way .
Together , both stories remind us of what is at stake when people are imprisoned , even for brief periods of time .
Pregnant Woman Dies of Medical Neglect
Whatever Chuniece Patterson and her family thought when she was arrested , they probably did n’t think that two days in the inaptly named “ Justice Center ” would result in her death .
But that is just what happened to this 21 year - old African - American woman when she was arrested and jailed in Syracuse , New York .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

According to the news report Patterson found out that she was pregnant at the jail .
This means that the staff knew she was pregnant , too .
But they essentially ignored her symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and weakness .
Although nurses made three visits to her cell , and various deputies made rounds , no one provided meaningful medical assistance .
A nurse who visited Patterson in her cell did not examine her abdomen or bring her to the medical unit for a pelvic exam .
It does not even appear that she took her temperature or her blood pressure , which might have suggested signs of fever or internal bleeding ( it “ does not appear ” because the nurse wrote her “ observations ” after the fact , after Patterson had already died ) .
A woman in a nearby cell said that she could hear Patterson moan and see her writhe in agony throughout the night .
The jail deputy who surveilled Patterson ’s cell on morning rounds ordered her to get up off the floor , but did not investigate why she was on the floor , even though she had been told that Patterson was having difficulties when she began her shift .
In a report of her 7:30 a.m. stop at the cell , the deputy wrote : “ I looked down at inmate Patterson , again told inmate to get off the floor .
It looked as if the inmate looked at me .
I continued with my tour . ”
One hour later , Patterson was pronounced dead at an outside hospital .
What is the standard of care in a situation like Patterson ’s ?
Obstetrician Gerson
Weiss describes it this way : Examine the woman ’s abdomen and conduct a pelvic exam .
These exams may result in pain , an indication to perform an ultrasound to determine whether the pregnancy is indeed outside the uterus .
If this is confirmed , proceed to emergency surgery .
The entire examination and diagnosis should take 5 - 10 minutes .
People who work in jails that hold women should be knowledgeable about pregnancy - related emergencies , including the signs of ectopic pregnancy , miscarriage , and premature labor .
Even if no one knew anything about ectopic pregnancy , they might have wondered if Patterson had appendicitis or some other condition requiring immediate medical attention .
Patterson died in November 2009 .
The story is in the news now because her mother is planning to sue the county and a state commission is finalizing an investigation into the circumstances of her death .
A previous investigation found fault with the same jail in 1996 , when a 36 year - old woman named Lucinda Batts died from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy .
In that case , Batts bled to death over several days .
None of the medical staff who visited her cell went the next step to get her proper medical attention .
After Batts died , the county health commissioner promised to issue new standards to prevent such tragedies , including pregnancy testing – which the jail seems to be doing – and thorough examination and monitoring of pregnant women experiencing problems , better training of staff , and improved communication between jail nurses and on - call physicians .
The editorial board of the Syracuse Post - Standard takes the jail to task for its failures : “ If the 1996 guidelines were implemented , why was n’t Patterson ’s health emergency caught in time ?
A second fatality due to an ectopic pregnancy after 14 years is not an epidemic .
But it raises questions :
Are the guidelines adequate ?
Have they lapsed ?
Or is another element still missing here — a lack of sensitivity to inmates ’ distress , an attitude of skepticism or indifference among those responsible for their welfare ? ”
The editorial board ’s perspective differs sharply from the perspective of some of its readers , judging from the comments people posted to the story .
More than one blames Patterson – if she had n’t gotten into trouble , then she would n’t have died in jail .
One writer with eugenic and divine interventionist leanings wrote : “ In and out of jail ?
What kind of mother is that ?
Maybe this was gods way of saying it was n’t meant to be . ”
Several readers also commented that the jail staff may not have been able to tell the difference between someone who was suffering from internal bleeding and someone who was suffering from drug withdrawal .
Rather than absolve anyone , these comments simply reinforce the need for proper medical evaluation .
Abrupt withdrawal from heroin , for example , can be physically brutal and can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth if a woman is pregnant .
No one who thinks a pregnant woman is withdrawing from drugs should leave her curled up in agony on the floor .
Sheriff Denies Access to Abortion Care
Across the country , a woman was trying to obtain abortion care from within the confines of the Parker County jail in Weatherford , Texas , about 30 miles west of Forth Worth .
The outlines of the story are familiar : A woman asks for an abortion , or asks to be taken to an appointment she has already made for an abortion .
Jail personnel say no .
Then as also often happens , the woman or someone she knows contacts the ACLU , whose staff inform jail officials that 1 ) they are violating the woman ’s rights and must transport her to a medical facility where she can exercise her constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy , and 2 ) they should implement a policy to deal with abortion requests in the future .
The sheriff in this incident said he was “ a little bit flabbergasted ” by the ACLU ’s position : “ My personal feeling is I do n’t feel like the taxpayers of Parker County would think much of their sheriff spending taxpayer money to take people to abortion clinics .
I do n’t think they would want me to even entertain that notion . ”
The sheriff ’s personal feelings and his ability to gauge the sentiments of other Parker County residents , however , are simply not relevant .
The courts have consistently held that women retain the right to have an abortion when they are incarcerated .
No court has ever ruled that jails can simply ignore women ’s requests for abortion care .
This means that jails must take women to an appropriate medical facility , because they are not free to take themselves .
As a judge explained in a similar case in Ohio , “ The federal judiciary has detailed a woman ’s constitutional right to an abortion .
The Sheriff might find such a right morally repugnant .
Or he might find ignoring its existence politically expedient .
Nevertheless , [ the Sheriff has taken … ] a solemn oath to support the Constitution , ” and that includes accommodating the reproductive rights of women in his custody [ see Roe v. Leis , No. C-1-00-651 , 2001 WL 1842459 ( S.D. Ohio Jan. 10 , 2001 ) ] .
The executive director of the Texas Commission on Jail Standards , as well as the sheriff and a spokesperson for nearby Tarrant County , said they could not recall the issue of abortion coming up before in the Texas jails .
But the issue has come up a number of times , including at least twice in Tarrant County .
Women have gone to court to fight for their rights and the Texas press has covered their stories .
The Jails Commission has had ample time to develop a standard on abortion access that would provide guidance to the many jail administrators throughout the state .
Ultimately , this conflict ended when the jail released the woman after a court dealt with the charges against her .
This leaves her free to make and carry out her own decision .
It leaves other women in the position of having to go through the exact same process of finding outside help , unless the sheriff adopts a policy that upholds their rights .
Many Women at Risk
More than a million women spend time in jail each year .
An estimated five percent of them are pregnant when they enter jail .
These two incidents of fatal medical neglect and interference with reproductive decisions crystallize how vulnerable women are to the institutional shortcomings in the nation ’s vast jail system , and highlight the need for far greater oversight to protect women ’s health , rights , futures , and very lives .
The good news , for drug fiends , is that Afghanistan has just harvested its biggest opium crop ever , up a whopping 59 % from last year and big enough to cover 130 % of the entire world market .
The street price for illegal heroin , 92 % of which now comes from Afghanistan , should be way down from Bangkok to London , and for those shooting up in the back alleys of Chicago .
The bad news , for the rest of us , is that in Bush - liberated Afghanistan , billions in drug profits are financing the Taliban .
Remember them , the guys who harbored the Al Qaeda terrorists , who gifted us with the 9/11 attacks five years ago , that President Bush promised to eliminate ?
Well , it turns out that while he was distracted with Iraq , the patrons of terrorism were very much in business back where the 9/11 attack was hatched , turning Afghanistan into a narco - state that provides a lucrative source of cash for the “ evildoers ” Bush forgot about .
The Bush administration has , for half a decade , celebrated its overthrow of the Taliban and subsequent national elections in Afghanistan , but if this is democratic nation - building then the model must be Colombia , the narco - state where the political process masks the real power held by drug lords and radical insurgents .
Afghanistan is dominated not by the government in Kabul but by a patchwork of warlords , terrorist groups and drug traffickers completely addicted to the annual poppy harvest ’s profits .
Or perhaps the model is post- invasion Iraq , because Afghanistan is now statistically as deadly for American soldiers , according to The New York Times , while in both countries suicide bombings and roadside bombings are on the rise and women are retreating to the burka to avoid persecution by armed zealots .
In any case , reported the United Nations this week , “ opium cultivation in Afghanistan is out of control ” despite the expenditure of billions by the West to fight it .
Intelligence estimates of the Taliban ’s cut of this lucrative trade , which represents over a third of the entire Afghan economy , range up to 70 % , according to ABC News .
“ The political , military and economic investments by coalition countries are not having much visible impact on drug cultivation , ” reported the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in its authoritative annual survey .
“ As a result , Afghan opium is fueling insurgency in Western Asia , feeding international mafias and causing 100,000 deaths from overdoses every year . ”
“ The southern part of Afghanistan [ is ] displaying the ominous hallmarks of incipient collapse , with large - scale drug cultivation and trafficking , insurgency and terrorism , crime and corruption , ” added Antonio Maria Costa , the agency ’s director .
Yet on Tuesday , the White House was once again trumpeting that “ we have deprived Al Qaeda of safe haven in Afghanistan and helped a democratic government rise in its place . ”
Considering that Osama bin Laden himself is still reputed to be hiding somewhere along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border and Afghan President Hamid Karzai is desperately dependent on the support of drug lords and warlords to prevent renewed civil war , such claims are a blatant fraud .
The senior British military commander in Afghanistan recently described the situation in the country as “ close to anarchy ” and said NATO forces were “ running out of time ” to salvage the situation .
“ The narcotics industry accounts for over one - third of Afghanistan ’s gross domestic product and poses a threat to that country ’s stability and emerging democracy , ” carefully admits a recent U.S. State Department fact sheet .
What the Bush administration will not confront in Afghanistan , or in Iraq , is that its ill - conceived and disastrously executed nation - building schemes are sinking into the swamp of local and historical realities .
Enamored of American military might but having little understanding of the world beyond , Bush and his team have ignored Gen.
Colin Powell ’s reported “ you break it , you own it ” warnings , floundering after initial military victories and ultimately strengthening the hand of local and international terrorists .
Rather than take care of business in Afghanistan after 9/11 , Bush and clueless U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld allowed bin Laden to slip out of the Tora Bora caves to plan more attacks and the Taliban to regroup .
Instead , Bush and Co. threw the bulk of our military and aid resources into a disastrous attempt to remake oil - rich Iraq , which had nothing to do with 9/11 , into an American puppet state .
With U.S. midterm elections around the corner , embattled Republicans are now desperately claiming to be the only thing standing between us and a bogeyman they are calling “ Islamo - fascism , ” and ridiculously comparing the “ war on terror ” to the fight against the Nazis .
Fortunately , if belatedly , two - thirds of the American electorate now recognize that our president is all hat and no cattle , as they say in Texas , a leader much better at starting wars than winning them .
