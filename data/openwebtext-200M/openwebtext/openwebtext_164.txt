Cannabinoids provide relief for a mouse 's itchy skin .
Ouch : the itch from poison ivy can be soothed by skin creams — maybe ones made from cannabis .

The chemicals that give marijuana its mood - altering kick might also be an option for treating skin allergies , according to a study done in mice .
The compounds , called cannabinoids , have been credited with everything from stimulating the growth of new neurons to easing the symptoms of multiple sclerosis .
Although they are best known for spicing up marijuana , the body also produces cannabinoids , which are thought to play a part in learning and in communications between the immune system and the nervous system .
Now , researchers have shown that cannabinoids can relieve some of the swollen , itchy agony of allergic skin reactions in mice .
The team first noticed the effect when they created mice that lacked two proteins that usually recognize cannabinoids produced by the body .
Some of the mutant mice scratched at the metal identification tags in their ears until the area around the tags became raw and covered with sores .
" We thought at first it was just an itching phenotype , " says Andreas Zimmer , a neurobiologist at the University of Bonn .
" But then we switched to another brand of ear tags and all of a sudden the problem completely disappeared . "
The first set of tags , it turned out , contained nickel , whereas the second set was made from non-allergenic brass .
Zimmer and his colleagues realized that the mutant mice were allergic to the nickel .
Mice that still had their cannabinoid receptors did not react in this way .
The results suggested that cannabinoids produced by the body might help protect the animals against skin allergies .
To find out whether the compounds could produce the same effect when applied externally , Zimmer 's research team applied a cannabinoid to the skin of mice before and after they were exposed to a chemical ( called 2,4 - dinitrofluorobenzene ) , which is known to produce an allergic response .
Mice that had received the cannabinoid had a diminished allergic response , with about 50 % less swelling , than did those that had not received the compound .
The results are published this week in Science .

Swell treatment
No one knows precisely how cannabinoids diminish allergic reactions , but Zimmer and his colleagues did find that the compounds alter the expression of genes that encode small proteins called chemokines .
And some chemokines are known to promote inflammation .
Zimmer 's mice received their cannabinoid treatment both before and after their encounter with the allergen , so it would n't necessarily work after a chance encounter with , for example , poison ivy .
The best defence against most contact allergies is simply to avoid contact with the allergens , says Thomas Tüting , a dermatologist at the University of Bonn and a co-author of the study .

But the treatment could be useful for treating patients with chronic dermatitis , says Thomas Klein , an immunologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa .
People with this condition have recurrent patches of swollen , itchy , cracked skin , and they do n't always know the cause .
" It 's very uncomfortable and the wounds carry the risk of secondary infections , " says Klein .
The usual treatment is steroids and immunosuppressants .
But long - term use of steroids can cause the skin to thin and patients often become tolerant of the drugs , rendering the medication less effective .
An alternative treatment would be a welcome addition , says Klein .
But no therapeutic application is certain until the experiments have been repeated in humans , cautions Roman Rukwied , who studies pain and inflammation at the University of Heidelberg in Germany .
" We are far before the day when we could say 'oh , I have a nickel allergy .
I will smoke marijuana and I wo n't have it anymore ' , " he says .
" That is definitely not the case . "

Via Eugene Volokh , comes news of a decision from the Utah Supreme Court regarding the state ’s attempted prosecuted of a 12 year old boy and thirteen year old girl for committing sexual abuse on a child , with each other :
When she was thirteen years old , Z.C. engaged in consensual sex with a twelve - year - old boy and became pregnant .
The state prosecutor chose to file delinquency petitions against both Z.C. and the boy for sexual abuse of a child under [ State ] Code section 76-5- 404.1 [ basically , in this context , any sexual touching of someone under 14 - EV ] , a crime that would constitute a second degree felony if committed by an adult … .
Because we conclude that the legislature could not possibly have intended to punish both children under the child sex abuse statute for the same act of consensual heavy petting , we hold that applying the plain language of the statute in this case produces an absurd result .
[ Footnote , slightly moved :
It is undisputed that Z.C. and the boy engaged in more than just sexual touching , but we must analyze the absurd result question in the context of the law actually applied and the act with which the State chose to charge Z.C. , not the law that might have been applied or the act with which the State could have charged Z.C. ]
Sexual abuse of a child is one of the most heinous crimes recognized by our penal code .
The gravity of this crime is reflected by the fact that it is punished as a second degree felony if committed by an adult .
Child sex abuse merits serious penalties because of the extreme psychological harm that the perpetrator causes the victim .
Therefore , like all forms of sexual assault , child sex abuse presupposes that a single act of abuse involves a victim , whom the statute endeavors to protect , and a perpetrator , whom the statute punishes for harming the victim .
The State , however , applies [ State ] Code section 76 - 5- 404.1 in an unprecedented manner .
By filing delinquency petitions for child sex abuse against both participants for sexually touching one another , the State treats both children as perpetrators of the same act .
In this situation , there is no discernible victim that the law seeks to protect , only culpable participants that the State seeks to punish .
We know of no other instance in which the State has attempted to apply any sexual assault crime to produce such an effect .
[ Footnote :
The primary fail - safe against the absurd application of criminal law is the wise employment of prosecutorial discretion , a quality that is starkly absent in this case .
While the State makes no attempt to defend the prosecution ’s charging decision , it suggests that the particular offense selected by the prosecutor as the basis for the delinquency petition is not significant because a juvenile delinquency adjudication is not a criminal conviction , but merely a means to bring the juvenile within the guiding supervision of the juvenile court .
If this is truly the case , it begs the question of why the prosecutor could not have accomplished the intended result by basing the delinquency petition on a victimless offense that more accurately fits the conduct at issue . ]
We acknowledge that the legislature has demonstrated its intent to punish both participants in victimless , extramarital sexual activity under [ State ] ’s adultery and fornication statutes .
However , these statutes differ from sexual assault crimes , such as child sex abuse , in both the theory and degree of punishment .
Rather than punishing an actor who has perpetrated a crime against a victim , these laws demonstrate the legislature ’s disapproval of the acts of both participants for violating a moral standard .
Because these crimes do not involve a victim , they involve a lesser degree of punishment .
Both adultery and fornication are punishable as class B misdemeanors .
Thus , while the legislature clearly could have intended some degree of simultaneous culpability for both Z.C. and the twelve - year - old boy under the fornication statute in order to discourage their admittedly reckless and age - inappropriate behavior , it is absurd to conclude that the legislature intended to simultaneously punish both children for child sex abuse , a crime that clearly envisions a perpetrator and a victim .
A review of the floor debates regarding the 1983 enactment of the [ statute ] reveals no evidence that the legislature contemplated application of the statute to situations where the same child was both victim and perpetrator .
Although we generally do not consult legislative history where the meaning of the statute is clear , after finding that the plain meaning has been applied in an absurd manner , we seek to confirm that the absurd application was indeed unintended by the legislature … .
We conclude that the legislature could not have intended the child sex abuse statute to be applied to punish Z.C. for the conduct at issue .
And the fact that this is a juvenile court disposition , in which the judge enjoys considerable latitude in crafting punishments and assigning state services designed to help the child , does not change our conclusion .
No amount of judicial lenity to compensate for the absurd application of the law changes the fact that the application of the law was absurd to begin with .
Moreover , labeling Z.C. with the moniker of “ child abuser , ” even within the juvenile court system , can have serious consequences that were not intended by the legislature .
A delinquency adjudication for sexual abuse of a child can lead to sentencing enhancements for any offenses Z.C. might commit while she is a juvenile or even as an adult if her juvenile record is not expunged .
Such an adjudication also has the potential to affect any civil proceedings related to the custody of her child or any future attempts to seek child support from the father .
We therefore vacate Z.C. ’s adjudication .
We stress , however , that our holding is narrowly confined to the application of [ State ] Code section 76-5- 404.1 in situations where no true victim or perpetrator can be identified .
Even among children under the age of fourteen , there are unfortunately situations where an older or more physically mature child abuses a younger or smaller child .
In cases where there is an identifiable distinction between the perpetrator and the victim , it is manifestly logical to conclude that the legislature intended to include such acts within the scope of [ State ] Code section 76-5- 404.1 .
In Z.C. ’s case , however , where both children were under the age of fourteen and were of similar age , where both children met the intent requirement of the statute , and where there was no evidence of any coercion or force , we conclude that application of the child sex abuse statute produces an absurd result … .
Even though the plain language of section 76-5- 404.1 allows Z.C. to be adjudicated delinquent for sexual abuse of a child , we conclude that the filing of delinquency petitions against both participants produces an absurd result not intended by the legislature because , like all sexual assault crimes , the statute presupposes a perpetrator and a victim .
We therefore hold that the juvenile court erred in denying Z.C. ’s motion to dismiss the delinquency petition .
We remand this matter to the court of appeals with instructions to remand it to the juvenile court to vacate Z.C. ’s delinquency adjudication .
The Honest Leadership and Open Government
Act of 2007 is numbered " S. 1 " in the books -- it was the first bill introduced in the Senate under Majority Leader Reid , marking Democrats ' clear intent to clean up the Republican culture of corruption in Washington .
Yesterday , after all the hullabaloo and fooferaw , it was signed into law .
Here 's some highlights :
Senators will no longer be able to take gifts or junkets from lobbyists .
Lobbyists will be required to report their activities quarterly to the House clerk and Senate secretary .
( Now , just semi-annually . )
And these reports must be filed electronically ( including lobbying by representatives of foreign governments ) -- which make them easier for us to search and analyze .
Senate spouses will be banned from the lobbying business , unless they were lobbyists before their spouse ’s most recent election or before they married a senator .
Senators and their top aides will have to notify the Ethics Committee within three days when they begin negotiating new jobs .
The K Street Project is dead :
Whoever , being a Senator or Representative in , or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to , the Congress or an employee of either House of Congress , with the intent to influence , solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation , an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity --
( 1 ) takes or withholds , or offers or threatens to take or withhold , an official act , or
( 2 ) influences , or offers or threatens to influence , the official act of another , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than 15 years , or both , and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor , trust , or profit under the United States .
Earmark sponsors must be listed in appropriations committee reports .
And Senators will be able to attack earmarks on the floor with a point of order triggering an hour of debate , and it will take a three - fifths majority vote to retain the provision .
" Dead of night " provisions can also be challenged with a point of order , and unless a three - fifths majority wants to keep such a provision , the offending language will be removed .
New restrictions on free travel would ban many trips but allow senators to enjoy one - day journeys at others ’ expense .
( Also still legal : trips financed by nonprofits and universities . )
Say goodbye to infinite , anonymous holds .
Senators will still be able to anonymously block a request for unanimous consent , but only for six days .
After that , the senator ’s name would be disclosed unless the objection was withdrawn .
Slow down the revolving door -- after Dec. 31 , senators , top aides and top administration officials would have to wait two years after leaving office before lobbying Congress .
When former members of the House or Senate begin to lobby , they will lose their access to their former chamber ’s floor and gym .
The FEC will be drafting new regulations requiring campaign committees to report bundled contributions from lobbyists and their political committees that total at least $ 15,000 during any six - month period .
( The next step : disclosure by all bundlers . )
If a lobbyist ( or a lobbyist 's client ) is throwing a big soirée at your party 's convention ... you can't go , unless you 're the nominee .

StopBlock
So , the debate has raged on whether Ad- Block is ethical or moral or whatever word you would like to use to describe it .
Regardless of your personal opinion , it has given some publishers so much angst that they have chosen to block all Firefox users ( Why Firefox is Blocked ) because of an inability to exclude visitors using the Ad-Block extension for Firefox .
Well , suffice to say , there is a fairly simple bit of code that can be used to determine if a person is blocking advertisements on your site .
The Ad- Block extension not only blocks ads , it hides them .
This means that the space previously consumed by an advertisement will disappear .
So , the simple solution is two put two elements , in my case 1 px by 1px images , above and below the advertisement .
I then use javascript to determine their Top Offset ( the distance between the element and the top of the page ) .
If that distance is less than the height of my advertisement , I know that the user is blocking ads .
The best part about this filter is that it would work for future technologies as well – unless of course they block javascript on your page altogether .
(1) First , copy and paste this into the header of your page :
< script > function stopBlock ( topObjId , bottomObjId, estHeight ) { var topObj = document.getElementById(topObjId ) ; var bottom Obj = document.getElementById( bottomObj ) ; var toptop = 0 ; if ( topObj.offsetParent ) { toptop = topObj.offsetTop while ( topObj = topObj.offsetParent ) { toptop += topObj.offsetTop } } if ( bottomObj.offsetParent ) { bottomtop = bottomObj.offsetTop while ( bottomObj = bottomObj.offsetParent ) { bottomtop += bottomObj.offsetTop } } var buffer = 15 ; var loc = ' http://google.com/search?q=ad+blocking+immoral'; var distance = toptop - bottomtop ; distance += buffer ; if ( distance > estHeight ) { alert ( ' This Site Does Not Allow Ad- Blocking . ' ) ; location.href=loc ; } } </script >
(2) Second , assuming your advertisement is 500 pixels tall , copy and paste this into the bottom of your page :
< script>stopBlock('startAd ' , 'endAd',500 ) ;</ script >
(3) Third , paste this code directly above your advertisement
<img src= 'http://thegooglecache.com/t.gif' height = ' 1 ' width= ' 1 ' id='startAd ' /> < br style=' line - height:1px;clear:both ;' />
(4) Fourth , paste this code directly below your advertisement
<img src= 'http://thegooglecache.com/t.gif' height = ' 1 ' width= ' 1 ' id='endAd ' />
(5) Fifth , if your nice , paste this code somewhere

MIT professor Edward Adelson uses remarkable visual illusions to help explain the workings of the human visual system .
One such illusion is shown above .
Believe it or not , the square marked A is the same shade of gray on your computer screen as the square marked B .
Here ’s a “ proof , ” provided by Adelson .
Two strips of constant grayness are aligned on top of the picture .
You can see that the A square is the same shade as the strips near it and the B square is the same shade as the strips near it .
Perhaps you still do n’t believe that the strips are of constant grayness .
In that case , put some paper up next to your computer screen to block off everything except for the strips ; you ’ll see it ’s true .
Adelson explains the illusion here .
The point is that our visual system is not meant to be used as a light meter ; instead it is trying to solve the much more important problem ( for our survival ) of determining the true shade ( that is , the color of the attached “ paint ” ) of the objects it is looking at .
You can find more interesting illusions and demos from Adelson and other members of the perceptual science group at MIT , but do n’t fail to also take a look at the illusions collected by the lab of Dale Purves at Duke .
I particularly recommend the cube color contrast demo , where you can see that gray can be made to look yellow or blue .
Purves , together with R. Beau Lotto , wrote the book “ Why We See What We Do : An Empirical Theory of Vision , ” which collects these remarkable illusions and also expounds on a theory explaining them .
The theory , to summarize it very briefly , says that what humans actually see is a “ reflexive manifestation of the past rather than a logical analysis of the present . ”
I found myself quite uncomfortable with the theory for much the same reasons as given in Alan Gilchrist ‘s review .
I also would prefer a more mathematical theory than Purves and Lotto give .
It seems to me that we should in general try to explain illusions in terms of a Bayesian analysis of the most probable scene given the evidence provided by the light .
My collaborators Bill Freeman and Yair Weiss ( both former students of Adelson ’s ) have long worked along these lines ; see for example Yair ’s excellent Ph.D. thesis from 1998 , explaining motion illusions .
In fact , I would like to go beyond a mathematical explanation of illusions to an algorithmic one .
I would argue that a good computer vision system should “ suffer ” from the same illusions as a human , even though it has neither the same evolutionary history nor the same life history .
To take an example of what I have in mind , the famous Necker cube illusion presumably arises naturally from the fact that the two interpretations are both local optima , with respect to probability , so a good artificial system should use an algorithm that settles into one interpretation , but then still be able to spontaneously switch to the other .

Where Am I ?
Where Am I ? by DANIEL C. DENNETT
Now that I 've won my suit under the Freedom of Information Act , I am at liberty to reveal for the first time a curious episode in my life that may be of interest not only to those engaged in research in the philosophy of mind , artificial intelligence , and neuroscience but also to the general public .
Several years ago I was approached by Pentagon officials who asked me to volunteer for a highly dangerous and secret mission .
In collaboration with NASA and Howard Hughes , the Department of Defense was spending billions to develop a Supersonic Tunneling Underground Device , or STUD .
It was supposed to tunnel through the earth 's core at great speed and deliver a specially designed atomic warhead “ right up the Red 's missile silos , ” as one of the Pentagon brass put it .
The problem was that in an early test they had succeeded in lodging a warhead about a mile deep under Tulsa , Oklahoma , and they wanted me to retrieve it for them .
“ Why me ? ” I asked .
Well , the mission involved some pioneering applications of current brain research , and they had heard of my interest in brains and of course my Faustian curiosity and great courage and so forth . . . .
Well , how could I refuse ?
The difficulty that brought the Pentagon to my door was that the device I 'd been asked to recover was fiercely radioactive , in a new way .
According to monitoring instruments , something about the nature of the device and its complex interactions with pockets of material deep in the earth had produced radiation that could cause severe abnormalities in certain tissues of the brain .
No way had been found to shield the brain from these deadly rays , which were apparently harmless to other tissues and organs of the body .
So it had been decided that the person sent to recover the device should leave his brain behind .
It would be kept in a safe place as there it could execute its normal control functions by elaborate radio links .
Would I submit to a surgical procedure that would completely remove my brain , which would then be placed in a life - support system at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston ?
Each input and output pathway , as it was severed , would be restored by a pair of microminiaturized radio transceivers , one attached precisely to the brain , the other to the nerve stumps in the empty cranium .
No information would be lost , all the connectivity would be preserved .
At first I was a bit reluctant .
Would it really work ?
The Houston brain surgeons encouraged me .
“ Think of it , ” they said , “ as a mere stretching of the nerves .
If your brain were just moved over an inch in your skull , that would not alter or impair your mind .
We 're simply going to make the nerves indefinitely elastic by splicing radio links into them . ”
I was shown around the life - support lab in Houston and saw the sparkling new vat in which my brain would be placed , were I to agree .
I met the large and brilliant support team of neurologists , hematologists , biophysicists , and electrical engineers , and after several days of discussions and demonstrations I agreed to give it a try .
I was subjected to an enormous array of blood tests , brain scans , experiments , interviews , and the like .
They took down my autobiography at great length , recorded tedious lists of my beliefs , hopes , fears , and tastes .
They even listed my favorite stereo recordings and gave me a crash session of psychoanalysis .
The day for surgery arrived at last and of course I was anesthetized and remember nothing of the operation itself .
When I came out of anesthesia , I opened my eyes , looked around , and asked the inevitable , the traditional , the lamentably hackneyed postoperative question : “ Where am l ? ” The nurse smiled down at me .
“ You 're in Houston , ” she said , and I reflected that this still had a good chance of being the truth one way or another .
She handed me a mirror .
Sure enough , there were the tiny antennae poling up through their titanium ports cemented into my skull .
“ I gather the operation was a success , ” I said .
“ I want to go see my brain . ”
They led me ( I was a bit dizzy and unsteady ) down a long corridor and into the life - support lab .
A cheer went up from the assembled support team , and I responded with what I hoped was a jaunty salute .
Still feeling lightheaded , I was helped over to the life - support vat .
I peered through the glass .
There , floating in what looked like ginger ale , was undeniably a human brain , though it was almost covered with printed circuit chips , plastic tubules , electrodes , and other paraphernalia .
“ Is that mine ? ” I asked .
“ Hit the output transmitter switch there on the side of the vat and see for yourself , ” the project director replied .
I moved the switch to OFF , and immediately slumped , groggy and nauseated , into the arms of the technicians , one of whom kindly restored the switch to its ON position .
While I recovered my equilibrium and composure , I thought to myself : “ Well , here I am sitting on a folding chair , staring through a piece of plate glass at my own brain . . .
But wait , ” I said to myself , “ should n't I have thought , ‘ Here I am , suspended in a bubbling fluid , being stared at by my own eyes ’ ? ”
I tried to think this latter thought .
I tried to project it into the tank , offering it hopefully to my brain , but I failed to carry off the exercise with any conviction .
I tried again .
“ Here am I , Daniel Dennett , suspended in a bubbling fluid , being stared at by my own eyes . ”
No , it just did n't work .
Most puzzling and confusing .
Being a philosopher of firm physicalist conviction , I believed unswervingly that the tokening of my thoughts was occurring somewhere in my brain : yet , when I thought “ Here I am , ” where the thought occurred to me was here , outside the vat , where I , Dennett , was standing staring at my brain .
I tried and tried to think myself into the vat , but to no avail .
I tried to build up to the task by doing mental exercises .
I thought to myself , “ The sun is shining over there , ” five times in rapid succession , each time mentally ostending a different place : in order , the sunlit corner of the lab , the visible front lawn of the hospital , Houston , Mars , and Jupiter .
I found I had little difficulty in getting my “ there ” 's to hop all over the celestial map with their proper references .
I could loft a “ there ” in an instant through the farthest reaches of space , and then aim the next “ there ” with pinpoint accuracy at the upper left quadrant of a freckle on my arm .
Why was I having such trouble with “ here ” ?
“ Here in Houston ” worked well enough , and so did “ here in the lab , ” and even “ here in this part of the lab , ” but “ here in the vat ” always seemed merely an unmeant mental mouthing .
I tried closing my eyes while thinking it .
This seemed to help , but still I could n't manage to pull it off , except perhaps for a fleeting instant .
I could n't be sure .
The discovery that I could n't be sure was also unsettling .
How did I know where I meant by “ here ” when I thought “ here ” ?
Could I think I meant one place when in fact I meant another ?
I did n't see how that could be admitted without untying the few bonds of intimacy between a person and his own mental life that had survived the onslaught of the brain scientists and philosophers , the physicalists and behaviorists .
Perhaps I was incorrigible about where I meant when I said “ here . ”
But in my present circumstances it seemed that either I was doomed by sheer force of mental habit to thinking systematically false indexical thoughts , or where a person is ( and hence where his thoughts are tokened for purposes of semantic analysis ) is not necessarily where his brain , the physical seat of his soul , resides .
Nagged by confusion , I attempted to orient myself by falling back on a favorite philosopher 's ploy .
I began naming things .
“ Yorick , ” I said aloud to my brain , “ you are my brain .
The rest of my body , seated in this chair , I dub ‘ Hamlet . ’ ”
So here we all are : Yorick 's my brain , Hamlet 's my body , and I am Dennett .
Now , where am I ?
And when I think “ where am I ? ” , where 's that thought tokened ?
Is it tokened in my brain , lounging about in the vat , or right here between my ears where it seems to be tokened ?
Or nowhere ?
Its temporal coordinates give me no trouble ; must it not have spatial coordinates as well ?
I began making a list of the alternatives .
1 . Where Hamlet goes there goes Dennett .
This principle was easily refuted by appeal to the familiar brain - transplant thought experiments so enjoyed by philosophers .
If Tom and Dick switch brains , Tom is the fellow with Dick 's former body — just ask him ; he 'll claim to be Tom and tell you the most intimate details of Tom 's autobiography .
It was clear enough , then , that my current body and I could part company , but not likely that I could be separated from my brain .
The rule of thumb that emerged so plainly from the thought experiments was that in a brain - transplant operation , one wanted to be the donor not the recipient .
Better to call such an operation a body transplant , in fact .
So perhaps the truth was ,
2 . Where Yorick goes there goes Dennett .
This was not at all appealing , however .
How could I be in the vat and not about to go anywhere , when I was so obviously outside the vat looking in and beginning to make guilty plans to return to my room for a substantial lunch ?
This begged the question I realized , but it still seemed to be getting at something important .
Casting about for some support for my intuition , I hit upon a legalistic sort of argument that might have appealed to Locke .
Suppose , I argued to myself , I were now to fly to California , rob a bank , and be apprehended .
In which state would I be tried : in California , where the robbery took place , or in Texas , where the brains of the outfit were located ?
Would I be a California felon with an out - of - state brain , or a Texas felon remotely controlling an accomplice of sorts in California ?
It seemed possible that I might beat such a rap just on the undecidability of that jurisdictional question , though perhaps it would be deemed an interstate , and hence Federal , offense .
In any event , suppose I were convicted .
Was it likely that California would be satisfied to throw Hamlet into the brig , knowing that Yorick was living the good life and luxuriously taking the waters in Texas ?
Would Texas incarcerate Yorick , leaving Hamlet free to take the next boat to Rio ?
This alternative appealed to me .
Barring capital punishment or other cruel and unusual punishment , the state would be obliged to maintain the life - support system for Yorick though they might move him from Houston to Leavenworth , and aside from the unpleasantness of the opprobrium , I , for one , would not mind at all and would consider myself a free man under those circumstances .
If the state has an interest in forcibly relocating persons in institutions , it would fail to relocate me in any institution by locating Yorick there .
If this were true , it suggested a third alternative .
3. Dennett is wherever he thinks he is .
Generalized , the claim was as follows :
At any given time a person has a point of view and the location of the point of view ( which is determined internally by the content of the point of view ) is also the location of the person .
Such a proposition is not without its perplexities , but to me it seemed a step in the right direction .
The only trouble was that it seemed to place one in a heads - I - win / tails - you - lose situation of unlikely infallibility as regards location .
Had n't I myself often been wrong about where I was , and at least as often uncertain ?
Could n't one get lost ?
Of course , but getting lost geographically is not the only way one might get lost .
If one were lost in the woods one could attempt to reassure oneself with the consolation that at least one knew where one was : one was right here in the familiar surroundings of one 's own body .
Perhaps in this case one would not have drawn one 's attention to much to be thankful for .
Still , there were worse plights imaginable , and I was n't sure I was n't in such a plight right now .
Point of view clearly had something to do with personal location , but it was itself an unclear notion .
It was obvious that the content of one 's point of view was not the same as or determined by the content of one 's beliefs or thoughts .
For example , what should we say about the point of view of the Cinerama viewer who shrieks and twists in his seat as the roller - coaster footage overcomes his psychic distancing ?
Has he forgotten that he is safely seated in the theater ?
Here I was inclined to say that the person is experiencing an illusory shift in point of view .
In other cases , my inclination to call such shifts illusory was less strong .
The workers in laboratories and plants who handle dangerous materials by operating feedback - controlled mechanical arms and hands undergo a shift in point of view that is crisper and more pronounced than anything Cinerama can provoke .
They can feel the heft and slipperiness of the containers they manipulate with their metal fingers .
They know perfectly well where they are and are not fooled into false beliefs by the experience , yet it is as if they were inside the isolation chamber they are peering into .
With mental effort , they can manage to shift their point of view back and forth , rather like making a transparent Necker cube or an Escher drawing change orientation before one 's eyes .
It does seem extravagant to suppose that in performing this bit of mental gymnastics , they are transporting themselves back and forth .
Still their example gave me hope .
If I was in fact in the vat in spite of my intuitions , I might be able to train myself to adopt that point of view even as a matter of habit .
I should dwell on images of myself comfortably floating in my vat , beaming volitions to that familiar body out there .
I reflected that the ease or difficulty of this task was presumably independent of the truth about the location of one 's brain .
Had I been practicing before the operation , I might now be finding it second nature .
You might now yourself try such a trompe l'oeil .
Imagine you have written an inflammatory letter which has been published in the Times , the result of which is that the government has chosen to impound your brain for a probationary period of three years in its Dangerous Brain Clinic in Bethesda , Maryland .
Your body of course is allowed freedom to earn a salary and thus to continue its function of laying up income to be taxed .
At this moment , however , your body is seated in an auditorium listening to a peculiar account by Daniel Dennett of his own similar experience .
Try it .
Think yourself to Bethesda , and then hark back longingly to your body , far away , and yet seeming so near .
It is only with long - distance restraint ( yours ? the government 's ? ) that you can control your impulse to get those hands clapping in polite applause before navigating the old body to the rest room and a well - deserved glass of evening sherry in the lounge .
The task of imagination is certainly difficult , but if you achieve your goal the results might be consoling .
Anyway , there I was in Houston , lost in thought as one might say , but not for long .
My speculations were soon interrupted by the Houston doctors , who wished to test out my new prosthetic nervous system before sending me off on my hazardous mission .
As I mentioned before , I was a bit dizzy at first , and not surprisingly , although I soon habituated myself to my new circumstances ( which were , after all , well nigh indistinguishable from my old circumstances ) .
My accommodation was not perfect , however , and to this day I continue to be plagued by minor coordination difficulties .
The speed of light is fast , but finite , and as my brain and body move farther and farther apart , the delicate interaction of my feedback systems is thrown into disarray by the time lags .
Just as one is rendered close to speechless by a delayed or echoic hearing of one 's speaking voice so , for instance , I am virtually unable to track a moving object with my eyes whenever my brain and my body are more than a few miles apart .
In most matters my impairment is scarcely detectable , though I can no longer hit a slow curve ball with the authority of yore .
There are some compensations of course .
Though liquor tastes as good as ever , and warms my gullet while corroding my liver , I can drink it in any quantity I please , without becoming the slightest bit inebriated , a curiosity some of my close friends may have noticed ( though I occasionally have feigned inebriation , so as not to draw attention to my unusual circumstances ) .
For similar reasons , I take aspirin orally for a sprained wrist , but if the pain persists I ask Houston to administer codeine to me in vitro .
In times of illness the phone bill can be staggering .
But to return to my adventure .
At length , both the doctors and I were satisfied that I was ready to undertake my subterranean mission .
And so I left my brain in Houston and headed by helicopter for Tulsa .
Well , in any case , that 's the way it seemed to me .
That 's how I would put it , just off the top of my head as it were .
On the trip I reflected further about my earlier anxieties and decided that my first postoperative speculations had been tinged with panic .
The matter was not nearly as strange or metaphysical as I had been supposing .
Where was I ?
In two places , clearly : both inside the vat and outside it .
Just as one can stand with one foot in Connecticut and the other in Rhode Island , I was in two places at once .
I had become one of those scattered individuals we used to hear so much about .
The more I considered this answer , the more obviously true it appeared .
But , strange to say , the more true it appeared , the less important the question to which it could be the true answer seemed .
A sad , but not unprecedented , fate for a philosophical question to suffer .
This answer did not completely satisfy me , of course .
There lingered some question to which I should have liked an answer , which was neither “ Where are all my various and sundry parts ? ” nor “ What is my current point of view ? ”
Or at least there seemed to be such a question .
For it did seem undeniable that in some sense I and not merely most of me was descending into the earth under Tulsa in search of an atomic warhead .
When I found the warhead , I was certainly glad I had left my brain behind , for the pointer on the specially built Geiger counter I had brought with me was off the dial .
I called Houston on my ordinary radio and told the operation control center of my position and my progress .
In return , they gave me instructions for dismantling the vehicle , based upon my on - site observations .
I had set to work with my cutting torch when all of a sudden a terrible thing happened .
I went stone deaf .
At first I thought it was only my radio earphones that had broken , but when I tapped on my helmet , I heard nothing .
Apparently the auditory transceivers had gone on the fritz .
I could no longer hear Houston or my own voice , but I could speak , so I started telling them what had happened .
In midsentence , I knew something else had gone wrong .
My vocal apparatus had become paralyzed .
Then my right hand went limp — another transceiver had gone .
I was truly in deep trouble .
But worse was to follow .
After a few more minutes , I went blind .
I cursed my luck , and then I cursed the scientists who had led me into this grave peril .
There I was , deaf , dumb , and blind , in a radioactive hole more than a mile under Tulsa .
Then the last of my cerebral radio links broke , and suddenly I was faced with a new and even more shocking problem : whereas an instant before I had been buried alive in Oklahoma , now I was disembodied in Houston .
My recognition of my new status was not immediate .
It took me several very anxious minutes before it dawned on me that my poor body lay several hundred miles away , with heart pulsing and lungs respirating , but otherwise as dead as the body of any heart - transplant donor , its skull packed with useless , broken electronic gear .
The shift in perspective I had earlier found well nigh impossible now seemed quite natural .
Though I could think myself back into my body in the tunnel under Tulsa , it took some effort to sustain the illusion .
For surely it was an illusion to suppose I was still in Oklahoma : I had lost all contact with that body .
It occurred to me then , with one of those rushes of revelation of which we should be suspicious , that I had stumbled upon an impressive demonstration of the immateriality of the soul based upon physicalist principles and premises .
For as the last radio signal between Tulsa and Houston died away , had I not changed location from Tulsa to Houston at the speed of light ?
And had I not accomplished this without any increase in mass ?
What moved from A to B at such speed was surely myself , or at any rate my soul or mind — the massless center of my being and home of my consciousness .
My point of view had lagged somewhat behind , but I had already noted the indirect bearing of point of view on personal location .
I could not see how a physicalist philosopher could quarrel with this except by taking the dire and counterintuitive route of banishing all talk of persons .
Yet the notion of personhood was so well entrenched in everyone 's world view , or so it seemed to me , that any denial would be as curiously unconvincing , as systematically disingenuous , as the Cartesian negation , “ non sum . ”
The joy of philosophic discovery thus tided me over some very bad minutes or perhaps hours as the helplessness and hopelessness or my situation became more apparent to me .
Waves of panic and even nausea swept over me , made all the more horrible by the absence of their normal body - dependent phenomenology .
No adrenaline rush of tingles in the arms , no pounding heart , no premonitory salivation .
I did feel a dread sinking feeling in my bowels at one point , and this tricked me momentarily into the false hope that I was undergoing a reversal of the process that landed me in this fix — a gradual undisembodiment .
But the isolation and uniqueness of that twinge soon convinced me that it was simply the first of a plague of phantom body hallucinations that I , like any other amputee , would be all too likely to suffer .
My mood then was chaotic .
On the one hand , I was fired up with elation of my philosophic discovery and was wracking my brain ( one of the few familiar things I could still do ) , trying to figure out how to communicate my discovery to the journals ; while on the other , I was bitter , lonely , and filled with dread and uncertainty .
Fortunately , this did not last long , for my technical support team sedated me into a dreamless sleep from which I awoke , hearing with magnificent fidelity the familiar opening strains of my favorite Brahms piano trio .
So that was why they had wanted a list of my favorite recordings !
It did not take me long to realize that I was hearing the music without ears .
The output from the stereo stylus was being fed through some fancy rectification circuitry directly into my auditory nerve .
I was mainlining Brahms , an unforgettable experience for any stereo buff .
At the end of the record it did not surprise me to hear the reassuring voice of the project director speaking into a microphone that was now my prosthetic ear .
He confirmed my analysis of what had gone wrong and assured me that steps were being taken to re-embody me .
He did not elaborate , and after a few more recordings , I found myself drifting off to sleep .
My sleep lasted , I later learned , for the better part of a year , and when I awoke , it was to find myself fully restored to my senses .
When I looked into the mirror , though , I was a bit startled to see an unfamiliar face .
Bearded and a bit heavier , bearing no doubt a family resemblance to my former face , and with the same look of spritely intelligence and resolute character , but definitely a new face .
Further self - explorations of an intimate nature left me no doubt that this was a new body , and the project director confirmed my conclusions .
He did not volunteer any information on the past history of my new body and I decided ( wisely , I think in retrospect ) not to pry .
As many philosophers unfamiliar with my ordeal have more recently speculated , the acquisition of a new body leaves one 's person intact .
And after a period of adjustment to a new voice , new muscular strengths and weaknesses , and so forth , one 's personality is by and large also preserved .
More dramatic changes in personality have been routinely observed in people who have undergone extensive plastic surgery , to say nothing of sex - change operations , and I think no one contests the survival of the person in such cases .
In any event I soon accommodated to my new body , to the point of being unable to recover any of its novelties to my consciousness or even memory .
The view in the mirror soon became utterly familiar .
That view , by the way , still revealed antennae , and so l was not surprised to learn that my brain had not been moved from its haven in the life - support lab .
I decided that good old Yorick deserved a visit .
I and my new body , whom we might as well call Fortinbras , strode into the familiar lab to another round of applause from the technicians , who were of course congratulating themselves , not me .
Once more I stood before the vat and contemplated poor Yorick , and on a whim I once again cavalierly flicked off the output transmitter switch .
Imagine my surprise when nothing unusual happened .
No fainting spell , no nausea , no noticeable change .
A technician hurried to restore the switch to ON , but still I felt nothing .
I demanded an explanation , which the project director hastened to provide .
It seems that before they had even operated on the first occasion , they had constructed a computer duplicate of my brain , reproducing both the complete information - processing structure and the computational speed of my brain in a giant computer program .
After the operation , but before they had dared to send me off on my mission to Oklahoma , they had run this computer system and Yorick side by side .
The incoming signals from Hamlet were sent simultaneously to Yorick 's transceivers and to the computer 's array of inputs .
And the outputs from Yorick were not only beamed back to Hamlet , my body ; they were recorded and checked against the simultaneous output of the computer program , which was called “ Hubert ” for reasons obscure to me .
Over days and even weeks , the outputs were identical and synchronous , which of course did not prove that they had succeeded in copying the brain 's functional structure , but the empirical support was greatly encouraging .
Hubert 's input , and hence activity , had been kept parallel with Yorick 's during my disembodied days .
And now , to demonstrate this , they had actually thrown the master switch that put Hubert for the first time in on - line control of my body — not Hamlet , of course , but Fortinbras .
( Hamlet , I learned , had never been recovered from its underground tomb and could be assumed by this time to have largely returned to the dust .
At the head of my grave still lay the magnificent bulk of the abandoned device , with the word STUD emblazoned on its side in large letters — a circumstance which may provide archeologists of the next century with a curious insight into the burial rites of their ancestors . )
The laboratory technicians now showed me the master switch , which had two positions , labeled B , for Brain ( they did n't know my brain 's name was Yorick ) and H , for Hubert .
The switch did indeed point to H , and they explained to me that if I wished , I could switch it back to B .
With my heart in my mouth ( and my brain in its vat ) , I did this .
Nothing happened .
A click , that was all .
To test their claim , and with the master switch now set at B .
I hit Yorick 's output transmitter switch on the vat and sure enough , I began to faint .
Once the output switch was turned back on and I had recovered my wits , so to speak , I continued to play with the master switch , flipping it back and forth .
I found that with the exception of the transitional click , I could detect no trace of a difference .
I could switch in mid-utterance , and the sentence I had begun speaking under the control of Yorick was finished without a pause or hitch of any kind under the control of Hubert .
I had a spare brain , a prosthetic device which might some day stand me in very good stead , were some mishap to befall Yorick .
Or alternatively , I could keep Yorick as a spare and use Hubert .
It did n't seem to make any difference which I chose , for the wear and tear and fatigue on my body did not have any debilitating effect on either brain , whether or not it was actually causing the motions of my body , or merely spilling its output into thin air .
The one truly unsettling aspect of this new development was the prospect , which was not long in dawning on me , of someone detaching the spare — Hubert or Yorick , as the case might be — from Fortinbras and hitching it to yet another body — some Johnny - come- lately Rosencrantz or Guildenstern .
Then ( if not before ) there would be two people , that much was clear .
One would be me , and the other would be a sort of super - twin brother .
If there were two bodies , one under the control of Hubert and the other being controlled by Yorick , then which would the world recognize as the true Dennett ?
And whatever the rest of the world decided , which one would be me ?
Would I be the Yorick - brained one , in virtue of Yorick 's causal priority and former intimate relationship with the original Dennett body , Hamlet ?
That seemed a bit legalistic , a bit too redolent of the arbitrariness of consanguinity and legal possession , to be convincing at the metaphysical level .
For suppose that before the arrival of the second body on the scene , I had been keeping Yorick as the spare for years , and letting Hubert 's output drive my body — that is , Fortinbras — all that time .
The Hubert - Fortinbras couple would seem then by squatter 's rights ( to combat one legal intuition with another ) to be the true Dennett and the lawful inheritor of everything that was Dennett's .
This was an interesting question , certainly , but not nearly so pressing as another question that bothered me .
My strongest intuition was that in such an eventuality I would survive so long as either brain - body couple remained intact , but I had mixed emotions about whether I should want both to survive .
I discussed my worries with the technicians and the project director .
The prospect of two Dennetts was abhorrent to me , I explained , largely for social reasons .
I did n't want to be my own rival for the affections of my wife , nor did I like the prospect of the two Dennetts sharing my modest professor 's salary .
Still more vertiginous and distasteful , though , was the idea of knowing that much about another person , while he had the very same goods on me .
How could we ever face each other ?
My colleagues in the lab argued that I was ignoring the bright side of the matter .
Were n't there many things I wanted to do but , being only one person , had been unable to do ?
Now one Dennett could stay at home and be the professor and family man while the other could strike out on a life of travel and adventure — missing the family of course , but happy in the knowledge that the other Dennett was keeping the home fires burning .
I could be faithful and adulterous at the same time .
I could even cuckold myself — to say nothing of other more lurid possibilities my colleagues were all too ready to force upon my overtaxed imagination .
But my ordeal in Oklahoma ( or was it Houston ? ) had made me less adventurous , and I shrank from this opportunity that was being offered ( though of course I was never quite sure it was being offered to me in the first place ) .
There was another prospect even more disagreeable : that the spare , Hubert or Yorick as the case might be , would be detached from any input from Fortinbras and just left detached .
Then , as in the other case , there would be two Dennets , or at least two claimants to my name and possessions , one embodied in Fortinbras , and the other sadly , miserably disembodied .
Both selfishness and altruism bade me take steps to prevent this from happening .
So I asked that measures be taken to ensure that no one could ever tamper with the transceiver connections or the master switch without my ( our ? no , my ) knowledge and consent .
Since I had no desire to spend my life guarding the equipment in Houston , it was mutually decided that all the electronic connections in the lab would be carefully locked .
Both those that controlled the life - support system for Yorick and those that controlled the power supply for Hubert would be guarded with fail - safe devices , and I would take the only master switch , outfitted for radio remote control , with me wherever I went .
I carry it strapped around my waist and — wait a moment — here it is .
Every few months I reconnoiter the situation by switching channels .
I do this only in the presence of friends , of course , for if the other channel were , heaven forbid , either dead or otherwise occupied , there would have to be somebody who had my interests at heart to switch it back , to bring me back from the void .
For while I could feel , see , hear , and otherwise sense whatever befell my body , subsequent to such a switch , I 'd be unable to control it .
By the way , the two positions on the switch are intentionally unmarked , so I never have the faintest idea whether I am switching from Hubert to Yorick or vice versa .
( Some of you may think that in this case I really do n't know who I am , let alone where I am .
But such reflections no longer make much of a dent on my essential Dennettness , on my own sense of who I am .
If it is true that in one sense I do n't know who I am then that 's another one of your philosophical truths of underwhelming significance . )
In any case , every time I 've flipped the switch so far , nothing has happened .
So let 's give it a try . . . .
“ THANK GOD !
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER FLIP THAT SWITCH !
You can't imagine how horrible it's been these last two weeks — but now you know ; it 's your turn in purgatory .
How I 've longed for this moment !
You see , about two weeks ago — excuse me , ladies and gentlemen , but I 've got to explain this to my . . . um , brother , I guess you could say , but he 's just told you the facts , so you 'll understand — about two weeks ago our two brains drifted just a bit out of synch .
I do n't know whether my brain is now Hubert or Yorick , any more than you do , but in any case , the two brains drifted apart , and of course once the process started , it snowballed , for I was in a slightly different receptive state for the input we both received , a difference that was soon magnified .
In no time at all the illusion that I was in control of my body — our body — was completely dissipated .
There was nothing I could do — no way to call you .
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I EXISTED !
It 's been like being carried around in a cage , or better , like being possessed — hearing my own voice say things I did n't mean to say , watching in frustration as my own hands performed deeds I had n't intended .
You 'd scratch our itches , but not the way I would have , and you kept me awake , with your tossing and turning .
I 've been totally exhausted , on the verge of a nervous breakdown , carried around helplessly by your frantic round of activities , sustained only by the knowledge that some day you 'd throw the switch .
“ Now it 's your turn , but at least you 'll have the comfort of knowing I know you 're in there .
Like an expectant mother , I 'm eating — or at any rate tasting , smelling , seeing — for two now , and I 'll try to make it easy for you .
Do n't worry .
Just as soon as this colloquium is over , you and I will fly to Houston , and we 'll see what can be done to get one of us another body .
You can have a female body — your body could be any color you like .
But let 's think it over .
I tell you what — to be fair , if we both want this body , I promise I 'll let the project director flip a coin to settle which of us gets to keep it and which then gets to choose a new body .
That should guarantee justice , should n't it ?
In any case , I 'll take care of you , I promise .
These people are my witnesses .
“ Ladies and gentlemen , this talk we have just heard is not exactly the talk I would have given , but I assure you that everything he said was perfectly true .
And now if you 'll excuse me , I think I 'd — we'd — better sit down . ”
Here 's a short movie featuring Bill Gates and Napoleon Dynamite that totally made my day .
Watch it and get back to me ; I can guarantee that you wo n't see Mr. Gate the same way ever again .
Enjoy !
フィンランドのセキュリティ企業F-Secureは8月27日、ソニーのUSBメモリのドライバに、rootkit的な隠し技術が組み込まれているのを見つけたとして、ブログで概略を公表した。
F- Secureによると、問題があるのは指紋認証機能を組み込んだソニー製USBメモリのソフトドライバ。2種類のUSBメモリを入手し、テストマシンにソフトをインストールしたところ、同社のrootkit検出システムで、システム上に隠しファイルが検出された。
これらUSBメモリに付属するソニーの指紋認識ソフト「MicroVault USM-F」のドライバは、「c:\windows\」のディレクトリの下に隠れる形でインストールされるという。Windowsディレクトリ内のファイルとサブディレクトリを一覧表示しても、Windows APIではこのディレクトリとファイルが表示されない。
しかし、ディレクトリ名を知っていれば、コマンドプロンプトを使ってこの隠しディレクトリに入り込み、新しい隠しファイルを作ることも可能だ。しかも一部のウイルス対策ソフトでは、このディレクトリ内のファイルは検出されない。つまり、理論的にはマルウェアがこの隠しディレクトリを利用することが可能になるとF-Secureは分析する。
MicroVaultソフトは指紋認証を守る目的でこのフォルダを隠しているのだろうが、rootkit的な隠し技術を使うのは適切ではないとF-Secureは主張。この問題を公表する前にソニーに連絡したが、これまでのところソニーからは何の返答もないとしている。
rootkitはかつて 、Sony BMGのCDに組み込まれているのが発覚して問題になったことがある。当時はまだ、rootkitを使ったマルウェアはそれほど多くなかったが、その後、この手口を採用したマルウェアが増加した。Sony BMG問題で有名にならなければ、これほどの規模でrootkitが急増したかどうかは分からないとF-Secureは解説している。
How To Brew Beer At Home - Even If You Can't Make Kraft Dinner !
So you want to know how to brew beer at home ?
If so , I 've found something I think you might find of interest - especially if you 're looking for a method that does n't require an advanced degree in chemistry !
I 've really wanted to learn homebrewing for a while myself .
So I started doing some research , looked around at web sites , articles , even checked out some of the homebrew stores , etc .
Well , the more I learned , the more I thought , " This sounds pretty complicated - I just want a simple method for brewing beer myself . "
Sound familiar ?
If so , I 've got great news - like I mentioned , I found a site where this guy claims he 'll teach you how to brew beer - great tasting beer , at home , for a fraction of what you 've been paying in stores for inferior alternatives !
What 's more , he says his method is so simple , anyone can do it - even if you can't make Kraft Dinner ( you know , macaroni and cheese out of a box ) without messing it up !
I mean , making great beer should not be like rocket science , should it ?
We 've started adding articles ( see links above ) taking you through this homebrewing process , step - by - step .
But in the meanwhile , if you can't wait , and want to know how to brew beer right now - with a foolproof , simple , easy method anyone can follow - click over and have a look .
You 'll thank me later - for the great tasting beer , and all the money you 'll save by brewing it yourself !
Those downward pressures , though , are being offset by a robust global economy that is providing a significant lift to exports , corporate profits and real wages , which finally picked up in the last year after stagnating for much of the decade .
Optimists note that consumer spending is unlikely to slow as long as hourly wages are perking along at a nominal annual pace of about 4 percent , about 1.5 percentage points above the inflation rate .
“ There clearly is a problem in mortgages , ” said David Kelley , an economist at Putnam Investments , the mutual fund company in Boston .
But “ outside the mortgage market , we do n’t really see the consumer stopping spending . ”
Consumer spending has often defied dour predictions .
There was no decline in spending during the recession of 2001 , even as job losses mounted and business sentiment sank after the technology bubble burst .
That is one reason the downturn was so mild compared with the harsher recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s .

Economists also note that spending by higher - income consumers has a far more significant impact on the economy than purchases by those who are less well - off , a group that appears to be most vulnerable to declining home prices , resetting mortgages and job loss .
“ There are essentially two consumer economies right now , and they parallel the split between the very rich and everybody else , ” said J. Walker Smith , president of Yankelovich , the consumer research firm based in Norwalk , Conn .
“ There is one part of the consumer economy that is unlikely to be affected at all by the recent events in the financial markets .
Those are the people making the loans .
The people taking the loans , however , are the people who are affected . ”
Mr. Tuberman sees that bifurcation in his furniture business .
Even as a number of competitors and distributors have gone out of business , Barn Furniture ’s sales have held up , he says , because it receives most of its orders from repeat and longtime customers , who are drawn to his traditional wood products .
Pork and waste .
Six years after the fall of the Twin Towers , the devastating blow to the Pentagon , and the inspiring courage of the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 , anti-terrorism funding is an exercise in pork - barrel spending and high - profile projects of dubious value .
On the one hand , we have money being spent on petty projects designed to defend “ targets ” that are more at risk from a meteor strike than a terrorist attack , like the town of Madisonville , Texas .
As reported by The Dallas Morning News , the town , population 4,200 , used a federal homeland security grant to purchase a $ 30,000 customized trailer .
The trailer can be used as a mobile command center , but city officials admitted it is more likely to be used as an information and first - aid booth during the town ’s annual mushroom festival .
Or there ’s the story of Dillingham , Alaska , population 2,400 .
Last year , the Anchorage Daily News noted that Dillingham — which does n’t have a single street light — had received $ 202,000 dollars in homeland security funding to purchase surveillance cameras .
On the other hand , the danger of big , headline - grabbing threats has been ameliorated to a limited extent — but these threats , like dirty bombs or bioterrorism , have always been inherently unlikely to come to pass on anything like the apocalyptic scale feared by some .
Ironically , in our effort to thwart terrorists , we ’re making things easier for them .
Without lifting a finger and starting down the long , difficult , and expensive road of actually making a viable biological , chemical , or nuclear weapon of mass destruction , the terrorists have managed to distract us with the specter of such a device .
Meanwhile , we remain vulnerable to other , less dramatic but perhaps much more realistic lines of attack .
Let ’s start with dirty bombs , a staple of media - fed fears .
In the typical scenario , a group of terrorists steal a few ounces of radioactive material like cobalt 60 from a food irradiation facility .
This can not be used to make a nuclear bomb , but it gives a lethal radiation dose in close quarters .
The terrorists wrap the cobalt 60 around a conventional explosive , detonate it , and shower a city with deadly fallout .
To detect dirty bombs in the offing , gamma and other radiation detectors have been deployed to airports and seaports as well as police departments around the country .
But there are still many unprotected ports .
If drug cartels can regularly sneak tons of narcotics into and around the country , surely terrorists can do the same with a much smaller cache of radioactive material .
What is really keeping us safe is probably not those radiation detectors but the basic physics of trying to carry out a radioactive attack .
In order to contaminate a large area with enough radioactive material to pose a major health hazard , the dirty bomb would have to be packed with so much cobalt 60 ( on the order of a few ounces in this case ) that the terrorists would die of radiation poisoning within minutes of exposure to their own weapon .
A practical dirty bomb ’s main effects would be from fear , not radiation , with both the Department of Homeland Security and the American Institute of Physics predicting few deaths from cancer or radiation poisoning , even in densely populated areas .
“ The radioactivity released by dirty bombs is not life threatening , ” says Angelo Acquista , former medical director of the Office of Emergency Management in New York City and author of The Survival Guide : What to Do in a Biological , Chemical , or Nuclear Emergency .
Writing in MIT ’s Technology Review , Richard Muller , a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , calculated the radiation exposure — measured in a unit known as the rem — that city residents would receive from a practical dirty bomb .
His analysis concluded that no one would receive sufficient radiation to induce radiation illness , let alone death , and that the long - term risk of developing cancer was only fractionally increased .
But with lawmakers and government agencies ratcheting up the rhetoric about dirty bombs in their lobbying for more funding , the average citizen can hardly be blamed for considering dirty bombs a grave threat — a perfect example of well - intentioned efforts that would amplify , not dampen , the impact of a terrorist attack .
Bioterrorism is another overhyped threat .
According the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation , based in Washington , D.C. , since 2001 federal and state governments have spent $ 41.5 billion combating bioterrorism , with another $ 6.8 billion on the way .
The money has been spent on things like improving sensors to detect an attack and on building up a stockpile of drugs to combat various pathogens like anthrax .
Faced with the prospect of terrorists releasing a bioweapon that spawns a deadly nationwide epidemic , quickly overwhelming hospitals and other health services , surely this seems a reasonable outlay .
As with dirty bombs , the main thing keeping us safe from bioattack is the nature of the weapon itself .
The most dangerous and virulent pathogens , like the Ebola virus , kill their victims too quickly , so an infected person is able to spread the disease to only a relatively small number of people before succumbing .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Ebola has an incubation period of 2 to 21 days and kills 50 to 90 percent of those infected within two weeks of the onset of symptoms .
This produces terrifying but limited and short - lived outbreaks .
The second problem terrorists face is how to infect victims with their disease of choice .
Aerosolizing the pathogen — so that it can be released and inhaled by a large number of people — is an obvious approach , but this is difficult to do , not least because many infectious agents can’t survive long outside a host .
Anthrax is seen as a particular threat because it occurs in spore form , meaning that it can be transported easily and will remain potent for decades .
In principle , inhaling just a couple of spores could spark a fatal infection .
More realistically , being exposed to several thousand spores would be required for most people to develop symptoms , but that still amounts to a dose weighing far less than a millionth of an ounce .
It ’s no surprise , then , that anthrax was used in the still - unsolved bioterror mailings that occurred in the weeks after 9/11 .
The attacks sparked frenzied countermeasures among the general public , with people ironing their mail to kill spores and reports of people attempting to obtain personal stockpiles of the antibiotic Cipro .
The government set up more elaborate schemes to use electron beams to sterilize mail .
Yet despite the mailings ’ status as the most sophisticated and deadly series of bioterrorist attacks in the United States to date , just five people were killed and another 17 sickened .
Compare this with the average annual death toll of 36,000 Americans from ordinary influenza .
Chemical weapons are a more clearly evident risk :
The sarin nerve gas that cultists used to attack the Tokyo subway killed 12 and injured hundreds in 1995 .
As a consequence , stockpiles of the nerve gas antidote , called Chempacks , have been put in place in cities around America , and detection systems are being developed to warn of an attack and have already been deployed in a few places like Grand Central Terminal in New York City .
First responders have also been provided with field supplies of nerve gas antidote , with each ambulance in New York City , for example , carrying 60 Mark I kits , says Neal Richmond , former deputy medical director of the New York Fire Department .
Each Mark
I kit has two auto­injectors , one containing atropine , which works to counteract the immediate effects of the nerve gas , and the other a drug called 2 - PAM , which helps the body clear the nerve gas out of its system .
All that said , for those caught in a chemical attack , the available countermeasures are not exactly reassuring .
A chemical weapons attack would be a “ mass casualty event , ” Richmond warns , meaning that emergency responders would expect to be overwhelmed by the number of sick and dying people .
In such an event , the rules for treating victims that most people have come to expect from emergency responders are altered .
“ You want to use available resources to get the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people instead of focusing all your resources on the sickest people , ” Richmond says .
Rather than treating the sickest first , rescuers would treat the most likely to survive first , evacuating those who can walk or crawl to a decontamination area before sorting out the rest .
In a chemical attack , the task of first responders would be further complicated by their bulky protective suits .
These make normal medical examinations impossible , forcing responders to rely on “ noxious stimulus triage ” — nicknamed kick triage — to sort out the living from the dead .
“ You do n’t really kick them , but you do shake them , move them ” to see if they react , says Richmond .
“ Anyone who does n’t appear dead gets dragged out ” and injected with three Mark I kits .
If that stabilizes the victim long enough to reach hospital care , chances are he will survive , as more antidote can be administered as needed to keep counteracting the nerve gas .
If the victim ’s condition worsens before he can reach the hospital , however , he is unlikely to receive any additional antidote — especially if the antidote is in short supply — as the responders turn their attention to others .
Richmond worries that despite all the elaborate planning made by the Department of Homeland Security and others to deal with chemical and biological attacks , mundane but important things are n’t happening — like conducting enough drills to make sure that these plans actually get implemented properly .
He also notes that a lot of money has been spent preparing for rare attacks , but emergency rooms around the country already have difficulties coping with routine patients :
“ We need to tackle building the everyday infrastructure in this country so that it ’s working for every patient , every day .
Then when the big things come down , we ’ll be pretty prepared . ”
Another big part of the homeland security boondoggle is the formula used to dole out federal funds .
Originally , after 9/11 , homeland security funds were distributed according to a formula that first guaranteed each and every state a certain minimum level of funding and then divvied up remaining funds according to the size of state populations .
Not surprisingly , the 9/11 Commission was horrified by such a simplistic approach , which gave money to states whether it was needed or not .
Consequently , the commission recommended in its 2004 report that funding be based “ solely on risks and vulnerabilities , putting New York City and Washington , D.C. , at the top of the current list . ”
Since then , there have been attempts to reform the formula to distribute funds based on the actual risk posed by terrorists .
Unfortunately , these attempts have resulted in sometimes ridiculous results .
Last year ’s much - derided analysis by the Department of Homeland Security reduced New York City ’s homeland security funding by 40 percent to $ 124 million , concluding that the metropolis contained no national monuments or icons — somehow skipping over the Statue of Liberty , the Empire State Building , the Brooklyn Bridge , and Wall Street , among others .
Although some of New York ’s funding was eventually restored , the homeland security distribution formula is still far off the mark set by the 9/11 Commission .
And so pork still abounds , prompting Congressmen Anthony Weiner and Jeff Flake to produce a list last March of the most absurd homeland security grants they could find .
Standouts included $ 36,000 to Kentucky in 2005 to prevent terrorists from raising money at state bingo halls ; $ 7,348 worth of bulletproof vests for the police and fire department dogs of Columbus , Ohio , in the same year ; and the biggest whopper of them all , $ 8,000 in 2006 for a Wisconsin fire department ’s clown and puppet shows .
The only silver lining is that these absurd preparations are probably not going to be needed .
Why ?
Because terrorists like getting as much bang for their buck as anyone else , which is why conventional explosives , not exotic weapons of mass destruction , will probably continue to be their primary weapon of choice .
“ The reality is that conventional weapons are easier to manufacture , transport , and detonate , ” says Acquista , a point graphically illustrated by the recent propane - based car - bomb attacks in the United Kingdom .
But let ’s imagine a worst - case scenario :
A particularly advanced terrorist group does manage to set off a dirty bomb , or a bioweapon begins to spread throughout the population .
The natural instinct — evacuate — may not be your best option , and in fact most Department of Homeland Security plans do not envision anything like attempting to evacuate an entire city except in the extremely unlikely event of the aftermath of an atomic bomb blast .
Mostly this is because these kinds of attacks are much more limited in their geographic impact than our fear would lead us to believe and also because evacuating cities quickly is very difficult , as was demonstrated by New Orleans and the Hurricane Katrina debacle .
Even on 9/11 , when the destruction was confined to a small area of Lower Manhattan , it took six to seven hours to evacuate around 400,000 commuters by boat .
With the subways out of commission , another 2.5 million Manhattan commuters made their way home as best they could , taking many hours in most cases and clogging bridges and roads .
Should the worst happen , unless your dwelling is in immediate danger , the best advice may be to ignore all the government - fueled drama and stay home , at least temporarily .
Following an atomic blast , for example , “ after seven days , the radiation goes down about 90 percent , ” says Acquista , making evacuation at that time much safer .
Acquista recommends sheltering underground in such a circumstance , which allows as much radiation as possible to be blocked by the ground and buildings above .
In the event of a chemical attack , though , he recommends staying indoors above­ground , because nerve agents are heavier than air and hence will accumulate in basements .
And although the suggestion that citizens keep duct tape and plastic sheeting on hand was much reviled when made in 2003 by then Secretary for Homeland Security Tom Ridge , Acquista believes it would be useful in a chemical attack to seal a refuge with tape and sheeting until the danger passes , because “ most chemicals dissipate very rapidly . ”
Homeland security , it seems , really does begin at home .
Natural pigments that give certain fruit and vegetables a rich red , purple or blue colour act as powerful anti-cancer agents , according to a study by American scientists .
The compounds , found in foods such as aubergines , red cabbage , elderberries and bilberries , restricted the growth of cancer cells and in some cases killed them off entirely , leaving healthy cells unharmed .
The study combined laboratory tests on human cancer cells with experiments on animals that were designed to see whether a diet rich in the foods made a difference to their risk of developing cancer .
Foods with the highest levels of the compounds were most effective at slowing cancer growth , with exotic purple corn and chokeberries stopping the growth of colon cancer cells and killing 20 % in lab tests .
Foods less enriched with the pigments , such as radishes and black carrots , slowed the growth of colon cancer cells by 50 % to 80 % .
The findings bring scientists closer to unravelling the key ingredients responsible for giving fruit and vegetables their cancer - fighting properties .
Because the pigments , which belong to a class of antioxidant compounds known as anthocyanins , are not easily absorbed by the bloodstream , they travel through the stomach to the gastrointestinal tract , where they are taken up by surrounding tissues .
Their survival through to the lower part of the intestine may be the key to their role in preventing cancers in the tract , the scientists believe .
Researchers led by Monica Giusti , an expert in plant nutrients at Ohio State University , extracted anthocyanins from a variety of exotic and more common fruits and vegetables that all had a deep red , blue or purple hue and added them to flasks containing a suspension of human colon cancer cells .
When the team calculated how much of each extract was needed to reduce cancer cell growth by 50 % , they found anthocyanin from purple corn to be the most potent .
Chokeberries and bilberries were nearly as effective , while radish anthocyanin required nine times as much - or 131 micrograms per millilitre of cancer cell solution to cut cell growth by half .
In a second study , the researchers fed rats with colon cancer a diet of anthocyanin extracts from bilberries and chokeberries , which are most often used as flavourings in jams and fruit drinks .
Colon tumours in the rats fell by 60 % to 70 % compared with a control group that were not given anthocyanin .
" These foods contain many compounds and we 're just starting to figure out what they are and which ones provide the best health effects , " said Dr Giusti .
" All fruits and vegetables that are rich in anthocyanins have compounds that can slow down the growth of colon cancer cells , whether in experiments in laboratory dishes or inside the body . "
The research was presented yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston .
The team are now investigating whether it is possible to modify the structure of the pigment compounds to make them even more potent .
Tentative results so far suggest that grafting an extra sugar or acid molecule to the anthocyanins improved their effectiveness .
The work is part of a long - term investigation aimed at a greater understanding of the 600 anthocyanins found in nature .
" We 're just beginning to scratch the surface of understanding how the body absorbs and uses these different structures , " Dr Giusti said .
In June , market researchers reported that sales of anthocyanin - rich blueberries had doubled in the past two years .
The berries joined a growing list of what associations marketing the products call " superfoods " , alongside oily fish , brazil nuts and tomatoes .
Anthocyanins have previously been linked to helping towards a healthy heart and with treating skin conditions .
A Montbello teenager who was gunned down while walking to a bus stop in Park Hill on Sunday night was killed because he had blue on his shirt – the victim of a random gang shooting , his family said Monday .
Seventeen - year - old Marcus Mason was walking with his girlfriend when he was shot several times in the back of the head by killers he did n’t know .
No words or dirty looks were exchanged , and Mason was not involved in gangs , his mother Josephine Baez said .
In fact , Mason , a senior at the Contemporary Learning Academy , was in the neighborhood to speak to a manager at a fast - food restaurant about a job , she said .
“ He had on a blue , black and white striped shirt and we believe that ’s why he was killed , ” Baez , 40 , said from her home , surrounded by grieving family and friends .
“ His girlfriend said they walked by two boys and one of them just turned around and shot Marcus in the back of the head three times .
It was a cowardly move . ”
No arrests had been made on Monday , and detectives were still determining whether the shooting was gang - related , Denver police spokesman John White said .
Police did not identify Mason as the victim of the homicide , but his family did , and a makeshift memorial of stuffed animals and a poster reading “ R.I.P. Marcus Mason ” was set up at the intersection , one block south of Martin Luther King Park .
Across the street was a Crime Stoppers poster asking anyone with information to call anonymously 720-913-7867 .
Neighborhood resident Marbella Bustos , 23 , witnessed the shooting and asserted that no words were exchanged and that it appeared to be random violence .
“ No one argued , no one said nothing , ” Bustos said .
“ I just saw one of the guys shoot that boy , and then he did n’t run or anything .
He just stood there for like 15 seconds over the boy and pointing his gun down at him and saying something .
Then he walked off down 36th . ”
Baez and her husband , Carlos Mason , were at the jazz concert in City Park when she spoke to her son by cellphone just minutes before he was murdered .
“ That neighborhood is just out of control , ” Baez said .
“ You ca n’t even have blue on your shirt , you ca n’t even ride a bicycle that ’s blue ; you have to spray paint it or it could get you killed . ”
Marcus Mason dreamed of being a music producer and planned on entering his school ’s music program .
He also played football and basketball .
He was chubby most of his life .
As an infant , he fell out of a window , and doctors told his family the only reason he survived was because he was such a fat little boy .
But within the past year he began to mature , his frame stretched and he stood 6 feet 2 inches – tall like his dad .
“ I would have liked to spend more time with my son and helped him follow his dreams , ” Carlos Mason , 39 , said .
“ This is just senseless , senseless . ”
His cherubic cheeks and smile lit up a room , family friend Renee Del Castillo said .
“ He encouraged other kids younger than him to work hard in school , and he even made time to play with my 9 - year - old , ” Del Castillo said .
“ The world lost a really good heart in that kid . ”
Staff writer Manny Gonzales can be reached at 303-954-1537 or mgonzales@denverpost.com .
To help out
Funeral arrangements for Marcus Mason are pending .
A fund is being set up in his name at Horizon Bank outlets to assist his family .

If someone used their political position to alter English grammar , would it work ?
If that sentence bothered you , then the answer is yes .
You see , for most of the existence of the English language , ‘ they ’ was used as the accepted singular gender - neutral pronoun .
The use of ‘ it ’ was reserved for objects , as it is today , but for people the pronoun of choice was they / their / them .
So how did this all change ?
Courtesy of the English Parliament .
In the middle 1700 ’s a fad was conceived for prescriptive grammars – books that laid out the laws of grammar and told people what was wrong and what was right .
It started with one Robert Lowth – later to become Bishop of London – who wrote a little book entitled “ Short Introduction to English Grammar ” .
Many of our classical grammar rules stem from that little volume .
The rule against splitting infinitives , for example , stems from Mr. Lowth ’s love of Latin .
In Latin , since the infinitive of the verb is one word rather than two , it is impossible to split an infinitive .
In English it ’s a common way to speak .
“ To boldly go … ”
However , Mr. Lowth did not cause the fall of ‘ they ’ as the singular gender - neutral pronoun .
At least not directly .
It was twenty years after the publication of Lowth ’s book in 1761 that Sir Charles Coote wrote an expansion on the original volume and added his own preference for using ‘ he’ , ‘ him ’ , and ‘ his ’ as the generic pronoun .
That expanded book was used as a school text , and the usage became more prevalent , especially among the upper classes , where using the rules of the latinate texts was considered more refined , as opposed to the “ coarse ” language of the middle and lower classes .
The capper came in 1850 when the English Parliament became involved .
They turned Sir Charles ’s preference into law .
“ … words importing the male gender shall be deemed and taken to include females . ”
Which sounds like a very inclusive way to run a language .
Except that Parliament felt free to ignore their ruling when it came to issues like suffrage .
So rather than including women in laws written for men , the effect of the ruling was to eliminate the true gender - neutral pronoun .
Their enforcement of this rule in legal documents and contracts ensured that the usage spread , not only throughout England , but to other English - speaking countries as well .
Now , of course , awareness of gender bias in language has become prevalent , and the popularity of ‘ he ’ as a gender - neutral pronoun is fading .
Odd constructs like ‘ s / he ’ , or ‘ hir ’ , are being tried in various contexts with greater or lesser success .
The lack of a true gender - neutral pronoun in English is decried repeatedly .
Yet at the same time , many people do use ‘ they ’ quite unconsciously when speaking or writing , and are generally scolded for it by those who still follow prescriptive grammar rules .
Which only deepens the irony of realizing that we would already have what we need – if we were only willing to embrace what we threw away over 150 years ago .
Atty . Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales acknowledged for the first time Thursday that U.S. attorneys might have resigned under pressure from the Justice Department , but said their departures were unrelated to the controversial firings of eight prosecutors last year .
In an often - testy House Judiciary Committee hearing , Democrats sought to expand their inquiry beyond the eight prosecutors to broader questions about political interference in Justice Department cases .
But Gonzales calmly deflected most of their questions .
And unlike the bipartisan grilling he endured in the Senate last month , several Republicans came to his defense , indicating that Gonzales may have passed the worst of the crisis that put his job in jeopardy .
Democrats pressed him on recent revelations about an exodus of federal prosecutors , in some cases in battleground states central to Republican political fortunes .

Gonzales confirmed the resignation last year of Todd P. Graves , the former U.S. attorney in Kansas City , Mo . But he denied charges by Democrats that Graves had been forced out for balking at a voter fraud lawsuit pushed by the Justice Department .
Gonzales said the department had “ issues ” with another U.S. attorney , Thomas Heffelfinger of Minneapolis , whose resignation last year has touched off an office coup of sorts aimed at his successor .
Gonzales also addressed the resignation last year of Debra Wong Yang , the former U.S. attorney in Los Angeles .
Responding to suggestions that Yang was eased out with a lucrative private - sector job offer to take the heat off Republicans who were being investigated in Southern California , Gonzales said Yang ’s resignation was “ entirely voluntary ” and for reasons he understood to be personal and financial .

The daylong hearing produced some revelations , including the fact that the Justice Department and White House aides behind the firings had once considered targeting the U.S. attorney in Milwaukee , Steven Biskupic .
The prosecutor was spared , according to documents released at the hearing , because of concern that his firing would alienate Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. ( R - Wis. ) , who was seen as a supporter of Biskupic .
Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - Wis. ) suggested that Biskupic had succumbed to Republican pressure to bring a corruption case against a state purchasing official who worked for the Democratic governor -- a case that was tossed out by a judge .
Gonzales defended the case , noting that some Democrats in Wisconsin had backed it .

Democrats , unable to get answers to many of their questions , at times were angry and attacked Gonzales ’ competence .
When the attorney general could provide no details on how his former top aide , D. Kyle Sampson , had assembled the list of U.S. attorneys to be fired , Rep. John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said : “ Tell me , just tell me how the U.S. attorney termination list came to be and who suggested putting most of these U.S. attorneys on the list and why .
Now , that should take about three sentences . ”
Gonzales said that Sampson “ presented to me what I understood to be the consensus recommendation ” of the Justice Department ’s “ senior leadership . ”
“ OK , in other words , you do n’t know , ” Conyers replied .
Advertisement
Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - Fla. ) was incredulous that Gonzales “ wo n’t tell us who made the recommendation ” to fire the prosecutors .
“ Are you the attorney general ?
Do you run the Department of Justice ? ” asked Wexler , raising his voice in irritation .
Gonzales responded that “ out of respect for the integrity of this investigation , ” he had not spoken to the people who might know the answer .
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla . ) quizzed Gonzales about voter fraud in her state .
She was angry that the administration had focused on a few cases but did not pursue broader corruption that would have targeted both political parties .
Advertisement
Gonzales said investigating voter fraud was “ important to the administration , ” but he could not recall the cases she cited .
At that , the lawmaker erupted .
“ I ’ve had a hard time today trying to figure out what you do know , ” she said .
Several Republicans came to the defense of Gonzales , who seemed more relaxed than he did before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 19 .
“ The list of accusations has mushroomed , but the evidence of wrongdoing has not , ” said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the committee ’s senior Republican .
“ If there are no fish in this lake , we should reel in our lines of questions , dock our empty boat and turn to more pressing issues . ”
Advertisement
Gonzales disputed reports that Graves , the former U.S. attorney in Kansas City , was asked to leave in January 2006 .
Graves has said that he believes he was forced out for not backing a voter fraud lawsuit against Missouri -- a suit launched by his successor but dismissed by the courts .
“ I have no basis to believe that case had anything to do with Mr. Graves ’ departure , ” Gonzales said .
Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - Minn. ) , whose district includes Minneapolis , questioned the attorney general about three veteran supervisors in the U.S. attorney ’s office there who have publicly clashed with their boss , Rachel Paulose .
Advertisement
Paulose , a young lawyer , was sent from Washington to Minneapolis to replace veteran prosecutor Heffelfinger , whom Gonzales said “ was identified as someone perhaps we might have issues with . ”
Gonzales conceded that there were problems with Paulose ’s leadership , and that a Justice Department official from Washington had been sent to Minneapolis to sort out why the U.S. attorney was so disliked .
Gonzales was asked whether Paulose would remain as the top prosecutor in Minneapolis .
“ If things do not change , that is something we would have to consider , ” he said .
Advertisement
Heffelfinger , who has said that his decision to leave was his own and that he had no indication that the Justice Department was dissatisfied with his performance , said Thursday that he was “ pleased to hear they ’re concerned about the situation ” in Minneapolis and that corrective steps were being taken .

Dick Cheney Eloquently Explains Why Invading Iraq Would Be A Horrible Idea
How have I missed this before ?
I 'd heard of it , but never ever seen it .
Transcript below , but you really need to watch it to get the full effect .
( via unfogged )
• • •
Q : Do you think the U.S. , or U.N. forces , should have moved into Baghdad ?
CHENEY : No .
Q : Why not ?
CHENEY : Because if we 'd gone to Baghdad we would have been all alone .
There would n't have been anybody else with us .
There would have been a U.S. occupation of Iraq .
None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq .
Once you got to Iraq and took it over , took down Saddam Hussein 's government , then what are you going to put in its place ?
That 's a very volatile part of the world , and if you take down the central government of Iraq , you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off -- part of it the Syrians would like to have to the west , part of eastern Iraq the Iranians would like to claim , fought over it for eight years .
In the north you 've got the Kurds , and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey , then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey .
It 's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq .
The other thing was casualties .
Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had .
But for the 146 Americans killed in action , and for their families , it was n't a cheap war .
And the question for the president , in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad , took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein , was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth ?
Our judgment was , not very many , and I think we got it right .
ABDOMINAL surgery is a radical way of losing weight , but could it also cure type 2 diabetes ?
Duodenal exclusion is a form of gastric bypass surgery in which the upper small intestine or duodenum is removed , so that the stomach feeds directly into the mid-small intestine .
This reduces the amount of time the body has to absorb calories from food , meaning people lose weight .
Surgeons performing duodenal exclusions on obese people with diabetes had noticed that in around 98 per cent of cases the patients ’ diabetes spontaneously vanished a few weeks after surgery – too soon to be accounted for by weight loss .
Now a team of Italian , Brazilian and French doctors has performed duodenal exclusions on seven people with type 2 diabetes who were classified as normal weight to moderately obese , to see if it has a similar effect .
Nine months after surgery , the first two people they operated on are both free of anti-diabetic medication .
Both experienced dramatic reductions in their blood sugar and insulin levels in the month following surgery – before any weight loss took place ( Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases , DOI : 10.1016/j.soard.2007.01.009 ) .
It is too soon to report on the other five patients .
Type 2 , or adult - onset , diabetes is characterised by insulin resistance .
This means the body can produce insulin – which would normally encourage liver and muscle cells to take up glucose from the blood – but cells no longer respond to it .
Francesco Rubino , a surgeon at the Catholic University of Rome , Italy , who was involved in the study , believes that the duodenum may be the source of a signal that can ultimately cause insulin resistance .
“ This molecular signal , which should be secreted in response to nutrients ’ passage , is possibly exaggerated in diabetic patients or produced in an untimely fashion , disturbing the regulation of insulin and blood glucose levels , ” says Rubino , who will present his results at a meeting of the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity in Porto , Portugal , next week .
If his assumption is correct , bypassing the duodenum could silence this “ insulin resistance signal ” , thus re-establishing a normal balance between insulin and sugar .
Previous studies in rats have shown that the effects of duodenal exclusion on diabetes are independent of the amount of food eaten by the rats , suggesting that dietary changes are not responsible for the improvement .
Conversely , people who do not have diabetes but undergo gastric bypass surgery for peptic ulcers or cancer , say , often see a deterioration in their glucose control , reinforcing the idea that the duodenum is involved in maintaining normal glucose levels , Rubino says .
Until recently , the pancreas was believed to be the key player in glucose regulation .
According to Rubino , duodenal exclusions in people with diabetes who are not morbidly obese have also been performed by groups in Mexico , Peru , Dominican Republic and India with similar outcomes , although the results have not been published .
Clinical trials are now starting in some of these countries , as well as in China , Japan , the US , Italy and Belgium .
While it may be five years before we have a clear idea of exactly who should undergo surgery , Rubino and several other doctors have already submitted a proposal to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ( AACE ) , suggesting it recommends the use of duodenal exclusion surgery to treat type 2 diabetes .
Richard Hellmann , president of the AACE , says the association is studying the evidence , but has not yet reached a decision .
“ Diabetes surgery may be an interesting option for some patients , but there are n’t yet any long - term data on its benefits and risks in large numbers of people , ” he says .
He adds that treatments already exist for diabetes that may be much safer , as well as far less expensive .
However , current treatments rarely cause complete remission of diabetes , Rubino says .
For the time being , Tracy Kelly of Diabetes UK stresses that the key ways to manage and possibly prevent type 2 diabetes are by eating a healthy balanced diet and taking regular exercise .

Story Highlights • Speaker plans meeting with Syrian president during Middle East trip
• Syria interfering in Lebanon and Iraq , administration says
• Congressional leader 's visit sends wrong message , White House says
• Pelosi to address Israel 's Knesset on Sunday ; rest of itinerary secret
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House has criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's plans to stop in Syria next week during a Middle East trip that began Friday .
She will be the highest - ranking U.S. official to visit Syria since relations deteriorated between Damascus and Washington .
The United States has accused Syria of aiding the Sunni insurgency in western Iraq with weapons and fighters .
Syria also is accused of supporting the militant extremist groups Hezbollah , a Shiite political party and militia , and Hamas .
" We do not encourage and , in fact , we discourage members of Congress to make such visits to Syria , " said White House deputy spokeswoman Dana Perino .
" This is a country that is a state sponsor of terror , one that is trying to disrupt the ( Prime Minister Fouad ) Siniora government in Lebanon and one that is allowing foreign fighters to flow through its borders to Iraq .
" I do n't know what she is trying to accomplish , and I do n't know if anyone in the administration has spoken to her about it , " Perino said .
" In general , we do discourage such trips . "
Responding to a follow - up question , Perino added , " We think that someone should take a step back and think about the message that it sends ... to our allies . "
Pelosi is scheduled to meet with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad next weekend while in Damascus , according to Imad Moustapha , Syria 's ambassador to the United States .
She will be the highest - ranking American to meet with a Syrian president since then - President Clinton met with the late Syrian President Hafez al - Assad in 1994 .
Pelosi is expected to address Israel 's Knesset on Sunday .
Further details of the trip -- her second to the region as speaker of the House -- were withheld for security reasons , her office said .
A statement from Pelosi 's spokesman , Brendan Daly , said : " As recommended by the Iraq Study Group , a bipartisan delegation led by Speaker Pelosi intends to discuss a wide range of security issues affecting the United States and the Middle East with representatives of governments in the region , including Syria . "
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the administration has advised members of Congress that " it 's not the right time to have those high - profile visitors to Syria . "
However , McCormack said the State Department provided Pelosi with a briefing , and that the U.S. Embassy in Damascus has said it would help if needed .
Late last year , Democratic U.S. Sens. John Kerry and Christopher Dodd , both senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , met with Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad and challenged his government to play a more constructive role in the region .
Wal - Mart Gets Religious - Toys ,
That Is Faith - based toys are about to hit the shelves of the world 's largest retailer .
July 16 , 2007  -- Wal - Mart is about to bring religion to the toy aisle .
Early next month , 425 Wal - Mart stores nationwide will begin carrying faith - based toys from One2 believe that target parents who would rather that their kids play with a Samson action figure than a Spider - Man action figure .
It 's the first time the world 's largest retailer has carried a full line of religious toys .
" We 're seeing interest from parents in faith - enriching toys , " says Melissa O'Brien , a Wal - Mart spokeswoman .
Religious products have become a multibillion - dollar business , and the toy move comes as it targets a younger audience .
Fox recently created FoxFaith , a 20th Century Fox unit to distribute family movies with Christian themes .
In January , Universal Pictures will release The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything - A VeggieTales Movie , based on the spiritual characters by Big Idea .
But until now , most faith - based toys have sold successfully only in specialty religious stores , not at mass - market retailers , warns Jim Silver , editor of Toy Wishes magazine .
" Once children turn 4 , parents tend to get them what they want .
And right now , kids are asking for Transformers . "
About one - sixth of Wal - Mart 's 3,300 stores will carry the One2 believe line , which will get 2 feet of toy aisle shelf space , says O'Brien .
One way Wal - Mart decided where to carry them , she says : Stores that sell a lot of Bibles will carry the new line .
" We view this as an opportunity to reach that audience , " she says .
But one religious leader does not consider Wal - Mart in the fold .
" They 'll carry anything that sells , " says David Croyle , president of FamilyLife , a non-denominational ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ .
" This simply signals intelligent buying within Wal - Mart . "
For David Socha , CEO of One2believe , it 's a dream come true .
" Our goal is to give the faith - based community an alternative to Bratz dolls and Spider - Man , " he says .
The toys are based on biblical stories .
For example , there 's a set of 3 - inch figures based on Daniel in the lion 's den for about $ 7 .
A 12 - inch talking Jesus doll is about $ 15 .
And 14 - inch Samson or Goliath action figures are about $ 20 .
The toys target kids from pre-school to age 12 , he says , and also are sold online at one2believe.com .
Since 9/11 , there 's been a surge in faith - based products , says Bob Starnes , vice president of licensing at Big Idea , the firm behind VeggieTales .
That 's because most Americans have a " faith perspective , " he says .
Laurie Schacht , president of The Toy Book , a toy industry publication , says some parents also are dissatisfied with toys from conventional toymakers : " There are a lot of wild things out there .
Parents want to give kids wholesomeness . "
Batman drove high - performance cars since his debut , but the term " Batmobile " did n't appear until nearly four years later in February 1941 's Detective Comics # 48 .
The car that first used the name was unlike later cars : this one was a bright red convertible that lacked fins , shields , or any other " bat " theme save for a small gold hood ornament .
It did , however , sport a supercharged engine capable of tremendous speeds and a heavily reinforced nose capable of smashing through buildings without suffering any damage .
The bulk of the design was based on the Cord 812 , a revolutionary design that featured America 's first front - wheel drive design with independent front suspension , a 185HP V8 , a semi-automatic transmission with overdrive , retractable headlights , variable - speed wipers , and a sleek , low - slung body ( including fully hidden door and trunk hinges ) .
The set back engine meant that there was ample space between the front of the car and the front of the engine , an ideal place for Batman to add the " battering ram " nose without risking damage to the car 's mechanical components .

For a split second , you were so afraid that you reacted as if your life were in danger , your body initiating the fight - or - flight response that is critical to any animal 's survival .
But really , there was no danger at all .
What happened to cause such an intense reaction ?
What exactly is fear ?
In this article , we 'll examine the psychological and physical properties of fear , find out what causes a fear response and look at some ways you can defeat it .
What is Fear ?
Fear is a chain reaction in the brain that starts with a stressful stimulus and ends with the release of chemicals that cause a racing heart , fast breathing and energized muscles , among other things , also known as the fight - or - flight response .
The stimulus could be a spider , a knife at your throat , an auditorium full of people waiting for you to speak or the sudden thud of your front door against the door frame .
­ ­The brain is a profoundly complex organ .
More than 100 billion nerve cells comprise an intricate network of communications that is the starting point of everything we sense , think and do .
Some of these communications lead to conscious thought and action , while others produce autonomic responses .
The fear response is almost entirely autonomic :
We do n't consciously trigger it or even know what 's going on until it has run its course .
Because cells in the brain are constantly transferring information and triggering responses , there are dozens of areas of the brain at least peripherally involved in fear .
But research has discovered that certain parts of the brain play central roles in the process :
" "
Thalamus - decides where to send incoming sensory data ( from - decides where to send incoming sensory data ( from eyes , ears , mouth , skin )
Sensory cortex - interprets sensory data
Hippocampus - stores and retrieves conscious memories ; processes sets of stimuli to establish context
Amygdala - decodes emotions ; determines possible threat ; stores fear memories
Hypothalamus - activates " fight or flight " response
­ T­he process of creating fear begins with a scary stimulus and ends with the fight - or - flight response .
But there are at least two paths between the start and the end of the process .
In the next section , we 'll take a closer look at how fear is created .
Bush prepares new Iraq escalation as congressional Democrats blather on
By Patrick Martin
18 July 2007
As Senate Democratic leaders moved Tuesday to stage an all - night session devoted to votes on supposedly “ anti- war ” measures that have no chance of passage , the Bush administration has dropped a series of hints that it plans to intensify rather than reduce the violence in Iraq .
Bush called in a hand - picked group of right - wing columnists and commentators to the White House Friday , telling them to put no stock in press reports that the White House was contemplating a change in policy on the war .
According to a report in National Review Online by Kate O’Beirne and Rich Lowry , two of those invited , “ Forget the leaks and the speculation , President George W. Bush is not looking for a way out of the surge and the Iraq war . ”
“ A confident and determined president made it clear that he is going to see the surge through , and will rely on General David Petraeus ’s advice on how to proceed come September , regardless of the political climate in Washington , ” they wrote .
Conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks , another invited guest , suggested in his column July 17 that further escalation of the surge might be in order : “ Bush was assertive , ” he wrote , “ he is unshakably committed to stabilizing Iraq .
If Gen. David Petraeus comes back and says he needs more troops and more time , Bush will scrounge up the troops . ”
This suggestion was reinforced by the comments of Gen. Peter Pace , the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , during a visit to Baghdad Monday .
Pace declared that the surge had produced a “ sea change ” in security conditions in Iraq .
According to an Associated Press report , “ Pace said earlier in Baghdad that the US military is continuing various options for Iraq , including an even bigger troop buildup if President Bush thinks his ‘ surge ’ strategy needs a further boost . ”
Pace told reporters that the military “ must be prepared for whatever it ’s going to look like two months from now .
That way , if we need to plus up or come down ” in troop numbers , the necessary operational plans will be in place .
These comments give the lie to claims by congressional Democratic leaders that they are waging an all - out battle that is pushing the Republican Party and the Bush administration toward withdrawal from Iraq .
The House of Representatives passed a resolution late Friday , by a near - party - line vote of 223 to 205 , for a measure to require US combat troops to begin coming home within 120 days of passage of the legislation , with most to be removed by April 1 , 2008 .
The bill permits tens of thousands of US troops to remain in occupation of the country , so long as their mission is defined as to combat terrorism , train Iraqi soldiers and defend US installations .
All members of the “ Out of Iraq ” caucus , numbering about 80 Democrats , voted for the bill , which would legitimize the open - ended US occupation of Iraq , with the exception of congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich .
Four Republicans voted for the bill , while nine conservative Democrats voted against it .
Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have already foresworn the only effective legislative measure against the war — a cutoff of funding — in favor of resolutions that either will be vetoed without possibility of an override , like the House measure , or that will not even receive a vote , as in the Senate , where most Republicans are committed to filibuster any restriction on the Bush administration ’s war policy .
Despite claims by Harry Reid that he was stepping up the pressure for a withdrawal of US forces in Iraq , the Tuesday all - nighter is merely a protest stunt that the Democrats hope will make them appear to oppose the war , while allowing the bloodbath to continue , and even escalate further .
Only three Senate Republicans have agreed to back the principal Democratic amendment to the defense appropriations bill , drafted by Carl Levin of Michigan and Jack Reed of Rhode Island , which mirrors the bill passed by the House Friday .
With at least one Democrat , “ independent ” Joseph Lieberman , committed to all - out support for the White House on the war , at least ten Republicans would have to defect to halt a filibuster and compel a vote .
Majority Leader Reid reiterated his intention to keep the legislative farce going as long as possible .
“ We ’re going to continue working on this until we get a vote on this amendment , ” he said .
“ It ’s unfortunate that President Bush has proven , beyond any doubt , that he wo n’t listen to the Congress or the American people unless he ’s forced to , and that ’s what this amendment does . ”
The Senate is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the Levin - Reed amendment , and perhaps later in the week on two others : a bipartisan measure , drafted by Democrat Ken Salazar of Colorado and Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , to adopt the Iraq Study Group recommendations as official policy ; and the proposal offered by two pillars of the Republican Senate establishment , John Warner of Virginia and Richard Lugar of Indiana , which would require Bush to carry out advance planning for a troop withdrawal , but would not mandate the removal of a single soldier .
As the charade continues , there has been increasing commentary in the media about the congressional Democratic leadership being in danger of alienating public opinion , which is far more hostile to the continuation of the war than anyone in the Senate .
A commentary in Time magazine , headlined , “ The Iraq Debate That Wasn’t , ” began by noting that most Americans were being given the impression there is a congressional debate over the war , but in reality , both sides support a continuing long - term US military occupation of Iraq .
The magazine observed :
“ Even if the Democrats ’ position is not in fact that far from where the President claims to be headed , both sides are portraying the gap between them as unbridgeable .
Which , in turn , leaves the impression that the debate is between those who want to escalate the war and those who want to withdraw US forces entirely ...
If you ’re looking for someone who will lead a speedy withdrawal from Iraq , you ’ll have to go to the extreme left or right of the parties .
Nobody in the mainstream is looking to get out soon . ”
There are , of course , intense and bitter conflicts over Iraq policy , between the Democrats and Republicans and within both parties .
These conflicts revolve around two issues : what methods should be employed to salvage what can be saved from the wreckage of the Bush administration ’s reckless policy ; and who will pay the political price for the debacle .
But no significant section of the US political establishment , in either party , supports an abandonment of the effort to dominate the oil fields of the Middle East and gain a decisive strategic advantage over rival capitalist powers like China , Russia and the European Union .
Energy :
If people object to wind farms cluttering up the countryside , one answer might be to put them in the air instead
IF IT ever seems windy where you live , be thankful that you do not live ten kilometres ( six miles ) up in the air .
At that height the jet - stream winds are stronger and blow more consistently than ground - level winds , and they carry up to a hundred times more energy .
So just as oil companies are drilling deeper and in more remote locations in search of new reserves , pioneer wind - power engineers are looking higher in the sky for new sources of energy .
Conventional turbines will not take them there — the tallest to date is just over 200 metres tall .
Instead they are trying to invent a whole new technology for harvesting wind : electricity generators that fly .
One of the most ambitious ideas has been developed by Sky WindPower , a company based in San Diego and led by Dave Shepard .
He began his career cracking Japanese military codes during the second world war , then developed machines for reading written text .
His work led to the squared - off numbers still seen on bank cards today .
Mr Shepard 's flying generator looks like a cross between a kite and a helicopter .
It has four rotors at the points of an H - shaped frame that is tethered to the ground by a long cable .
The rotors act as the surface of a kite does , providing the lift needed to keep the platform in the air .
As they do so , they also turn dynamos that generate electricity .
This power is transmitted to the ground through aluminium cables .
Should there be a lull in the wind , the dynamos can be used in reverse as electric motors , to keep the generator airborne .
Mr Shepard estimates these rigs could produce power for as little as two cents per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) .
That is cheaper than the three to five cents conventional energy generation costs .
It is an attractive idea , but a flying generator is a difficult thing to build — and there is a limit to how helpful existing helicopter technology will be .
Aircraft require maintenance after a few days of operation , if not sooner .
To operate cost - effectively , wind turbines will need to keep turning for many months without upkeep .
Mr Shepard , however , thinks he has a way out .
Stabilising and directing a conventional helicopter requires that the pitch of the individual blades be adjusted with every rotation — up to a thousand times a minute .
That puts massive stress on the turning mechanism and wears it out rapidly .
With a four - rotor arrangement , you can achieve the same effect by changing the pitch of one or two whole rotors , rather than adjusting the pitch of individual blades .
Mr Shepard reckons this will make a big difference and will increase the periods between maintenance enough to make the project viable .
Exploiting the jet stream represents the zenith ( literally and figuratively ) of aerial wind - engineers ' ambitions .
Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution who has worked with Sky WindPower , estimates that harvesting just 1 % of its energy would produce enough power for everybody on the planet .
But even at lower altitudes , the winds are stronger than they are at the surface , and that has attracted the attention of other inventors .
In Canada a company called Magenn Power has developed a proposal for a wind generator filled with helium .
It turns around a horizontal axis , rather like a water mill , and could fly at an altitude of up to 1 km .
The firm sees its system as an alternative to diesel generators in remote locations where ground - level wind is insufficient for a normal windmill .
Meanwhile , Wubbo Ockels of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has been developing another approach to airborne wind generation at lower altitude , with backing from Royal Dutch Shell , an oil giant , and Nederlandse Gasunie , a natural - gas company .
Dr Ockels 's idea is to launch a kite ( without rotor blades ) from a ground station , turning a generator as it rises to an altitude of several hundred metres .
When it reaches its maximum altitude the kite alters its shape to catch less wind , and can thus be reeled back in using much less energy than it produced when it was being paid out .
An arrangement of two or more of these kites could act together to produce a steady supply of power .
While one kite was being released , some of the electricity produced would be used to reel another kite back in , and vice versa .
This system has the advantage that it requires only simple parts — generators , kites and cables — and should therefore be much cheaper to build than a conventional wind turbine .
Controlling it , however , would be a different matter .
Dr Ockels is working on kites with wings and rudders , which look much more like planes than anything you might see flying in the park .
The wings and rudders themselves would be under computer control — the technology is already well established for flying aircraft without a human pilot .
To test the idea Dr Ockels 's team is building a 100 - kilowatt prototype .
He hopes to start testing a full - scale device , which would generate 10 megawatts , within five years .
That would be enough to power around 6,000 homes .
He believes it should be possible to generate electricity at a cost of just 1 cent per kWh .
Any promise of such cheap energy has to be treated with scepticism and all these projects are still a long way from the full - scale test rigs needed to prove they will succeed .
No one denies that it will be hard to build a flying generator that can make money .
However , the political impetus behind renewable energy is growing and space is limited at ground level .
Perhaps it is time for the wind - power industry to reach for the sky .
Even If You Curse the War , You Can Still Help the Warriors
A few months back I met a remarkable man named Gene Sit .
He is a money manager in Minneapolis , with more than $ 6 billion under management , but that is not what makes him remarkable .
He was born to a wealthy family in late 1930s China and , in the lawless years after World War II , was kidnapped and held for ransom by gangsters , but that is not what makes him remarkable .
After his family lost its fortune , he came to the U.S. in 1948 , not knowing a word of English .
He proceeded to study accounting and finance and work his way up a few corporate ladders before founding his own firm , but that is not what makes him remarkable .
What makes him remarkable is that he took a look around at the Minnesota soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and felt they were badly in need of appreciation ( and , often , money ) , and decided to do something about it .
So in addition to his many other philanthropic ventures , Sit founded the Minnesotans ’ Military Appreciation Fund .
“ Our mission is twofold , ” he told me the other day .
“ One , to say thank you , and two , to provide financial assistance , in small amounts , to everybody from Minnesota who has served in combat since 9/11 . ”
So far the organization has raised $ 6 million and paid out $ 3 million to more than 4,500 soldiers or the families of soldiers killed in action .
The grants range from $ 500 to $ 10,000 , depending on the type of duty and need .
MMAF is a nonpartisan and apolitical group .
No matter how you feel about the war in Iraq , Sit figured , it was terrible to watch soldiers coming home to Minnesota , especially the reservists and Guard members , with so little support , financial and otherwise .
“ One young widow just wrote to me , ” Sit said , “ to say that she buried her husband and she used our money to pay for the funeral . ”
I asked Sit why he formed MMAF .
Here ’s what he said : “ I just think that any well - informed individual who is patriotic and who ’s been given a lot , when they learn about the sacrifices done by these very few on our behalf — I think we have the responsibility to step up and do what I did . ”
I agree with Sit : regardless of your position on U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan , it certainly seems an honorable and decent thing to make life a little easier for the people who have been pulling the hard duty .
Even the fortunate soldiers who are n’t wounded or killed come home to a pile of bills at the very least .
An MMAF grant can knock out a few months of mortgage payments , which makes a huge difference .
When he had the idea to start the fund a few years ago , Sit figured he would borrow the organizational template of some other state ’s soldier - appreciation fund , but he found that no such thing existed .
So he created the template himself .
Then he waited for other states to take advantage of his work and set up similar funds .
To date , he said , not a single state has followed , even though Sit had the governor of Minnesota write to the other 49 governors to encourage them to do so .
There are n’t many reasons I can think of not to endorse
Sit ’s idea – except , perhaps , if you are strongly anti-war and think that such a fund might make it more politically palatable to prolong the war , since returning soldiers do n’t have it so bad .
But even if that unintended consequence were real , I doubt the effect would be very strong .
And even if you curse the war , you can still help the warrior .
Sit was “ very disappointed , ” he told me , that no other states have set up funds similar to the MMAF , and I do n’t blame him .
Just because a paid - volunteer army is better than a drafted one from an economist ’s perspective does n’t mean that the system is optimal .
While I do n’t have the talent or experience to set up such a fund for New York State soldiers , I ’ll gladly write a $ 5,000 check to anyone who ’s willing to do so .
Levitt will do the same for an Illinois fund .
Gene
Sit ’s organization is happy to help other states set up similar funds .

One was sacked and two resigned after managers at Neath Port Talbot Council found some staff were spending up to two hours a day on the website .
Union officials have blamed bosses for " putting temptation in their way " - by allowing access to the internet .
The council said it carried out an investigation after officials spent a " significant time " on the internet .
It said another two cases were being investigated while another member of staff had been given a warning .
Union officials said in all , over an 18 month period , up to six council staff had lost their jobs .

The council highlighted " an unacceptable level of usage of shopping , entertainment " .
Graham Jones , personnel chief at the council , said : " We have a policy of allowing employees to use the internet in their own time .
" But we clearly do n't want them to use it in council time - at the end of the day they are employed to do a job of work not be shopping online . "
The council , which employs 7,500 staff , had security software in place to prevent access to inappropriate websites such as porn sites but not eBay sites .
Andrew Woodman , regional organiser for Unison said they had asked for an urgent review .
" The council have gone completely over the top on this issue .
The internet is part of our working lives , whether we like it or not . "
Unison welfare officer Mark Fisher said people got " addicted " to certain websites .
" People get very involved in eBay , Sky Sports and their favourite soccer teams .
It happens in many , many offices , " he said .
The council has software to prevent staff accessing some sites
" We plan to push for the authority to make changes to its IT system , to help prevent workers landing themselves in hot water . "
He called for internet access be limited to lunch break and that web access should be filtered at other times .
' Constant problem '
" We want them to take temptation out of people 's hands , " Mr Fisher said .
" These were decent well - paid jobs in admin earning between £ 20,000 and £ 25,000 a year .
" It is personally devastating to them to lose their jobs over this . "
Employment solicitor Bethan Darwin , of Cardiff - based Darwin Gray Solicitors , said she regularly advised on excessive use of the internet which was a " constant problem for all employers " .
She said some policies for companies also concerned the use of telephones for personal calls , mobile telephones and e-mail , and had become more commonplace in the last five years .
Ms Darwin said : " Technology is changing all the time , consequently workplace policies and procedures have to change alongside those developments . "

14 . Chopped Liver
I was not raised by daring Jews .
Nor were they brainy and accomplished .
This Junior of Zion was saddled with no family legacy of piety , wisdom , or Talmudic scholarship .
My people were chosen for bubkes , peasants in both countries , Old and New .
I 'll tell you what we had :
We had chopped liver .
Hankering to defy death ?
Try schmaltz , hard - boiled eggs , organ meat , and onions , all ground to a coarse pâté , thumbed up from the bowl on thick heels of seeded rye .
Add salt .
Then we 'll speak of risky feats and cardiologic derring - do .
Its earthy serf - feed roots are blatant -- no one ever kvetched , " What am I , beluga ? " -- and yet chopped liver lives on as a great delicacy savored wherever Jews gather to fress like chozzerim -- which is , quite frankly , how Jews love to eat .
The last platter I devoured -- airy , creamy , nothing that my thick - fingered Bubbe would have recognized -- was floating on a bed of lettuce in a poyer - free deli in Beverly Hills .
It certainly was n't bad -- gehakteh leber simply can't be bad -- but it was n't Gram's .

Especially from the top of the Parque Central hotel , rising high and new out of the nearruins , with its rooftop pool and bar and rich Germans browning in the last of the sun that 's been cooking the poor streetbounds since morning .
After dark , it 's easier to forget what surrounds you , because you can't see the poverty ; only the hotels stand out , like stars against the night , foreign currency having trumped the day 's electricity rations .
In the distance : the historic Hotel Nacional , where you wandered this afternoon on the lazy hunt for cigars .
Not Cohibas -- every fat - fuck turista down here smokes Cohibas -- but a box of Sancho Panzas , cheap and creamy and drawing enough heady smoke to begin choking out the last strains of ill feeling .
The rum assists -- in mojitos , drunk through straws stuck in a pile of wet sugar at the bottom -- as do the cheeseburgers , grind - house bloody , because there are no surgeons general to mind your store in Cuba .
Nobody cares if you die down here .
And at last , just now , spitting out the end of your night 's fourth cigar , ordering another rummy drink , your belly full and warm with still - kicking meat , you do n't care , either .

30 . Narco Diving
The Bahamian island of Andros is a sheer - walled skyscraper , lapped by the six - thousand - foot - deep Tongue of the Ocean , where a diver can kick out a few yards and fall right off the continental shelf .
While the abyss is free to all , Small Hope Bay Lodge offers a guided dive called Over the Edge of the Wall , down to 185 feet .
It 's not for the impulse - control challenged ; at that depth you will be thoroughly narced , as in nitrogen narcosis , the dreaded Rapture of the Deep .
Why one gas should produce euphoria and another mere unconsciousness is not easily explained .
But at about a hundred feet , a strange sea change begins to come over your brain , thanks to the increased partial pressure of nitrogen at depth .
The muted colors of dangling sponges and the melancholy shapes of massive plate corals leap out at you , laughing .
All at once , you 're in on the cosmic joke .
Truly , you are tiny , so freaking tiny , yet oceanic in your newfound wisdom .
All is one -- and then some !
Cap'n of the Good Skull Lollipop , you soar in space as you slowly fall , blessing basses and wrasses and intoxicating gases .
At last you touch down on a little sandy ledge , a catwalk worthy of the north face of the Eiger , overlooking blue - black inner space .
You may ask yourself , referencing the Talking Heads , How did I get here ?
And you may experience the profound confusion of an honest philosopher , which some people do not enjoy .
But Jerko -- it 's just scuba diving .
You 're only high , frying your synapses on pressurized dope .
Confusion and death await those who linger too long .
So do n't .
Head for the surface and you 'll come down as you go up , into the brilliant Bahamian light , no longer such a smarty - pants , perhaps , but still on vacation .

31 . Getting a Road Job
Sometime before you die , and potentially right before , you must enjoy a blow job while driving a car in excess of eighty miles per hour .
Everything about a blow job is better at high speed : the power , the thrill , the feeling you 're about to lose control and leave a memorable obituary .
A few caveats :
The interior design of automobiles has changed since my road - job days , and it seems like it would be impractical in these newfangled models with their obstructive cupholders .
It wo n't work in a Prius , for example , which is a damn shame , because imagine the self - satisfaction of zero- population - growth sex with low carbon emissions .
It would probably work in a Hummer .
Other considerations :
It works best in the Great Plains , where the highways are long and straight ; it 's safer , and more fun , in broad daylight , particularly if you slow down as you pass a truck ; and most important , drinking and driving and dunking do n't mix .
I can't recall exactly how you talk a woman into going down on you in a speeding car , though .
I think it 's mostly hand gestures .

32 . Carousing with the Mob
It happened one night in a bar near the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg , Russia .
I was researching a novel and found myself deep in conversation with a number of ballet dancers .
Do n't laugh .
Dancers drink .
Dancers smoke .
Dancers believe in the short life .
Two in the morning .
We had all been overserved .
It was time for one last song .
I closed my eyes and belted it out .
The bartender grabbed me by the shoulder .
" Shut up , " he said .
I 've heard the complaints before .
" Shut the fuck up , " he said .
" Look . "
I turned and saw a number of impeccably dressed men walking into the bar .
They were packing guns .
One of them stopped and stared at me .
It was as if all the oxygen was gone from the air .
They cased the bar and abruptly left .
I started singing again .
The bartender grabbed my arm .
Seconds later the real mob -- without their well - dressed bodyguards -- walked in : fat and unshaven and scruffy .
Each had a bouquet of beautiful women on his arm .
" Leave , " my ballet friends whispered .
" Leave now -- and quietly . "
I walked across the room .
I picked out the meanest fucker of them all and hunkered down beside him .
He looked as if he'd just strangled Vladimir Putin 's mistress .
There are times in life when we must throw out the anchor , even when it 's unattached to a rope .
" You want to hear an Irish song ? " I asked him .
He stared at me , his mouth quivering .
I was suddenly quite sober .
He took me by the collar .
I could feel my heart beating in my cheap white shirt .
He said nothing but slowly broke into a grin .
The drunk man often navigates by the stars beyond the ceiling .
Still to this day I cannot remember what song it was I sang , but I do recall that fifteen minutes later I was party to the spectacular sight of three great Kirov ballerinas dancing on the long wooden table of the Shamrock Irish Bar on Dekabristov Street , performing ballet moves with three very large Russian mafiosi , shots of vodka thrown back and forth , and the dancers outlasting them , and outcharming them , with ease .
As they left the bar -- it was five in the morning -- the Mafia leader put his arm around me and said that he would help me if ever I was in trouble .
" What do you do ? " I asked , trying hard to be naive .
He turned and looked me straight in the eye .
" I am . . . " he said , stumbling toward the door , " ... I am a Russian baby - sitter . "

33 . Drinking Alone
I know that everything I 'm about to say has already been said better by George Thorogood .
And listen , I aced health class back at Sedgwick Middle School , and so I know that drinking alone means you 're an alcoholic .
I know too that being an alcoholic is bad , that alcoholism turns you toothless and yellow and moaning in the dark .
Until I was thirty , my biggest fear was that I 'd end up drinking alone .
Like every day .
Like full - time .
But now I 'm thirty - five .
I 've got a nearly regular job .
I 'm married , and I 've got a daughter .
This means I 'm almost never alone .
And that 's great .
That 's the best thing that 's ever happened to an idiot like me .
And yet ... and yet ... I miss drinking alone .
I miss walking into a bar early and without intent .
I miss sitting there talking to no one .
I miss ordering a Harvey Wallbanger only because I 've never had a Harvey Wallbanger and because I might never summon the courage to order a Harvey Wallbanger in the company of others .
The more I think about it , my mistake was worrying too much about drinking alone .
I should 've drunk alone more often .
All the stupid things I 've done ... and no one to see me do them .
All the stupid things I 've said ... and no one to hear me say them .
Yeah , the drinking alone might end you early , but sometimes it sounds like heaven .

34 . Refried doughnuts .
When and where can one sample the unholy union of Krispy Kreme and hot bacon fat ?
In your kitchen , whenever you make one .
35 . Duck - fat potatoes .
• 1 pound small red new potatoes ( about 16 ) , with strip peeled around center
• 4 tablespoons duck fat ( $ 3 for 7 ounces ; specialty supermarket or dartagnan.com )
Over low heat , melt duck fat in deep skillet with tightly fitting lid .
Raise temperature to get hot .
Run potatoes under water , letting excess drain through colander .
Transfer to skillet ( water and hot fat create splatter but also cooking steam ; potatoes must be in one layer with enough room to roll around ) and quickly cover .
Shake pan slightly to coat potatoes and cook until deep golden and tender , about 18 minutes .
Season abundantly with coarse salt and ground black pepper and serve .

43 . A Home Firearm
My entire life is a series of hedged bets .
As the fifty - four - year - old dad of a seven - year - old , I take no uncalculated risks .
I do n't let the gas - gauge needle fall below the quarter - tank mark .
I set the ADT alarm every night .
You could not pay me to travel outside the northern half of the Western Hemisphere .
Everywhere lurks doom ; I acknowledge its inevitability by avoiding all danger at every turn .
When I can , I avoid turns .
I spent a long time living dangerously .
I was the guy they sent into the pharmacy with the forged quaalude prescription .
The guy who sold weed by the pound to the outlaw bikers .
The guy who ate ham - and - cheese sandwiches on Yom Kippur .
Now I 'm the guy who insists that his wife clean the dryer vent twice a year so the lint does n't catch fire .
Still , a few feet from where I now sit typing on the third floor of our home in a Garden State suburb of leafy calm sits my shotgun .
The safety 's on , but it is loaded .
I do n't hunt .
And though my penis would win no bar bets , the shotgun does n't make me feel larger .
It is what it is : the most fearsome , effective , legal home - protection device around .
Is it a danger to me and mine as well ?
Many studies say so , but I have n't seen a study yet that helps me get to sleep at night .
Call me crazy .
Call me an ugly American .
But do n't expect me to call 911 if you break into my house -- not till I 've blown your head and neck clean off your shoulders .

60 . Directing
A year ago , my twelve - year - old daughter , Chloe , was acting in my film RV .
After a long day , I said , " You know , Chloe , you 're painfully opinionated and you boss everyone around .
You should be a director . "
" No offense , Dad , but I 'll stick to being a movie star , " she said .
" Directing looks too stressful . "
On the first movie I directed , The Addams Family , I ended up fainting when , after a sleepless night , I thought I could maintain some sense of awareness the next day by drinking nine straight espressos .
When the head of Paramount Studios said that it was unreleasable , I spent the night weeping on Sweetie 's ( the wife 's ) lap .
During Men in Black II , I was raced to the hospital with what I thought was a heart attack .
After spending the night in the emergency room next to a woman whining , " I need quinine , " I was given an echocardiogram and told that I was simply suffering from stress and that I should get into a program of meditation .
( I did n't tell the doctor that I was meditating when the chest pain started . )
On Wild Wild West , I broke my hand in five places when I punched Will Smith 's arm .
So why direct ?
It 's the closest a guy like me will ever come to being a general .
I have a thought , and suddenly manly men are building gigantic sets .
Plus , being forced to make thousands of decisions a week on topics that you did n't know you were ever going to need to have an opinion about ( Lara Flynn Boyle 's girdle comes to mind ) is exhilarating .
I also get to send back cappuccinos because the foam looks too much like a latte and work with people smarter than me , who make me look good .
If every couple of years I have a psychological breakdown , well , at least I 've got a thick head of foam on my cappuccino .

Perhaps the only thing more impressive than claimed possession of an " infinite free energy " machine is the refusal to give - in under the weight of the world 's skepticism - turned ire .
" We screwed up , " admitted Steorn 's CEO Sean McCarthy yesterday after their failed demonstration , but " if we were here to rig a demo , we 'd all be here watching a wheel spin . "
As shyster - Sean explains , Steorn brought three systems to London , one of which they got working for " about 4 - hours " on Tuesday night .
As we all know by now , it mysteriously ceased to function after it was moved to the display room .
At that point , there was a breakdown of the watchmaker - quality bearings causing friction to " go to hell . "
Sean no longer attributes the failings to the lamp heat , lamenting only that his team does n't know the cause .
Moving forward Sean alluded to a less " covert and cryptic " Steorn as they attempt to regain the confidence ( they had it ? ) of the public and more importantly , their shareholders who are more than likely discussing matters with legal counsel at this very moment .
Still , he promised to return .
Next time , however , the system will already be up and running before the demonstration is announced .
While we seriously doubt they 've circumvented the laws of our physical world , half the fun of any good scam ( and this is a good 'n ) is picking apart the components to reveal the truth .
Click - on through for the full Q&A caught on video .
When I founded my first company I did n’t have time to find someone to date , but I knew that I wanted to get married .
So I followed all the advice I had read about how you should tell people what you want in order to get what you want .
I started telling everyone that I wanted to get married , and a lot of people set me up on dates .
But things did not go well .
Almost every guy I went out with ended up wanting to do business with me .
( Yes , I went into business with one of them . )
And often when I met with an investor about the next round of funding for my company , our meeting ( that was invariably at some swanky restaurant he owned ) turned into a date by the end of the evening .
I started questioning the idea that I should be so frank about looking to get married .
Life is one big negotiating opportunity , and I saw I was not doing well .
Also , I noticed that men do n’t generally ask for what they want .
The classic example :
They ask you out to lunch when what they really want is sex .
There is so much written about how women are not as good at negotiating as men are .
Lots of studies show that women do n’t even start negotiating — nine times out of ten , men will ask and women wo n’t .
And when women do negotiate , they do n’t get what they want as often as men do .
There is no solid research to tell us the why behind the poor negotiations .
Most people who toss around ideas about why women do n’t ask , toss around some version of the idea that women do n’t like conflict : Women like to collaborate ; women are caretakers .
I do n’t believe this , because in a relationship , women are typically more comfortable with conflict than men are .
In fact , women are more likely than men to bring up conflict in a relationship .
And men are more likely to withdraw from conflict .
( This last link is so fun .
It ’s dating tips for guys from AskMen.com – a site that is always right on target about how women think . )
Anyway , I think the reason women do poorly in negotiations is that women assume you should ask for what you want , but men know that ’s not how the game is played .
Men know that you need to be aware of what you want , but that ’s not necessarily what you ask for .
So then it makes sense that men negotiate more than women because women are facing conflict head - on and men are not .
It ’s much easier to approach someone you are not going to instigate conflict with .
So negotiations work best when you do n’t assume you need to ask for exactly what you want .
Think of the sex example :
If a guy approaches you for sex , you hang up on him .
If he approaches you for lunch , you think he ’s very sweet .
And then later you have sex .
Salary is another situation where you are better off not asking for what you want .
In salary negotiations , you always want to wait until the other person gives the number .
Even though you know what you want , if you say the first number , your counterpart will tell you it is higher than he or she was planning to pay , no matter what the number is .
When someone asks how much money you want , a way to get out asking directly for the very high salary you really want is to say things like , “ I want to consider the whole package not just salary ” or “ I want to make sure we are a good match before we talk about salary . ”
This forces the other person to give a number first , and then you can say you want more .
My friend Chris
Yeh gave me another good example of when you should not ask for what you want : Founding a company .
He said if you want advice , ask for money , and if you want money , ask for advice .
For those of you who have dealt with investors , you ’ll recognize that this is exactly how the world of startups works .
And based on my own experience of trying to date while running a startup , I think this might be true too :
If you want to go into business with someone , ask them on a date .
And if you want to date someone , go into business with them .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 21 — A report released Tuesday by the Central Intelligence Agency includes new details of the agency ’s missteps before the Sept. 11 attacks , outlining what the report says were failures to grasp the role being played by the terror mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and to assess fully the threats streaming into the C.I.A. in the summer of 2001 .
The 19 - page report , prepared by the agency ’s inspector general , also says 50 to 60 C.I.A. officers knew of intelligence reports in 2000 that two of the Sept. 11 hijackers , Nawaf al - Hazmi and Khalid al - Mihdhar , may have been in the United States .
But none of those officers thought to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the potential domestic threat , the report says , evidence of what it calls a systemic failure .
The inspector general recommended that several top agency officials , including former director George J. Tenet , be held accountable for their failure to put in place a strategy to dismantle Al Qaeda in the years before Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Gen. Michael V. Hayden , the current C.I.A. director , and his predecessor , Porter J. Goss , have declined to seek disciplinary action against Mr. Tenet and others named in the report .
The outlines of the report have been known since shortly after it was completed in 2005 , but it had never been made public , and its release reignited a debate about whether the C.I.A. should have done more before the attacks and whether Mr. Tenet and other officials should be held accountable .
Coke requests court secrecy A sting uncovered an alleged scheme to sell secret Coca - Cola information to rival Pepsi for $ 1.5 million .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Coca -Cola Company Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) PepsiCo Incorporated or or Create Your Own ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Coca -Cola asked for a protective order on Thursday so its trade secrets allegedly put up for sale by an employee will not be divulged in any legal action .
Coke also said it had fired Joya Williams , 41 , who is accused with two men of offering samples of a new product to rival Pepsi for $ 1.5 million .
Williams appeared in an Atlanta , Georgia , court along with Ibrahim Dimson , 28 , and Edmund Duhaney , 43 .
She was expected to be freed later Thursday on a $ 25,000 bond .
The men are being detained ahead of a hearing on Tuesday .
The trio -- who appeared in court wearing T - shirts and shorts -- were arrested earlier this week after a federal sting operation launched after Pepsi tipped off
Coke that it was being offered inside information .
( Watch for the drama of ' Dirk , ' an Armani bag and the Girl Scout cookie box -- 2:43 ) Undercover agents negotiated with the suspects , who allegedly provided classified documents and even promised a sample of a secret new drink , officials said .
" Phone records and further investigation allegedly showed the source of the information was Joya Williams , an executive administrative assistant at Coke in Atlanta , " David Nahmias , the U.S. attorney in Atlanta , said on Wednesday .
Williams was arrested along with Dimson , of New York and Edmund Duhaney , of the Atlanta suburb of Decatur , Nahmias said .
All three are charged with wire fraud and unlawfully stealing and selling trade secrets from The Coca - Cola Company .
Plot revealed Dimson , using the alias " Dirk , " allegedly sent the initial letter to Pepsi using an official Coca - Cola envelope on May 19 .
He later gave an FBI undercover agent 14 pages of Coca - Cola documents marked " Classified -- Confidential " and " Classified -- Highly Restricted , " according to Nahmias .
Coke officials confirmed the documents were tightly held trade secrets , he said .
" Dirk " then requested $ 10,000 for the initial papers , accompanied by a letter promising to provide further documents on request , Nahmias said .
" I can even provide actual products and packaging of certain products , that no eye has seen , outside of maybe five top execs , " the letter states .
" I need to know today , if I have a serious partner or not .
If the good faith money is in my account by Monday , that will be an indication of your seriousness . "
" Dirk " provided other documents to the FBI for $ 5,000 and agreed to take $ 75,000 for a highly confidential product sample from a new Coca - Cola project .
A surveillance camera placed in Williams ' office videotaped her " going through multiple files looking for documents and stuffing them into bags , " Nahmias said .
" She also was observed holding a liquid container with a white label , which resembled the description of new Coca - Cola product sample before placing it into her personal bag .
Coca - Cola later verified the sample was genuine and is in fact a product being developed by the company , " he said .
On June 16 , an FBI undercover agent met with Dimson at Atlanta 's Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport .
Dimson handed over a bag containing documents marked " highly confidential " and a glass bottle with a white label containing a liquid product sample , Nahmias said .
The undercover agent paid Dimson $ 30,000 in $ 100 and $ 50 bills stuffed in a Girl Scout cookie box , he said .
The agent also agreed to pay another $ 45,000 after successful testing of the product sample , he said .
After the exchange , agents followed Dimson as he drove to Duhaney 's home in Decatur , he said .
The three suspects were arrested July 4 , the day they were supposed to be paid $ 1.5 million for the rest of the Coke secrets , he said .
" Theft of valuable trade secrets will not be tolerated , not by the Justice Department and not even by competitors , " Nahmias said .
Rivals respond Neville Isdell , Coke 's chairman and CEO , said the company is reviewing its security procedures in the wake of the arrests .
" While this breach of trust is difficult for all of us to accept , it underscores the responsibility we each have to be vigilant in protecting our trade secrets .
Information is the lifeblood of the company , " he said in a letter to employees .
Isdell also thanked PepsiCo officials for alerting their competitor " to this attack . "
A Pepsi spokesman said the company was glad to help .
" We did what any responsible company would do , " the spokesman said .
" Competition can be fierce , but it must also be fair and legal . "

You have to watch closely for it , but every day a timeless cat - and - mouse game unfolds on the streets of Toronto , one in which the mice never learn their lesson , and the cats always bring in a big prize .
In this case , the mice are the hundreds of courier drivers who scurry around the downtown core every day in their trucks and vans , getting and delivering precious packages .
The cats : the parking police .
Courier companies are Toronto 's biggest parking violators .
Of the top five ticket recipients in 2006 , three were international couriers : Federal Express , United Parcel Service and Purolator .
The list , according to city records , was rounded out with two car rental companies , but those violations were committed by individual renters .
In 2006 , the three couriers together compiled 33,716 tickets , worth approximately $ 1.5 million .
That 's about 130 tickets every workday , or roughly one ticket every four minutes during business hours .
But for the couriers , the fines are simply an unavoidable cost of doing business .
They have no intention of parking legally .
The city has no intention of halting the ticketing .
On a recent bright morning around Yonge and Bloor Sts. , there were two or three couriers parked on every block .
Like Purolator 's Ed Rushford .
When asked about the parking police , he sets down his parcels and blinks through black - rimmed glasses .
He disconcertingly resembles an angry Michael Douglas in Falling Down .
" I 've had more tickets in the last year and a half around here , " seethes the 54 - year - old , " than I have in the last 29 years . "
He says police now " wallpaper " courier vans with tickets .
" It makes us look bad , those things flapping on the windshield .
We 're just trying to make a living . "
As he talks , two parking officers swish by on bicycles going in the other direction .
" It 's not about parking , " he continues .
" It 's about revenue generation . "
And the city does makes big cash on parking violations , about $ 80 million every year .
The couriers all know the parking police who work their neighbourhoods .
They know the easy - going ones , the mean ones .
They text message each other as to the whereabouts of the particularly overzealous cops .
Conversations between drivers and parking cops are often strangely amicable , but sometimes there 's tension .
Rushford relates how , a few days prior , he was approaching the end of his shift and had four tickets already .
One young officer , whom he talks to regularly , walked by and did n't ticket .
When Rushford returned , however , a fresh , yellow violation glared out from under his wiper .
He confronted the officer , who , according to Rushford , said he was " below his quota " for the day .
One Toronto officer , who asked not to be named , said there is n't an explicit quota , but officers are expected to write 65 tickets each a day .
" It 's an uneasy relationship , " Rushford explains .
" It 's like the bird that cleans the crocodile 's teeth . "
He means that sometimes , the croc will let you go .
Sometimes he 'll bite .
" With the amount we pay , " echoes UPS courier Corey Ferrara , 27 , " this country should be out of debt . "
Of course , the drivers do n't themselves pay .
They bring the tickets back and hand them over to the company to look after .
Drivers say they 're not asked to find legitimate places to park .
" The company would lose more money if we had to wait to find parking , " says one FedEx driver who asked not to be named .
" The packages would be late . "
Of the companies , only FedEx responded to questions , but would n't discuss specifics .
" We try to balance meeting the needs of our customers , their reliable , on - time deliveries , with the traffic restrictions in each city , " says spokesperson Karen Cooper .
" But in very congested cities this is often difficult . "
The companies , says Anthony Fabrizi , manager of the city 's parking operations , " treat tickets as well as anything else related to driving around as a cost of doing business in Toronto . "
In 2002 , he says , the city adopted a " zero tolerance " policy between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. toward parking on main arteries .
This meant no mercy for couriers .
In Toronto , the courier companies still come in each week with their hundreds of tickets , Fabrizi says , " and literally flip through each ticket " with staff , to see if there are any errors .
That 's probably by necessity .
Though a big business expense , the fines are n't tax - deductible .
Following on from my Channels implementation , I 've now added ' Remote Channels ' .
These are distributed channels that allow you to access channels in separate Factor instances , even on different machines on the network .
It 's based on my Distributed Concurrency work .
A channel can be made accessible by remote Factor nodes using the ' publish ' word .
Given a channel this will return a long
Id value that can be used by remote nodes to use the channel .
For example :
< channel > [ sieve ] spawn drop publish . =>
" ID12345678901234567890 ..... "
From a remote node you can create a < remote - channel > which contains the hostname and port of the node containing the channel , and the Id of that channel :
" foo.com " 9000 < node > " ID1234 ... " < remote - channel >
You can use ' from ' and ' to ' on the remote channel exactly as you can on normal channels .
The data is marshalled over the network using the serialization library .
Remote channels are implemented using distributed concurrency so you must start a node on the Factor instance you are using .
This is done with ' start - node ' giving the hostname and port :
" foo.com " 9000 start - node
Once this is done all published channels become available .
Note that the hostname and port must be accessible by the remote machine so it can connect to send the data you request .
As an experiment I published the prime number sieve example mentioned in my last post .
It 's running on one of my servers .
To make it easy to create a < remote - channel > without needing to know the hostname and port I serialized the < remote - channel > instance , saved it in a file and made it available as [... server down sorry ... ] .
You can load this file into Factor , deserialize it and get the < remote - channel > instance .
You can then call ' from ' on it to get the next prime number in the series .
Until they get so big that my Factor instance is DOS 'd of course !
The code to do this is :
USING : serialization http.client channels.remote concurrency.distributed ; " yourhostname-or-ip-address.com " 9000 start - server " [ server - down- sorry ] / prime.ser " http - get - stream 2nip [ deserialize ] with - stream dup from .
dup from . ...etc...
The ' 9000 ' can be any port number openly accessible on your machine .
A current Factor bug means you may get an error in ' start - server ' about an address already assigned if you run Linux .
This is due to an interaction with ip v6 - you can ignore it , the server will start fine .
' start - server ' needs to be run whenever you start our Factor instance .
The ' dup from .' duplicates the < remote - channel > , gets the next number from it and prints it .
It may not be in sequence as other users may have gotten the next number before you .
There is a lot of room for improvement and additions to the code .
Feel free to hack at it and send in patches .
Let me know some ideas on how this could be used in ' real world ' applications .

A couple of days ago I got an advance copy of a book by Susan Faludi titled The Terror Dream , due to be released in October .
I ’ve gotten only a few pages into it so I cannot say if the book as a whole is good or not .
But the premise is spot on .
Faludi explores what September 11 did to our national psyche .
In short , Americans as a whole did not respond to September 11 clearly and honestly .
Instead , we retreated into a dreamworld of John Wayne cinematic epics and frontier melodrama .
In this spectacular we cast ourselves as both the hero and the damsel in distress .
The villain role has been filled by a rotating cast — Osama bin Laden , of course , but also Saddam Hussein , France , the United Nations , liberals , various straw man characters allegedly representing liberalism ( Ward Churchill , whoever the hell he is , comes to mind ) , Democrats , the entire Middle East ( excluding Israel , of course ) and the entire religion of Islam .
As they said in the Wild West — shoot ’em all , and let God sort ’em out .
I do n’t blame the American people .
We needed responsible leaders to explain to us clearly what had happened and help us rise above fear and a mob ’s desire for vengeance to a rational response .
Instead , we had the Bush Administration .
As Faludi writes on page 3 —
Throughout the fall of 2001 , the media attempted to position the assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as a reprise of Pearl Harbor , a new “ day of infamy ” that would reinvigorate our World War II ethic of national unity and sacrifice , a long - awaited crucible in which self - absorbed Americans would , at long last , be forged into the twenty - first century ’s stoic army of the latest Greatest Generation .
But the summons to actual sacrifice never came .
No draft ensued , no Rosie the Riveters were called to duty , no ration cards issued , no victory gardens planted .
Most of all , no official moral leadership emerged to challenge Americans to think constructively about our place in the world , to redefine civic commitment and public responsibility .
There was no man in a wheelchair in the White House urging on us a reassessment of American strengths and weakness .
What we had was a chest beater in a borrowed flight suit , instructing us to max our our credit cards for the cause .
In case any righties drop by here — they do tend to be rigidly literal — Faludi is n’t saying that President Bush should have reinstated the draft , issued ration cards , and called the nation ’s womenfolk to work in factories .
She ’s saying that Americans needed to do something extraordinary to channel our grief and anger .
We looked to our President for instruction .
We never got that instruction , beyond “ trust me . ”
Consider this nationally televised speech that the President gave on November 8 , 2001 .
I said in my speech to a Joint Session of Congress that we are a nation awakened to danger .
We ’re also a nation awakened to service , and citizenship , and compassion .
None of us would ever wish the evil that has been done to our country , yet we have learned that out of evil can come great good .
During the last two months , we have shown the world America is a great nation .
( Applause . )
Americans have responded magnificently , with courage and caring .
We ’ve seen it in our children , who have sent in more than $ 1 million for the children of Afghanistan .
We have seen it in the compassion of Jewish and Christian Americans who have reached out to their Muslim neighbors .
We have seen it as Americans have reassessed priorities — parents spending more time with their children , and many people spending more time in prayer and in houses of worship .
Yes , huge amounts of money were donated , because Americans did n’t know what else they could do .
It ’s like the hundreds , probably thousands , of New Yorkers who stood on line outside hospitals that day to give blood , because they wanted to do something .
We have gained new heroes :
Those who ran into burning buildings to save others , our police and our firefighters .
( Applause . )
Those who battled their own fears to keep children calm and safe — America ’s teachers .
( Applause . )
Those who voluntarily placed themselves in harm ’s way to defend our freedom — the men and women of the Armed Forces .
( Applause . )
And tonight , we join in thanking a whole new group of public servants who never enlisted to fight a war , but find themselves on the front lines of a battle nonetheless :
Those who deliver the mail — America ’s postal workers .
( Applause . )
We also thank those whose quick response provided preventive treatment that has no doubt saved thousands of lives — our health care workers .
( Applause . )
We spend time with our children .
We go to church .
We do our jobs .
We did these things before September 11 .
What more can we do ?
What extraordinary effort can we make ?
We are a different country than we were on September the 10th — sadder and less innocent ; stronger and more united ; and in the face of ongoing threats , determined and courageous .
( Applause . )
Our nation faces a threat to our freedoms , and the stakes could not be higher .
We are the target of enemies who boast they want to kill — kill all Americans , kill all Jews , and kill all Christians .
We ’ve seen that type of hate before — and the only possible response is to confront it , and to defeat it .
( Applause . )
This new enemy seeks to destroy our freedom and impose its views .
We value life ; the terrorists ruthlessly destroy it .
We value education ; the terrorists do not believe women should be educated or should have health care , or should leave their homes .
We value the right to speak our minds ; for the terrorists , free expression can be grounds for execution .
We respect people of all faiths and welcome the free practice of religion ; our enemy wants to dictate how to think and how to worship even to their fellow Muslims .
This enemy tries to hide behind a peaceful faith .
But those who celebrate the murder of innocent men , women , and children have no religion , have no conscience , and have no mercy .
( Applause . )
We wage a war to save civilization , itself .
We did not seek it , but we must fight it — and we will prevail .
( Applause . )
Yes , yes .
We ’re ready .
We will give what we can .
We will do what we must .
Just tell us what is required of us .
I ’m proud of the way our health care and postal workers — and the American people — are responding with calm in the face of this deadly new threat .
( Applause . )
Public health officials have acted quickly to distribute preventive antibiotics to thousands of people who may have been exposed .
The government is purchasing and storing medicines and vaccines as a precaution against future attacks .
We are cleaning facilities where anthrax has been detected , and purchasing equipment to sanitize the mail .
Thousands of law enforcement officials are aggressively investigating this bioterrorism attack — and public health officials are distributing the most accurate , up - to - date information we have to medical professionals and to the public .
To coordinate our efforts we ’ve created the new Office of Homeland Security .
Its director , my good friend and former Governor , Tom Ridge , reports directly to me — and works with all our federal agencies , state and local governments , and the private sector on a national strategy to strengthen our homeland protections .
For example , the Coast Guard has taken on expanded duties to protect our shores and our ports .
The National Guard has increased — an increased role in surveillance at our border .
We ’re imposing new licensing requirements for safer transportation of hazardous material .
We ’ve passed a new antiterrorism law which gives our law enforcement officers the necessary tools to track terrorists before they harm Americans .
A new terrorism task force is tightening immigration controls to make sure no one enters or stays in our country who would harm us .
( Applause . )
We are a welcoming country , we will always value freedom — yet we will not allow those who plot against our country to abuse our freedoms and our protections .
( Applause . )
That ’s fine , Mr. President , but what can we do ?
I recently received a letter from a 4th - grade girl that seemed to say it all : “ I do n’t know how to feel , ” she said , “ sad , mad , angry .
It has been different lately .
I know the people in New York are scared because of the World Trade Center and all , but if we ’re scared , we are giving the terrorists all the power . ”
In the face of this great tragedy , Americans are refusing to give terrorists the power .
( Applause . )
Our people have responded with courage and compassion , calm and reason , resolve and fierce determination .
We have refused to live in a state of panic — or a state of denial .
There is a difference between being alert and being intimidated — and this great nation will never be intimidated .
( Applause . )
People are going about their daily lives , working and shopping and playing , worshiping at churches and synagogues and mosques , going to movies and to baseball games .
( Laughter and applause . )
Life in America is going forward — and as the 4th - grader who wrote me knew , that is the ultimate repudiation of terrorism .
( Applause . )
Whereupon the Bush Administration spent the next six years reminding us to be afraid and stripping away civil liberties in the name of “ security . ”
We cannot know every turn this battle will take .
Yet we know our cause is just and our ultimate victory is assured .
We will , no doubt , face new challenges .
But we have our marching orders :
My fellow Americans , let ’s roll .
End of speech .
Let ’s roll .
Sounds grand .
Where ?
How ?
With what ?
Bush did n’t say .
The military action against the Taliban and the liberation of Afghani women from their burquas was fine , but we did n’t realize at the time how half - assed the effort was .
Osama bin Laden and most of al Qaeda was allowed to slip away , and the Kabul Spring of freedom and democracy withered through lack of follow - up .
The Bushies had already turned their attention to Iraq .
In the year after the attacks , many Americans were left in a state of emotional suspension .
Their anger and sense of victimization roiled about , unresolved and directionless .
The Afghan campaign had faded from the news , Osama bin Laden was still at large , and the challenge of September 11 still seemed unanswered .
We were still waiting to be told where to roll .
Thus the Bushies easily pulled off the Mother of All Bait and Switch Scams and whipped up a public frenzy against Saddam Hussein .
With Darryl Worley ’s “ Have You Forgotten ? ” ringing in our ears , Americans were convinced that a war with Iraq was just the thing to get justice for the dead of September 11 .
Those of us who realized there was no connection — and no threat to the United States from Saddam Hussein — were shoved aside .
Anyone who did n’t support the invasion of Iraq , no matter what our reasons , were dismissed as “ Saddam lovers . ”
And here we are .
Stuck in Iraq , lives and resources drained by a war we should n’t have fought .
Osama bin Laden is still sending us “ nyah nyah nyah ” videos .
There ’s still a hole in the ground in Manhattan .
The real challenge of September 11 was never met .
It was never even made clear to us what that challenge was .
I flipped on the television this morning and saw a bit of live broadcast of today ’s September 11 memorial service .
The cameras zoomed in on a weeping woman .
I flipped the television off .
I respect the grief of those who lost loved ones that day , but as a nation we have forfeited the right to grieve .
A moment of great opportunity has passed , and it was utterly squandered .
After more than four years bogged down in Iraq , we seem to spend more time arguing about what narrative we ’re playing out than what strategy we should be following .
Is this World War II ?
Is it Vietnam ?
Are we John Wayne on the beaches of Normandy or General Custer at the Little Big Horn ?
And what about the ending ?
My dears , we must have victory .
We must not leave Iraq without a satisfying climax to the drama , with parades and speeches and a general wallowing in our national glory , never mind the cost .
Or the purpose .
At this point it does no good to argue with the war ’s bitter - end supporters that Iraq is not , in fact , World War II and that George W. Bush is neither Winston Churchill nor Abraham Lincoln .
Anyone who still supports the war is utterly lost in whatever heroic storyline is playing in his head .
George Bush can continue to evoke all manner of irrelevant historical references — including September 11 — and it still reverberates in the psyches of many Americans .
They are stuck in their dream world and will not wake up .
Update : Little Lulu is still rolling :
But remembrance without resistance to jihad and its enablers is a recipe for another 9/11 .
This is what fueled my first two books , on immigration enforcement and profiling .
This is what fuels much of the work on this blog and at Hot Air .
Not every American wears a military uniform .
But every American has a role to play in protecting our homelandâ € “ not just from Muslim terrorists , but from their financiers , their public relations machine , their sharia - pimping activists , the anti-war goons , the civil liberties absolutists , and the academic apologists for our enemies .
So what movie is Lulu playing in her head ?
And was it directed by Leni Riefenstahl ?

Common Lisp Testing Frameworks

Common Lisp Testing Frameworks
I 've been evaluating the various Common Lisp testing frameworks .
I have a large body of code in my Project Euler stuff , and I use unit testing extensively ; extensively enough that the simplistic unit testing package I had been using was getting unwieldy .
So I figured I 'd take a look at what was available and see how everything stacked up .
Since this page is long , I 'll present my summary up front :
If your testing needs are simple , use lisp - unit .
It you need many , well - organized tests ( as I now do ) , use either Stefil or FiveAM , depending on whether you want highly - interactive or noninteractive tests , respectively .
First , a bit about my requirements .
I use packages extensively in my Project Euler setup .
I have a main package , : euler , which contains " common " code , both things that are used extensively , like my primality testing function , and things that might only be used in one place , but that seemed like they belonged in the common section , like the implementation of Dijkstra 's shortest - path algorithm or the function for finding a minimum spanning tree .
I have unit tests for most of these functions .
( Not all yet , but I 'm working on it . )
There is a separate package for each problem , into which goes at least a function named get - answer as well as any other problem - specific code and tests .
The problem - specific tests include at least tests to check my code against the examples given in the problems and ( when I 've gotten it ) a test for the answer to the problem .
I generally want to do one of three things : test everything , test just one problem 's code , or test the library functions .
I occasionally want to test just the answers to all of the problems , too .
In setting up the tests , I wrote a few macros and put all of my tests in those so I could redefine the test framework easily .
When I could use hierarchies , I set them up as follows : suite euler - tests is the root of the tree .
It contains euler - functions and euler - problems .
euler - functions contains a suite / test ( depending on the particular framework ) for each common function .
euler - problems contains one suite for each problem , of the form euler -< problem - number >- tests .
That suite contains a test / suite for the examples given in the problem ( euler - < problem - number > - givens ) , one for the answer ( euler - < problem - number > - answer ) , and possibly one for each internal function I want to test ( euler - < problem - number > -< function - name > ) .
In my example runs , I 've deliberately introduced several errors : a function signalling an error when it should n't and vice versa , a function returning t when it should return nil and vice versa , and a couple of functions that return an incorrect ( numerical ) value .
lisp - unit
lisp - unit was the package I 'd been using , and I like it because it 's dead simple to work with .
It uses packages to group the tests , so your existing package structure serves the part of test suites .
Obviously , they 're not even hierarchical , let alone composable .
There are no fixtures .
While the design lacks some flexibility , since it 's tied directly to the package system , it makes up for it in simplicity .
Because there 's no need to declare and organize your test suites , adding a test is as simple as
( lisp-unit : define - test < test- name > < test-clauses > )
The test clauses use the fairly obvious assert - true , assert - false , assert - equal , and assert - error tests ( plus a couple of others ) .
Running the tests is either a matter of ( run-tests < test- names > ) , which runs tests in the current package ( if no names are given , all tests are run ) ; or ( run-all - tests < package > < test- names > ) to use a different package ( again , listing no tests will run them all ) .
The main drawbacks for large bodies of tests are that there 's no composition of test suites , so you have to give explicit commands to run all of your tests , and it prints one line for each test .
Here 's a sample run :
* ( eval `( progn ( lisp - unit : run - all - tests euler ) , @( loop for i from 1 to 142 collect `( lisp - unit : run - all - tests , ( intern ( format nil " E~3 , '0D " i ) ) ) ) ) ) )
EULER - BOUNCYP : 17 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER -LEAST-DIVISIBLE-REPUNIT : 2 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER -MODPOWER : 6 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER -NEXT -PRIME : 9 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER -NUM-PARTITIONS : 12 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER - PALINDROMEP : ( PALINDROMEP 10221 ) failed : Expected T but saw NIL EULER - PALINDROMEP : 35 assertions passed , 1 failed .
EULER - PREV-PRIME : 7 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER - PRIMEP : ( PRIMEP 2 ) failed : Should have signalled ERROR but saw T EULER - PRIMEP : 11 assertions passed , 1 failed .
EULER - UNIQUE -DIGITS-P : ( UNIQUE-DIGITS -P
1 ) failed : Expected NIL but saw T EULER - UNIQUE - DIGITS-P : 9 assertions passed , 1 failed .
TOTAL : 108 assertions passed , 3 failed , 0 execution errors .
EULER -001 - ANSWER : 1 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER -001- GIVENS : ( GET - ANSWER 10 ) failed : Expected 24 but saw 23 EULER - 001 - GIVENS : 0 assertions passed , 1 failed .
TOTAL : 1 assertions passed , 1 failed , 0 execution errors .
EULER - 002-ANSWER : 1 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER - 002- GIVENS : 1 assertions passed , 0 failed .
TOTAL : 2 assertions passed , 0 failed , 0 execution errors . [ 72 lines snipped ]
EULER - 035 - GIVENS : 1 assertions passed , 0 failed .
EULER -035-ROTATE-NUM : ( ROTATE - NUM 1 1 ) failed : Expected 2 but saw 1 EULER - 035 - ROTATE - NUM : 9 assertions passed , 1 failed .
TOTAL : 11 assertions passed , 1 failed , 0 execution errors .
[ 123 lines snipped ]
EULER - 095 - ANSWER :
The value - 1 is not of type ( MOD 536870911 ) .
[ 87 lines snipped ]
In most cases , the error test is very informative .
It gives the code that it ran , the expected return value , and the actual value .
The only exception is when an unexpected error was signalled ; in that case , only the test name is given .
The problem , as you can see , is that these informative failure messages get lost among all the noise of the successful tests .
The fact that there 's no composition means that you do n't even get a count of total failed tests at the end .
( That is a failing of many of the Common Lisp test frameworks available ) .
lisp - unit 's main strength is that it 's easy to use .
For simple testing situations , it 's easily the best one available , because it 's so easy to use there 's no barrier to writing all the tests you need .
Its failure messages are useful and informative .
Its main drawback is that it does n't scale well .
If your test needs are simple then lisp - unit is probably the best choice for you .
LIFT
Initially , LIFT looked good .
It 's obviously influenced by JUnit 's ways of doing things .
Test suites are defined very much like CLOS classes ; they have a hierarchical inheritance structure ( with multiple inheritance , even ) and can have slots just like CLOS classes .
Fixtures for setting up and tearing down resources for the tests are supported ( with the resources references by custom slots ) .
The test running function simply returns a test result object , but the package uses the pretty - printing function for that object to detail the test results , which is rather neat and would lend itself well to automated processing of the test results .
Another interesting feature is randomized testing based on a specification , similar to QuickCheck for Haskell .
Setting up tests requires defining a test suite and adding tests to it , which can either be done in one statement :
( lift:deftestsuite < suite - name > ( < parent- suites > ) ( < slots > ) ( : setup < forms to set up the slots > ) ( : teardown < forms to tear down slots > ) ( : tests ( < test- clause > ) ( < test- clause > ) ( < test- clause > ) ) )
or , since everything after the slot definitions is optional , in multiple statements :
( lift:deftestsuite < suite-name > ( < parent- suites > ) ( < slots > ) ) ( lift : addtest ( < suite - name > ) < test- clause > )
( Note that having the suite name in a list for addtest is a special case .
Normally , that parameter would be a symbol giving the name of the test , which would be placed in the most recently - defined test suite .
Using a list with a suite name in it overrides that behavior and assigns the test to a specific suite and gives the test a name of the form test - < number > .
Another special case is that you can omit both the name and the suite ; when the first form is a list of more than one element , it is treated as a test clause and the test is given an autogenerated name ( as above ) and placed in the most recently - defined test suite . )
Test clauses are very much like lisp - unit 's , except that the test macros have slightly different names : ensure ( analogous to lisp - unit : assert - true ) , ensure - same , and ensure - error .
The analog to ( lisp - unit : assert - false < form > ) is ( ensure ( not < form > ) ) .
The fact that test suites support multiple inheritance is a nice touch .
In my setup , it means that I could have an additional suite named euler - answers , and every answer suite would inherit from both its project 's test suite and the euler - answers suite .
That way I would have a suite that would run just the tests on the problems ' answers without interfering with the rest of my test hierarchy structure .
Of the test frameworks I looked at , LIFT was the only one with multiple inheritance for test suites .
One feature that 's not in LIFT just yet but which the author has mentioned adding is support for benchmarking tests .
This is something that would really interest me , especially in conjunction with being able to run just the tests on the problem answers .
( I 've actually got some code that did benchmarking of my lisp - unit code , and I 've used it to target my optimization of problems .
Having support for that sort of thing baked into the testing framework would be very nice . )
Test and suite names appear to be effectively global ; as far as I can tell , they 're compared by string= on symbol - name .
This means that it 's easy to call tests that were defined in a different package than the current one , but it also means that the normal package exporting rules do n't apply , and all names must be globally unique .
That 's all good stuff .
There were a few problems I ran into .
First , whenever I defined a test , SBCL raised a style - warning about redefining things in defmethod , even if it was the first time I 'd defined the test .
SLIME did n't quite understand the warnings , so everytime I compiled a test suite or file , I got an extra SLIME window listing all the spurious warnings .
The larger problem , though , was its speed and memory footprint .
Defining tests is very slow ; when using LIFT , the time necessary to compile and load all of my Project Euler code jumped from the other frameworks ' average of about 1.5 minutes to over nine minutes .
Redefining tests felt even slower than defining them initially , but I do n't have solid numbers on that .
After loading everything , memory usage was more than twice that of other frameworks .
Running all of the tests took more than a minute longer than other frameworks , though that seems mostly to be a result of swapping induced by LIFT 's greater memory requirements .
Here 's a sample run :
* ( lift:run - tests : suite ' euler - tests ) #< Results for EULER - TESTS 380 Tests , 5 Failures , 1 Error .
Failure : euler - primep : test - 12 Condition : Expected ERROR but got NIL Failure : euler - palindromep : test - 36 Condition : Ensure failed : ( EULER : PALINDROMEP 10221 ) ()
Failure : euler- unique - digits - p : test - 10 Condition : Ensure failed : ( NOT ( EULER : UNIQUE-DIGITS-P 1 ) ) ()
Failure : euler - 001 - givens : test - 1 Condition : Ensure - same : 24 is not EQUAL to 23 Failure : euler - 035 - rotate - num : test - 1 Condition : Ensure - same : 2 is not EQUAL to 1 ERROR : euler - 095 - answer : test - 1 Condition :
The value - 1 is not of type ( MOD 536870911 ) . >
As I mentioned before , the use of the print - object generic function to give a summary of the tests is very nice .
The fact that it only details failures is also quite nice ; failures are n't lost in the noise of successful tests .
The reporting of the failures is n't quite as nice as in lisp - unit .
While failures of ensure show the code that failed , failures of ensure - same merely show the mismatched values , not the code that generated the values .
There 's no feedback while the test routines are running , which is a minor annoyance , but completely in keeping with the nature of functional programming .
Overall , LIFT is an intriguing framework with a lot of good things going for it , but the speed and memory issues killed it for me .
It might work better with fewer test cases and suites , but in that case I 'd probably recommend just using lisp - unit and its elegant simplicity .
XLUnit
XLUnit bills itself as a low - programmer - overhead adaptation of JUnit .
It 's based on both XPTEST and clos - unit ( so I did n't bother trying either of those individually ) .
It follows the approach of JUnit in using native OO classes as test suites ; each suite is simply a CLOS class that inherits from the test - case class .
It does have its own macro for declaring test cases , but its format reads very much like a generic method being specialized on a particular class .
Likewise , fixtures are supported by implementing the set - up and tear - down generic functions for your test suite class .
The main drawback is that , although you can create hierarchies of test suites ( since they 're just CLOS classes ) , the suites are n't composable .
Setting up tests is pretty simple :
( defclass < suite - name > ( xlunit: test - case ) ( < slots > ) ) ( xlunit : def - test - method < test- name > ( ( test < suite - name > ) ) < test-clauses >)
XLUnit uses fairly standard names for its test clauses , too : assert - true , assert - false , assert - equal , assert - condition , assert - eql , and assert - not - eql .
The UI is pretty similar to the standard * Unit text interface , too :
* ( xlunit : textui - test - run ( xlunit : get - suite euler - tests ) ) ..F...F..F.. Time : 0.072
There were 3 failure : 1 ) EULER - UNIQUE -DIGITS-P : Assert false : ( UNIQUE - DIGITS -P
1 ) 2 ) EULER - PALINDROMEP : Assert true : ( PALINDROMEP 10221 ) 3 ) EULER - PRIMEP : Assert condition ERROR , but no condition signaled FAILURES !!!
Run : 9 Failures : 3 Errors : 0 #<XLUNIT :TEST -RESULTS
{ AC399D9} > * ( xlunit:textui- test- run ( xlunit : get - suite e001::euler - 001 - tests ) ) ..F
Time : 0.002
There was 1 failure : 1 ) EULER - 001 - GIVENS : Assert equal : 24 23 FAILURES !!!
Run : 2 Failures : 1 Errors : 0 #<XLUNIT :TEST -RESULTS
{ B79A7F9} > * ( xlunit:textui- test- run ( xlunit : get - suite e095::euler -095-tests ) ) .E Time : 0.138
There was 1 error : 1 ) EULER - 095 - ANSWER :
The value - 1 is not of type ( MOD 536870911 ) .
FAILURES !!!
Run : 1 Failures : 0 Errors : 1 #< XLUNIT :TEST -RESULTS
{ B82F53A} >
It prints dots , ' F's , and 'E 's as it runs each test and then summarizes the failures .
As with LIFT , it gives details of the code that failed in some cases ( assert - true , assert - false ) , but not in others ( assert - equal , assert - error , unexpected condition ) .
The def - test - method macro feels a little clunky to me .
I 'd rather see the class instance and test suite named separately from each other , but I think part of that is just experience with other test frameworks that worked differently .
It does make plenty of sense when viewed as just an extension of CLOS .
The non-composability of suites is what really kills XLUnit for me .
If I did n't want composition , I 'd still be using lisp - unit , which has even less syntactic overhead and comparable resource usage .
I 'd say it has some usefulness for situations where you needed fixtures but still wanted a simple programming interface to the framework .
FiveAM
Initially , FiveAM reminded me a bit of LIFT with fewer gee - whiz features .
It , too , does hierarchical , composable test suites .
( In fact , it was the only other framework that supported composing suites . )
It also does fixtures , but somewhat differently than anyone else .
In FiveAM , fixtures are written as macros with a special keyword indicating where the test body will go .
On one hand , it 's a very Lispy approach to the issue .
( In particular , it lets you keep all of your state in local variables , which is a bit more functional style than the OO approach of using class slots . )
On the other hand , you have to wrap every set of tests that use the fixture in a with - fixture macro , while most other approaches tie the fixtures to the test suite so they 're set up and torn down automatically for each test in the suite .
Like LIFT , FIveAM has support for specification - based random testing .
I do n't have anywhere I use things like that , so I again did n't test it .
FiveAM also has fewer test clauses ; most cases will work with the is macro , which codewalks its body to determine what exactly is being tested .
Test suites are pretty easy to create :
( 5 am:def - suite < suite - name > )
It supports inheritance ( and documentation ) with key parameters :
( 5 am : def - suite < suite - name > : in < parent - suite > : documentation < doc- string > )
Test may either be bound to suites explicitly :
( 5 am:test ( < test- name > < dependencies > < suite > ) < test-clauses > )
or implicitly , as with the in - package form :
( 5 am : in - suite < suite - name > ) ( 5 am:test < test- name > < test-clauses > )
The < dependencies > parameter is for declaring that a given test depends on another test completing successfully ( or failing ) first .
Sample run :
* ( time ( 5 am:run ! ' 5 am- euler-tests ) ) .................f...................................................f.......... ...........f....................f............................................... ...........f.................................................................... ..................................................X............................. .............................................................
Did 381 checks .
Pass : 375 ( 98 % ) Skip : 0 ( 0 % ) Fail : 6 ( 1 % ) Failure Details : -------------------------------- EULER-PRIMEP [ ] : Failed to signal a ERROR .
-------------------------------- --------------------------------
EULER-PALINDROMEP
[ ] : 10221 did not satisfy PALINDROMEP .
-------------------------------- --------------------------------
EULER-UNIQUE-DIGITS-P [ ] : 1 satisfied UNIQUE - DIGITS-P.
-------------------------------- -------------------------------- EULER-001-GIVENS
[ ] : 23 was not = to 24 .
-------------------------------- --------------------------------
EULER -035-ROTATE -NUM
[ ] : 1 was not = to 2 .
-------------------------------- --------------------------------
EULER-095-ANSWER [ ] : Unexpected Error : #< TYPE -ERROR { B2B7639} >
The value - 1 is not of type ( MOD 536870911 ) ...
-------------------------------- NIL
As with other * Unit frameworks , it prints one character for each test run , giving a bit of visual feedback .
The failure messages are decent , but ( as with most frameworks ) no code is shown for unequal values .
Overall , I like FiveAM slightly more than the other frameworks I tried .
( Though I like lisp - unit 's failure messages , XLUnit 's approach to fixtures , and several of LIFT 's current and proposed features more than FiveAM . )
FiveAM does support the one killer feature I was looking for -- hierarchical , composable test suites -- as well as a number of smaller things that seem very nice and in the spirit of Lisp .
ptester
ptester is barely a test framework .
It has no test suites and no test functions .
All it provides is a set of macros for checking function results ( test ( analogous to lisp - unit : assert - equal ) , test - error , test - no - error , test - warning , and test - no - warning ) and a wrapper macro designed to enclose the test clauses which merely provides a count of success and failures at the end .
ptester expects that all testing is done in predefined functions and lacks the dynamic approach present in other frameworks .
I did n't bother trying ptester with my code .
The lack of any sort of organization meant that I would have had to rewrite most of my tests to get them all called properly .
( I would have to put each set of test clauses in a function and then have the function called from somewhere .
Compare to most frameworks , where the test is told which suite or clause it belongs to and running the suite automatically gets all of the tests it contains . )
CLUnit
Although there 's a Debian package for CLUnit , it did n't load properly into my environment ( SBCL 1.0.0.0 ) ; it complained that the function deftest was undefined .
A survey of the documentation indicates that it 's lacking my single most important requirement : a composable test suite hierarchy .
I thus did n't spend much time trying to get it to work .
It does support grouping of tests , but not hierarchically .
There are no fixtures .
Tests are named with strings , which bypasses some of the scope problems that can arise when using symbols .
The use of function passing looks a little clunky to me , but it could be abstracted away with a macro if necessary .
It does support multiple value returns , which sets it apart from most other frameworks I looked at ( MSL .
TEST does them , as does ptester , though ptester only considers the first return value by default ) .
A simple test definition looks roughly like this :
( clunit : deftest " < test- name > " : category " < suite - name > " : test- fn ( lambda ( ) < test- clauses > ) )
The test is considered to have failed if test - fn returns nil ; otherwise , it succeeded .
The functionality of other frameworks ' test clause macros ( lisp - unit : assert - same , etc. ) is accomplished by use of other keyword arguments passed in to the deftest clause .
For example , this lisp - unit test
( lisp- unit : define - test addition ( lisp-unit:assert - equal 2 (+ 1 1 ) ) )
could be rendered as
( clunit : deftest " addition " : input - form ' ( 1 1 ) : test - fn ( lambda ( args ) ( destructuring - bind ( a b ) args (+ a b ) ) ) :output-form 2 )
which , yes , is wordier , but the various keywords allow for some interesting combinations of tests .
When the tests are run , the names of failed tests are given , but nothing more .
The setup appears to highly encourage one clause per test , so that imprecision should n't be too much of an impediment .
I did n't really experiment with this one much , since it failed to compile and was missing a key feature , but it does seem to have an interesting approach to testing .
I fear , though , that its approach adds too much complexity to the process .
FReT
FReT also did not compile for me .
It ran into problems with some of its internal macros .
It says it is based on LIFT , which I 'd already dismissed , and it has no documentation available aside from the source .
I opted not the spend the time investigating it further .
MSL.TEST
MSL.TEST is another basic test framework .
It checks multiple value returns by default , which is nice ( though it made a bunch of my previously - passing tests fail ; all the other frameworks I tried only compared the primary return value by default ) .
The framework only has test groups , not a hierarchy , but it uses the return value of its test clauses to determine success or failure , and the run-tests function returns t only if all of its tests succeeded , so you can fake a hierarchy be having one of your test clauses run the tests in a different group .
The test results are not aggregated , though , and its output format is very noisy , printing one line per passing test and more for failing tests .

MSL.TEST is exceedingly wordy , too much so for feasably running any large number of tests .
As usual , I feel that in situations where the requirements are simple enough that MSL .
TEST would work well , lisp - unit would work equally well , if not better .
Stefil
Stefil takes a much more interactive approach to testing .
It is intended primarily for use from the REPL , preferably running within SLIME .
Test failures are reported by raising conditions with information about the failing test :
Test assertion failed : Binary predicate ( = X Y ) failed .
x : 24 => 24 y : ( EULER -001:GET - ANSWER
10 ) => 23 [ Condition of type STEFIL :: ASSERTION - FAILED ]
Restarts : 0 : [ CONTINUE ]
Record the failure and continue 1 : [ CONTINUE -WITHOUT-DEBUGGING ]
Record the failure , turn off debugging for this test session and continue 2 : [ CONTINUE ]
Skip the rest of the test ( STEFIL :: NAME -OF STEFIL ::TEST ) and continue 3 : [ RETEST ]
Rerun the test ( STEFIL :: NAME-OF STEFIL ::TEST ) 4 : [ CONTINUE ]
Skip the rest of the test ( STEFIL :: NAME -OF STEFIL ::TEST ) and continue 5 : [ RETEST ]
Rerun the test ( STEFIL :: NAME-OF STEFIL ::TEST ) 6 : [ CONTINUE -WITHOUT-DEBUGGING ]

Defining a test ( via deftest ) results in a function with the same name as the test ; running that function runs the test .
Tests are completely composable ; you can call one test from within another and their results are aggregated .
Test suites are defined by defsuite , but internally suites are just tests that call other tests .
Adding a new test to a suite just adds that test 's function to the functions called by the suite 's function .
Likewise , creating a suite adds it to the current suite , giving you a hierarchy .
My only problem with the setup is that I do n't see a way to explicitly assign tests to suites , aside from dynamically binding stefil ::* suite * .
Normally , the current suite is set by in - suite , which requires careful attention if you 're jumping between different suites often .
( A somewhat mitigating factor is that tests remember which suite they were created in , so the current suite only matters for newly - defined tests . )
As an example of a hierarchy , here 's roughly how I set up things for my tests :
( in - package :euler ) ( stefil : in - root - suite ) ( stefil: defsuite * test- all ) ( stefil: defsuite test - functions ) ( stefil : defsuite test - problems ) ( stefil : in - suite test - functions ) ( stefil : deftest test - modpower ( ) ( stefil : is ( = 399 ( modpower 123456 123456 789 ) ) ) ) ( in - package :e001 ) ( stefil : in - suite euler: test - problems ) ( stefil : defsuite * test - all ) ( stefil : deftest test - answer ( ) ( stefil : is ( = < answer > ( get-answer ) ) ) ) ( stefil : deftest test- givens ( ) ( stefil : is (= 24 ( get- answer 10 ) ) ) )
Note that ( defsuite * < suite - name > ) is equivalent to ( defsuite < suite - name > ) followed by ( in - suite < suite - name > ) .
Fixtures are supported in pretty much the same way that FivaAM does them ; you define them as macros and then run your tests within a with - fixture macro .
Running the tests looks like this :
* ( test - all ) .................X...................................................X.....................X........ ............X..........................................................X............................ .......................................................................................... E......... ................................................................................. #< test - run 362 tests , 381 assertions , 6 failures in 169.139 sec >
That is , of course , only half the picture , since failures are reported by raised conditions , and that returned object is designed to be browsed with the SLIME inspector .
I showed the full debugger response to a condition earlier ; here are the other messages from test failures I saw in my run :
Test assertion failed : ( PROGN ( PRIMEP 2 ) ) failed to signal condition ERROR [ Condition of type STEFIL :: ASSERTION -FAILED ] ... Expression ( PALINDROMEP 10221 ) evaluated to false 0 : 10221 => 10221 [ Condition of type STEFIL :: ASSERTION -FAILED ] ... Expression ( NOT ( UNIQUE-DIGITS -P 1 ) ) evaluated to true 0 : 1 => 1 [ Condition of type STEFIL :: ASSERTION -FAILED ] ... Binary predicate ( = X Y ) failed .
x : 24 => 24 y : ( EULER -001:GET - ANSWER
10 ) => 23 [ Condition of type STEFIL :: ASSERTION -FAILED ] ...
The value - 1 is not of type ( MOD 536870911 ) .
[ Condition of type TYPE - ERROR ]
I like that you get lots of information about the code that was run , the result it produced , and the result that was expected .
The only thing that could be clearer is the actual test that failed .
You either have pore through the backtrace or wait for everything to finish and pore through the test result objects .
Speaking of test result objects , here 's the one returned by the test .
It 's got a lot of information in it .

I like the touch of having the test 's runtime available .
As I mentioned in the LIFT section , I 'd written some functions to gather that data myself , but having the test collect it for me is even nicer .
I 'm fairly impressed with Stefil .
It 's got a very interesting interface , and the use of the debugger and inspector lends itself well to the interactive , short feedback cycle of Lisp programming .
I 'm not sure if the approach will work for everyone , but I 'm going to give Stefil an extended try and see how well its testing approach works for me .
If the live testing proves too bothersome , I 'll just use FiveAM .
Think Progress captures the moment :
Today on Fox News Sunday , Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol attacked the Democratic presidential candidates for their decision to attend the Yearly Kos blogger convention .
He held it up as evidence that the presidential candidates have " gone left . "
" Every Democratic presidential nominee is going to the DailyKos convention , " said Kristol .
" That ’s the left - wing blogger who was not respectable three or four years ago .
The Howard Dean kind of sponsor .
Now the whole party is going to pay court to him and to left wing blogs . "
Sorry , chump .
But given the radical and now objectively untrue political views that were " respectable " 3 - 4 years ago , I do n't know if there 's a higher compliment .
Some day soon -- and that day may even be right now -- being outside of what the Beltway Dingbats considered " respectability " during the greatest failure of political and journalistic conscience in American history will be a badge of honor and courage as coveted as the ability to claim membership in the French Resistance after World War II .
You wo n't be able to survive politically without it .
My daughter will be turning 2 in January .
So for my wife and I , its time for us to start planning for her college .
Should we go for a College 529 plan , an Education IRA or a Regular Investment account ?
What should we do ?
There are many reasonable education options such as the Indiana Wesleyan University , but we need to start preparing .
So I started researching the various college savings options available .
I decided to go to the Vanguard website because Vanguard is the most conservative mutual fund company I know of , because as far as saving for college is concerned I do n’t want to invest too aggressively .
That being said , I still want to have enough so she can choose from a Nursing degree , to an online entrepreneurship MBA , or whatever else she has in mind .
So here is what I found .
529 College savings Plan
529 plans enable you to invest for higher education free of federal and , sometimes , state income taxes .
States or schools can sponsor a 529 plan .
Most are open to residents of all states .
Some plans allow you to invest between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 on behalf of one child , so a 529 plan may be your best bet for fully funding a college education .
Advantage
Enjoy investing flexibility , high contribution limits , and tax advantages to save for college and graduate school .
Disadvantage
The money can ONLY be used for college .
And If your kid does n’t go to college , you may name another eligible family member as beneficiary on the account and use the 529 assets to pay for that person ’s education .
If no eligible family members can be named beneficiary , then you might have to close the account , paying federal and possibly state income taxes and a 10 % federal penalty tax on earnings not used for qualified higher - education expenses .

Education Savings Account
Advantage
you can invest for any level of a child ’s education–primary school , high school , college , or beyond .
And you can start investing for that child from birth .
The money is taxed at the child ’s tax rate , which is typically lower than the parents ’ rate .
Although contributions are n’t tax - deductible , your earnings grow tax - free and withdrawals are free from federal income taxes when used for qualified education expenses .
Disadvantage
You can only contribute $ 2000 a year .
UGMA / UTMA accounts
Advantage
A tax - advantaged way to save for a child ’s future , for higher education or any other purpose that benefits the child .
The accounts dont have any contribution limits , though contributions above a certain amount will trigger the federal gift tax .
Disadvantage
When the child turn 18 , he / she gains control of the money and they can do anything with the money .
Open a Roth IRA with Scottrade .
Regular Investment Account
Advantage
You retain complete control of the account .
Select from from a broad lineup of stock , bond , balanced , and short - term investments .
Disadvantage
You do not receive the tax advantages of accounts specifically created for college investing .
So what did we decide ?
As of now , our finances are in order with no credit card debt an we regularly keep a close watch on our savings and spending .
Therefore , we went for a regular investment account .
We chose the Vanguard STAR fund that is a conservative balanced mutual fund that has consistently given a return of at least 10 % .

Estimate : Giuliani spent 7 percent of time spent by first responders at Ground Zero Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 17 , 2007
Print This Email This Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has faced repeated criticism of his apparent attempts to trade on his reputation that grew out of Sept. 11 to propel his presidential campaign .
A new estimate shows Giuliani spent about 7 percent as much time at Ground Zero as did the typical first responder during a three month period after the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
On Friday the GOP frontrunner faced more harsh words after the New York Times revealed that Giuliani spent only 29 hours at the smoldering pile of wreckage that was the World Trade Center from mid-September to mid-December 2001 .
During those same three months , rescue workers were putting in 12 - hour shifts digging through the World Trade Center 's wreckage .
And Michael J. Palladino , president of the Detectives Endowment Association of New York City , told the Times that officers averaged 400 hours each at the site during that time .
Talking Points Memo's Election Central unearthed comments from Giuliani in 2006 .
" I spent as much time here as anyone ... I was here five , six times a day for four months , " Giuliani said last September .
" I thought of it as living here . "
The Times ' tally was compiled from records of Giuliani 's schedules form Sept. 17 to Dec. 16 , 2001 and does not take into account the first six days following the attack , during which Giuliani paid repeated visits to the site .
If Giuliani had paid Ground Zero five or six daily visits for the timeframe covered by the Times , a rough estimate shows each visit would 've lasted less than four minutes , on average .
However the Times reports Giuliani made 41 appearances at Ground Zero , mostly to give tours to other officials and foreign dignitaries .
In his 2002 book , Leadership , Giuliani recounts visiting Ground Zero on Jan. 1 , 2002 , just after his successor , Michael Bloomberg , was sworn in .
" I wanted it to be the last place I visited before I left , " Giuliani wrote .
" I had been there hundreds of times in the three and a half months since the attacks . "
Giuliani was criticized earlier this month when he claimed he was " at ground zero as often , if not more , than most of the workers . "
First responders said the remark was insensitive and untrue .
Although Giuliani said a few days later that he misspoke , he still claimed to face health risks because of his exposure to toxic material at Ground Zero .
Computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and the Russian Academy of Science will share the Association for Computing Machinery 's 2007 Gödel Prize for their seminal work on what many consider the most important unresolved question in theoretical computer science .
Steven Rudich , professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon , and Alexander A. Razborov , a mathematician and computational theorist at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow , will receive the $ 5,000 prize at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing , June 11 –13 in San Diego .
The ACM's Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computing Theory recognized Rudich and Razborov for their work on the P vs. NP problem , a classic question concerning computational complexity that underlies the security of ATM cards , computer passwords and electronic commerce .
It is literally a million - dollar question — one of seven Millennium Problems that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $ 1 million for solving .
The Gödel prize is named for Kurt Gödel ( 1906 –1978 ) , an Austrian - American mathematician and philosopher who had a major impact on the foundations of computer science and was among the first to puzzle over the P vs. NP problem .
" Of all of the prizes I could win , I would choose this one , " Rudich said .
" Gödel has been my luminary hero since I was 12 . "
The P vs. NP question asks whether the class of problems with solutions that can be quickly recognized ( complexity class NP ) is the same as the class of problems with solutions that can be quickly generated ( complexity class P ) .
In human experience , it is intuitive that the ability to recognize something ( like a good musical piece ) is easy compared to being able to generate one yourself ( like a good composer ) .
People strongly suspect , based on a shared awe of creativity , that NP is a larger class than P. Cryptographers hope that is so ; the security of all digital cryptographic systems requires it .
At the same time , other computer scientists hope for the exact opposite — they hope to find unexpected shortcuts in the efficiency of creative problem - solving .
To date , no one has formulated a mathematical proof that can answer the question one way or the other .
Findings by Rudich and Razborov brought decades of work to find such a proof to a screeching halt .
In a paper presented at the Symposium on Theory of Computing in 1994 and published in 1997 in the Journal of Computer and System Sciences , they showed that a wide class of proof techniques they call " natural proofs " can't solve the P vs. NP question .
What 's more , they found that those previous results turned out to have an almost contradictory double life , providing methods for breaking a wide class of cryptosystems .
That 's not to say that a mathematical proof for P vs. NP is impossible , Rudich said , but it will have to be very different from the natural proofs that mathematicians had been employing .
To date , no one has convincingly devised such a proof , but Rudich is among those who are trying .
" I 've devoted my life to this question , " he said .
And if he can't solve it , he 's convinced someone will .
" I 'm a big believer in human creativity . "
Rudich is editor of the Journal of Cryptology and was selected by the Mathematical Association of America as Pólya Lecturer for the 2004–2005 and 2005 – 2006 academic years .
An accomplished magician , he also serves as director of Andrew 's Leap , a highly selective summer program for Pittsburgh - area high school students interested in math and science .
Razborov is an editor of the Theoretical Computer Science journal and was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize of the International Mathematical Union in 1990 for his contributions to complexity theory .

Researchers at Temple University have observed and documented electron transfer reactions on an electrode surface at the single molecule level for the first time , a discovery which could have future relevance to areas such as molecular electronics , electrochemistry , biology , catalysis , information storage , and solar energy conversion .
The researchers have published their findings , “ Dynamics of Porphyrin Electron - Transfer Reactions at the Electrode–Electrolyte Interface at the Molecular Level , ” in the international scientific journal , Angewandte Chemie .
“ The simplest chemical reactions are oxidation and reduction , ” says Eric Borguet , professor of chemistry at Temple and the study ’s main author .
“ Chemistry is basically all about the transfer of electrons from one atom to another or one molecule to another .
Those reactions are called ‘ redox ’ reactions . ”
According to Borguet , one important place where these reactions occur is on an electrode surface .
For example , metal corrosion is essentially oxidation .
Corrosion can sometimes be reversed by reducing the oxides and reclaiming the metal .
“ Most of our studies of oxidation and reduction basically involve measuring the flow of electrons in and out of bulk chemical systems , ” he says .
“ We ’ve never really looked at this at the single molecule level , looking at it one molecule at a time .
And it was n’t necessarily clear that we could do that . ”
As part of their research , Borguet and his collaborator were looking on a metal electrode surface at porphyrins , an important class of molecules that are involved in a number of biological processes , and in fact , can act as a catalyst for these processes .
The Temple researchers used scanning tunneling microscopy , in which a sharp metal tip scans the electrode surface and measures the passage of electrons from the tip , through the molecules , to the metal surface .
They noted that the chemical state of the molecule changes the ability of the electrons to pass from the metal tip to the electrode .
“ We noticed that some of these molecules , under certain conditions , appeared dark while others appeared bright , ” noted Borguet .
“ What we essentially figured out was that the molecules change color and appear dark when we apply a potential to the electrode that begins to oxidize , or essentially pull out an electron from , the molecule .
So now it seems that we can see the difference between oxidized molecules — the dark ones — and reduced molecules — the bright ones . ”
Borguet says that by gaining a handle on the molecules ’ chemical state , researchers now have the ability to identify oxidized and reduced molecules , and to track them individually .
“ As researchers , we can now ask questions such as ‘ Do molecules oxidize one at a time or do entire domains or areas on the surface oxidize together " ’ , ” he says .
“ Do they oxidize in pairs or in clusters "
If one molecule oxidizes , is it going to make the oxidation of a neighboring molecule more or less likely "
What is the timescale under which these processes occur and what factors facilitate redox reactions ? ”
Borguet believes the Temple researchers are the first to observe and understand this interfacial electron transfer process at the single molecule level .
“ We think if you look back in the literature and at other peoples ’ data there is some evidence for this , but I do n’t think they actually recognized that they were observing this process , ” he says .

A Different Kind of Reading List
I
love biographies .
I am really a sucker for stories related to the
creation of great software and hardware .
These books provide me with
inspiration that great things are possible .
Here are some of my favorites :
Revolution in the Valley
The
Apple Macintosh is arguably one of the greatest software / hardware
creations of all time .
This book ( one of my favorites ) contains a ton
of stories told by the people that created the Apple Macintosh
computer .
Its origins started on the web site www.folklore.org.
Check out this web site for stories of the Mac .
Postmortems
One
of my favorite magazines is Game Developer Magazine .
The reason it is
my favorite is because of the monthly column called Postmortem .
Every
issue highlights the process of creation of a game pointing from two
perspectives .
What went right and what went wrong .
Game developers face
the same issues that line of business developers face : tough deadlines ,
new tools , process problems and other recurring themes from our
profession .
This book contains dozens of these postmortems culled from the magazine over the years .
Showstopper
The
creation of Windows NT marked one of the greatest milestones in the
history of Microsoft Windows .
This book by Pascal Zachary tells the
stories of the architects , designers and developers of Windows NT .
With all the problems with Windows Vista Microsoft should put Dave Cutler back in charge ( read the book and you 'll know why )
High Stakes No Prisoners
Before www.myspace.com
( the web site where every page looks like a ransom letter ) there
existed an application that enabled neophyte developers create there
own web pages ( that also looked like ransom letters < G > ) with
just a few simple clicks and a very intuitive interface .
This book
documents the process of creating Microsoft FrontPage .
Microsoft did
not originally create Microsoft FrontPage .
Microsoft FrontPage was
purchases from a company called Vermeer .
This book shows the process
that Vermeer went through when creating .
FrontPage .
It also gives a
history of some tools we still use today .
FrontPage extensions anyone ?
Making the Xbox
The XBOX is one of the best things to come out of Microsoft in the most recent history .
( With the exception of the .NET of course < G > )
This book documents the creation of the first XBOX .
It discusses the design work , the production process and risks involved in creating something truly great .
I like this book because it reinforces the idea that great things come from small teams .
Soul of a New Machine
This
book was the inspiration for the book Showstopper .
It documents the
creation of the Data General minicomputer .
This book , written in
1981 ( practically the dawn of the computer industry as we know it ) tells
the story of creating a new 32 bit minicomputer this book is all about
the blood sweat and tears that come with creating something great .
I Sing the Body Electronic
There
was a day when creating content for CDs ( yes CDs ) was a new and
innovative field of work .
Anyone remember the game Manhole ?
This book
documents the process of creating a new children 's multimedia title at
Microsoft .

New week , a new abdz .
' Raw Design Inspiration ' to kick it off .
No theme , absolutely ' raw ' inspiration .
Being an abdz. , inspiration is one of the biggest fuels in my everyday life .
Whatever it is for life and work balance , it comes in many shapes and forms .
For me , I do appreciate a good surf on Dribbble .
At the Lusaka sewage ponds , two teenage boys plunge their hands into the dark brown sludge , gathering up fistfuls and stuffing it into small plastic bottles .
They tap the bottles on the ground , taking care to leave enough room for methane to form at the top .
A sour smell rises in the hot sun , but the boys seem oblivious to the stench and the foul nature of their task .
" It lasts about an hour " , says one user , 16 - year - old Luke Mpande , who prefers Jenkem to other substances .
" With glue , I just hear voices in my head .
But with Jenkem , I see visions .
I see my mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life . "
Symptom of poverty
Sniffing sewage is a symptom of the desperate plight of Zambia 's street - children .
There are thought to be some 75,000 in the country as a whole - a number that has doubled in the past eight years .
Sikwanda Makono is an education specialist at the Ministry of Health .
" Now that the economy is going down , we see more and more of our younger boys going into the streets .
" And girls too .
If you drive around at night , you see very young girls looking for men , to merely get something to survive . "
Abandoned
Children are sent out onto the streets to earn a living , or treated cruelly by relatives already struggling to support their own families , or simply abandoned by parents , who cannot afford to feed and clothe them .
Victor Chinyama of the United Nations Children 's Fund in Lusaka says it is imperative that the Zambian government gets to grips with this problem .
" So far , one does n't get the feeling that this has been recognised as priority , or as a problem that needs to be nipped in the bud , " he says .
" This problem is on the rise and the sooner it is dealt with , the better . "
Temporary respite
Substance - abuse offers a temporary respite in an otherwise harsh world .
Nobody knows exactly where the idea for making Jenkem came from , but it has been used by street - children in Lusaka for at least two years .
Nason Banda of the Drug Enforcement Agency is not proud when he says that it is unique to Zambia .
He shudders when he sees the boys at the sewage ponds , scavenging for faecal matter to make Jenkem .
" It 's unimaginable " he says .
" It hits right at the heart to see a human being coming down a level , to be able to dip his hand into a sewage pond , picking out the material and not caring about anything but the feeling of getting high . "
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
You 've got to love the stock market .
Just about 10 days ago - on July 19 , to be exact - the Dow Jones industrials closed above 14,000 for the first ( and so far only ) time and the financial world was full of happy chatter .
Then , almost before you could catch your breath ( or cash in your profits ) , we had last week , with the Dow dropping 585 points and the total stock market ( as measured by the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 ) losing a cool $ 1 trillion in value .
One day , the sky 's the limit .
The next day , the sky is falling .
How is a retail investor - which most of us are - supposed to think about this ?
I 've been writing about markets and playing around with stocks for close to 40 years , but I have no clue where the market will go next .
I do know two things , however .
First , that the worst way to invest is to buy when optimism fills the air like it did two weeks ago , and to sell out when everyone 's predicting the end of the world , like last week .
If you do that , you get whipsawed by buying dear and selling cheap .
The second thing I know is that you should n't freak out when you see triple - digit moves in the Dow , either up or down .
As the market has climbed over the past 20 years - the first triple - digit Dow move came in October , 1987 - a 100 - point move has become less and less significant because the overall market is so much higher than it was .
Consider , if you will , the table at the bottom of this page , whipped up for me by the folks at Aronson + Johnson +
Ortiz , a Philadelphia money management firm .
As you can see , three - digit moves , once rarities , have become relatively common .
You can also see that 100 points means progressively less in percentage terms - and to be an intelligent investor you need to think in percentage terms , not react viscerally to triple - digit Dow moves .
Let me show you how little 100 Dow points mean , by explaining how Dow Jones determines the Dow number .
The Dow's an arithmetic average , which you calculate by adding up the prices of the 30 Dow stocks and dividing the sum by the " Dow divisor . "
As of Friday , that wonderfully - precise number , which changes frequently , was 0.123017848 .
( Some day , I 'll tell you how Dow Jones determines the divisor .
But this is n't the day . )
This means that a $ 1 change in any Dow stock moves the average by about 8.13 points ( that 's 1 divided by the divisor ) .
So if the average price of all 30 issues changes by 42 cents - which is n't much - you get a three - digit move in the Dow .
( Want to verify that ?
Multiply 0.42 by 30 , then divide the product , 12.6 , by the Dow divisor .
Is n't this fun ? )
To give you another example of how drops that are big in absolute terms are n't all that big in relative terms , consider the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 .
The 5 K , the most accurate measure of the overall U.S. stock market , includes all U.S. stocks , rather than just the 30 Dow industrials or the 500 in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index .
On Wednesday , when the Dow dropped a sickening 311 points ( its 16th - biggest one - day point drop ever ) , the Wilshire racked up its 18th biggest one - day drop in points - but only the 90th biggest drop in percentage terms .
One way to protect yourself against Dow Freakout is to have assets other than stocks in your investment portfolio .
During rapidly - rising stock markets , like the bull market that started in October of 2002 and that I think ended last week , money funds and high - quality bonds drag down your overall performance because they return much less than stocks do .
But they protect you during a declining market .
If you bail out of stocks entirely because of the Dow 's down days , you run the risk of missing the next bull market .
Which will come sooner or later .
So when will I be writing a piece warning you not to get carried away by the Dow 's triple - digit gains ?
Beats me .
If I knew that , I 'd be a professional investor , not a professional writer .
Triple - digit Dow days

Amnesty says 24 child offenders have been executed in Iran since 1990
In a new report , it says Iran is the only country to have executed child offenders so far this year .
It lists the names of 71 other child offenders it says are known to be facing the death penalty .
The organisation defines a " child offender " as a person convicted of crimes they committed when they were under the age of 18 .
In a report entitled Iran : the Last Executioner of Children , Amnesty says that since 1990 , 24 child offenders have been executed in Iran - more than in any other country in the world .
CHILD EXECUTIONS IN IRAN
Two children executed so far this year 71 other child offenders face the death penalty 24 child offenders have been executed in Iran since 1990 Source : Amnesty International
Eleven of these people were still under 18 at the time of their execution , while the others were kept on death row until they reached 18 or were convicted and sentenced after reaching that age , the report says .
" Only three other countries have executed child offenders in the past three years according to information received by Amnesty International , " says Drewery Dyke of Amnesty International .
" In three years , Iran has executed more child offenders than all those other countries combined .
It 's now the case that as of June 2007 , Iran is the only country to have executed child offenders , having executed two in 2007 . "
Unpopular
Amnesty notes Iran denies executing children .
But it says it is calling on the Iranian authorities to halt further executions of child offenders and amend laws so no minors who commit crimes can be sentenced to death .
Amnesty 's Drewery Dyke says public opinion in Iran is increasingly opposed to the death penalty for those who commit crimes under the age of 18 .
" Iran is isolated in this regard .
And it 's a tragic isolation , because it does not seem to be what defenders in Iran want , it does not seem to be entirely what a large part of the judiciary wants .
" It 's a practice that is increasingly out of step with what Iranians themselves expect from their judicial system . "
Amnesty says a draft law proposed by the judiciary in 2001 and still under consideration by the Iranian authorities could pave the way for the abolition of the death sentence for minors - or at least result in a reduction in the number of offences for which child offenders could be sentenced to death .

Why do we have any barriers to using buses , trolleys , SkyTrain ?
The threat of global warming is no longer in doubt .
The hue and cry of the traffic jammed driver grows louder every commute .
Yet since 2000 , TransLink has hiked fares 50 per cent , and its board has just agreed to follow the staff ’s recommendation to raise them higher still .
That kind of thinking is so last century .
Just ask the mayor of San Francisco , a city similar in size to Vancouver , who ordered his staff to seriously explore the cost efficiency of no longer charging people to ride public transit .
Listen to Michael Bloomberg , mayor of New York , who recently voiced to a reporter his top dream : " I would have mass transit be given away for nothing and charge an awful lot for bringing an automobile into the city . "
Consider this sampling of communities providing free rides on trolleys , buses , trams , and ferries : Staten Island , NY ; Chapel Hill , North Carolina ; Vail , Colorado ; Logan and Cache Valley , Utah ; Clemson , South Carolina ; Commerce , California ; Châteauroux , Vitré , and Compiègne , France ; Hasselt , Belgium ; Lubben , Germany ; Mariehamn , Finland ; Nova Gorica , Slovenia ; Türi , Estonia ; Övertorneå , Sweden .
Or speak , as I have , with transit officials in locales of Washington State and Belgium , where Fare - Free Transit has hummed along smoothly now for years .
It 's time B.C. joined the trend because forcing people to pay ever higher fares is not just tough on the planet and people with tight budgets , it 's bad economics and self - defeating public policy , as I will explain in this five part series funded by a Tyee Fellowship for Solutions - oriented Reporting .
Tough sell ?
Over the course of the next few days , I 'll be doing my best to explain why taking the fare box out of our buses -- wherever you live in B.C. and beyond -- makes both dollars and sense .
Believe me , I know that 's a tough sell for skeptics .
Tyee Interview Listen to audio : Kathryn Gretsinger interviews Dave Olsen about the reasons for making transit free .
Just seven years ago TransLink stated that their " market research " indicated that people wanted to pay when boarding the bus .
But as Tania Wegwitz , senior transit planner in the Municipal Systems Program for BC Transit recently wrote : " Prepaid fares are better than cash fares , I do n't think there is anyone -- passengers , municipalities , transit staff -- who would disagree with you . "
Well , fare - free transit is simply the ultimate implementation of prepaid fares .
We would prepay for all public transit through taxes , and then we 'd ride for " free . "
Why Fare - Free Transit ?
Perhaps the skeptic in you is saying : without fares , public transit would run out of money and break down .
Or you worry that a free ride would attract riff - raff threatening other passengers ' safety and comfort .
Or you doubt that sober , number crunching officials would ever take the idea seriously .
By the time you are done reading this series , I will have shared real life examples and expert findings to counter all those concerns .
Fare - free transit brings many benefits , some of which include :
a barrier - free transportation option to every member of the community ( no more worries about exact change , expiring transfers , or embarrassment about how to pay ) eliminating a " toll " from a mode of transportation that we as a society want to be used ( transit is often the only way of getting around that charges a toll ) reducing the inequity between the subsidies given to private motorized vehicle users and public transport users reducing , and in some cases eliminating , the need for private motorized vehicle parking reducing greenhouse gas emissions , other air pollutants , noise pollution ( especially with electric trolleys ) , and run-off of toxic chemicals into fresh water supplies and ocean environments reducing overall consumption of oil and gasoline eliminating the perceived need to spend billions on roads and highways ( now up to $ 7 billion for the proposed Gateway Project in Vancouver ) eliminating the perceived need to spend billions on bigger car - carrying ferries ( $ 2.5 billion for BC Ferries ' new super - sized boats and ramps ) contributing significantly to the local economy by keeping our money in our communities reducing litter ( in Vancouver , the newer transfers / receipts have overtaken fast food packaging for most common garbage found on our streets ) saving trees by eliminating the need to print transfers and tickets allowing all bus doors to be used to load passengers , making service faster and more efficient allowing operators ( drivers ) to focus on driving safely giving operators more time to answer questions providing operators a safer work environment since fare disputes are eliminated eliminating fare evasion and the criminalization of transit - using citizens fostering more public pride in shared , community resources
Pampered cars
If it 's hard economic arguments you prefer , bear in mind that making use of free public transit eliminates the significant costs of fare collection and combating fare evasion ( more on this later in the series ) .
It also cuts costs associated with global warming , air and noise pollution , litter collection and garbage removal .
As our own premier trumpets a green agenda , more people are taking a hard look at just how many of their tax dollars subsidize the private car versus less polluting buses and trains .
You have to figure in roads , parking and other infrastructure , tax breaks for car and fuel companies , as well as subsidies for car ferries throughout the province and federal income tax reductions and write - offs for companies that use motor vehicles .
Todd Litman of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute has estimated that in 2000 the government subsidy to each private vehicle owner was about $ 5,378 in Canadian dollars .
In that year , the average cost of providing each trip taken by transit in Vancouver was approximately $ 5 .
The equivalent subsidy for transit users would have been 1,075 free trips .
Few of us could even use that many .
In fact , if the subsidy given private car owners were simply handed over to each car - free transit user , bus riders would make money for taking transit !
Why raising fares impoverishes the system
Big or small , most transit systems are scraping by or on the brink of financial collapse , paradoxically because of their reliance on the fare box .
Revenue for any system drops when ridership dips or when fares are increased .
Yes , when fares are increased .
This is so well proven it has a name : the Simpson - Curtain rule .
Most often the dip in ridership is caused by the hike in fares .
To understand this cycle better , let 's imagine that you are in charge of a transit system .
You feel pressure to increase service or to maintain service despite increasing costs .
You need to raise more money .
Politically and practically , for most systems , the easiest way is to raise fares .
But soon after , ridership goes down .
It drops 3.8 per cent for every 10 per cent increase in fares , researchers have found ( Cervero , R. , 1994 ) .
Which means you either have n't gained much new revenue , or worse , you 've started spiraling downward .
In 1955 and 1959 , fare increases helped send Vancouver 's transit system into an 11 - year tailspin , reducing ridership from 109 million trips in 1954 to less than 63 million in 1966 , a decrease of 42 per cent !
Further fare increases in 1970 , 1978 , and 1987 were followed by a decrease of 9 million , 7 million , and 13 million trips , respectively ( even with the new SkyTrain line ! ) .
More recently , in a context of explosive population growth and rapidly rising fuel prices , TransLink 's first two of three recent fare increases ( with another to come in 2008 ! ) in 2000 and 2002 resulted in 400,000 fewer riders in 2002 compared to 2000 .
Meanwhile , Toronto 's transit system went into a 12 - year downward spiral throughout the 1990s after a series of fare increases and resultant service cutbacks .
The Transit Cooperative Research Program creates expert panels ( appointed by the Transportation Research Board in Washington , DC ) to solve operating problems , to adapt appropriate new technologies from other industries , and to introduce innovations into the transit industry .
In their 2004 publication , Traveler Response to Transportation System Changes , the chapter on Transit Pricing and Fares clearly documents how fare increases always result in lower ridership .
Reality check
What the trends above tell us is that if you want a strong public transit system , then we need to figure out how to slash or eliminate the fares riders pay .
That said , let 's make a few important guiding principles clear :
Taking the farebox out of any bus without a plan is just a recipe for disaster .
That 's why we 'll be looking at operations like Island Transit on Whidbey Island that have proven beyond doubt that fare - free systems can be safe , clean and very friendly .
Making transit free of charge wo n't in itself allow huge numbers of people to abandon their cars .
We 'll need more public transit vehicles , running more frequently , too .
The decade - old experience in Hasselt , Belgium , has shown that investing in the service prior to the removal of the fare boxes not only makes the transition smoother , it will get people on the bus and out of their cars .
We need to pay , one way or another .
There is n't a transit system on the planet that pays for itself solely through the fare box .
If we want a transit system that is adequate , reliable , and gets those lonely drivers out of their cars , we need to find funding formulas that are adequate and reliable .
From Aukland , New Zealand 's Residents Action Movement to Scotland 's Socialist Party and Vancouver 's own Bus Riders Union , advocates are putting cheap and abundant public transit on politicians ' agendas .
To sample the utopia they imagine , I took a trip by bus and public transit to Whidbey Island , Washington and visited Island Transit , fare - free since 1987 .
More on that tomorrow .

Hugo and Nebula Award - winning author Kim Stanley Robinson
What better way to initiate the summer reading season than with a science - fiction trilogy on the potential horrors of global warming ?
The final installment of Kim Stanley Robinson 's latest series , which includes Forty Days of Rain , Fifty Degrees Below and Sixty Days and Counting , came out in paperback in April .
The novels rival his award - winning Mars trilogy in their vivid evocation of another world .
But this time the world is Earth , dramatically but all - too - believably altered following sudden climate change .
Sixty Days and Counting culminates Robinson 's most ecologically minded trilogy , and contains many provocative ideas for saving the Earth should glaciers suddenly begin melting .
Wired News spoke with the author by phone about the potential real - life applications of his fantastic ideas regarding environmentalism , geo-engineering and our terrestrial future .
Wired News :
You use the analogy of falling from a cliff when discussing humanity and climate change .
Do you think coming changes will be so abrupt ?
Kim Stanley Robinson :
It 's not the best analogy .
But when I'm in the Sierras , because of the way the glaciers carved the landscape , you come to points where it's a difficult down - climb off a promontory to a better situation .
That 's probably what history in the 21st century is going to be like .
Many of the technologies we 've invented are necessary to keep 6.5 billion people alive .
We can't go back from that , so we need to decarbonize really rapidly .
WN : One of the main characters in the new trilogy is Frank Vanderwal , a scientist who leads a radical National Science Foundation initiative to respond , immediately and on a planetary scale , to climate change .
Vanderwal becomes heavily influenced by Buddhist thought , and his own lifestyle becomes a form of Freganism – living without a single permanent home , communing in a deeply spiritual way with nature , accepting change and valorizing adaptability , living off the excess of our own over - producing society .
Do you feel this to be the ideal mentality and lifestyle for a time of radical climate change ?
Robinson :
He 's a character in a comedy who takes things too far .
A lot of scientists act on their beliefs and so do things that look crazy to the rest of us .
He 's basically following the right line – but without going homeless or moving into a treehouse , all of us can look at the way we live and adjust accordingly .
That 's what novels are for in the utopian sense : to suggest modes of thought so you can examine your own life and see what you can do .
WN : Many of the solutions you propose in the trilogy involve some pretty radical geo-engineering – seeding the Atlantic Ocean with salt to restart the Gulf Stream , releasing a genetically modified lichen that enables trees to absorb more CO2 by growing to titanic sizes .
Many people would be very unnerved by this approach , and worry that we could make things even worse for ourselves .
What would you say to them ?
Robinson : I 'd be one of those people .
We only have one planet to experiment with , and unexpected side effects and the consequences of these actions on a massive scale are so hard to predict .
In the new trilogy , the big projects they do – particularly the release of the engineered lichen – are incredibly dangerous and unadvisable .
What I wanted to suggest is that if things got desperate enough , there are governments that could decide to do things on their own and not wait for the rest of the world to approve .
That could get bad .
In terms of geo- engineering , there 's hardly a single project I think would be advisable .
But if we fail to decarbonize , and it's 5 or 7 degrees hotter in 2050 , there will be scientists and engineers saying they can fix it all with a silver bullet .
And then the idea will be on the table .
If you pour salt in the North Atlantic because it 's gotten too fresh and stalled the Gulf Stream , as in my book , then you 're doing something relatively benign and un-dangerous .
Salt would quickly diffuse ; it would n't change much in the environment .
It would be an attempt at remediation .
WN : In the Mars trilogy , you focus a lot on scientific advances that allow people to live far longer than is currently possible , as well as the mental and spiritual consequences such extensions would have .
In the latest trilogy , with humanity faced by an immediate threat to its collective survival , such person - oriented advances are absent .
Does this reflect your thinking these days ?
Robinson : I think we do see in the health sciences a most amazing potential for better health , resulting in longer , healthier lifetimes .
The kind of sci - fi magic pill I described in Red Mars , where you instantly get longevity doubled , is not likely to happen – but the gradual increasing of healthy lifetimes is a clear possibility .
That 's one of the ironies of our time :
Right when we 're on the edge of serious improvements in health care , we 're also cooking the planet .
WN : One of the main characters in the Mars trilogy is Anne , who insists on maintaining the purity of Mars , free from human interference .
You treat her sympathetically , even though she desires something that is impossible , given the scale of human planetary impact .
Is sentiment such as Anne 's possible , or laudable , at this point in time on our own planet ?
Robinson : I think it 's too pure , too caught up in a dichotomy of sacred and profane , where you call some things pure and sacrifice everything else to them .
On Earth , I do n't think that works .
I was really astounded by reading in Charles Mann 's 1491 of how completely the New World was a human landscape – that we 've been terra - forming and gardening the planet for a lot of human history .
Now we 're tremendously powerful at it , but we 've always been powerful .
Places you think of as virgin wilderness , these were humanized landscapes – parks , not wilderness .
When we think of wilderness , we should think of it as a particular kind of park , where we minimize human impacts to see what happens .
I believe in wilderness , but as a kind of ethical position rather than a natural state .
We could develop everywhere , but I hope we choose not to , so as to create biodiversity and diversity for humans .
I understand Anne 's feelings about Mars , but that same impulse on Earth rests on an improper comprehension of how humans interact with the earth .
We should conceive of ourselves not as rulers of Earth , but as highly powerful , conscious stewards :
The Earth is given to us in trust , and we can screw it up or make it work well and sustainably .
Something I 've been more and more aware of as we face the mass extinction that we 're about to start is that animals and landscapes need legal and philosophical representation as crucial parts of ourselves .
WN : How do you cultivate this sense in society if , for instance , you live in Brooklyn and the animals you see are rats and seagulls ?
Robinson : I 'd love those rats and seagulls as our horizontal brothers and sisters .
That 's a truly depleted ecology at that point , but you want to encourage the feral cats and raccoons .
Where I live , even though it 's a fully humanized little city , there 's a fair amount of species that get along as suburban creatures .
Here in California , we too have killed the animals and destroyed their habitat – we need our industrial agriculture to change , to include travel zones , habitat zones , so that you can create a civilization coexisting in the same space with other animals .
WN : In the new trilogy , the U.S. government embarks on a New Deal - style initiative to prevent the climate from going more awry than it already has .
Many people dream of this now – but in the books , it only happens when the United States experiences storms and weather patterns more catastrophic than ever seen before .
Is that what it 'll take for us to engage climate change in a meaningful way ?
Robinson : I hope not .
That 's going to be too late .
I 'm hoping the scientific community continues to go off like a fire alarm in a hotel , just as they have for the last five years , and that that will do the trick .
If they do , the democracies , the political leadership and even big business will all recognize that this is a real threat .
And we 're seeing enough of the effects , even without catastrophic weather .
Take glaciers , for example , which are melting so fast , and it turns out they are the source of water for one - third of the world 's population .
Even India and China therefore have compelling reasons to get serious .
Their own populations will be hammered by the loss of the Himalayan glaciers .
So many effects are combining .
I do n't think we need the kind of minus - 50 - degree winter I described in the books .
Humanity is sane , and can make use of its intelligence .
We have to act as if this is true .
That 's the whole story of the 21st century :
Are we a sane civilization or not ?

Multiprocessor computers are readily available .
Most personal computers already have specialized multiprocessor systems with additional processors handling features such a as graphics or sound .
To better use the power inherent in multiprocessor systems , languages with concurrent tasking must be developed .
The concept of concurrent programming also serves us well on single processor systems .
Many programming projects are best thought of as multitasking jobs , perhaps with intertask communication .
A familiar example of multitasking is the MS - DOS print facility , which copies a file to the line printer while the computer is being used for other tasks .
In a single processor environment , the concurrent tasks are interleaved ( time shared ) .
This article discusses the design and implementation of a concurrent LISP interpreter ( CLI ) based on a construct that allows simultaneous evaluation of a list of LISP forms ; see Listing One. CLI also allows for intertask communication .

A Note on Error Handling in CLI ;
The most common error is stack - group - overflow , i.e. , running out of ; memory space .
Try reducing the size of each stack group ( see function make - stack - groups ) r
Whe ' a ' erro occur withi ' concurren ?
; task tw problem result .
; First , the GCLisp error handling routines were not designed to work ; with stack groups .
In particular , you cannot use Control - G to move up ; one listener level .
This is because the listeners use the catch - throw ; construct , and the catch is in the original stack group ( the one which ; initiated concurrent execution ) not the one which contains the error .
;
You can use cntrl - C to return to the top - level of the original stack ; group , but then you are confronted with problem two .
; When a stack group is exhausted , its name is unbound ( in function ; switch - around ) in order to reclaim the memory used .
However , if there ; is an error , this unbinding will be skipped .
Worse , GCLisp contains ; an apparent bug which does not allow reclamation of memory used by a ; stack group which terminates by being broken ( i.e. , with an error ) ; instead of by exhaustion .
Thus , any stack group which terminates in an ; error will continue to occupy ( waste ) memory .
The only solution to this ; problem is to exit GCLisp and restart . ;; C. 1986 by Andrew P. Bernat . ;;

From the front page today 's WSJ
, an article about the oversupply of lawyers , " Job Market Wanes for U.S. Lawyers ; Law Schools Proliferate : "
" On the supply end , more lawyers are entering the work force , thanks in part to the accreditation of new law schools and an influx of applicants after the dot - com implosion earlier this decade .
In the 2005 - 06 academic year , 43,883 Juris Doctor degrees were awarded , up from 37,909 for 2001 - 02 , according to the American Bar Association ( see chart above ) .
Universities are starting up more law schools in part for prestige but also because they are money makers .
Costs are low compared with other graduate schools and classrooms can be large .
Since 1995 , the number of ABA - accredited schools increased by 11 % , to 196 . "
MP : Now , if we could only have an outcome similar to this for medical schools and graduates from medical school , which have remained constant at 125 schools and 16,000 graduates , respectively , for at least the last 20 years ( see chart above ) .
Unfortunately
,
According to an article in today ’s Washington Post :
WASHINGTON — More than 70,000 bridges across the country are rated structurally deficient like the span that collapsed in Minneapolis , and engineers estimate repairing them all would take at least a generation and cost more than $ 188 billion .
One prominent blogger is appalled :
This is the kind of disaster that just does n’t happen in the United States–a bridge spontaneously collapsing , apparently , into a river .
It is hard to convey to those who do n’t live here the astonishment of this sort of catastrophe happening on our most traveled highway .
No , this kind of thing never happens in America .
Ever !
But if it did , it would be the fault of the Democrats ( if you wondered what all those dementors are going to be doing now that their services are no longer required at Azkaban , it looks like some of them have landed work writing press releases at the White House ) .
But hey , at least we can count on our leader in a time of crisis not to politicize a tragedy for political gain .
So we got that going for us .
Where was I before I digressed ?
Ah , right – this never happens in America .
Well , almost never :
Let ’s see , any other interesting items in the “ crumbling infrastructure ” file ?
Well , there was that little steampipe thingie a few weeks ago , but that was only 83 years old .
Anyway , $ 188B – that ’s a lot of money .
Taxpayer money .
And we simply can’t afford that kind of reckless spending .
Errr , hold on , we just found this :
One thing is certain about the Iraq war :
It has cost a lot more than advertised .
In fact , the tab grows by at least $ 200 million each and every day .
So , according to my calculator , what we ’re spending in Iraq would pay for all those bridges by around Christmastime , 2009 .

Feature Sixty years ago , a former tank sergeant named Mikhail Kalashnikov submitted an assault - rifle design to the Red Army for trials .
It was selected as the new personal weapon for most Soviet soldiers , and designated Automat Kalashnikova 1947 – AK47 for short .
That designation went out of official use in 1959 , but to this day “ AK47 ” is probably the world 's most widely - known gun name .
Just as open - source Linux - the " communist " software , according to Steve Ballmer - has made Linus Torvalds famous , the genuinely communist open - source AK has given Mikhail Kalashnikov a profile at least as high .
The AK47 and its successor designs are the most widely - used firearms on the face of the planet .
El Reg meets the general .
The ubiquitous AK has been seen as one of the most influential pieces of technology produced in the 20th century .
People have made amazing claims for it : the Kalashnikov is said to have humbled US military and economic power , to have liberated the downtrodden and oppressed , to have changed the very face of warfare .
Dozens of books have been written about the AK phenomenon , hundreds or perhaps thousands of articles .
Only one thing has been lacking in the AK discussion .
That is , analysis from the debatable borderlands where technology , social phenomena and enormous , rumbling , erratically - researched commentary / analysis spitball articles collide : the land of Vulture Central .
But today it shall lack no more .
The Nazis were arguably the first to field an assault rifle in significant numbers ( See the Reg gun - dork primer here ) , but they dropped out of the picture in 1944 .
The Russians did n't : which is where Mikhail Kalashnikov and the AK47 come in .
By the end of World War Two , the Red Army had become enormous .
Its millions of short - service , poorly trained conscript soldiers were largely armed with cheap submachineguns knocked out in a hurry .
As the Soviets squared up to the Western powers , they knew that their troops – and those of their client nations – would need better weapons .
They decided on an intermediate - power cartridge , so as to minimise costs and maximise capability .
Having a very low level of marksmanship among their forces , they were n’t much concerned with accuracy or range .
The design they chose was the AK47 , firing intermediate - poke Soviet 7.62 mm cartridges , and it could n't have fulfilled the requirement better .
The AK could hit targets out to perhaps 200 - 300 m .
( AK47 sights are adjustable to 800 m , later increased to 1000 m on the AKM , but this is wildly optimistic . )
The new weapon could spray bullets efficiently on full automatic , seldom suffering a stoppage .
It was simple to strip and maintain , and worked pretty well even without any maintenance , covered in mud , dirt or rust .
Best of all , it could be made very cheaply and easily .

This , below , is the original text of my SSD endurance article published in March 2007
Does the fatal gene of " write endurance " built into flash SSDs prevent their deployment in intensive server acceleration applications ?
It was certainly true as little as a few years ago ( 2005 ) .
What 's the risk with today 's devices ?
Flash based solid state disks would seem to be the ideal virtual storage device ...
In every other respect you can treat them in exactly the same way as a hard drive :- same interface , same software model .
They even fit mechanically into the same standard hard drive slots .
And in many ways they are better - significantly faster , consuming less electric power and more tolerant of ambient temperature and vibration extremes .
You mostly do n't need to know about what 's inside them .
They are the perfect " fit and forget " storage product .
In the smaller form factors like 1.8 " and 2.5 " - the gap in capacity between SSDs and hard drives has disappeared .
If it was n't for the price you 'd use them - right ?
( The user value propositions - explaining why SSDs can be significantly cheaper to buy and own in a wide variety of applications are discussed in another article . )
What 's wrong with this utopian vision ?
And why is it that even if you were offered a flash SSD accelerator for your server absolutely FREE you might still hesitate about installing it ?
The answer explains why the flash SSD server acceleration market still is n't a billion dollar plus market - even 4 years after I first posed this exact same question .
When you look in more detail at flash SSDs there is just one skinny dark stormcrow hanging around the edge of this picture which makes you feel uneasy about a technology which in other respects is acquiring an untarnished reputation .
That 's the prickly issue of write endurance .
Write Endurance : -
The number of write cycles to any block of flash is limited - and once you 've used up your quota for that block - that 's it !
The disk can become unreliable .
In the early days of flash SSDs managing this was a real headache for oems and users .
The maximum number of write cycles to an address block - the endurance - was initially small ( about 10,000 write cycles in 1994 , rising to 100,000 in 1997 ) .
And the capacity of flash storage was small too .
So the write endurance limit was more than just a theoretical consideration .
In the worst case - you could destroy a flash SSD in less than a week !
But in those days the SSD was being designed in by electronics engineers who knew exactly how the SSD was going to be used .
If it helped solve the problem they could even rewrite the software a different way to lessen the risk .
But when you buy an SSD for use in a notebook or server - you do n't write the software .
You do n't control the data .
So how do you know in advance if you 're going to hit that brick wall ?
This fear is an issue which has slowed down the adoption of flash SSDs in commercial server acceleration applications .
Write endurance does n't affect RAM based SSDs - which have until now dominated that part of the market - mainly due to their superior speed .
But the speed of flash SSDs has improved to the point where they could replace RAM based SSDs in many server acceleration slots at a much lower price - if it was n't for the worry about endurance .
Write endurance has been a FUD issue for potential enterprise server users .
They know it 's lurking there - but who can they trust to quantify the problem in their own language ?
Server makers did n't want users to know about SSDs ( any type - period ) during 2000 to 2006 - because more SSDs meant selling less servers .
In the 2005 edition of the SSD Buyers Guide I wrote about the problem ...
" One disadvantage , compared to RAM SSDs is that flash has an intrinsic limit on the total number of write cycles to a particular destination .
The limit varies , according to manufacturer but is over millions of cycles in the most durable products .
Internal controllers within the flash SSD manage this phenomenon and can reallocate physical media transparently to prolong media life .
In most applications , high endurance flash SSDs can have a reliable operating life which is typically 3 times as high as that of a hard drive .
But I would hesitate about installing a flash SSD as a server speedup in a university maths research department , for example , or in other applications where the ratio of data writes to data reads is unusually high . "
In May 2006 I came to the conclusion that my earlier doubts may need to be revised .
It was clear from reader emails and negative comments about SSDs which I saw in other publications that fear and doubt about the impact of write endurance was slowing down adoption of flash SSDs in the server acceleration market .
It was also clear that most users did n't know how to interpret the kind of data being offered by SSD oems - which was designed for an elite audience of electronics designers - and not for managers of storage systems .
So I contacted all flash SSD oems with the idea of setting up a standard way of presenting endurance life expectancy data - with a proposal which I called the " SSD Half Life . "
That dialog met with some enthusiasm but there was n't enough vendor support to take it further .
The SSD oems I talked to took reliability very seriously - but did n't want their own proprietary reliability schemes and models swamped by a general industry wide scheme .
The way that SSD oems deal with the management of write endurance internally within their products varies but they all have the common theme of scoring how many times a block of memory has been written to , and then reallocating physical blocks to logical blocks dynamically and transparently to spread the load across the whole disk .
In a well designed flash SSD you would have to write to the whole disk the endurance number of cycles to be in danger .
Some manufacturers go a step further .
SiliconSystems has a patented algorithm which delivers a lifetime which it claims is better than simplistic wear levelling .
Another manufacturer Adtron actually has a percentage of spare flash blocks in the SSD - which are invisible to the host interface and do n't show up as spare storage .
But internally - when blocks get close to the limit - the data is transparently switched over to the spare parts of the disk to give an additional breathing space .
The precise numbers are a proprietary secret but are based on analyzing the software from real customers ' SSD applications over many years .
OEMs , like these , which target high reliability applications , are also more picky about which flash chips they use , and qualify them according to the results they see from testing .
the Flash SSD Application from Hell * - the Rogue Data Recorder
In most real - life applications the computer does a lot more reads from disk than writes - and the duty cycle ( that 's the percentage of time that the disk is being accessed at all ) is low .
But to estimate whether you should be worried about write endurance with today 's SSD technology I 've chosen a worst case example - the Rogue Data Recorder .
Real hard disk based data recorders from companies like Conduant can record data continuously in an endless loop .
They are useful for a bunch of applications such as capturing pre-trigger data in seismic events , capturing unpredictable data for modelling and bugging phone calls .
I managed a company in the mid 80s which pushed storage technology to its limits to get wire speed continuous recording onto disk and massive memory systems with inbuilt real - time trigger processors , embedded workstations and array processors for various types of industries and agencies .
That was a good education for my day job now of cutting and pasting .
Most of you would n't set out to design a real - time data recorder - and if you are doing that - this article is n't going to tell you anything you do n't already know .
But by looking at the worst thing which could happen and estimating a confidence boundary from that - it can tell you how much you need to worry .
The nightmare scenario for your new server acceleration flash SSD is that a piece of buggy software written by the maths department in the university or the analytics people in your marketing department is launched on a Friday afternoon just before a holiday weekend - and behaves like a data recorder continuously writing at maximum speed to your disk - and goes unnoticed .
How long have you got before the disk is trashed ?
For this illustrative calculation I 'm going to pick the following parameters :-
Configuration :- a single flash SSD .
( Using more disks in an array could increase the operating life . )
Write endurance rating :- 2 million cycles .
( The typical range today for flash SSDs is from 1 to 5 million .
The technology trend has been for this to get better .
When this article was published , in March 2007 , many readers pointed out the apparent discrepancy between the endurance ratings quoted by most flash chipmakers and those quoted by high - reliability SSD makers - using the same chips .
In many emails I explained that such endurance ratings could be sample tested and batches selected or rejected from devices which were nominally guaranteed for only 100,000 cycles .
In such filtered batches typically 3 % of blocks in a flash SSD might only last 100,000 cycles - but over 90 % would last 1 million cycles .
The difference was managed internally by the controller using a combination of over - provisioning and bad block management .
Even if you do n't do incoming inspection and testing / rejection of flash chips over 90 % of memory in large arrays can have endurance which is 5 x better than the minimum quoted figure .
Since publishing this article , many oems - including Micron - have found the market demand big enough to offer " high endurance " flash as standard products . )
AMD marketed " million cycle flash " as early as 1998 .
Sustained write speed :- 80 M bytes / sec
( That 's the fastest for a flash SSD available today and assumes that the data is being written in big DMA blocks . ) capacity :- 64G bytes - that 's about an entry level size .
( The bigger the capacity - the longer the operating life - in the write endurance context . )
Today single flash SSDs are available with 160G capacity in 2.5 " form factor from Adtron and 155G in a 3.5 " form factor from BiTMICRO Networks .
Looking ahead to Q108 - 2.5 " SSDs will be available upto 412GB from BiTMICRO .
And STEC will be shipping 512 GB 3.5 " SSDs .
To get that very high speed the process will have to write big blocks ( which also simplifies the calculation ) .
We assume perfect wear leveling which means we need to fill the disk 2 million times to get to the write endurance limit .
2 million ( write endurance ) x 64G ( capacity ) divided by 80 M bytes / sec gives the endurance limited life in seconds .
That 's a meaningless number - which needs to be divided by seconds in an hour , hours in a day etc etc to give ...
The end result is 51 years !
But you can see how just a handful of years ago - when write endurance was 20 x less than it is today - and disk capacities were smaller .
For real - life applications refinements are needed to the model which take into account the ratio and interaction of write block size , cache operation and internal flash block size .
I 've assumed perfect cache operation - and sequential writes - because otherwise you do n't get the maximum write speed .
Conversely if you are n't writing at the maximum speed - then the disk will last longer .
Other factors which would tend to make the disk last longer are that in most commercial server applications such as databases - the ratio of reads to writes is higher than 5 to 1 .
And as there is no wear - out or endurance limit on read operations - the implication is to increase the operating life by the read to write ratio .
As a sanity check - I found some data from Mtron ( one of the few SSD oems who do quote endurance in a way that non specialists can understand ) .
In the data sheet for their 32G product - which incidentally has 5 million cycles write endurance - they quote the write endurance for the disk as " greater than 85 years assuming 100G / day erase / write cycles " - which involves overwriting the disk 3 times a day .
How to interpret these numbers ?
With current technologies write endurance is not a factor you should be worrying about when deploying flash SSDs for server acceleration applications - even in a university or other analytics intensive environment .
How about RAID systems stuffed with flash SSDs ?
The calculation above gives the worst case ( shortest ) operating life based on stuffing data into a single disk at the fastest possible speed .
Having a faster interface coming into the a box stuffed with SSDs does n't make the life shorter - because the data can only be striped to any individual disk at the limiting rate for that disk .
Au contraire :- not only can an SSD RAID array offer a multiple of a single SSD 's throughput , and IOPs , just as with hard disks but depending on the array configuration the operating life can be multiplied as well - because not all the disks will operate at 100 % duty cycle .
That means that MTBF and not write endurance will be the limiting factors .
And although oem published MTBF data for hard disks has been discredited recently - the MTBF data for flash SSDs has been verified for over a decade in more discriminating applications in high reliability embedded systems .
I 've been waiting years for storage oems to start marketing flash SSD based storage arrays - as alternatives to RAM based systems .
What 's held that market back has been the looming shadow of write endurance .
That myth - that flash SSDs wear out - now belongs to the past .
... Later :- in May 2008 - in an exclusive interview with STORAGEsearch.com - AMCC 3 ware confirmed it is working with leading SSD oems to develop products which will support the unique needs of the flash SSD RAID market .
* clarifying why the Rogue Data Recorder is the Worst Case Application
I did n't need to explain this choice to those who design SSDs , but it 's clear from some comments I 've seen that some readers who do n't have an electronics / semiconductor education or do n't know enough about SSD internals have queried this choice .
Why , for example , does the data recorder example stress a flash SSD more than say continuously writing to the same sector ?
The answer is that the data recorder - by writing to successively sectors - makes the best use of the inbuilt block erase / write circuits and the external ( to the flash memory - but still internal to the SSD ) buffer / cache .
In fact it 's the only way you can get anywhere close to the headline spec data write throughput and write IOPS .
This is because you are statistically more likely to find that writing to different address blocks finds blocks that are ready to write .
If you write a program which keeps rewriting data to exactly the same address sector - all successive sector writes are delayed until the current erase / write cycle for that part of the flash is complete .
So it actually runs at the slowest possible write speed .
If you were patient enough to try writing a million or so times to the same logical sector - then at some point the internal wear leveling processor would have transparently assigned it to a different physical address in flash by then .
This is invisible to you .
You think you 're still writing to the same memory - but you 're not .
It 's only the logical address that stays the same .
In fact you are stuffing data throughout the whole physical flash disk - while operating at the slowest possible write speed .
It will take orders of magnitude longer wearing out the memory in this way than in the rogue data recorder example .
That 's because writing to flash is not the same as writing to RAM , and also because writing to a flash SSD sector is not the same as writing to a block of dumb flash memory .
There are many layers of virtualization between you and the raw memory in an SSD .
If you write to a dumb flash memory chip successively to the same location - then you can see a bad result quite quickly .
But comparing dumb flash storage to intelligent flash SSDs is like comparing the hiss on a 33 RPM vinyl music album to that on a CD .
They are quite different products - even though they can both play same music .
... Later :- Clarifying Flash Endurance Specifications
I 've added this footnote in response to some reader emails which asked about the variation in flash endurance specs quoted by different flash SSD oems .
Like any semiconductor related spec ( such as memory speed , or analog offset voltage in an op - amp , or failed memory blocks in a high density RAM chip ) - there 's a spread of performance which depends on the process and may vary over time in the same wafer fab , or at the same time when chips are made in different fabs within the same company .
A spec such as 100k or 1 million or 10 million erase - write cycles - is a business decision made according to market conditions - which gives generic semiconductor buyers a confidence level that if they buy 1 million chips - then the reject rate - of those that will fail due to process tolerances - will be acceptably low .
The shape of the distribution curve may not actually be gaussian - but there is a distribution curve in there which is implied by the published specs .
Due to process variations between oems ( some designs will be automatically shrunk from old designs , other layout geometries may be recompiled or optimized for that particular process point ) there will be vast differences between the endurance from different chipmakers .
As the generic semiconductor flash market does n't place a premium on this spec - the " datasheet " published standard number will gradually improve at a slow pace ( every 2 - 3 years ) even if some oems are making chips today which are 10 x better .
If I was designing a high reliability flash SSD - I would want to get into the process details - qualify devices and order them to my own spec .
Currently SSD volumes are too low - to give much buying power with flash chipmakers .
Therefore few SSD oems are able to buy flash chips qualified to their own specs .
( This is done by batch testing samples and by negotiation with the fab where the chips are made . )
Some SSD oems make their own flash chips - and while this gives them more control over the end to end process - it does not necessarily mean that they start with the best chips .

How come there are so many different and contradictory reliability claims ?
The House of Representatives on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution calling on President George W. Bush to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , this on the 40th anniversary of the Six Day War .
The Senate is expected to approve a similar motion later in the day .
In the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 Congress determined that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel and that the U.S. Embassy should be established there no later than May 31 , 1999 .
However , the Clinton and Bush administrations have refrained from moving the embassy for fear of riots against American embassies in Arab countries and a possible decline in the US 's status .
“ The House congratulates the citizens of Israel on the 40th anniversary of the Six Day War in which Israel defeated enemies aiming to destroy the Jewish State .
Jerusalem has been the focal point of Jewish religious devotion and the site of a continuous Jewish presence for over three millennia , with a Jewish majority since at least 1896 , ” the resolution said .
“ The vibrant Jewish population of the historic Old City of Jerusalem was driven out by force during the 1948 Arab - Israeli War .
In six days of war , Israel defeated those forces seeking its destruction and reunited the city of Jerusalem which had been artificially divided for 19 years . ”
Some July 7 brides say they believe they are being forced to pay a premium for services that would n’t cost as much on any other Saturday this summer .
“ Once we told them we were getting married on July 7 , the tone changed , ” said Esther Marius , from Brockton , Mass .
After calling 20 limousine companies , only to find that they were all committed to other weddings on July 7 , she ended up paying $ 400 more than she had planned to secure the 24 - passenger stretch limo she wanted to arrive in on her wedding day .
If it were n’t for the deposit she has already paid to the wedding hall , Ms. Marius said she would consider changing the date .
“ It ’s gotten to a point where we said if someone wants to buy the date , we ’ll sell it , ” she said .
“ We could get married the month before or the month after . ”
Others are n’t so flexible .
Jennifer McVay , social and travel sales manager at the Sagamore resort in Lake George , N.Y. , which is holding four weddings that day , said that at least three brides demanded to be put on a waiting list in case any of the weddings were called off .
One has even checked back to see if any of the other couples had decided to break up .
“ They ’re just desperate for that date , ” Ms. McVay said .
“ I really appreciate it ’s such a big day and it ’s really special — but I was surprised they were n’t as willing to move to another date . ”
She said several couples had already turned down her offer of July 6 , which has plenty of openings .

Among those who have had to scramble to find a place for their wedding on the 7th are Lisl Kludzuweit , 33 , and her fiancé , Artie Jones , 35 , both from Philadelphia .
After calling roughly half a dozen places only to find out that other couples had already taken them , Ms. Kludzuweit booked the Camden Windward House in Camden , Me. , sight unseen .
( Still to be found : a photographer who is free that day . )
Ms. Kludzuweit said it was important to her to secure this specific day for her wedding , despite the hassles .
The couple picked July 7 after finding out that a tumor removed from Ms. Kludzuweit ’s abdomen last year was benign .
“ For us it was symbolic , ” said Ms. Kludzuweit .
“ It just felt so lucky . ”

Marijuana Dealers Offer Schwarzenegger
One Billion Dollars August 6 --
A coalition of California marijuana growers and dealers has offered Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger one billion dollars to solve the current state budget crisis .
The group , calling itself Let Us Pay Taxes makes the offer through its web site LetUsPayTaxes.com .
The offer comes at a time when the California legislature is deadlocked on a new budget and California has stopped issuing checks for vitally needed social services .
Legislators are currently arguing over which programs will be cut in order to balance the budget .
“ It is ridiculous that California ca n’t pay its bills , ” said spokesman Clifford Schaffer .
“ It is a tragedy that they will cut badly needed services and programs such as medical care for the elderly and prison drug treatment when the money to fund all these programs and more is there and available .
Everyone who is currently waiting for a check from the state should be enraged at this foolishness . ”
Regulation and taxation of marijuana could produce six billion dollars in additional tax revenue , according to economic studies linked from their web site LetUsPayTaxes.com .
In addition , it could save up to ten billion dollars in enforcement costs .
“ That is a conservative estimate , ” said Schaffer .
“ By other estimates , the revenues could be five times that .
The economists are with us all the way on this one .
Marijuana prohibition is an economic disaster . ”
“ Let ’s face reality , ” Schaffer says .
“ Marijuana legalization is inevitable .
The situation is already beyond control in California .
The state and local authorities have offered safe harbor for medical marijuana use and the Federal Government simply does n’t have the resources for effective control . ”
More importantly , says Schaffer , the operators of the medical marijuana clubs are no longer afraid of the Federal Government .
“ If you talk to them , you will find that they know they are going to win this battle .
They know that the DEA is vastly outnumbered and ca n’t begin to prosecute all of them .
The few that are prosecuted are accepting their fate as martyrs because they know that what they are doing is right .
They are willing to sacrifice themselves to make the point that the Federal Government has just gone too far in interfering with very personal and private decisions .
There is no way the DEA is going to win this battle .
At this point , it is all over but the counting of the money – and the victims of the DEA . ”
Schaffer went on to say that the national market for marijuana has been estimated from a low of ten billion dollars per year to more than fifty billion dollars per year .
“ The first states to regulate and tax marijuana will receive an economic bonanza bigger than the original California Gold Rush , ” says Schaffer .
“ Some states will get rich like the Saudis . ”
Schaffer predicts that it will not take long for some local areas to wake up to the economic possibilities .
“ We are talking potentially big bucks here , ” he said .
“ The Canadians are already starting to take note of a cannabis - fueled economic boom in some areas .
Politicians can’t resist fresh cash , especially when it is coming to their local community .
There will be big winners and losers here .
The winners will be the ones who recognize the foregone conclusion first . ”
The group also cites foreign terrorism as a reason to regulate and tax marijuana .
“ Drug Czar John Walters is being dishonest when he says that marijuana money goes to criminals and terrorists .
The only reason any of that money goes to criminals or terrorists is because of the prohibition that Walters supports , ” said Schaffer .
“ Marijuana prohibition makes criminals rich just like alcohol prohibition did .
The criminals are now so rich and powerful that they can challenge the legitimate governments of their own countries .
There is no reason to send billions of dollars per year to foreign criminal gangs when patriotic Americans make the best products in the world .
There is no reason to suffer such a huge foreign trade deficit when that money could be providing jobs and funding badly needed services right here in the USA . ”
Let Us Pay
Taxes calls upon all US citizens to sign their petition at their web site http://LetUsPayTaxes.com and press the issue with their lawmakers .
“ Take the money , please , ” said Schaffer .
“ These people want to contribute .
Now it is up to our politicians to tell us why they want to send those billions to foreign criminal gangs rather than to their own voters . ”

Some people say the attempt to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney is n’t anything more than a charade by far - left Democrats .
That ’s not the case for U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison , who gets animated about the subject .
The freshman Democrat from Minneapolis has joined a dozen or so lawmakers as co-sponsors of a bill to impeach Cheney for “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
The alleged crimes are yet to be spelled out by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , who sponsored the bill late last month .
But Ellison accuses Cheney of “ abusing his power ” ¦and abstracting information . ”

Somewhere , sometime in life , everyone has a job they hate .
Whether the hours are terrible , the pay is awful , the coworkers are wretched , or the boss is horrid , hated jobs are very much a thing of the present .
We work them for different reasons , for different lengths of time , and with different levels of satisfaction , but almost all of us work them at some point .
For many people , these jobs are a drag that make them feel like hollow shells of their former selves .
However , there are a few people who manage to survive and thrive in jobs they really do n't like .
Here are a few of their secrets for making that hated job easier .
( See also : What to Do When You Want to Quit Your Job )
Know Why You 're There
Whether you took the job in the first place because you thought it was something other than it turned out to be or because you absolutely had to make rent and could n't do it any other way , knowing why you took the job will help you maintain perspective while you 're there .
Remembering the process that led up to your current situation : the job search , the interviews , your conversations with others about the job , your conversations with yourself about it , hearing that you had the job , your acceptance of it , and anything else you went through during that time will remind you that you are more than your job .
YOU took IT for a good reason .
If that reason is n't so good anymore , well , then it 's time to reevaluate .
But you can do that , because you are more than the job .
Know What You Really Want
Often , a terrible job will help you know what you would want in a good job .
So go ahead and note what these things are !
Are your current coworkers loud ?
Note that you would like a job where you can have quiet time to focus , at least when working on large projects .
Is your boss always second - guessing or changing your decisions ?
Note that you would like a job where employees are trusted and tasks are truly delegated .
Go through the process of actually writing these things down .
When you have a physical list of what you want , your current job wo n't seem so worthless .
After all , it helped you learn what to look for next !
Once you have this list , add to it the things you 've dreamed about doing .
Would you like a job that requires a lot of problem - solving instead of a set group of tasks ?
Include that .
Would you rather work for yourself ?
Note it .
Have you always dreamed of writing for a living ?
Put it down .
Whether you 're in a position to actually go out and look for another job or not , this list shows what you know about yourself , job - wise .
And knowing what you want is often the first step towards getting it .
Know Your Motivation for Staying
If you 're planning to stay in a job you dislike , it 's important that you know why .
Is your current job the only one in your area that fits your skills ?
Or do you need it to keep your children fed and clothed ?
Whatever the reason , remembering what it is and keeping it at the forefront of your consciousness makes working a difficult job easier .
When you do this , you end up working not for the job itself , but for whatever the motivation is behind your being there .
The job becomes more than a job : it becomes a way to fulfill whatever desire moved you to take it in the first place .
Make a Conscious Choice to Stay
Knowing your motivation also makes it possible for you to evaluate it .
Maybe you wanted a job close to home because you were newly married and wanted to spend as much time as possible with your new husband .
Now , he 's working regular hours and taking some night classes , so your short commute does n't net the two of your more time .
While working the hated job might have been worth it for the time together , it 's not when it does n't produce that result .
Or maybe you realize that you qualify for lots of different jobs of the same type that you 're working now , and you realize that a different work environment might make things much more tolerable .
Whatever your motivation , consider carefully whether it's enough motivation to stay at the job .
If your motivation is enough for you to keep the hated job , make staying a conscious choice .
Own your choice .
You do not HAVE to stay at the job , but you CHOOSE to .
And you know the reasons behind your choice , and that they are enough to outweigh the fact that you hate what you 're doing .
Deliberately choosing to stay will help you own the job .
It will help you to feel , in some small way , like you are doing what you want to do ( because you do want it , even if only from the perspective that it is better than any current alternative ) .
Make that Choice Again If You Have To
Even after you choose to stay , there will be parts of the job that you dislike .
Those parts may even make up the majority of your time there !
If you can notice those parts and notice the feelings of frustration / rage / anger / sadness / hopelessness / whatever that rise up in you , you can choose to make your choice again .
Run through the motivations , and the reasons why those motivations are worth it .
Remember that you are more than this job , that you chose it .
This is really hard ( particularly when you 're used to letting the negative emotions take over ) !
Stick with it .
Remember that you will fail sometimes , and go home complaining and pissed off again .
Over a long period of time , though , your choice will become the habit instead of the emotions .
Feel Your Feelings
When something comes up in your job that you hate , feel that .
Let yourself feel whatever emotion comes over you .
Do n't try to hide it inside , or it will just blow out later .
If you need to take a walk , or go to the restroom , or even put the emotion on an internal shelf to feel later ( just be sure to take it back out ! ) , do that .
Letting things build up until they might explode is never a good idea .
So let yourself feel .
And , in the midst of your feelings , remember your choice .
Remember why even these awful feelings are worth sticking it out .
Have Realistic Expectations
Do n't expect yourself to ever love your job .
Do n't think that you should be loving it so something must be wrong .
Instead , expect that you wo n't like it .
Expect that the things that have frustrated you since the first day will still frustrate you now and will probably continue to do so as long as you stay at the job .
If you expect that , the job will never sink below your expectations .
However , at this point , you know that you are more than the job .
You do n't expect all of your satisfaction to come from that , because there are more areas in your life than just that .
Take Advantage of Any " Extras " the Job Offers
Some jobs suck , but have great perks .
Right now , I work a job that I actually like ( well , most of the time ! ) .
But , even if I did n't like it , I 'd probably work here because it gets my husband huge discounts on his grad school tuition ( I work at the university ) .
Knowing that my working here helps us financially like that can make a big difference when I want to throw in the towel .
Different jobs have different perks , but almost every job has at least one .
My husband is a server at a local restaurant .
He does n't like it , but he gets to bring home any mistakes they make .
Knowing that we 'll get delicious pasta for lunch the next day often makes his shifts feel lighter and go faster .
I know it sounds crazy , but taking advantage even of these small things makes staying easier .
Personalize Your Space
Put up pictures of the people who are your motivation for working .
Decorate the walls of your cube with colorful material .
Decorate your computer screen with sayings that inspire you .
If your workplace wo n't allow any of those things , wear a locket with a special picture in it or carry one in your wallet .
Put something small and special in your pocket so you can at least touch it whenever you want .
These things help make your space , your computer , you person YOURS , and if they 're yours then they do n't belong to the horrible job that you hate .
Once again , these things help you feel like you are more than your job , help you remember why you 're really there , and help you choose to stay .
It 's pretty clear that no one wants to stay in a job they hate .
But if you choose to , whether because it satisfies some deeper motivation or because it 's the best of a bad situation , these ideas should help you thrive there without feeling dead inside .
The former head of the popular - yet - shady MP3 site Allofmp3.com is looking at some jail time and some hefty fines in his home country of Russia now that his site has been shut down .
The authorities say he owes the RIAA a bunch of money and was violating all sorts of copyright laws .
The only problem is , well , that he did n't actually break any Russian laws by running the site .
Advertisement
While he sold boatloads of copyrighted files from his site with virtually none of the revenues going to the copyright owners , he was actually giving 15 % of his revenue to the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems ( ROMS ) , a collecting agency similar to ASCAP here in the States .
If a record label went to ROMS and asked for their cut , they would have gotten it , but they would have had to agree that the whole situation was legit .
Even if they did n't think it was , it was how things worked in Russia , at least until the RIAA put pressure on the US government to put pressure on the Russian government to change their copyright laws .
Now the laws have been changed , Allofmp3.com has been shut down only to be replaced by a number of very similar sites , and Denis Kvasov is being prosecuted for breaking laws that did n't exist when his site was up and running .
Boy , what a heartwarming story !
But hey , if the Black Eyed Peas get a few more bucks in royalties out of this , I guess it 'll all be worth it , right ?

fold
Wrap input lines to fit in specified width , writes each FILE ( ' -' means standard input ) , or standard input if none are given , to standard output , breaking long lines .
Syntax fold [ options ] ... [ FILE ] ...
By default , ' fold ' breaks lines wider than 80 columns .
The output is split into as many lines as necessary .
' fold ' counts screen columns by default ; thus , a Tab can count more than one column , Backspace decreases the column count , and CarriageReturn sets the column to zero .
Options - b -- bytes Count bytes rather than columns , so that tabs , backspaces , and carriage returns are each counted as taking up one column , just like other characters .
-s -- spaces Break at word boundaries : the line is broken after the last blank before the maximum line length .
If the line contains no such blanks , the line is broken at the maximum line length as usual .
-w WIDTH -- width=WIDTH
Use a maximum line length of WIDTH columns instead of 80 .

Money Mistakes to Avoid – Procrastination
Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow ?
If that is your motto then this post is for you !
Time is Money
Even if you ’re not a procrastinator by nature , you ’ve probably had a time or two where putting something off cost you money .
Whether it ’s paying money you should n’t be because you forgot to cancel a subscription or missing out on compound growth because you have n’t setup a savings or investment plan , procrastination can be expensive !
In our busy lives , time goes by faster than you can blink .
Each birthday and tax season seems to come sooner than the last one .
Those months and years add up when you ’re talking about paying higher expenses or earning lower returns on your money .
Make a Decision
The reason we procrastinate is often because we do n’t know how to take the next step or do n’t know what to do .
We decide we need more information or want to “ think about it ” for a little while .
Before we know it , a little while turns into a long while and we still have n’t made a decision .
A great example of this is not signing up for a 401 k plan because you ’re not sure which funds to choose .
Smart Money magazine reported that procrastination is one reason almost half of employees do n’t participate in their 401k plan or contribute enough to get the company match .
I ’ve seen this in action myself .
Our 401k administrator offered a seminar on our plan and its options several years ago .
I was already investing and knew the plan options but attended to see if I could learn anything new .
Not much came out of the meeting other than the revelation one of my co-workers had n’t been putting any money into his 401k ever since he started working there because he did n’t know which funds to invest with !
Live & Learn
We got my co-worker putting at least enough to earn the company match into some index funds .
I pointed him towards a few personal finance websites and recommended a few good books on money to help him get more comfortable with his investing decisions .
Later on we talked about how he was glad he finally got started even though he did n’t know what he was doing .
A lot of times just taking some action is what it takes to get over the indecision that leads to procrastination .
You might not make the best decision possible but you learn from your choices and make changes accordingly .
Make Time for Your Money
If you have some financial decisions or actions you ’ve been putting off now is the time to take care of them .
I find what works for me is to make a prioritized list of the things I need to do and carry it around with me until I ’ve completed it .
You probably wo n’t have time to get them all done at once but if you write them down and stay on top of it you should finish sooner rather than later .
Money Mistakes to Avoid

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has accused movie executives of leaking his new film on the Internet because he insists the weekend controversy must have been an inside job .
The editors of video - sharing Web site YouTube.com were forced to pull links to pirated versions of Moore ‘s new healthcare film , Sicko , after learning as many as 600 people had seen the movie illegally online .
But Moore is n’t buying suggestions the leak was a mistake or the result of a clever pirate –because the online footage was too good .
He fumes , “ The film that ’s leaked onto the Internet is not taken at a movie theater with a little home - movie camera the way it ’s usually done .
This is the master .
This is the actual digital ; it ’s perfect .
“ You ca n’t really get that unless you ’ve been able to perform an inside job .
“ If you were a police detective , one of the first questions you would ask is about motive :
Who has a vested interest in ruining the opening weekend ’s box office of this movie ?
If I were the police or FBI investigating this felony that ’s taken place , that ’s where I would look . ”

Well , here we go again , another episode of neocons conning the theocons :
The Democratic - led U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to lift a key restriction by President George W. Bush on the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research .
... Sen . Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat and chief sponsor of the bill , urged Bush " to reconsider his threat to veto it .
There are some 400,000 leftover , unwanted embryos in fertility clinics across America , " Harkin said .
" All we are saying is , instead of throwing those leftover embryos away , let 's allow couples to donate a few of them , if they wish , to create stem cell lines that could cure diseases and save lives . "
New Embryonic Stem Cell lines are made from material stored at fertility clinics which is already slated for destruction .
Preventing these cells from being used for research wo n't ' save ' them .
It simply means they 'll be disposed of in a medical waste facility instead of being used to find cures for disease .
The only reason to ban federal funding is to appeal to a minority of extremist social conservatives and it comes at the cost of possibly delaying or denying treatment -- and in some cases perhaps life itself -- to millions of people .
To the left we see the friendly neighborhood IVF Clinic which produces unused blastocysts ( Diagram courtesy of Karen Wehrstein ) .
Of the many thousands that are discarded each year , a handful could be saved and used to make Embryonic Stem Cell Cultures .
A misinformed minority of voters led by a few politicians and a deeply unpopular President refer to the fiery end as " saving children , " and the petrii dish as " murder . "
It would be funny , if the rest of us were n't forced to humor their glaring , discordant fabrication1 .
Right about now is when the obligatory dig at the Neo - GOP is inserted , perhaps placed in an all too familiar list of failures , maybe with a concluding and slightly gleeful observation that at least they 're systematically destroying themselves .
But that conclusion is little consolation .
A once decent mainstream political party has been hijacked by a small band of fringe kooks , incompetent crooks , and predatory clerics .
This cabal of mendacity has ripped off the poor , the sick , the middle class , and even the unborn to give to the super rich .
They have left a trail of broken lives , broken dreams , abandoned neighborhoods , maimed bodies , and corpses from Baghdad to the Gulf Coast .
In the process they have driven that party over a cliff with the entire nation in tow .
We will all be stuck cleaning up the wreckage left in their wake long after this ugly chapter in American history has drawn to an official close .
That 's nothing to celebrate .
In light of Iraq , Purgegate , or Katrina , Stem Cells may seem like small potatoes .
But they ’re an ideal window into the seamy duplicity dominating today 's perverse remnant of the Grand Old Party .
Through that lens the priorities of the ruthless ideological operatives pulling the strings of a puppeteer President are starkly revealed : fiction over truth , self over party , party over country , women and children last , money and power for a fleeting moment above all .
And , given that this research holds promise to treat virtually every major cause of death in the US , in the end it may turn out that holding up ESCR killed more Americans than all other White House sins combined .
Tens of thousands of Old National Bancorp customers whose personal and financial information was hijacked by a computer hacker cannot recover damages from the Indiana banking institution who lost the data in 2005 , a federal appeals court ruled Thursday .
In dismissing a proposed class action against Old National Bancorp , the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said damages were unavailable to victims of data theft if those victims did not suffer economically .
The three - judge panel of the circuit , mirroring decisions of federal courts in Ohio , Minnesota , Arizona and Michigan , ruled ( .pdf ) : " Without more than allegations of increased risk of future identity theft , the plaintiffs have not suffered a harm that the law is prepared to remedy . "
The plaintiffs did not allege direct financial loss and did not claim they had been the victim of identity theft .
They alleged they suffered " substantial potential economic damages " and demanded compensation for emotional harm out of fear they would suffer economic damages by those who stole their information .
The bank 's customers also demanded a " monitoring procedure to insure prompt notice to plaintiffs of any attempt to use their confidential personal information stolen from the defendants . "
The appeals court also ruled that the law in Indiana , where the bank is located , did not protect the customers either .
" Had the Indiana Legislature intended that a cause of action should be available against a database owner for failing to protect adequately personal information , we believe that it would have made some more definite statement of that intent , " the court wrote .
The court added that the plaintiffs " have not come forward with a single case or statute , from any jurisdiction , authorizing the kind of action they now ask this federal court , sitting in diversity , to recognize as a valid theory of recovery under Indiana law . "
The court noted that the investigation into the security breach was under seal .
But the judges added that " the scope and manner of access suggests that the intrusion was sophisticated , intentional and malicious . "

The Astrée Static Analyzer
Participants :
Former participants :
Astrée stands for A nalyseur s tatique de logiciels t emps - ré el e mbarqués ( real - time embedded software static analyzer ) .
The development of Astrée started from scratch in at the Laboratoire d'Informatique of the École Normale Supérieure ( LIENS ) , initially supported by the ASTRÉE project , the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , the École Normale Supérieure and , since September 2007 , by INRIA ( Paris — Rocquencourt ) .
Objectives of Astrée
Astrée is a static program analyzer aiming at proving the absence of Run Time Errors ( RTE ) in programs written in the C programming language .
On personal computers , such errors , commonly found in programs , usually result in unpleasant error messages and the termination of the application , and sometimes in a system crash .
In embedded applications , such errors may have graver consequences .
Astrée analyzes structured C programs , with complex memory usages , but without dynamic memory allocation and recursion .
This encompasses many embedded programs as found in earth transportation , nuclear energy , medical instrumentation , aeronautic , and aerospace applications , in particular synchronous control / command such as electric flight control [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] or space vessels maneuvers [ 32 ] .
Industrial Applications of Astrée
The main applications of Astrée appeared two years after starting the project .
Since then , Astrée has achieved the following unprecedented results on the static analysis of synchronous , time - triggered , real - time , safety critical , embedded software written or automatically generated in the C programming language :
In , Astrée was able to prove completely automatically the absence of any RTE in the primary flight control software of the Airbus A340 fly - by - wire system , a program of 132,000 lines of C analyzed in 1h20 on a 2.8 GHz 32 - bit PC using 300 Mb of memory ( and 50 mn on a 64 - bit AMD Athlon™ 64 using 580 Mb of memory ) .
From on , Astrée was extended to analyze the electric flight control codes then in development and test for the A380 series .
The operational application by Airbus France at the end of 2004 was just in time before the A380 maiden flight on Wednesday , 27 April , 2005 .
In , Astrée was able to prove completely automatically the absence of any RTE in a C version of the automatic docking software of the Jules Vernes Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) enabling ESA to transport payloads to the International Space Station [ 32 ] .

Theoretical Background of Astrée
The design of Astrée is based on abstract interpretation , a formal theory of discrete approximation applied to the semantics of the C programming language .
The informal presentation Abstract Interpretation in a Nutshell aims at providing a short intuitive introduction to the theory .
A video introduces program verification by abstract interpretation ( in French : « La vérification des programmes par interprétation abstraite » ) .
More advanced introductory references are [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] .
Briefly , program verification — including finding possible run-time errors — is undecidable : there 's is no mechanical method that can always answer truthfully whether programs may or not exhibit runtime properties — including absence of any run-time error — .
This is a deep mathematical result dating from the works of Church , Gödel and Turing in the 1930's .
When faced with this mathematical impossibility , the choice has been to design an abstract interpretation - based static analyzer that will automatically :
signal all possible errors ( Astrée is always sound ) ;
is always sound ) ; occasionally signal errors that cannot really happen ( false alarms on spurious executions e.g. when hypotheses on the execution environment are not taken into account ) .
Of course , the goal is to be precise , that is to minimize the number of false alarms .
The analysis must also be cost - effective , e.g. being a small fraction of the costs of running all tests of the program .
In the context of safety - critical reactive software , the goal of zero false alarm was first attained when proving the absence of any RTE in the primary flight control software of the Airbus A340 .
Astrée is based on the theory of abstract interpretation [ 1,2,3 ] and so proceeds by effectively computing an overapproximation of the trace semantic properties of analyzed programs and then proving that these abstract properties imply the absence of runtime errors .
The program analysis is iterative [ 5 ] , structural [ 10 ] ( by induction on the program syntax ) , interprocedural and context - sensitive for procedures [ 6 ] , and extremely precise for memory [ 24 ] .
It combines several abstractions of a trace semantics [ 7,19 ] with a weak form of reduced product [ 7,26 ] .
The basic general - purpose abstractions are either non-relationals ( like intervals [ 4,5 ] ) ) or weakly relational ( like octagons [ 16 ] ) with uniform interfaces [ 23 ] .
Astrée precision comes from a clever handling of disjuctions [ 12,14,19 ] and domain - specific abstract domains [ 13,17 ] for control / command .
Most abstractions are infinitary which requires convergence acceleration with widening / narrowing [ 5,9 ] .
The soundness of the abstractions is based on Galois connections [ 5,7 ] or concretization - based [ 8 ] in absence of best abstraction .
Which Program Run-Time Properties are Proved by Astrée ?
Astrée
Any use of C defined by the international norm governing the C programming language ( ISO / IEC 9899:1999 ) as having an undefined behavior ( such as division by zero or out of bounds array indexing ) ,
Any use of C violating the implementation - specific behavior of the aspects defined by ISO / IEC 9899:1999 as being specific to an implementation of the program on a given machine ( such as the size of integers and arithmetic overflow ) ,
Any potentially harmful or incorrect use of C violating optional user - defined programming guidelines ( such as no modular arithmetic for integers , even though this might be the hardware choice ) , and also
Any violation of optional , user - provided assertions ( similar to assert diagnostics for example ) , to prove user - defined run-time properties .
Astrée
Three Simple Examples ... Hard to Analyze in the Large
The examples below show typical difficulties in statically analyzing control / command programs .
Of course , the real difficulty is to scale up !
Booleans
Control / command programs , in particular synchronous ones , manipulate thousands of boolean variables .
Analyzing which program run-time properties hold when each such boolean variable is either true or false rapidly leads to a combinatorial explosion of the number of cases to be considered , that is prohibitive time and memory analysis costs .
For example , the analysis of the following program by Astrée :
/* boolean.c */ typedef enum { FALSE = 0 , TRUE = 1} BOOLEAN ; BOOLEAN B ; void main ( ) { unsigned int X , Y ; while ( 1 ) { /* ... */ B = ( X == 0 ) ; /* ... */ if ( ! B ) { Y = 1 / X ; } ; /* ... */ } ; }
B
X
Astrée has shown to be able to handle successfully thousands of boolean variables , with just enough precision to avoid both false alarms and combinatorial explosion has shown to be able to handle successfully thousands of boolean variables , with just enough precision to avoid both false alarms and combinatorial explosion [ 12 ]
Floating point computations
Command programs controlling complex physical systems are derived from mathematical models designed with real numbers whereas computer programs perform floating point computations .
The two computation models are completely different and this can yield very surprising results , such as :
/* float - error .c */ int main ( ) { float x , y , z , r ; x = 1.000000019e+38 ; y = x + 1.0e21 ; z = x - 1.0e21 ; r = y - z ; printf ( " %f
" , r ) ; } % gcc float - error .c % ./a.out 0.000000 % /* double -error.c */ int main ( ) { double x ; float y , z , r ; /* x = ldexp ( 1.,50 ) + ldexp ( 1.,26 ) ; */ x = 1125899973951488.0 ; y = x + 1 ; z = x - 1 ; r = y - z ; printf ( " %f
" , r ) ; } % gcc double - error .c % ./a.out 134217728.000000 %
2.0e21
2.0
Astrée handles floating point computations precisely and safely .
For example , Astrée proves the following program free of run-time error ( but for a " Loop never terminates " warning ) when running on a machine with floats on 32 bits :
/* float .c */ void main ( ) { float x , y , z ; if ( ( ( ( *( ( unsigned * ) &x ) & 0x7f800000 ) >> 23 ) !=
255 ) /* not NaN */ && ( x >= - 1.0e38 ) && ( x <= 1.0e38 ) ) { while ( 1 ) { y = x +1.0e21 ; z = x -1.0e21 ; x = y-z ; }} else return ; }
Astrée is sound for floating point computations in that it takes all possible rounding errors into account ( and there might be cumulative effects in programs computing for hours ) [ is sound for floating point computations in that it takes all possible rounding errors into account ( and there might be cumulative effects in programs computing for hours ) [ 12 13 ] .
Digital filters
Control / command programs perform lots of digital filtering , as shown by the following example :
/* filter .c */ typedef enum { FALSE = 0 , TRUE = 1} BOOLEAN ; BOOLEAN INIT ; float P , X ; void filter ( ) { static float E [ 2 ] , S [ 2 ] ; if ( INIT ) { S[ 0 ] = X ; P = X ; E [ 0 ] = X ; } else { P = ( (( ( ( 0.5 * X ) - ( E [ 0 ] * 0.7 ) ) + ( E [ 1 ] * 0.4 ) ) + ( S [ 0 ] * 1.5 ) ) - ( S [ 1 ] * 0.7 ) ) ; } E[ 1 ] = E[ 0 ] ; E [ 0 ] = X ; S[ 1 ] = S[ 0 ] ; S[ 0 ] = P ; } void main ( ) { X = 0.2 * X + 5 ; INIT = TRUE ; while ( 1 ) { X = 0.9 * X + 35 ; filter ( ) ; INIT = FALSE ; } }
The absence of overflow ( and more precisely that P is in [ - 1327.05 , 1327.05 ] as found by Astrée ) is not obvious , in particular because of 32 /64 bits floating point computations .
The situation is even more inextricable in the presence of boolean control , cascades of filters , etc .
Astrée knows enough about control theory to make precise analyzes of filters [ knows enough about control theory to make precise analyzes of filters [ 12 13 ] .
Astrée is sound , automatic , efficient , domain - aware , parametric , modular , extensible and precise
Some static analyzers consider only some of the possible run-time errors while others sort out the most probable ones .
The aim is then static testing ( that is to find out the most frequent bugs ) rather than verification ( that is to prove the absence of any run-time error ) .
In contrast Astrée is sound .
Astrée will always exhaustively consider all possible run-time errors and never omit to signal a potential run-time error , a minimal requirement for safety critical software .
Some static analyzers ( e.g. using theorem provers ) require programs to be decorated with inductive invariants .
In contrast Astrée is fully automatic , that is never needs to rely on the user 's help .
Some static analyzers have high computational costs ( typically hours of computation per 10,000 lines of code ) while others may never terminate or terminate out of memory .
Astrée has shown to be efficient and to scale up to real size programs as found in the industrial practice .
Since 2005 , Astrée can run on multicore parallel or distributed machines

General - purpose static analyzers aim at analyzing any program written in a given programming language and so can only rely on programming language - related properties to point at potential run-time errors .
Specialized static analyzers put additional restriction on considered program and so can take specific program structures into account .
Astrée is domain - aware and so knows facts about application domains that are indispensable to make sophisticated proofs .
For example , Astrée takes the logic and functional properties of control / command theory into account as implemented in control / command programs [ 13 ] .
In contrast , is domain - aware and so knows facts about application domains that are indispensable to make sophisticated proofs .
For example , takes the logic and functional properties of control / command theory into account as implemented in control / command programs [ 12 ]
Moreover , Astrée is parametric .
This means that the rate ( cost of the analysis / precision of the analysis ) can be fully adapted to the needs of Astrée 's end -users thanks to parameters and directives tuning the abstraction .
Astrée is modular .
It is made of pieces ( so called abstract domains ) that can be assembled and parameterized to build application specific analyzers Astrée is made easy thanks to is modular .
It is made of pieces ( so called ) that can be assembled and parameterized to build application specific analyzers [ 27 ] , fully adapted to a domain of application or to end - user needs .
Written in OCaml , the modularization ofis made easy thanks to OCaml 's modules and functors .
Finally , Astrée is extensible .
In case of false alarms , it can be easily extended by introducing new abstract domains enhancing the precision of the analysis .
A consequence of generality may be low precision .
Typical rates of false alarms ( i.e. spurious warnings on potential errors than can never occur at runtime ) are from 10 % to 20 % of the C basic operations in the program .
Specialized static analyzers achieve better precision ( e.g. less than 10 % of false alarms ) .
Even a high selectivity rate of 1 false alarm over 100 operations with potential run-time errors leaves a number of doubtful cases which may be unacceptable for very large safety - critical or mission - critical software ( for example , a selectivity rate of 1 % yields 1000 false alarms on a program with 100 000 operations ) .
Astrée , being modular , parametric and domain - aware can be made very precise and has shown to be able to produce no false alarm , that is fully automated correctness proofs .
Theoretical work was done on locating the origin of alarms [ 22 ] .

Rapid overviews of Astrée is proposed in [ 14 ] and [ 18 ] .

Search for Wikis
This search allows you to find Wikis matching your exact feature criteria .
BitTorrent users are facing a new enemy .
A BitTorrent client named ZipTorrent , allegedly created by our friends from the anti-piracy organization Media Defender , leeches bandwith and spreads useless data chunks .
The goal of ZipTorrent is to slow down popular downloads as much as possible .
They use hundreds of these clients at the same time and this can potentially bring the average download speed down to zero .
Even more so , it is not unlikely that it will record your IP - address in the process so they can send you a copyright infringement notice on top of it .
On the Media Defender website we read :
“ Decoying and Spoofing are the most commonly known techniques that we employ .
We send blank files and data noise that look exactly like a real response to an initiated search requests for a particular title . ”
According to ubisuck over at the mininova forums , Media Defender is doing just this with ZipTorrent .
Apparently the fake client is a mod of the popular BitTorrent client Azureus which can be configured to send fake data .
Here ’s a full screenshot of the ZipTorrent configuration screen .
As you will see , there are some dubious settings like “ fake upload ratio mode ” , “ no upload ” and “ safe fake download ” .
It is not hard to check whether you are connected to these fake clients .
In the peers list of your BitTorrent client they will show up as “ ZipTorrent ” and most of the time you will be connected to a bunch of them all originating from similar IP addresses with either 0 % or 100 % of the file completed .
However , there are blocklists to stop these malicious clients from connecting to your BitTorrent client .
Pasted below is a list of the known IP - ranges ZipTorrent is on .
The ranges were identified by The Pirate Bay team and are posted in several forums .
You might want to add these to the blocklist of your BitTorrent client or PeerGuardian .
There ’s one problem though , Media Defender will probably move to new IPs if they read this , a never ending story .
Update :
The legitimacy of the screenshot and “ ZipTorrent ” is doubtful but the IP ranges are correct .
Spoofing is not limited to a client like ZipTorrent and I ’m told that clients like uTorrent and Azureus are also used to do this job .

Tests show that it is n't just the vitamin that protects the body .
If you 're after an antioxidant , try oranges .
AddStyle
If you 're in the market for an antioxidant to keep your body young and healthy , new research suggests you'd be much better off with oranges than vitamin C tablets .
Although vitamin C is best known for its protection against scurvy and , possibly , the common cold ( see ' Vitamin C best in the cold ' ) , fruits rich in vitamin C are also powerful antioxidants that protect cellular DNA from being damaged by oxidation .
Going without such foods leads to DNA damage long before the iconic bleeding gums of scurvy are seen .
But do vitamin C pills on their own have the same protective effect as fruit ?
Serena Guarnieri and a team of researchers in the Division of Human Nutrition at the University of Milan , Italy , designed a simple experiment to find out .
The team gave test subjects a single glass of blood - orange juice , vitamin - C - fortified water , or sugar water to drink .
The blood - orange juice and the fortified water had 150 milligrams of vitamin C each , whereas the sugar water had none .
Blood samples were taken from the test subjects 3 hours and 24 hours after their drink .
Unsurprisingly , blood plasma vitamin C levels went up after drinking both the juice and the fortified water .
The blood samples were then exposed to hydrogen peroxide , a substance known to cause DNA damage through oxidation .
The damage was significantly less in the samples taken from volunteers who had ingested orange juice , in both the samples collected 3 hours after consumption and 24 hours after the drink .
Unsurprisingly , the sugar water had no protective effect .
But neither did the vitamin - C - fortified water .
ADVERTISEMENT
At least one other study , which looked at larger quantities of vitamin C , has shown a protective effect from the vitamin alone .
But the fact that it does n't show up here indicates that something more complicated is going on , says Guarnieri .
" It appears that vitamin C is not the only chemical responsible for antioxidant protection ; there is something more at work here , " she says .
The find is reported in the British Journal of Nutrition1 .
" It is an important observation , " says David Heber , director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California , Los Angeles .
It suggests that people studying the effects of the vitamin should be careful to note where in the diet it comes from .
" Vitamin C is provided in a matrix in fruits with many other beneficial substances , " he says ; and all of these may interact with each other .
Other nutrition researchers have suggested that sugars in juice interact with vitamin C to generate the antioxidant effect2 .
But Guarnieri suspects that the phytochemicals found in oranges ( cyanidin - 3 - glucoside , flavanones and carotenoids ) are the substances that need further study .
" But how they are interacting is still anyone 's guess , " she adds .

Have you ever noticed that smart , interesting people have weird technical hangups ?
Often , they take a good idea to its logical conclusion in such a manner that it dominates their lives .
For instance : I 'm an open source fanatic .
I 'll put up with a lesser product if it means the difference between being open source or not .
For instance , I think Apple has a better desktop experience than Ubuntu does , and I also think they have slicker laptops than Dell has .
However , I refuse to buy a Macbook because it's not open source , despite the fact that all the people around me have Macbooks -- even my heros Guido van Rossum and Bram Moolenaar .
My buddy Mike C. hates OOP .
Mike 's a wicked sharp guy from MIT , so he 's earned the right to his opinion .
( As an aside , it 's strange how vehement many Lisp hackers hate OOP , despite the fact that OO systems exist for Common Lisp . )
It 'd be one thing if he were simply a fan of Scheme over Java , but Mike often codes in Python and refuses to use OOP .
My co-worker Alex J. has many strange technical hangups .
He 's also been coding in Haskell for nine years , which I think qualifies him for " smart and interesting " .
Alex hates RDBMSs because of the way they use disks .
Clearly in the 70s , RDBMSs were an important way to abstract disk usage , but he argues that memory is plentiful enough these days that we should no longer optimize for disk usage .
The thing that irritates him most is that when you query a database , you do n't know whether it 's going to be able to answer the query from memory or have to incur several 9 ms seek time penalties in order to answer the query .
He calls this a " leaky abstraction " .
Sounds somewhat reasonable right ?
Except
Alex takes it to the point where it literally pains him to work in any company that uses an RDBMS .
I have a previous co-worker named Jesse M. who hates the Web .
He 's a senior architect at IronPort Systems ; he 's the type of guy who can get big things done .
Jesse 's a user interface purist and he argues that the Web is a fundamentally broken user interface .
The fact that every Web site looks and behaves slightly differently is horrible from a user interface perspective .
His pet peeve is that text areas have scroll bars while the page itself also has a scroll bar .
Personally , I had never thought to be irritated by that .
It 's reasonable for a user interface purist to gripe about the Web , but Jesse takes it to what might be considered unreasonable levels .
He almost entirely refuses to use the Web .
He occasionally has to write scripts to scrape data from Web pages so that he can avoid using a Web browser .
In fact , he refused the adoption of a company wiki because that would require a Web browser .
My buddy Sam R. loves asynchronous networking , but hates writing asynchronous code .
These days Erlang is popular enough that people are beginning to see that you can write asynchronous code without breaking everything into callbacks .
However , Sam figured this stuff out years ago .
He was the inspiration behind Stackless Python and wrote the mail server for eGroups ( i.e. Yahoo Groups ) .
There are cases where the performance benefits of asynchronous networking are simply unnecessary ; cases where it'd be nice to simply use the built in server libraries .
However , Sam would rather write everything from scratch -- hacking at the innermost bits of Python - - that put up with synchronous networking APIs or having to write Twisted code .
By the way , I 'm a convert to Sam 's religion .
I think Twisted is awful ;) Guido van Rossum has an interesting hangup .
He built restrictions into the very syntax of Python in order to force programmers to write more readable code .
Did you ever edit a piece of C where the indentation did n't match the braces ?
Guido's response was to write a language where it's not possible to indent the code in a way that conflicts with the meaning of the code .
Similarly , in many functional languages , you can write code like
The " if " statement is itself an expression that returns a value .
You can do this in all of the functional languages and in Ruby too .
However , Guido feels that the following is more readable : Guido's response : Python makes a distinction between expressions and statements that prevents you from writing the code in a way that Guido feels is less readable .
Well , since it's my blog , I can confess to one more over - the - top hangup .
I love style guides .
I think following style guides improves code readability .
In fact , I have the style guides for C ( BSD ) , Java , Python , and Perl mostly memorized .
Sounds like a good idea , right ?
The problem is that I 'm so obsessed with style guides that I have a hard time reading code that does n't follow the style guide .
During code reviews , if a chunk of code does n't follow the smallest requirement in the Python style guide , I 'm so distracted that I can barely focus at all on what the code does or whether it has any bugs .
It 's interesting to see how smart , interesting people can often take reasonable ideas and take them to their logical conclusions in such a way that it dominates their lives .
Sometimes , it 's in a way that is not only disproportional to the subject at hand , but is even occasionally harmful to them overall .
Erlang is a concurrent , distributed functional programming language aimed at systems with requirements on massive concurrency , soft real time response , fault tolerance , and high availability .
It has been available as open source for several years creating a community that actively contributes to its already existing rich set of libraries and applications .
Originally created for telecom applications , its usage has spread to other domains including e-commerce , banking , and computer telephony .
Erlang programs are today among the largest applications written in any functional programming language .
These applications offer new opportunities to evaluate functional programming and functional programming methods on a very large scale and suggest new problems for the research community to solve .

On Tuesday , the House Committee on Administration approved Rush Holt 's ( D - NJ ) e-voting reform bill by a 6 - 3 vote .
The vote broke down along party lines , with the six Democrats supporting the legislation , and the three Republicans opposing it .
As we reported last month , the legislation includes several provisions on the wish list of e-voting critics .
It requires a voter - verified paper ballot , dictates that those ballots be the official record in the event of a recount , and mandates random audits of election results .
It also prohibits voting machines with wireless network capabilities or connections to the Internet .
Before approving Holt 's legislation , the committee accepted an amendment by Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) that made two important changes to Holt 's original proposal .
First , the amount of money made available to help states comply with the requirements of the legislation was tripled to a billion dollars .
This was undoubtedly a response to the testimony of several state election officials who argued that the previous figure of $ 300 million would not be sufficient to allow the states to meet the legislation 's requirements .
Limits on source code disclosure
Second , Lofgren 's amendment significantly watered down the requirement that voting machine source code be made publicly available .
Holt 's original legislation had required that source code be " available for inspection promptly upon request to any person . "
The version approved by the House still requires vendors to disclose source code to an independent third party , but that third party may only disclose the source code to government officials , to parties in election - related litigation , or to a person " who reviews , analyzes , or reports on the technology solely for an academic , scientific , technological , or other investigation or inquiry concerning the accuracy or integrity of the technology . "
In addition , under Lofgren 's amendment , anyone who receives copies of the source code may also be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement .
This is n't quite as bad as it sounds because the amendment requires that the non-disclosure agreement must :
Allow the signatory to perform analyses on the technology ( including by executing the technology ) , disclose reports and analyses that describe operational issues pertaining to the technology ( including vulnerabilities to tampering , errors , risks associated with use , failures as a result of use , and other problems ) , and describe or explain why or how a voting system failed or otherwise did not perform as intended .
It seems likely that this change was made at the urging of e-voting vendors , who were uncomfortable with the idea of their source code being available to the general public .
But it 's hard to see what rationale there could be for limiting source code disclosure .
Piracy is certainly not a plausible risk : government purchasers are n't going to buy voting machines that run pirated software , and there 's not much of a private market for e-voting machines .
The NDA requirement could , however , have two serious harmful consequences .
First , by requiring people to jump through more hoops before they can get access to the source code , it is likely to reduce the total number of people who are willing and able to examine the source code for vulnerabilities , reducing the chance that serious vulnerabilities will be spotted in time .
Second , regardless of what the legislation says , the non-disclosure agreement could give voting machine vendors a pretext for legal harassment of security researchers who publicize security problems with their products .
The Lofgren amendment is still better than the status quo—in which no one is allowed to see voting machine source code under any circumstances — but it 's a big step backwards from the excellent language of the original Holt proposal .
Dealing with damaged and missing ballots
Another possible weakness of the legislation is that it does not seem to deal very clearly with the risk that the voter - verified paper trail will be undermined by printer jams or lost ballots .
The legislation is unclear on what procedure to follow in these cases .
It states that if the paper ballots are shown to have been compromised , " the appropriate remedy with respect to the election shall be made in accordance with applicable State law , except that the electronic tally shall not be used as the exclusive basis for determining the official certified vote tally . "
It would be difficult to craft legislation to directly prevent printer jams , but here 's an intriguing approach that could help to address the problem , suggested to me by Ars ' own Jon Stokes : require that if , during an audit , more than five percent of paper ballots are found to have been damaged , missing , or inadequately labeled , that the election in that precinct be re-held .
That proposal would likely have positive effects on election security , but in light of the difficulties of pulling together an extra election on a few days ' notice , it 's likely that such a requirement would be fiercely opposed by state election officials .
Fortunately , even without such a provision , the legislation has several requirements that will give election officials good reason to pay careful attention to safeguarding the paper ballots .
The law requires automatic random recounts of at least three percent of precincts in every congressional district or state , with higher audit rates for closer elections .
Any widespread problems with the voter - verified paper trails are likely to come to light in the course of these recounts .
State action on e-voting
The Holt legislation must still be approved by the full House of Representatives , and companion legislation will also need to be passed by the Senate .
But while Congress deliberates , the states have not been standing still .
In the last two weeks , Florida 's house and senate have both passed legislation replacing the state 's touchscreen voting machines with an optical - scan paper system .
The change was made at the behest of Florida 's new governor , Charlie Crist , who is determined that his state avoid yet another round of embarrassing election problems .
And yesterday California Secretary of State Debra Bowen initiated a comprehensive review of the state 's election systems , including creating a " red team " who will be given access to voting equipment in order to probe it for vulnerabilities .
Regardless of what happens in Congress , the developments in Florida and California make it clear that the tide has turned in the debate over e-voting .
Until the 2006 elections , it was widely believed that touchscreen voting was the wave of the future .
Critics of computerized voting faced an uphill battle convincing the public of their dangers .
Today , touchscreen voting machines are widely seen as buggy and insecure — even anachronistic .
It may take a few years to completely phase out touchscreen voting machines , but the debate is increasingly not over whether to phase them out , but when and how to do so .
ZURICH , Switzerland ( Reuters ) --
An amateur paleontologist in Switzerland may have unearthed Europe 's largest dinosaur mass grave after he dug up the remains of two Plateosaurus .
The dinosaurs ' bones came to light during house - building in the village of Frick , near the German border .
" A hobby paleontologist looked at a construction site for a house and happened to discover the bones , " said Monica Ruembeli from the Frick dinosaur museum .
The finds show that an area known for Plateosaurus finds for decades may be much larger than originally thought .
" It could be that the area extends for 1.5 kilometers ( 0.9 miles ) and in that case , you could certainly say it's the biggest site in Europe , " said Martin Sander , a dinosaur paleontologist at the university of Bonn in Germany .
The Frick area contained the bones of one animal per 100 square meters , Sander said , so the entire area might contain bones of 100 more Plateosaurus .
The peaceful herbivore -- measuring up to 10 meters from head to tail -- roamed river deltas in large herds some 210 million years ago , according to some scientists , when most of Switzerland was covered with desert and its landscape may have looked much like the estuary of the Nile now .
There are two other large Plateosaurus sites in Germany , Sander said .
It is not known how big they are because one is covered by the town of Halberstadt and the other , near Trossingen , by a forest .

Employers are reacting to a disturbing trend .
As most employer - sponsored health plans have raised co-payments sharply for drugs in recent years , employer drug spending has slowed .
But total health care spending by employers has nonetheless continued to rise : 7.7 percent last year , or more than double the general inflation rate , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .
The free drug programs are being adopted in hopes of countering the rising costs , taking their place alongside other steps by some employers that have included opening or expanding health clinics in their factories and offices , and offering checkups and medicines at no cost or for a modest co-payment .
Given the millions of Americans who suffer from heart disease , depression , asthma or diabetes — about one in four working - age adults — the movement toward free drugs and preventive care has the potential to help many people , said Craig Dolezal , a health care specialist at Hewitt Associates , a consulting firm .
Co-payments of $ 10 to $ 20 a prescription have become typical , while the co-pay for some expensive drugs can be $ 50 or more for a month ’s supply .
The new employer programs are waiving those fees .
For people with serious health problems , free medicine is an incentive not only to stay with their prescribed regimens , but also to keep in touch with nurses and pharmacists who monitor changes in their weight , blood pressure and other vital signs .
At the Mohawk Industries carpet factory in Dublin , Ga. , about 200 of the 750 employees signed up for free blood pressure and heart drugs last summer after the company held meetings to describe the benefits of lowering blood pressure and cholesterol .
Alan Christianson , Mohawk ’s benefits administrator , said that the company recognized a few years ago that it could eventually face health costs so high that employees could not afford insurance .
“ We felt we had to do something about it , ” he said .
Peggy Cauley , 36 , who supervises a customer service unit at Mohawk ’s factory , said she was 30 pounds overweight and had spent $ 40 a month on blood pressure and heart drugs before she started the program .
It 's common to see reports that stress the economic importance of copyright and the content owners who benefit from it ; the Copyright Alliance says that " core copyright industries " generated $ 819 billion in the US in 2005 , for instance .
What 's less common is to find studies that look at the economic impact of fair use .
That was the goal behind a new report ( PDF ) from the Computer & Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) .
Their provocative finding ?
" In 2006 , fair use - related industry value added was $ 2.2 trillion , 16.6 percent of total US current dollar GDP . "
The CCIA is the group that has launched a Defend Fair Use campaign and has filed a complaint with the FTC about overly - broad copyright notices in books and on sports broadcasts .
Now , it 's challenging the " more rights are always better " approach of groups like the Copyright Alliance with its new report .
The CCIA hired an economic consulting firm to run the numbers on various US industries that rely on certain fair use privileges .
The list is broader than you might think :
Internet broadcasting , data hosting and processing , audio and video equipment manufacturing , electronic auctions , radio and television broadcasting , and many more all rely on certain elements of fair use .
The " photographic and photocopying equipment manufacturing " industry , for example , relies on the Sony principle ( that devices capable of substantial noninfringing uses should remain legal even though they could threaten some copyright owners ) for its very existence .
Radio and TV broadcasters rely on fair use exemptions for criticism , news reporting , and parody .
Even search engines like Google and Yahoo rely on fair use to republish tiny snippets of web sites in their search results and to store thumbnails of copyrighted images .
YouTube has even relied on a " safe harbor " defense enshrined in copyright law to keep out of trouble even when copyrighted works are posted to its service .
" In our highly competitive markets , technology innovators depend both upon copyright protection and its limits , " writes Ed Black , the CCIA 's CEO .
" While CCIA holds copyrights like the copyright protecting this study , for example , we also benefit — along with the rest of the public — from limitations on the reach of copyright , such as the fact that copyright does not extend to the raw data that forms the basis of this study . "
The report concludes that industries which rely on fair use for at least some of their revenues have seen significant growth over the course of this decade .
Between 2002 and 2006 , total revenue from these industries surged from $ 3.5 trillion to $ 4.5 trillion — a rate of growth faster than that of the general US economy .
Groups like the Copyright Alliance would prefer not to focus on these claims ( which are derived from a WIPO - approved method for measuring the economic value of copyrights in the country , but are likely exaggerated by the fact that all of an industry 's revenues are counted , not just those that stem from fair use ) , but instead on the need to give content creators even more rights .
In a response to the CCIA study , the Copyright Alliance said in a statement , " There is no fair use without original creative works .
Period .
It is like trying to imagine a librarian without books .
All those who embrace fair use must understand this and support creators who are producing the works they so prize . "
Which is true , but it also seems to attack an argument that no one is making .
This is n't really a surprise .
William Patry , senior copyright counsel at Google , points out that the Copyright Alliance has one real goal : strengthen copyrights for content owners .
On his blog , Patry notes that " a review of its web site reveals that every position it discusses as having taken is pro-protection .
And that 's fine : Washington , D.C. is awash with partisan groups like this , on all sides of issues , on hundreds of topics . "
Not everyone sees a contradiction between the positions espoused by the two groups ; Microsoft , for instance , is a member of both .
As Iraq struggles to define its future , there is one important group that has been largely left out of the process : women .
But they are refusing to be left behind .
With little international support or media attention , a network of more than 150 women ’s organizations across Iraq is fighting to preserve their rights in the new constitutional revision process .
As part of a campaign to garner international support , the Iraq Women ’s Movement sent a letter in May to U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and another to UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon expressing concern over the constitutional review process taking place and calling for international support for their effort to preserve women ’s rights in Iraqi law .
" As women face escalating violence and exclusion in Iraq , they have been marginalized in reconciliation initiatives and negotiations for government positions , " the letter noted .
" Even with the shy and insignificant pressure exerted by the UN and other international donors / players on the Iraqi government and politicians to fulfill minimum obligations of Security Council Resolution 1325 , the action taken has been a sequence of disappointments . "
Passed in 2000 , Resolution 1325 emphasizes the importance of women ’s participation in conflict resolution and peace - building processes .
A second resolution , 1483 , applies this conviction specifically to Iraq .
More than three years ago , the United States was instrumental in overturning an amendment to the interim constitution that would have lifted protections for women and children .
U.S. and international pressure , and Iraqi women who took to the streets , succeeded in defeating the provision , which was contradictory to many other parts of the constitution .
Following that triumph , women turned out in record numbers for the 2005 election .
They secured 33 percent of the seats in the National Assembly but remain woefully absent from other influential branches of the government , according to a 2006 report from the Iraq Legal Development Project .
The effectiveness of previous international pressure has spurred the women ’s movement in Iraq to call the world ’s attention to this issue once again , but there has been little acknowledgment of their effort so far .
The office of the UN secretary - general has released only a very general statement about the review process since the Iraqi Women ’s Movement sent their letter on May 21 .
Pelosi ’s office has not yet recognized the letter publicly .
Hanaa Edwar is a leader of the Iraqi Women ’s Movement and founder of the Iraqi al - Amal Association , a national civil society group based in Baghdad .
She is campaigning against Article 41 , a provision buried in the text of the draft constitution that places personal status laws under the influence of religion , sect , or belief .
These are the laws that administer marriage , divorce , inheritance , child custody , and how religious courts settle disputes among Muslims , Christians , and Jews .
But " there is no unity across sects or even within sects " on the rules that govern family and women ’s status , Edwar noted .
Warning that the current language could " deepen the sectarian issues in this society , " Edwar added : " We feel that this is not a women ’s demand , it is a national demand .
This is important for national security . "
" National security " is a term that the U.S. Congress knows well , and the Iraqi women appealed to the issues that are keystones of U.S. policy in the Middle East .
Their letter to Pelosi asks for " help in preventing Iraq from taking the identity of a religious state , " and includes a reminder that , " any destabilization in the state of law , economy , and security in Iraq can reflect on the security and stability of the whole region . "
Mary Trotochaud , an activist who has worked both on the ground in Iraq and with lawmakers in Washington , told IPS , " This movement originates from three generations of women who had really strong rights . "
Iraq ’s progressive women ’s rights laws began when the " personal status laws " were included in the 1959 Constitution .
In 1970 , women were formally guaranteed equal rights and additional laws ensured their right to vote , attend school , run for office , and own property .
Iraq has also ratified a series of international treaties that guarantee equal rights for all , including the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic , Social , and Cultural Rights that protect the pluralistic nature of Iraqi society and offer unprecedented protections to women in an Arab country .
Yet Iraqi women still faced considerable historical obstacles to their political participation , including Ba’ath policies that disenfranchised them and Saddam Hussein ’s strengthening of Islamic and tribal traditions in an effort to consolidate power in the 1990s .
" These are human rights issues that we ’re talking about that we should be advocating all the time in all countries , " Trotochaud said .
" We should n’t be shy about saying that . "
The most recent campaign to preserve these rights began in 2003 in the wake of Hussein ’s fall and the dissolution of Iraq ’s existing legal , political , and economic systems .
Women ’s groups began springing up around the country and organizing to advocate for their rights and participation in the new constitution and government .
The network of groups held regional and national meetings and met with parliamentarians and officials across sect and party lines .
" When the time for constitutional conventions came , women were already organized , " said Trotochaud , who was living in Iraq at the time .
However , the spiraling violence has taken its toll on the campaign .
" The sectarian divide has gotten big enough that people who have worked together in the past do n’t work together now , " she added .
The constitutional review process has labored on for the past six months with few signs of progress .
Debate remains bogged down in issues like the disposition of Kirkuk , an oil - rich city in the northern , Kurdish - dominated region ; the distribution of national wealth ; and de-Ba’athification .
Article 41 , which places family law under religious and tribal traditions , is still in the drafts of the constitution , and women ’s rights in the process remain a backstage issue .
Edwar said that the Constitutional Review Committee has been granted another month to complete its work .
Refusing to be discouraged by the lack of international attention , she looks at the delay as an opportunity to advance the movement ’s goals of ensuring that women ’s rights and family law will be included in her country ’s new constitution and that civil society will be a part of the process .
The Iraqi Women ’s Movement has submitted its own language to the review committee for consideration to replace the objectionable Article 41 .
It says that , " The Iraqi state should ensure that personal status laws should be organized according to law . "
Edwar said they were often met with support for the Movement ’s appeal but that " women ’s issues are one of the compromise issues among politicians . "
There is likely little that will stop the political maneuvering in the run-up to the referendum on the new constitution .
But Edwar made clear that the Iraqi Women ’s Movement will continue its campaign to preserve human rights until the very last moment and she represents a political force that will keep women ’s rights on the political agenda for years to come .
As stated in their letter to Pelosi , " Our hopes in our nation are big , but our trust in our women ’s resilience has no boundaries . "

So it 's the finale of 24 ( Sky One , 9 pm ) tomorrow night , and - wait !
Come back !
I know , I know , it bores you senseless now .
I agree .
This season has been so dreadful , I 'm not going to watch the climax .
I do n't have to .
I 've saved myself the time by reading the episode synopsis on Wikipedia .
That 's how bad this once - unmissable show has become : I 'm willingly seeking out spoilers just to get it over with .
And I 'm not alone .
24 's ratings have plunged in the US .
The producers are promising to make changes in time for season 7 - possibly a complete reboot .
With this in mind , and in an attempt to revive a show I used to love , I humbly present 12 sure - fire ways to save 24 .
Free of charge .
I 'm good like that .
1. Introduce plausible enemies .
At present , 24's bad guys are such humourless , hard - arsed drones , they might as well be replaced by shop window dummies with " BAD GUY " scribbled on the forehead .
If they must be one - dimensional cartoon villains , go the whole hog .
Make them Terminators .
This would be far more exciting , and probably only about 3 % less realistic than the show is anyway .
2 . Think small .
You do n't need mushroom clouds to hold our attention .
Give Jack a compact - yet - urgent threat to handle - a lone serial killer perhaps - and we 'll be just as entertained .
3. Enough of CTU 's teenage office politics .
Things reached a new nadir this season , where the moronic Chloe / Morris , Milo / Nadia storylines resembled a soap opera aimed at people recovering from head injuries .
Either make them bang each other over the desks , or do n't let their love lives intrude at all .
4 . Make the next season a blatant Fantastic Voyage rip - off , in which Jack is miniaturised and injected into Lindsay Lohan 's body .
He has 24 hours to save her liver from permanent damage by fighting off invading " alcohol cells " with his bare hands .
Not only is this a superb cautionary tale for younger viewers , it means the finale will culminate in an eye - popping sequence in which Jack , midway through transforming back to his original dimensions , squeezes out of Lohan 's bottom and flops triumphantly into an aluminium medical tray , where he thrashes around , covered in mucus , the same size as a rat .
Do n't tell me you would n't remember THAT for the rest of your life .
5. Rest Home 24 : recast the show with 85 - year - olds who take an entire episode to stagger from one side of a room to the other , and half a season to make a cup of tea with their brittle , quaking fingers .
It 'd have true morbid appeal .
Will Jack make it to the front door before the postman stops ringing the bell ?
Can Chloe climb into the bath unassisted before the water goes cold ?
The clock is ticking !
( Literally - you 'd replace the iconic digital timer with an Edwardian grandfather clock ) .
6 . The Chinese have created 240 identical clones of Dick Cheney !
One has an essential microchip hidden in its balls , and the only way for Jack to retrieve it is to suck it out through the end of its winky .
That 's 240 clones - in order to save the world , Jack must perform 10 blowjobs an hour , for 24 hours .
On Dick Cheney .
Brilliant .
7. Jack travels back to 1963 and must race against time to stop Lee Harvey Oswald shooting John F Kennedy .
8. Jack travels back to 1990 and must race against time to stop himself making Young Guns II .
9 . Jack wants to buy a hen , but all the hen shops are closed ( hey , it COULD work ) .
10 .
Make each episode cover a year instead of an hour ; instead of playing a government agent fighting terrorists , Kiefer plays a glacier fighting the effects of climate change .
You 'll need to play loads of dramatic uptempo music to keep the pace jaunty .
11 . Do a Memento season , in which each episode takes place an hour before the previous one ( NOTE : instead of " Previously on 24 ... " the pre-credits summary would have to say " Consequently on 24 ... " )
12 . Do n't do any of the above .
Apart from the first three .
It is a time of sleep deprivation , constant tiredness and a regular inability to carry out even the simplest task .
But now scientists have discovered - after experimenting on the California deer mouse , laboratory rats , and humans - that pregnancy also confers startling benefits : it actually boosts brainpower .
During pregnancy , learning and memory skills improve dramatically , say researchers , reversing the popular myth that it is a time of dumbing down .
Key brain areas also alter in size ; changes that can persist for decades .
Far from transforming mothers into weakened emotional wrecks who lose car keys and drop in IQ , it turns out having children makes them cleverer .
It 's just hard to spot thanks to all that lost sleep .
' Many benefits seem to emerge from motherhood , as the maternal brain rises to the reproductive challenge , ' says Professor Craig Kinsley , of Richmond University , and Professor Kelly Lambert , of Randolph - Macon College , both in Virginia , writing in the latest Scientific American .
' In other words , when the going gets tough , the brain gets going . '
Their paper reveals that the brain - boosting potential of parenthood includes enhanced sensory abilities just after childbirth , allowing women to recognise their infants by faint smells and sounds .
It also reports that women who have children in their forties are four times more likely to survive to 100 than women who gave birth earlier .
Pregnancy enhances women 's brains just when the memory decline of middle age normally kicks in , say researchers , leading to better mental health and longevity .
Underlying these changes are two key processes .
The first involves the hormonal fluctuations of pregnancy , birth and lactation , which remodel the brain , increasing the size of neurons in some regions .
Women become vigilant and alert - and the benefits appear to be long - lasting , say Kinsley and Lambert .
Secondly , rearing a child is so challenging it stimulates brain activity .
Having a baby is ' a revolution for the brain ' , says Dr Michael Merzenich of the University of California in San Francisco .
The brain creates cells that thrive the more they are used and the emotional , novel experiences of childraising provide the most stimulating use of all .
Further support for this idea is provided by Katherine Ellison in her book , The Mommy Brain , published last year in the United States and scheduled for release in the UK in April .
As Ellison points out : ' There 's no other time in a woman 's life when she needs to be quite as smart as when she is looking after young children . '
In other words , getting a cerebral lift in pregnancy makes evolutionary sense and evidence can be seen throughout the animal kingdom , Lambert told The Observer .
' We just did n't look for the evidence before , ' she said .
In one experiment , scientists compared the behaviour of virgin female rats with those with litters .
The rats were placed in enclosures containing a cricket - a tasty rat snack - hidden under wood chips .
' The virgins took nearly 270 seconds to find the cricket and eat it , compared with slightly more than 50 seconds for mother rats , ' Lambert said .
Kinsley and Lambert say the phenomenon could have been a key driver in the evolution of all mammals .
Instead of laying eggs and walking off like reptiles , mammals defend their young .
Creatures that were most vigilant at this time would have fared better and lived longer .
The idea may seem startling because a dimming of brain power is still viewed as a side effect of motherhood .
' It does seem counter - intuitive , ' added Lambert .
' We just have n't noticed it because these boosts are masked by sleep deprivation .
It was n't until I had a baby that I realised what is involved in having a child and how organised a female has to be .
It makes sense for her body to boost her mental capacities . '
But if mothers get a boost from parenthood , is the same true for fathers ?
Lambert says yes , but to a more limited extent .
' A man wo n't get a hormone boost , but if he is an involved father he will gain through sharing the challenging experience of childraising .'
This idea is backed by Lambert 's studies of the California deer mouse , the male of which shares equally in childrearing tasks .
Experienced fathers were found to do better than inexperienced males in experiments that tested their ability to navigate mazes and find food .
I 'm more alert mentally now '
Aine Ropke was born on 26 September to Polly Thompson and Stuart Ropke .
' In the months leading up to Aine 's birth , I had been doing some serious multi- tasking , ' said Polly .
I was juggling the major renovation of our house while getting everything ready for the baby 's arrival - which is a big deal when it 's your first .
At the same time I started a new , stressful and demanding job .
When I gave birth , however , I thought my brain had turned to mush .
I was enormously happy , but at the same time I was exhausted and distracted .
As the tiredness and stress dropped away , the mists in my head began to clear .
Suddenly everything became sharper again and instead of being unable to remember anything , I was plotting , planning and organising just as efficiently as I did before .
I think I 'm even more mentally alert now than before Aine arrived , because I have to be . '
By Thembi Mutch
BBC News , Thailand
A report from the US state department has criticised Thailand for not doing enough to combat the illegal trafficking of women and children from Burma , Cambodia , Laos and China .
Thembi Mutch meets women and children who have been caught up in Thailand 's trafficking business .
Many bar girls are sending money to their families back home
" I worked as a waiter in a bar near here .
At first I did n't realise it was even possible for men to have sex with men , or boys , and at that time I still looked like a boy .
I was only 16 and my family had various problems , so I was just working everything out . "
Keng is 22 , very slim , and now an incredibly beautiful woman .
The operation to change from a man to a woman took place last year .
It cost her several thousand dollars , which she earned as a prostitute on the streets .
There is nothing about her that suggests she was ever male - her voice is soft and she is dainty and feminine .
I find myself really liking her quiet dignity and gentle manner .
" When I approach them I have to be very careful .
For the first few days they obey me - some of them have n't eaten properly for weeks - but we still lock them in the attic at the bar , partly so they wo n't escape , partly so that the police or rescue agencies can't find them . "
Child trafficking
Keng is a trafficker - a trafficker of children , into prostitution , mostly for Western men .
She tells me how she hires a van and goes to the countryside if she cannot find children in the city .
Keng herself was trafficked , says my researcher , and she is just as much of a victim , he argues , as the children she traffics .
She has no other job options open to her , and she is shunned publicly in shops , restaurants and bars outside the red light district where she works .
Keng points to a child sitting on the road across from us : " That one , " she says , " is from Cambodia .
He was living on the street in Bangkok . "
Later we interview this boy , Suni , who is jittery and incredibly nervous , and constantly smokes .
He says he is 10 .
He describes having sex with various men in a detached and disturbing way .
He is more animated talking about the money he earns to play computer games or buy speed to get him through the night .
" You know , " Keng says , " he has got a much better life with me than he ever had at home or on the street . "
Groomed for sex
Prey Vang Province is one of the poorest regions in Cambodia .
It is easy to cross from there into Thailand so each year thousands of children are trafficked across the border , often by parents .
In Buddhist cultures the debt owed to parents by children is deeply imbued into families , especially in the countryside where the idea of destiny is wholeheartedly embraced
On the second day in the city , her nine - year - old girl disappeared .
She is convinced her daughter was kidnapped for sex work .
Three other mothers she knows in the village tell a similar story .
In another village , a group of girls aged between seven and 13 tell me their experiences .
They are articulate and open .
Four of them had been kidnapped and groomed for sex work for a month .
They had travelled to the city with their families to beg , but once there , had been coaxed by the offer of a meal into a house in a suburb .
Then they were locked away and made to watch pornography .
Two girls escaped , and the other two were rescued .
Buddhist culture
In Buddhist cultures the debt owed to parents by children is deeply imbued into families , especially in the countryside where the idea of destiny is wholeheartedly embraced .
But poverty and a desire not to confront difficult issues - especially those around sexuality , rape and prostitution - means that many issues just get swept under the carpet .
Sometimes it is just greed that makes parents turn a blind eye to what they are letting their own children in for .
But mostly , say the experts , it is ignorance and a lack of opportunities .
Those who have already been trafficked know the dangers .
I asked the girls in the village what their advice to other children might be to avoid being preyed on by traffickers .
The youngest replies : " It 's really difficult if your mum asks you to get money to feed the family , you want to help .
But it 's best to go to school , and not to beg . "

Researchers said today they have identified the mechanism of action of lipoic acid , a remarkable compound that in animal experiments appears to slow down the process of aging , improve blood flow , enhance immune function and perform many other functions .
The findings , discussed at the “ Diet and Optimum Health ” conference sponsored by the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University , shed light on how this micronutrient might perform such a wide range of beneficial functions .
“ The evidence suggests that lipoic acid is actually a low - level stressor that turns on the basic cellular defenses of the body , including some of those that naturally decline with age , ” said Tory Hagen , an LPI researcher and associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics at OSU .
“ In particular , it tends to restore levels of glutathione , a protective antioxidant and detoxification compound , to those of a young animal .
It also acts as a strong anti-inflammatory agent , which is relevant to many degenerative diseases . ”
Researchers at LPI are studying vitamins , dietary approaches and micronutrients that may be implicated in the aging or degenerative disease process , and say that lipoic acid appears to be one of those with the most compelling promise .
It ’s normally found at low levels in green leafy vegetables , but can also be taken as a supplement .
According to Hagen , research on the natural processes of aging , and steps that could slow it or improve health until near the end of life , are of growing importance .
“ We ’re coming into the middle of an aging epidemic in the country , ” he said .
“ In a short time more than 70 million Americans will be over 65 .
This is partly because of the Baby Boom , but also people are living longer , being saved with antibiotics and other medical treatments .
In any case , it will be an unprecedented number of elderly people in this nation . ”
The goal of LPI research , Hagen said , is to address issues of “ healthspan , ” not just lifespan – meaning the ability to live a long life with comparatively good health and vigor , free of degenerative disease , until very near death .
The best mechanisms to accomplish that , scientists say , have everything to do with diet , exercise , healthy lifestyle habits and micronutrient intake .
At the moment , Hagen said , that ’s not the way things appear to be headed – diabetes is skyrocketing , about 50 percent of people over 65 have high blood pressure , heart disease often leads to permanent disability , and almost half of the elderly people in America have malnutrition that is easily preventable .
No single intervention can address all of these issues , Hagen said , but one that scientists keep coming back to is lipoic acid .
“ Our studies have shown that mice supplemented with lipoic acid have a cognitive ability , behavior , and genetic expression of almost 100 detoxification and antioxidant genes that are comparable to that of young animals , ” Hagen said .
“ They are n’t just living longer , they are living better – and that ’s the goal we ’re after . ”

What the OSU researchers now believe is that the role of lipoic acid is not so much a direct one to benefit cells , but rather an indirect aid that “ kick starts ” declining function in cells and helps them recover the functions that came more easily and naturally in young animals .
In various effects , lipoic acid appears to help restore a cellular “ signaling ” process that tends to break down in older blood vessels .
It reduces mitochondrial decay in cells , which is closely linked to the symptoms of aging .
With age , glutathione levels naturally decline , making older animals more susceptible to both free radicals and other environmental toxins – but lipoic acid can restore glutathione function to near normal .
And the expression and function of other genes seems to come back to life .
“ We never really expected such a surprising range of benefits from one compound , ” Hagen said .
“ This is really unprecedented , and we ’re pretty excited about it . ”
Many other presentations have been made at this conference on the role of diet , lifestyle and micronutrients in health and degenerative disease , including cancer , heart disease , neurological diseases and aging .

Homeopathy : Can We Please , As a Society , Let This One Go ?
You hear us rant almost daily about the ridiculous machinations of the modern medical establishment , namely the reliance on drugs and surgery to “ fix ” health issues that could often be better dealt with or eliminated with simple lifestyle changes .
Modern medicine has become a bureaucratic , money - driven actuarial game wherein individual patient rights are routinely sacrificed for the greater good of large populations .
And so you hear , “ The operation was a success , but the patient died . ” or , “ We do n’t care that you refuse to get vaccinated .
You need to do it so the rest of us do n’t die from an epidemic of this obscure disease . ”
Or “ Despite debilitating side effects , this new drug appears to benefit 22 % of patients who take it . ”
For that reason I am a big fan of “ integrated medicine , ” which combines the best elements of conventional medical methods with some forms of complementary and alternative medicine – when research suggests that these alternatives might provide better benefits with fewer side effects or complications .
A lot of doctors are now embracing this new vision of medicine which includes diet and lifestyle alterations , stress management techniques , biofeedback , and the use of certain vitamin regimens and herbal therapies when drugs or surgery just do n’t seem ethical .
Good for them and better for us .
But often lumped in with that group is another specific “ branch ” of medicine I find ludicrous and which I need to explore with you , since many of my readers tend to assume it is a legitimate option within the “ alternative ” camp .
That branch is called homeopathy .
Ironically , many people willingly accept homeopathy as a legitimate form of medicine simply because no one has explained to them how silly it is … despite having been in existence for almost 200 years with no reputable studies to prove that it works .
Many assume that homeopathy is equivalent to “ herbal medicine ” and that those little homeopathy pills or tinctures are just smaller versions of the research - proven herbal extracts that often do have real benefits .
But nothing could be further from the truth .
The basic theory behind homeopathy involves stimulating the body ’s ability to heal itself by providing minute doses of substances that in larger amounts would cause illness .
It is often referred to as “ like cures like ” or “ The Law of Similars ” .
Take a little of the “ hair of the dog that bit you ” ( literally , in some cases ) .
Now dilute it with water and shake vigorously .
Now dilute it and shake it again , and again , until it is so dilute that only one part per billion remains .
Sorry , it ’s still not dilute enough .
To make it even “ stronger ” we need to dilute it to parts per trillion or less !
( This is known in homeopathy as the “ Law of Infinitesimals ” and in science as “ officially nothing ” ) .
Under the theory of homeopathy , the substance being diluted confers some vibrational energy that remains in the water and which enables the body to heal itself …or at least deal with the symptoms of the condition , since homeopathy does n’t seem to concern itself with the origin of the disease .
I am astounded that people today still believe that homeopathy has any place in modern medicine .
It was developed in the early 1800s by a “ physician ” named Samuel Hahnemann on a misguided theory that he could restore the body ’s “ vital forces ” using these diluted and vigorously shaken poisons to release “ immaterial and spiritual powers . ”
Please .
Almost more ridiculous is the fact that this theory has n’t changed much in the ensuing 200 years and yet homeopathy is still practiced by otherwise knowledgeable “ doctors ” .
Homeopathy is even unofficially recognized by the FDA as a form of treatment .
How , you ask , could our government condone such silly practices ?
Simply because there is no way anyone can be harmed by homeopathic remedies .
Remember , the more “ powerful ” the homeopathic remedy is , the less of anything it contains .
The FDA has its hands full trying to prevent myriad needless deaths from countless new drugs .
They simply look the other way when a homeopathic remedy claims to treat a disease or condition because they know that no one will be hurt ( unless by relying on the homeopathic cure , the patient forgoes more effective treatment ) .
Since supplement manufacturers are not allowed to make disease claims , some unscrupulous supplement companies have even moved into the lucrative homeopathy business just to be able to legally claim their products treat disease .
So how is it that so many people swear by their homeopathic remedies and truly believe they work ?
There ’s your answer right there : belief .
Blind faith and the placebo effect .
( Was n’t that Ginger Baker ’s third band ? )
The placebo effect occurs when a patient gets better simply as a result of his / her positive expectations that the treatment will work .
Some studies show that 50 % of people taking a placebo will experience significant improvement if they believe they were given a strong medicine .
The mind is a very powerful tool in healing the body , as any Christian Scientist or Voodoo believer will tell you .
And that ’s all that ’s happening in the case of homeopathy .
Blind faith .
And maybe there ’s nothing wrong with that , except that it takes the focus away from the cause of your affliction .
Bottom line : if you are willing to suspend disbelief and are a sucker for placebos , then homeopathy is just what the doctor ordered .
Otherwise , let ’s see how eating well , exercising and controlling stress might better address the situation .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The FBI possibly violated the law or its rules more than 1,000 times since 2002 in collecting data about phone calls , e-mails and financial records while investigating terrorism or espionage suspects , FBI officials said on Thursday .
FBI Director Robert Mueller speaks in Boston in a 2006 photo .
An internal FBI audit has found the agency violated rules more than 1,000 times while collecting data on domestic phone calls , e-mails and financial transactions in recent years , The Washington Post reported on Thursday .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
The potential violations found by an FBI audit were far greater than the approximately two dozen previously documented violations in a U.S. Justice Department report released in March that was based on a much smaller sampling , they said .
The vast majority of newly discovered violations were instances in which companies , such as telephone and Internet providers , gave more information than the FBI sought , the officials said .
They said the FBI has drafted new guidelines in an effort to prevent future abuses , but civil liberties groups and Democrats in Congress expressed doubt that they would be sufficient to protect the privacy of Americans .
The ongoing audit concerned the use of national security letters , which allow the FBI to compel the release of private information such as communications or financial records without getting court approval .
Their use has grown dramatically , mainly as a result of powers granted to the FBI under the USA Patriot Act , an anti-terrorism law Congress approved after the September 11 attacks .
Caroline Fredrickson of the American Civil Liberties Union said the new guidelines were not enough .
“ Congress must go back to the legislative drawing board and rein in the broad ... authorities expanded by the Patriot Act , ” she said .
Rep. Edward Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts , urged Congress to hold oversight hearings to determine whether changes in the law were required to prevent future violations .
Rep. Jerrold Nadler , a Democrat from New York and chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee , said : “ The new FBI guidelines ... fall far short of protecting the privacy of innocent Americans . ”
Justice Department inspector general Glenn Fine in the March report sharply criticized the FBI for how it demanded and received records such as customer information from telephone companies , Internet service providers , banks and credit card firms .
The FBI audit sampled about 10 percent of the FBI ’s national security investigations since 2002 and the officials said they expected the full audit to be completed soon .
FBI officials said the audit found no evidence that any agent knowingly or willingly violated the laws or that supervisors encouraged such violations .
The report in March also found no evidence of intentional criminal misconduct .
THE Boom is bouncing around the classroom like an overgrown kid .
With his bushy gray eyebrows and mad scientist ’s grin , he ’s demonstrating the density of methane to 25 rapt teenagers at San Lorenzo Valley High School .
“ Let ’s see if we can do this without burning the place up again , ” he says .
“ Again ? ” gasps one girl .
Explosions are nothing new to Preston Q. Boomer ’s physics and chemistry classes .
Neither are flash fires , electric shocks , spark - spitting transformers or deafening gongs , sirens and klaxons .
He begins many lectures with the subversive come - on : “ Want to blow something up today ? ”
Advertisement
It ’s the Boom ’s Big Bang Theory of teaching : Noise is fun , even instructive .
But his wacky experiments can go awry .
One day the cops showed up as a result of a half - baked Boomer stunt .
The teacher was testing whether a 1.5 - million - volt Tesla coil could shoot a spark across the room .
In the process , he cut off all police radio communications for miles .
Boomer ’s reaction : “ Neat ! ”
Preston Boomer is 75 .
He ’s been teaching science at the same school near Santa Cruz since 1956 , the year Elvis Presley released “ Heartbreak Hotel . ”
Advertisement
He ’s had 8,000 students in the last half - century -- three generations of some families .
Many teachers and administrators once sat in his class .
He often hears from former students long retired .
But like the Robert Crumb cartoon posted in his class , he prefers to “ Keep on Truckin ’ . ”
High school graduates everywhere can recall a teacher who was a favorite despite the generational divide .
Boomer is that teacher taken to the next level .
He is one of fewer than 20 California instructors with 50 or more years in the classroom .
It ’s not just his longevity that amazes colleagues and students ; so does his energy .
Boomer ’s pension now outpaces his salary , so he ’d make more money if he called it quits .
Yet with no mandatory retirement in his district , he says his goal is to remain “ until they drag my corpse off the lab table . ”
There ’s this thing about retired teachers , he says : “ Before you know it , they ’re dead . ”
Advertisement
Over the five decades , Boomer says he has missed work only twice -- once for a conference , the other time for his grandfather ’s funeral .
He often walks with a cane and likes to riff on his advancing age , telling students he was conceived in the rumble seat of a 1931 Model A .
“ You ’re great kids , ” he says .
“ So were your grandparents . ”
The Boom ( the nickname is short for Boomer , not an explosion ) is a master teacher , stand - up comic and circus showman .
To the kids , he ’s Yoda with a chemistry set .
Or a character from a “ Far Side ” cartoon .
He ’s also an innovator -- the first instructor in his district to use computers and PowerPoint demonstrations as teaching tools -- and a tough disciplinarian who bills his “ Big Chem ” and “ Mighty Physics ” classes as rigorous college boot camps .
Advertisement
The lessons do n’t stop at school .
The grandfather of two often hosts students at “ Boomeria , ” a Disneyland for science geeks that he and his students have created over the years at his home in the Santa Cruz Mountains .
Boomeria features a wooden castle and guard towers , a 2,000 - pipe organ housed in its own chapel -- even a working guillotine with a steel blade that students use to cut watermelons , not necks .
Students often wage “ war , ” marauding through Boomeria ’s hand - dug catacombs , firing water cannons and hurling eggs and water balloons from catapults .
There ’s a method here :
Teens learn about concepts like water propulsion and the fact that it takes just a tad of zinc mixed with sulfur to make an explosion .
All while the self - proclaimed “ King of Boomeria ” plays a dirge on the mammoth pipe organ .
Advertisement
His tutelage has paid off .
Ex-students e-mail to say his lessons primed them for their toughest college classes .
Many Boomer graduates have gone on to lucrative careers in Silicon Valley and Hollywood .
Most attribute their continued love affair with science and technology to the teacher they call their most influential childhood mentor .
One of them , Hoyt Yeatman , became a Hollywood visual - effects supervisor and in 1989 won an Academy Award for the special effects in the film “ The Abyss . ”
“ The most important thing I learned from Boom is that you do n’t have to grow up to grow old , ” said Yeatman , 52 .
“ He still plays in this fantasy world , even as an adult .
Many of us eventually lose those childlike abilities , but he ’s stubbornly held on to them .
I ’ve used his inspiration throughout my entire career . ”
Yeatman ’s mother , Marie , now 81 , at first worried about the eccentric teacher -- enough to check out Boomeria for herself .
Advertisement
“ It did n’t look dangerous , ” she said .
“ Of course , that was before the guillotine . ”
THE teacher is working his alchemy , demonstrating wave harmonics .
He holds a 20 - foot line affixed to a door , furiously whipping the end to create ever - shorter wave lengths .
Soon he is out of breath .
“ I took an aspirin so I would n’t have a heart attack , ” he jokes .
Dressed in his “ physics is phun ” T - shirt , Boomer storms the room , pausing only to hitch up his sweat pants .
He refers to himself in the third person : “ Is the Boom nervous today ? ”
Advertisement
Before Boomer ’s ankles gave out , janitors each summer had to replace floor tiles worn down by his incessant pacing .
In a fast - moving lecture , he handles such dense concepts as the Doppler effect , shock waves and sonic booms .
In a spiel on beat frequency , he plays a few notes of the Sonny and Cher song “ The Beat Goes On . ”
“ You guys were born in the wrong time , ” he tells his class .
“ The hippie era was really fun . ”
Next he ’s using a contraption called an equalizer to measure the harmonics of various sounds .
A student blows his nose .
Advertisement
“ Good tone , ” Boomer says .
“ Bring it up here and let ’s put in on the equalizer . ”
Soon he tries to pull an answer from the class .
“ Inter ? Inter ? ”
He pauses .
“ Intercourse ? ” The class cackles .
“ No , ” he deadpans .
It ’s interstitial , referring to the spaces between molecules .
The room is a shrine to science and Boomer ’s warped humor .
Next to posters showing the Periodic Chart of Elements and Fundamental Particles and Interactions is a photo of a young Boomer in the Naval Reserve and a hand - drawn sign reading : “ Time will pass , you may not . ”
Most students stay riveted .
There ’s no whispering or note - passing , no gum-chewing condescension .
They know their roles :
The Boom is the performer ; they ’re the attentive audience .
Advertisement
They preface questions with “ Hey , Boom , ” reveling in his off - the - wall answers .
“ No teacher comes close to him , ” said Cammie Dueber , 17 .
“ He ’s so weird . ”
In class , Boomer will command “ OK , write this down , ” and all heads will plunge toward their notebooks .
Students must write in ink and in complete sentences .
All submitted papers must be stapled ; names printed legibly , not scribbled .
Late arrivals or in - class bathroom runs are not tolerated .
He ’ll reduce grades on papers for including what he calls “ Baloney Stuff ( BS ) . ”
He refuses to approve most field trips during his teaching hours , insisting that nothing is more important than his own class .

“ In my day , he fanatically rejected blue jeans for some reason , to the point of kicking people out of school dances for wearing them , ” said former student Bill Gervasi , 50 , now a computer hardware executive .
Boomer is better at making rules than following them .
In his early years , he rigged a “ principal alarm ” to alert him when administrators were approaching his classroom .
He still has a note in his file for sneaking out of a staff meeting -- or , as he calls it , “ a pooling of ignorance . ”
Advertisement
Boomer once used a fire extinguisher to snuff out a colleague ’s smoldering cigarette in the teachers lounge .
When he used the same trick on a girl for talking in class , she blasted him back with her own extinguisher .
Boomer retreated under a desk and , to the delight of the class , raised a white flag .
What charms students has n’t always charmed the school board .
One member tried to fire him years ago , saying he gave easy grades to girls who wore short skirts to class .
An inquiry cleared him .
Advertisement
Boomer says he bears no grudges , but adds of the board member : “ I gave her a C in class .
I guess she wanted to get even . ”
Said Paul Sacco , a former counselor : “ Make kids accountable and you make enemies . ”
AS a boy growing up in San Jose , Preston Boomer had a penchant for the macabre :
He read about medieval torture , engrossed in the workings of guillotines and dungeons .
He devoured his parents ’ 1879 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica .
In high school he was inspired by Mr. Fisher , his physics instructor , who taught his young student how a teacher could be a showman .
Advertisement
“ One day I came in early to class and saw him wiring a bunch of student seats to a high - voltage induction coil .
He believed some kids needed a jolt now and then to stay awake in class , ” Boomer said .
As the story goes , Boomer ’s backyard fantasy land was born the night a carload of students tried to egg his home as payback for bad grades .
Boomer was ready :
He set a booby - trap of honking horns and water guns in what became known as the first epic battle for the soul of Boomeria .
Students still make pilgrimages to his home , laughing at the front gate as his voice booms over the loudspeaker : “ Who goes there ? ”
Advertisement
“ The Boom loves science with a deeper passion than anyone I ’ve ever known , ” said onetime student Lance McVay , 39 , now a high school teacher .
“ He ’s like a little kid with a chemistry set .
His just got bigger and bigger .
Boomeria is one man ’s ode to childhood . ”
Boomer once turned an upside - down tub into a bathysphere in his backyard pool .
He pumped in air and sent sandwiches down by pulley as students competed to see who could stay submerged the longest .
( The record was two hours . )
Beginning in the 1960s , science students who referred to themselves as the Natural Philosopher ’s Club started digging catacombs across Boomer ’s 2 1/2 - acre spread .
They ’re now big enough to stand inside of .
In battle , students use water cannons and makeshift catapults -- and the losers sometimes spend the night in the dungeon .
They get one phone call to let their parents know where they are : in jail at their teacher ’s house .
Advertisement
The teacher ’s troops usually emerge victorious , because as the Boom reminds kids : “ The King always wins . ”
Boomer ’s two sons recall their father as a mix of Mr. Rogers and David Lynch .
“ My childhood was defined by all - night water battles , people sneaking around in the woods , alarms going off at all hours , ” said Alex Boomer , 49 , an electrical contractor in Fortuna .
“ I thought it was normal until I got out in the real world . ”
Not every parent got the joke .
Boomer remembers one father who threatened to sue if his son got hurt at Boomeria .
“ I told him , ‘ Then we wo n’t have your child up to the house . ’
He called me right back and changed his mind .
He said he did n’t want his son to miss out on all the action . ”
Some former student warriors say Boomeria ’s crowning glory was the “ aqua goose , ” a geyser of water shot from a hidden underground nozzle .
One night , an army of students set off the geyser beneath a car without headlights , which they assumed belonged to an enemy scout .

Recalled Gervasi : “ This massive amount of water shot up beneath the vehicle and suddenly the car ’s loudspeaker says , ‘ Mr. Boomer .
This is the police .
We need to talk . ’ ”

I came back to education rather late in life - just turning 50 .
I had disliked school from day one .
Learned to read and write , and that was about it .
I knew I would never return after age 16 .
But life is funny , and when I found myself a has - been at 49 , I had to look outside the comfort zone I had built up with 30 - odd years of writing and editing .
In fact , it was my wife who looked outside my comfort zone .
She had always had a strange belief that I would make a marvellous teacher .
Where she got this notion from I have no idea .
It was she who applied for me on seeing a job advertised for a cover supervisor at the local comprehensive .
From September 2004 the government and Nasuwt decreed that all schools had to make sure teachers would do no more than 38 hours of cover ( taking lessons for absent colleagues ) each year .
And so was born the position of cover supervisor , a full - time job covering lessons across the whole curriculum for teachers absent through illness or coursework .
A masterstroke of the government and the education system was that the position called for no qualifications or even training , allowing for a minimum wage .
No qualifications or certificates in hand , I applied for the post .
When called in by the headteacher , I was upfront about my lack of qualifications .
Regardless , he took a shine to me and , to my amazement , I was offered the job .
" I can't do maths , you understand , " I protested .
" You 'll be fine , " he assured me .
He 's the head , I thought .
He must have spotted some quality in my character hidden to all but him and my wife .
Haircut and suit .
September 6 . Back to school .
I 'm the new boy , aged 50 .
My first cover lesson : maths .
" Sir , what 's this mean ? " asks a 12 - year - old .
I look .
Gibberish covers the page of his text book .
" This is looked on as a revision lesson , " I explain .
" When your teacher returns he needs to be able to see what you do n't know as much as what you do know . "
Pretty cool on - the - spot thinking .
I 'm convinced .
Unfortunately , the boy is n't .
" He does n't know , " he whispers to his mate .
Nor did I .
I also did n't know science , geography , French , German , DT , business studies or cookery , but soon found myself holding lessons in all of them between three and five times a day .
For the year and a half I was at the school , not once did a teacher step into a class to observe how or indeed what I was doing .
A lot of cover lessons would degenerate into handing out word searches .
" We 've done this ! "
" Three times already ! "
" Then it should n't be too difficult for you ! "
The students knew this situation did n't quite add up .
Speaking of adding up , I often wondered just how many cover supervisors there were up and down the country taking countless lessons each term .
We are looking at hours and hours taken out of each student 's lesson timetable .
They might as well have been doing dot - to - dot puzzles .
Hearing the government claim it had put x number more teachers into schools made me gag .
The con being that we cover supervisors were on a puny wage , so has n't the government done well , a zillion more teachers at half the cost .
During my time at the school I was attacked three times .
Once with a hammer .
Fair dues to the lad , we were in the woodwork area so he was using the correct tool .
The second attack was with a carving knife , and again praise to the boy involved as I was taking a cookery lesson at the time .
My favourite incident was when a 14 - year - old girl walked across my science class while unwrapping a Black Velvet liquorice - flavour condom .
" Do you want to use this on me , sir ? "
Again full marks for politeness and sexual responsibility .
As an untrained teacher I recognised the minefield that lay before me with whatever response I gave .
Amidst sniggers from the class I simply told her to get back to work .
When I reported the incident later , the head 's reaction was : " She can be difficult . "
He also came down like a ton of feathers on hammer - boy , giving him a two - day suspension which , since he spat at me on his return , did n't seem to have the desired effect .
Knife - boy had to write a letter of apology to me in which he promised it would never happen again .
So that was all right then .
It was strange to mix with teachers in the staff room .
Certain social skills seemed missing from the majority , particularly those who had gone straight from school as students to school as teachers .
On my first day in September , one of them had given me the often - heard tip : " Do n't smile until after Christmas . "
Although I had little to smile about , I found this an impossible task after a lifetime of smiling like a loon .
It is obviously a skill acquired during teacher training .
The majority of teachers were stressed and unhappy , with paperwork and lack of support being the main problems moaned about daily .
During my first term , there was concern from the more militant teachers over my position as the uneducated teaching the uneducated .
Unions were mentioned , but nothing came of it as I was soon covering so many lessons each day ( three to five out of five ) that it made life easier for the staff .
I did snap once .
I was holding a science class for the dregs of the school .
As text books and beakers flew every which way , I bellowed that they were a " bunch of tossers " .
Silence .
And then : " You can't call us that .
We 're going to report you . "
My only thought : " Please go get me fired . "
Angry parents phoned the head demanding justice for my slur on their family escutcheon .
Writing out an incident report , I exchanged the word tosser for dosser and no more was heard about it .
Ofsted inspectors came to the school .
It was interesting to see that they did n't come into lessons covered by me or my fellow cover supervisor .
The school was deemed " good " .
Not a week went by when I was n't astounded at school life .
On the way home one evening , I spotted a student happily scrawling the initials KKK on a town landmark .
When I brought this up with the head , he just shook his head .
" Nothing we can do if he was outside the school . "
No feeling of duty to educate the boy on the full wonders of the Ku Klux Klan .
One day I was holding a class in RE when my mobile rang and someone offered me some freelance writing work .
The class was quite out of control , with Bibles being hurled out of the window .
I felt I was either going to strike a child or a teacher at some point soon .
I had to go .
The students remain , preparing for tomorrow 's bright new world .
Cover supervisors continue holding lessons - up to GCSE and A - level - for which they have no training or qualification .
Children deserve better .

Gay Bomb will begin filming in November 2007 , after Dark
Alley completes its already jam - packed production and release schedule for the year .
Look out for current releases Gaytanamo and Fisting Underground , Part 3 , as well as the upcoming Matthias von Fistenbergâ ??s 8 Â½ and 20 Fist Weekend .
Listen , you Americans , Laura Bush wants you to know the President is suffering over Iraq .
In fact , Laura told Anne Curry on the Today Show , that the American people need to know that " no one suffers more than their President and I do . "
No one ?
She 's as delusional as her husband .
Of course , her husband is the person who caused the suffering -- and is the one person who can end it .
I would wager that there are 3,300 families in America that are suffering more than George Bush .
And , there are tens of thousands of injured soldiers who are literally suffering .
Suffering , my ass :

周りで読んでいる人が多かったので読んでみました。お金の話と自己啓発のバランスがとれたいい本だと思います。というわけで、より抜きメモ。
君が提供したサービスの量と質＝君が受け取る報酬額
( 中略)給料をもらう人間は働いている時間が退屈なので、その時間が早く過ぎないかだけを考えている。彼らは、「人からもらえるもの」にしか興味がないのだ。だから、金持ちになれない。
一方、スターと呼ばれる人たちや、事業で成功している人たちは、その仕事を辞めるのが難しいくらい、自分の仕事を愛している。自分のやっていることにワクワクして、今度は何が出来るだろうかと考えている。言ってみれば、与えることばかり考えていると言えるだろう。だから、彼らは、ますます金持ちになっている。(p33 )
陥りがちな思考が 「私ががんばった量＝報酬額」で、現実は「誰かに与えた量と質＝報酬額」なので不平不満を漏らすことが多い。結果第一というのはそういうことかな。
「 働かずに金持ちになるなんて、何か、ずるくないですか？」
「 現在の世の中は、経済価値や喜びを与えた人間が豊かになるようになっているんだよ」(p50 )
重要な原則。がんばっているとか、たいへんな思いをしているかじゃない。いかに与えたかである。
自分の嫌いなことを仕事にすると決めた瞬間、本質的には自分に懲役刑を下しているのだ。月曜日から金曜日まで、人生のほとんどをそれに費やすのだからね。いや、囚人のほうが楽かもしれない。刑務所のほうが労働時間は少なく、厳しいノルマもない。納期もないので、夜中までの残業はしなくていいしね。(p63 )
漫画『刑務所の中』の刑務所暮らしを見ていると、嫌いなことをやり続けるより刑務所のほうがマシかもしれないというのはちょっと思う。ちなみに私は今の仕事は大好きですので念のため。
嫌いなことをやって仕事をしている人は、憂さ晴らしのためにお金をくだらないものに使う。給料を慰謝料と勘違いするから、そんな使い方をしてしまうのだ。ローンで車や家や家具、洋服なんかを何も考えずに買ってしまう。(p63 )
嫌いなことを仕事にすると、それの憂さ晴らしのため払わなければいけない対価が生まれる。
好きなことをやる人生 嫌いなことをやる人生 お金がたくさん入る ◎ △ お金にならない ○ × 好きなことをやってお金になる─これは最高の人 生
好きなことをやってお金がない─好きなことをやれているので結構幸せ
嫌いなことをやってお金がある─お金があるけど嫌いなことをやっているので、少し不幸（人により、まあまあと思う人もいるので△）
嫌いなことをやってお金がない─これは最低の人生 ( p66 )
実際は嫌いなことをやってお金がない人生を選ぶ人が多く、そのわけは、人間が習慣の動物だから一度嫌いなことをやって生活するパターンが身につくとそのほうが慣れ親しんだ感じがするからだという。
人間性を見るためには、その人が直接、利害関係のない他人をどう扱うかを見たらすぐわかる。(p76 )
たしかに 。
人生は、 「 考えること 」 と「行動すること」の二つでできている。今まで考えてきたことと、思考の結果行動してきたことの集大成が君だ。健康に気を遣う人は、口に入れるものに注意する。食べるものが体を作ることをよく知っているからだ。だが、
人生の健康を望む人間のほとんどが、頭に何を入れるのかさっぱり注意しないのは、不思議でならないね 。( p79 )
食べるものが体をつくり、頭にいれるものが人生をつくる。いい例え。
「 何に気をつければスピーチがうまくなるのでしょうか？ 」 「 自分の考えをともかく紙に書きなさい。そして、自分が何を考えているか、感じているかを紙に吐きだしてしまうように。うまく書こうとか考えずに、アイデアが浮かんだらすぐにそれを書き留めなさい。すると、自分が何を考えているのか良くつかめるようになってくる。
自分が口を開くときには、真実のみを話しなさい。いい加減なことを口走ってはいけない。本当にその気がないことを言わないことだ。自分の真実を話さなければ、君の言葉のパワーはなくなってしまうからね」( p112)
見える化と、嘘やあいまいさは伝わるということ。
偉い人には、あたかも彼が偉くないかのように接しなさい。そして、偉くない人には、あたかもその人が偉い人のように接しなさい。そうすると、そのどちらからも君は驚きの目で見られるだろう。
彼らは、そんな扱いを受けたことがないからだ。そして、どちらもが君に感謝し、好意を持つだろう。偉い人は、本当は普通に接してもらいたいものなのだ。そして、偉くない人は、偉い人のように扱ってもらいたいものだから。(p122)
「 頭を下げる意味があるのは、立場が上のときだけ」なのと似てる。
ある程度の収入ができるまでは、支出は収入の三分の一くらいにするべきなんだ。収入が増えても、支出はそのままにしなければ、次のステップに行けない。( p134 )
さ、三分の一ですか 。
貧乏人の口癖は、 「普段頑張っているご褒美に買っちゃおう！」。一方、金持ちの口癖は、「今の私には必要ないな。またにしておこう」( p136 ) 自分がお金を使うときには、そのお金で何を得ようとしているのか、よく見極めることだよ。( p137 )
これは徹底しようと思った。
大切なのは、そのプレゼントの渡し方だ。気持ちよく受け取れるような、感情面の言い訳を用意してあげることだ。そして、相手に負担にならないようなものにするなどの心配りが必要だ。( p138)
プレゼントは喜んでもらうためにするものであって、負担にさせちゃあ意味がない。見返りを求めるプレゼントはナンセンス。
なぜ、目標達成に失敗するのか すべきことを目標にしている
目標を達成するモチベーションがない
具体的なステップがない
期限がない ( p168 )
パフォーマンス・マネジメントですね。この本もオススメです。
ある心理学者によると、人生で最大の恐怖は、死の恐怖よりも、成功する事への恐れだという。私は、自分の体験からいって、それは正しいと思っている。普通の人は、失敗のほうを恐れていると思うだろう。しかし、それは成功への恐れに比べれば、大した恐怖ではないのだ。
失敗は辛い体験だが、我慢して頑張っていれば乗り切れるものだ。成功は、いってみれば、膨大なエネルギーを全身で受け止めるということなのだよ。（中略）真に成功するということは、あらゆる変化を受け止めるということだ。
変化はふつう痛みをともなう。友人がいなくなったり、現在のパートナーとの別れ、上司や同僚との別れ、今までの自分とも別れなくてはいけないかもしれない。そんな訳のわからない目に遭うよりも、豊かでもないが幸せな現状を望みたくなるのだよ。
本当の成功とは、完全に人生に身をゆだねることなのだよ。それをできる人間は少ない。(p224)
成功が人生にもたらす関門の一つ。失敗よりも成功のほうが恐れている。言われてみればたしかに。

The performance of Maria Falconetti is considered to be the greatest on screen performance in history .
3. Nosferatu 1922 , F.W. Murnau
An unauthorized production of Bram Stoker ’s work ( The legal heirs did n’t give their permission ) , so the names had to be changed .
But this was n’t enough :
The widow of Bram Stoker won two lawsuits ( 1924 and 1929 ) in which she demanded the destruction of all copies of the movie , however happily copies of it were already too widespread to destroy them all .
Later , the Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie .

His guardian angel , Clarence , falls to Earth , literally , and shows him how his town , family , and friends would turn out if he had never been born .
George meant so much to so many people ; should he really throw it all away ?
10 . All Quiet on the Western Front 1930 , Lewis Milestone
This is an English language film ( made in America ) adapted from a novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque .
The film follows a group of German schoolboys , talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher .
The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals .
As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them , any preconceptions about “ the enemy ” and the “ rights and wrongs ” of the conflict disappear , leaving them angry and bewildered .
This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body .
The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality .
Bonus : 1984 1984 , Michael Radford After The Atomic
War the world is divided into three states .
London is the capital of Oceania , ruled by a party who has total control over all its citizens .

RCTV .
RCTV is under fire .
The big television station , which has been broadcasting under license in Venezuela for 54 years , sort of the equivalent of FoxNews or CBS , officially loses its right to broadcast at the end of today .
But that was n't all that happened .
Like furies , red tshirted Chavista mobs gathered and bayed liked wolves in the days leading up to this end of an era , graffiting and spray - painting the TV station with words like ' expropriacion ' along with filthy slogans that if you know Spanish , you can see the equivalent of 'f word ' among , racism charges , campesino movement slogans , anti-Vatican slogans ( the Vatican actually defended this TV station , which is run by a devout Catholic ) and ' RCTV out ' slogans .
They also left plenty of garbage and mess , including what looks like a dead dog - a mob symbol if there ever was one , behind .
This is how Venezuela is being ruled right now - not just by arbitrary " legal " rulings based on what Chavez likes , but by the added calling card of the Chavista mob , spray painting its vile messages in its ' revolutionary ' fervor to get the point across that this is n't about law or the public interest anymore , this is about bloodthirsty mob rule .
One little fact that will make you sick to hear is that I know exactly who organized the attack .
I hung out with him in Caracas because I was curious how the other side thought and I went to his " Bolivarian Circle " meeting and I got literature - it was 100 % against the dissident TV stations - and I even got drunk with him in one of the mayor 's offices out in the western slums .
I know who he is and how he thinks .
He had a string of " community " television stations of his own , and he told me the pbig rivate TV stations were " against democracy . "
His people were after Globovision and its broadcasting equipment at the time but they rapidly moved against RCTV and have been talking about destroying them through violence .
He even had state - funded pamphlets , with the little Venezuelan government jumping - people logo on them to give to me and I still have them .
His bile against private media finally came to fruition yesterday .
And he will be the beneficiary of the spoils .
The injury added to insult against RCTV shows that not only is the law against the existence of the dissident TV station , it 's also against enforcing even civic laws against the integrity of the property itself .
Think about how you would feel for your personal safety in the wake of these attacks .
These thugs would have thrown a bomb or set a fire if they could but the government wants to steal the equipment for its own ' public broadcast ' service , which will fall into the hands of this rapcious graffiti mob .
This is violence , from top to bottom , with the state making common cause with the criminal elements to make Venezuela a holy hell for anyone who produces anything of value .
God help Venezuela .
UPDATE : Alek Boyd at VCrisis sends me a correction - RCTV is slated for closure on May 31 , not March 31 as had been reported earlier .
Thanks Alek !
Read Alek 's item on RCTV , complete with more strings of photos , here .
UPDATE : Venezuela Today has a whole special section on RCTV with all the coverage and all the photos for easy viewing here .
The term ' Mock Objects ' has become a popular one to describe special case objects that mimic real objects for testing .
Most language environments now have frameworks that make it easy to create mock objects .
What 's often not realized , however , is that mock objects are but one form of special case test object , one that enables a different style of testing .
In this article I 'll explain how mock objects work , how they encourage testing based on behavior verification , and how the community around them uses them to develop a different style of testing .
I first came across the term " mock object " a few years ago in the Extreme Programming ( XP ) community .
Since then I 've run into mock objects more and more .
Partly this is because many of the leading developers of mock objects have been colleagues of mine at ThoughtWorks at various times .
Partly it 's because I see them more and more in the XP - influenced testing literature .
But as often as not I see mock objects described poorly .
In particular I see them often confused with stubs - a common helper to testing environments .
I understand this confusion - I saw them as similar for a while too , but conversations with the mock developers have steadily allowed a little mock understanding to penetrate my tortoiseshell cranium .
This difference is actually two separate differences .
On the one hand there is a difference in how test results are verified : a distinction between state verification and behavior verification .
On the other hand is a whole different philosophy to the way testing and design play together , which I term here as the classical and mockist styles of Test Driven Development .
Regular Tests
I 'll begin by illustrating the two styles with a simple example .
( The example is in Java , but the principles make sense with any object - oriented language . )
We want to take an order object and fill it from a warehouse object .
The order is very simple , with only one product and a quantity .
The warehouse holds inventories of different products .
When we ask an order to fill itself from a warehouse there are two possible responses .
If there 's enough product in the warehouse to fill the order , the order becomes filled and the warehouse 's amount of the product is reduced by the appropriate amount .
If there is n't enough product in the warehouse then the order is n't filled and nothing happens in the warehouse .
These two behaviors imply a couple of tests , these look like pretty conventional JUnit tests .
public class OrderStateTester extends TestCase { private static String TALISKER = " Talisker " ; private static String HIGHLAND_PARK = " Highland Park " ; private Warehouse warehouse = new WarehouseImpl ( ) ; protected void setUp ( ) throws Exception { warehouse .
add( TALISKER , 50 ) ; warehouse.add( HIGHLAND_PARK , 25 ) ; } public void testOrderIsFilledIfEnoughInWarehouse ( ) { Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 50 ) ; order.fill( warehouse ) ; assertTrue(order.isFilled ( ) ) ; assertEquals ( 0 , warehouse.getInventory ( TALISKER ) ) ; } public void testOrderDoesNotRemoveIfNotEnough ( ) { Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 51 ) ; order.fill( warehouse ) ; assertFalse(order.isFilled ( ) ) ; assertEquals ( 50 , warehouse.getInventory ( TALISKER ) ) ; } xUnit tests follow a typical four phase sequence : setup , exercise , verify , teardown .
In this case the setup phase is done partly in the setUp method ( setting up the warehouse ) and partly in the test method ( setting up the order ) .
The call to order . fill is the exercise phase .
This is where the object is prodded to do the thing that we want to test .
The assert statements are then the verification stage , checking to see if the exercised method carried out its task correctly .
In this case there 's no explicit teardown phase , the garbage collector does this for us implicitly .
During setup there are two kinds of object that we are putting together .
Order is the class that we are testing , but for Order . fill to work we also need an instance of Warehouse .
In this situation Order is the object that we are focused on testing .
Testing - oriented people like to use terms like object - under - test or system - under - test to name such a thing .
Either term is an ugly mouthful to say , but as it's a widely accepted term I 'll hold my nose and use it .
Following Meszaros I 'll use System Under Test , or rather the abbreviation SUT .
So for this test I need the SUT ( Order ) and one collaborator ( warehouse ) .
I need the warehouse for two reasons : one is to get the tested behavior to work at all ( since Order. fill calls warehouse 's methods ) and secondly I need it for verification ( since one of the results of Order. fill is a potential change to the state of the warehouse ) .
As we explore this topic further you 'll see there we 'll make a lot of the distinction between SUT and collaborators .
( In the earlier version of this article I referred to the SUT as the " primary object " and collaborators as " secondary objects " )
This style of testing uses state verification : which means that we determine whether the exercised method worked correctly by examining the state of the SUT and its collaborators after the method was exercised .
As we 'll see , mock objects enable a different approach to verification .
Tests with Mock Objects
Now I 'll take the same behavior and use mock objects .
For this code I 'm using the jMock library for defining mocks .
jMock is a java mock object library .
There are other mock object libraries out there , but this one is an up to date library written by the originators of the technique , so it makes a good one to start with .
public class OrderInteractionTester extends MockObjectTestCase { private static String TALISKER = " Talisker " ; public void testFillingRemovesInventoryIfInStock ( ) { //setup - data Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 50 ) ; Mock warehouseMock = new Mock ( Warehouse.class ) ; //setup - expectations warehouseMock.expects( once ( ) ) . method ( " hasInventory " ) . with( eq ( TALISKER ) ,eq( 50 ) ) .will( returnValue( true ) ) ; warehouseMock.expects ( once ( ) ) . method ( " remove " ) . with( eq ( TALISKER ) , eq( 50 ) ) .after ( " hasInventory " ) ; //exercise order.fill (( Warehouse ) warehouseMock.proxy ( ) ) ; //verify warehouseMock.verify ( ) ; assertTrue(order.isFilled ( ) ) ; } public void testFillingDoesNotRemoveIfNotEnoughInStock ( ) { Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 51 ) ; Mock warehouse = mock ( Warehouse.class ) ; warehouse.expects ( once ( ) ) . method ( " hasInventory " ) .withAnyArguments ( ) .will ( returnValue( false ) ) ; order.fill ( ( Warehouse ) warehouse.proxy ( ) ) ; assertFalse(order.isFilled ( ) ) ; } Concentrate on testFillingRemovesInventoryIfInStock first , as I 've taken a couple of shortcuts with the later test .
To begin with , the setup phase is very different .
For a start it 's divided into two parts : data and expectations .
The data part sets up the objects we are interested in working with , in that sense it 's similar to the traditional setup .
The difference is in the objects that are created .
The SUT is the same - an order .
However the collaborator is n't a warehouse object , instead it 's a mock warehouse - technically an instance of the class Mock .
The second part of the setup creates expectations on the mock object .
The expectations indicate which methods should be called on the mocks when the SUT is exercised .
Once all the expectations are in place I exercise the SUT .
After the exercise I then do verification , which has two aspects .
I run asserts against the SUT - much as before .
However I also verify the mocks - checking that they were called according to their expectations .
The key difference here is how we verify that the order did the right thing in its interaction with the warehouse .
With state verification we do this by asserts against the warehouse 's state .
Mocks use behavior verification , where we instead check to see if the order made the correct calls on the warehouse .
We do this check by telling the mock what to expect during setup and asking the mock to verify itself during verification .
Only the order is checked using asserts , and if the method does n't change the state of the order there 's no asserts at all .
In the second test I do a couple of different things .
Firstly I create the mock differently , using the mock method in MockObjectTestCase rather than the constructor .
This is a convenience method in the jMock library that means that I do n't need to explicitly call verify later on , any mock created with the convenience method is automatically verified at the end of the test .
I could have done this in the first test too , but I wanted to show the verification more explicitly to show how testing with mocks works .
The second different thing in the second test case is that I 've relaxed the constraints on the expectation by using withAnyArguments .
The reason for this is that the first test checks that the number is passed to the warehouse , so the second test need not repeat that element of the test .
If the logic of the order needs to be changed later , then only one test will fail , easing the effort of migrating the tests .
As it turns out I could have left withAnyArguments out entirely , as that is the default .
Using EasyMock
There are a number of mock object libraries out there .
One that I come across a fair bit is EasyMock , both in its java and .NET versions .
EasyMock also enable behavior verification , but has a couple of differences in style with jMock which are worth discussing .
Here are the familiar tests again : public class OrderEasyTester extends TestCase { private static String TALISKER = " Talisker " ; private MockControl warehouseControl ; private Warehouse warehouseMock ; public void setUp ( ) { warehouseControl = MockControl.createControl( Warehouse.class ) ; warehouseMock = ( Warehouse ) warehouseControl.getMock ( ) ; } public void testFillingRemovesInventoryIfInStock ( ) { //setup - data Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 50 ) ; //setup - expectations warehouseMock.hasInventory ( TALISKER , 50 ) ; warehouseControl.setReturnValue(true ) ; warehouseMock.remove( TALISKER , 50 ) ; warehouseControl.replay ( ) ; //exercise order.fill(warehouseMock ) ; //verify warehouseControl.verify ( ) ; assertTrue(order.isFilled ( ) ) ; } public void testFillingDoesNotRemoveIfNotEnoughInStock ( ) { Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 51 ) ; warehouseMock.hasInventory ( TALISKER , 51 ) ; warehouseControl.setReturnValue(false ) ; warehouseControl.replay ( ) ; order.fill ( ( Warehouse ) warehouseMock ) ; assertFalse(order.isFilled ( ) ) ; warehouseControl.verify ( ) ; } } EasyMock uses a record / replay metaphor for setting expectations .
For each object you wish to mock you create a control and mock object .
The mock satisfies the interface of the secondary object , the control gives you additional features .
To indicate an expectation you call the method , with the arguments you expect on the mock .
You follow this with a call to the control if you want a return value .
Once you 've finished setting expectations you call replay on the control - at which point the mock finishes the recording and is ready to respond to the primary object .
Once done you call verify on the control .
It seems that while people are often fazed at first sight by the record / replay metaphor , they quickly get used to it .
It has an advantage over the constraints of jMock in that you are making actual method calls to the mock rather than specifying method names in strings .
This means you get to use code - completion in your IDE and any refactoring of method names will automatically update the tests .
The downside is that you can't have the looser constraints .
The developers of jMock are working on a new version which will use other techniques to allow you use actual method calls .
The Difference Between Mocks and Stubs
When they were first introduced , many people easily confused mock objects with the common testing notion of using stubs .
Since then it seems people have better understood the differences ( and I hope the earlier version of this paper helped ) .
However to fully understand the way people use mocks it is important to understand mocks and other kinds of test doubles .
( " doubles " ?
Do n't worry if this is a new term to you , wait a few paragraphs and all will be clear . )
When you 're doing testing like this , you 're focusing on one element of the software at a time - hence the common term unit testing .
The problem is that to make a single unit work , you often need other units - hence the need for some kind of warehouse in our example .
In the two styles of testing I 've shown above , the first case uses a real warehouse object and the second case uses a mock warehouse , which of course is n't a real warehouse object .
Using mocks is one way to not use a real warehouse in the test , but there are other forms of unreal objects used in testing like this .
The vocabulary for talking about this soon gets messy - all sorts of words are used : stub , mock , fake , dummy .
For this article I 'm going to follow the vocabulary of Gerard Meszaros 's book .
It 's not what everyone uses , but I think it 's a good vocabulary and since it's my essay I get to pick which words to use .
Meszaros uses the term Test Double as the generic term for any kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purposes .
The name comes from the notion of a Stunt Double in movies .
( One of his aims was to avoid using any name that was already widely used . )
Meszaros then defined five particular kinds of double : Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used .
Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists .
objects are passed around but never actually used .

Fake objects actually have working implementations , but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production ( an in memory database is a good example ) .

Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test , usually not responding at all to anything outside what 's programmed in for the test .

Spies are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called .
One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent .

One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent .
Mocks are what we are talking about here : objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive .
Of these kinds of doubles , only mocks insist upon behavior verification .
The other doubles can , and usually do , use state verification .
Mocks actually do behave like other doubles during the exercise phase , as they need to make the SUT believe it 's talking with its real collaborators - but mocks differ in the setup and the verification phases .
To explore test doubles a bit more , we need to extend our example .
Many people only use a test double if the real object is awkward to work with .
A more common case for a test double would be if we said that we wanted to send an email message if we failed to fill an order .
The problem is that we do n't want to send actual email messages out to customers during testing .
So instead we create a test double of our email system , one that we can control and manipulate .
Here we can begin to see the difference between mocks and stubs .
If we were writing a test for this mailing behavior , we might write a simple stub like this .
public interface MailService { public void send ( Message msg ) ; } public class MailServiceStub implements MailService { private List < Message > messages = new ArrayList < Message >( ) ; public void send ( Message msg ) { messages.add ( msg ) ; } public int numberSent ( ) { return messages.size ( ) ; } }
We can then use state verification on the stub like this .
class OrderStateTester ... public void testOrderSendsMailIfUnfilled ( ) { Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 51 ) ; MailServiceStub mailer = new MailServiceStub ( ) ; order.setMailer( mailer ) ; order.fill ( warehouse ) ; assertEquals ( 1 , mailer.numberSent ( ) ) ; }
Of course this is a very simple test - only that a message has been sent .
We 've not tested it was sent to the right person , or with the right contents , but it will do to illustrate the point .
Using mocks this test would look quite different .
class OrderInteractionTester ... public void testOrderSendsMailIfUnfilled ( ) { Order order = new Order ( TALISKER , 51 ) ; Mock warehouse = mock ( Warehouse.class ) ; Mock mailer = mock ( MailService.class ) ; order.setMailer(( MailService ) mailer.proxy ( ) ) ; mailer.expects ( once ( ) ) . method ( " send " ) ; warehouse.expects ( once ( ) ) . method ( " hasInventory " ) .withAnyArguments ( ) .will ( returnValue( false ) ) ; order.fill ( ( Warehouse ) warehouse .
proxy ( ) ) ; } }
In both cases I 'm using a test double instead of the real mail service .
There is a difference in that the stub uses state verification while the mock uses behavior verification .
In order to use state verification on the stub , I need to make some extra methods on the stub to help with verification .
As a result the stub implements MailService but adds extra test methods .
Mock objects always use behavior verification , a stub can go either way .
Meszaros refers to stubs that use behavior verification as a Test Spy .
The difference is in how exactly the double runs and verifies and I 'll leave that for you to explore on your own .
Classical and Mockist Testing Now I 'm at the point where I can explore the second dichotomy : that between classical and mockist TDD .
The big issue here is when to use a mock ( or other double ) .
The classical TDD style is to use real objects if possible and a double if it 's awkward to use the real thing .
So a classical TDDer would use a real warehouse and a double for the mail service .
The kind of double does n't really matter that much .
A mockist TDD practitioner , however , will always use a mock for any object with interesting behavior .
In this case for both the warehouse and the mail service .
Although the various mock frameworks were designed with mockist testing in mind , many classicists find them useful for creating doubles .
An important offshoot of the mockist style is that of Behavior Driven Development ( BDD ) .
BDD was originally developed by my colleague Daniel Terhorst - North as a technique to better help people learn Test Driven Development by focusing on how TDD operates as a design technique .
This led to renaming tests as behaviors to better explore where TDD helps with thinking about what an object needs to do .
BDD takes a mockist approach , but it expands on this , both with its naming styles , and with its desire to integrate analysis within its technique .
I wo n't go into this more here , as the only relevance to this article is that BDD is another variation on TDD that tends to use mockist testing .
I 'll leave it to you to follow the link for more information .
You sometimes see " Detroit " style used for " classical " and " London " for " mockist " .
This alludes to the fact that XP was originally developed with the C3 project in Detroit and the mockist style was developed by early XP adopters in London .
I should also mention that many mockist TDDers dislike that term , and indeed any terminology that implies a different style between classical and mockist testing .
They do n't consider that there is a useful distinction to be made between the two styles .
Choosing Between the Differences
In this article I 've explained a pair of differences : state or behavior verification / classic or mockist TDD .
What are the arguments to bear in mind when making the choices between them ?
I 'll begin with the state versus behavior verification choice .
The first thing to consider is the context .
Are we thinking about an easy collaboration , such as order and warehouse , or an awkward one , such as order and mail service ?
If it 's an easy collaboration then the choice is simple .
If I 'm a classic TDDer I do n't use a mock , stub or any kind of double .
I use a real object and state verification .
If I 'm a mockist TDDer I use a mock and behavior verification .
No decisions at all .
If it 's an awkward collaboration , then there 's no decision if I 'm a mockist - I just use mocks and behavior verification .
If I 'm a classicist then I do have a choice , but it 's not a big deal which one to use .
Usually classicists will decide on a case by case basis , using the easiest route for each situation .
So as we see , state versus behavior verification is mostly not a big decision .
The real issue is between classic and mockist TDD .
As it turns out the characteristics of state and behavior verification do affect that discussion , and that 's where I 'll focus most of my energy .
But before I do , let me throw in an edge case .
Occasionally you do run into things that are really hard to use state verification on , even if they are n't awkward collaborations .
A great example of this is a cache .
The whole point of a cache is that you can't tell from its state whether the cache hit or missed - this is a case where behavior verification would be the wise choice for even a hard core classical TDDer .
I 'm sure there are other exceptions in both directions .
As we delve into the classic / mockist choice , there 's lots of factors to consider , so I 've broken them out into rough groups .
Driving TDD
Mock objects came out of the XP community , and one of the principal features of XP is its emphasis on Test Driven Development - where a system design is evolved through iteration driven by writing tests .
Thus it's no surprise that the mockists particularly talk about the effect of mockist testing on a design .
In particular they advocate a style called need - driven development .
With this style you begin developing a user story by writing your first test for the outside of your system , making some interface object your SUT .
By thinking through the expectations upon the collaborators , you explore the interaction between the SUT and its neighbors - effectively designing the outbound interface of the SUT .
Once you have your first test running , the expectations on the mocks provide a specification for the next step and a starting point for the tests .
You turn each expectation into a test on a collaborator and repeat the process working your way into the system one SUT at a time .
This style is also referred to as outside - in , which is a very descriptive name for it .
It works well with layered systems .
You first start by programming the UI using mock layers underneath .
Then you write tests for the lower layer , gradually stepping through the system one layer at a time .
This is a very structured and controlled approach , one that many people believe is helpful to guide newcomers to OO and TDD .
Classic TDD does n't provide quite the same guidance .
You can do a similar stepping approach , using stubbed methods instead of mocks .
To do this , whenever you need something from a collaborator you just hard - code exactly the response the test requires to make the SUT work .
Then once you 're green with that you replace the hard coded response with a proper code .
But classic TDD can do other things too .
A common style is middle - out .
In this style you take a feature and decide what you need in the domain for this feature to work .
You get the domain objects to do what you need and once they are working you layer the UI on top .
Doing this you might never need to fake anything .
A lot of people like this because it focuses attention on the domain model first , which helps keep domain logic from leaking into the UI .
I should stress that both mockists and classicists do this one story at a time .
There is a school of thought that builds applications layer by layer , not starting one layer until another is complete .
Both classicists and mockists tend to have an agile background and prefer fine - grained iterations .
As a result they work feature by feature rather than layer by layer .
Fixture Setup With classic TDD , you have to create not just the SUT but also all the collaborators that the SUT needs in response to the test .
While the example only had a couple of objects , real tests often involve a large amount of secondary objects .
Usually these objects are created and torn down with each run of the tests .
Mockist tests , however , only need to create the SUT and mocks for its immediate neighbors .
This can avoid some of the involved work in building up complex fixtures ( At least in theory .
I 've come across tales of pretty complex mock setups , but that may be due to not using the tools well . )
In practice , classic testers tend to reuse complex fixtures as much as possible .
In the simplest way you do this by putting fixture setup code into the xUnit setup method .
More complicated fixtures need to be used by several test classes , so in this case you create special fixture generation classes .
I usually call these Object Mothers , based on a naming convention used on an early ThoughtWorks XP project .
Using mothers is essential in larger classic testing , but the mothers are additional code that need to be maintained and any changes to the mothers can have significant ripple effects through the tests .
There also may be a performance cost in setting up the fixture - although I have n't heard this to be a serious problem when done properly .
Most fixture objects are cheap to create , those that are n't are usually doubled .
As a result I 've heard both styles accuse the other of being too much work .
Mockists say that creating the fixtures is a lot of effort , but classicists say that this is reused but you have to create mocks with every test .
Test Isolation
If you introduce a bug to a system with mockist testing , it will usually cause only tests whose SUT contains the bug to fail .
With the classic approach , however , any tests of client objects can also fail , which leads to failures where the buggy object is used as a collaborator in another object 's test .
As a result a failure in a highly used object causes a ripple of failing tests all across the system .
Mockist testers consider this to be a major issue ; it results in a lot of debugging in order to find the root of the error and fix it .
However classicists do n't express this as a source of problems .
Usually the culprit is relatively easy to spot by looking at which tests fail and the developers can tell that other failures are derived from the root fault .
Furthermore if you are testing regularly ( as you should ) then you know the breakage was caused by what you last edited , so it 's not difficult to find the fault .
One factor that may be significant here is the granularity of the tests .
Since classic tests exercise multiple real objects , you often find a single test as the primary test for a cluster of objects , rather than just one .
If that cluster spans many objects , then it can be much harder to find the real source of a bug .
What 's happening here is that the tests are too coarse grained .
It 's quite likely that mockist tests are less likely to suffer from this problem , because the convention is to mock out all objects beyond the primary , which makes it clear that finer grained tests are needed for collaborators .
That said , it 's also true that using overly coarse grained tests is n't necessarily a failure of classic testing as a technique , rather a failure to do classic testing properly .
A good rule of thumb is to ensure that you separate fine - grained tests for every class .
While clusters are sometimes reasonable , they should be limited to only very few objects - no more than half a dozen .
In addition , if you find yourself with a debugging problem due to overly coarse - grained tests , you should debug in a test driven way , creating finer grained tests as you go .
In essence classic xunit tests are not just unit tests , but also mini-integration tests .
As a result many people like the fact that client tests may catch errors that the main tests for an object may have missed , particularly probing areas where classes interact .
Mockist tests lose that quality .
In addition you also run the risk that expectations on mockist tests can be incorrect , resulting in unit tests that run green but mask inherent errors .
It 's at this point that I should stress that whichever style of test you use , you must combine it with coarser grained acceptance tests that operate across the system as a whole .
I 've often come across projects which were late in using acceptance tests and regretted it .
Coupling Tests to Implementations
When you write a mockist test , you are testing the outbound calls of the SUT to ensure it talks properly to its suppliers .
A classic test only cares about the final state - not how that state was derived .
Mockist tests are thus more coupled to the implementation of a method .
Changing the nature of calls to collaborators usually cause a mockist test to break .
This coupling leads to a couple of concerns .
The most important one is the effect on Test Driven Development .
With mockist testing , writing the test makes you think about the implementation of the behavior - indeed mockist testers see this as an advantage .
Classicists , however , think that it 's important to only think about what happens from the external interface and to leave all consideration of implementation until after you 're done writing the test .
Coupling to the implementation also interferes with refactoring , since implementation changes are much more likely to break tests than with classic testing .
This can be worsened by the nature of mock toolkits .
Often mock tools specify very specific method calls and parameter matches , even when they are n't relevant to this particular test .
One of the aims of the jMock toolkit is to be more flexible in its specification of the expectations to allow expectations to be looser in areas where it does n't matter , at the cost of using strings that can make refactoring more tricky .
Design Style
One of the most fascinating aspects of these testing styles to me is how they affect design decisions .
As I 've talked with both types of tester I 've become aware of a few differences between the designs that the styles encourage , but I 'm sure I 'm barely scratching the surface .
I 've already mentioned a difference in tackling layers .
Mockist testing supports an outside - in approach while developers who prefer a domain model out style tend to prefer classic testing .
On a smaller level I noticed that mockist testers tend to ease away from methods that return values , in favor of methods that act upon a collecting object .
Take the example of the behavior of gathering information from a group of objects to create a report string .
A common way to do this is to have the reporting method call string returning methods on the various objects and assemble the resulting string in a temporary variable .
A mockist tester would be more likely to pass a string buffer into the various objects and get them to add the various strings to the buffer - treating the string buffer as a collecting parameter .
Mockist testers do talk more about avoiding ' train wrecks ' - method chains of style of getThis ( ) .get That ( ) .getTheOther ( ) .
Avoiding method chains is also known as following the Law of Demeter .
While method chains are a smell , the opposite problem of middle men objects bloated with forwarding methods is also a smell .
( I 've always felt I 'd be more comfortable with the Law of Demeter if it were called the Suggestion of Demeter . )
One of the hardest things for people to understand in OO design is the " Tell Don't Ask " principle , which encourages you to tell an object to do something rather than rip data out of an object to do it in client code .
Mockists say that using mockist testing helps promote this and avoid the getter confetti that pervades too much of code these days .
Classicists argue that there are plenty of other ways to do this .
An acknowledged issue with state - based verification is that it can lead to creating query methods only to support verification .
It 's never comfortable to add methods to the API of an object purely for testing , using behavior verification avoids that problem .
The counter - argument to this is that such modifications are usually minor in practice .
Mockists favor role interfaces and assert that using this style of testing encourages more role interfaces , since each collaboration is mocked separately and is thus more likely to be turned into a role interface .
So in my example above using a string buffer for generating a report , a mockist would be more likely to invent a particular role that makes sense in that domain , which may be implemented by a string buffer .
It 's important to remember that this difference in design style is a key motivator for most mockists .
TDD 's origins were a desire to get strong automatic regression testing that supported evolutionary design .
Along the way its practitioners discovered that writing tests first made a significant improvement to the design process .
Mockists have a strong idea of what kind of design is a good design and have developed mock libraries primarily to help people develop this design style .
So should I be a classicist or a mockist ?
I find this a difficult question to answer with confidence .
Personally I 've always been a old fashioned classic TDDer and thus far I do n't see any reason to change .
I do n't see any compelling benefits for mockist TDD , and am concerned about the consequences of coupling tests to implementation .
This has particularly struck me when I 've observed a mockist programmer .
I really like the fact that while writing the test you focus on the result of the behavior , not how it 's done .
A mockist is constantly thinking about how the SUT is going to be implemented in order to write the expectations .
This feels really unnatural to me .
I also suffer from the disadvantage of not trying mockist TDD on anything more than toys .
As I 've learned from Test Driven Development itself , it 's often hard to judge a technique without trying it seriously .
I do know many good developers who are very happy and convinced mockists .
So although I 'm still a convinced classicist , I 'd rather present both arguments as fairly as I can so you can make your own mind up .
So if mockist testing sounds appealing to you , I 'd suggest giving it a try .
It 's particularly worth trying if you are having problems in some of the areas that mockist TDD is intended to improve .
I see two main areas here .
One is if you 're spending a lot of time debugging when tests fail because they are n't breaking cleanly and telling you where the problem is .
( You could also improve this by using classic TDD on finer - grained clusters . )
The second area is if your objects do n't contain enough behavior , mockist testing may encourage the development team to create more behavior rich objects .

I have mentioned some of my Emacs hacks for editing Common Lisp code here , here , and here ( the latter of which Troels Henriksen ported to Climacs ) .
So , I finally dusted off some more code - wrangling Emacs macros and bundled them up in the Redshank minor mode .
Obligatory screencast :
The provided functionality is quite embryonic still , but I expect it to continue to grow .
For actual code motion and manipulation of Lisp code , I heavily rely on the excellent Paredit mode , with a minimal dependency on SLIME ( the dependency might grow in the future , as more sophisticated refactoring likely requires cooperation from a running Lisp . )
For laughs comparison , I 'd like to see the same done for unparenthesized code ...
Okay , enough smugness for today .
Now read the best Common Lisp Tutorial , and start hacking away !

michaelw | pkhuong : eh , okay ECONTEXT :) defclass - skeleton now inserts parenthesis balanced pkhuong | michaelw : ah good , good !
I might have to try it out then michaelw | ( bonus : customizable accessor style ) pkhuong | so I can have foo - of instead of get - foo too ?

Millions of people swap music via file - sharing networks
The surprise ruling could start a legal assault on the creators of file - sharing networks such as Grokster and Morpheus .
The case was brought by 28 movie and music makers who claimed that rampant piracy was denting profits .
The Supreme Court judges were expected to rule in favour of the file - sharers because of legal precedents set when video recorders first appeared .
Big win
The unanimous ruling is a victory for recording companies and film studios in what is widely seen as one of the most important copyright cases in years .
Andrew Lack , chief executive of Sony BMG , said his company would pursue those who failed to comply with the law .
" The court made it very clear that we can go after damages and that we can chase them out , " Mr Lack told BBC World 's World Business Report .
" We will do that if necessary , but my hope is that we will find new bridges to legitimise a lot of services that formerly were confused about what was right and wrong , legal and illegal . "
The legal case against Streamcast Networks - which makes the software behind Grokster and Morpheus - began in October 2001 when 28 media companies filed their legal complaint .
The complaint alleged that Streamcast was prospering on the back of the unfettered piracy taking place on the file - sharing networks .
However , the attempts to win damages suffered a series of defeats as successive courts sided with the file - sharing networks .
The judges in those lower courts cited a ruling made in 1984 over Sony 's Betamax video recorder .
In that case , the Supreme Court said that the majority of people using a video recorder for legal uses outweighed any illegal use of the technology .
In the ruling Justice David Souter wrote : " The question is under what circumstances the distributor of a product capable of both lawful and unlawful use is liable for acts of copyright infringement by third parties using the product . "
He added : " We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright ... is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties . "
Reaction to the ruling was swift .
Dan Glickman , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , said : " Today 's unanimous ruling is an historic victory for intellectual property in the digital age , and is good news for consumers , artists , innovation and lawful Internet businesses . "
John Kennedy , head of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry said : " It quite simply destroys the argument that peer - to - peer services bear no responsibility for illegal activities that take place on their networks . "
In other decisions on Monday , the Supreme Court :
ruled against the display of the Ten Commandments inside two Kentucky courtrooms but approved a monument to the same in Texas
declined to hear appeals by two US journalists facing a contempt ruling by a lower court over their investigation into an alleged White House intelligence leak
overturned a ruling that cable operators ' high - speed internet lines must be opened up to rivals .
One expected announcement that did not appear concerned the retirement of 80 - year - old Chief Justice William Rehnquist .
Justice Rehnquist is suffering from thyroid cancer , breathes through a tracheal tube and struggled to talk during a speech closing the current court term that thanked court workers .
Unseen effects
In its ruling the Supreme Court said there was " substantial evidence " that Streamcast Networks had " induced " people to use its software to illegally share copyrighted files .
It is unclear yet what action this ruling will prompt from movie studios and music makers who brought the original case .
It could mean claims for substantial damages from Streamcast or moves to get the file - sharing networks shut down .
It is unclear what effect the ruling will have on use of digital media
He said it would mean that users would have to get used to paying for music .
Michael McGuire , from analyst firm Gartner G2 , said : " It 's something of a surprise .
It will be interesting to see how record labels respond .
It could be argued that these peer - to - peer services were the most efficient way to deliver rich media . "
The decision could also have an impact on any technology firm developing gadgets or devices that let people enjoy media on the move .
If strictly interpreted the ruling means that these hi-tech firms will have to try to predict the ways people can use these devices to pirate copyrighted media and install controls to stop this infringement .
The ruling could also prompt a re-drafting of copyright laws by the US Congress .
Why do people go to the gym ?
We did n’t evolve with treadmills and barbells , so why should experts recommend exercising every day ?
The answer would probably be because our daily life does n’t challenge us enough physically .
I ’d like to suggest that our daily life does n’t challenge us enough mentally .
Through setting aside time to visit the mental “ gym ” and organizing my life to work various mental muscles I ’ve found it much easier to think logically , create new ideas and focus myself .
Research indicates brainpower is more than just genes
Science shows that intelligence is both environmental and genetic .
Lab rats given more toys to interact ended up much smarter than rats left without any .
Even more , studies are now showing that , contrary to an earlier belief , you can grow new neurons if given a stimulating environment .
The benefits of mental fitness
The benefits of physical fitness are obvious and visual .
In my opinion , the benefits of mental fitness are even more important , although they might be more subtle .
Here ’s just a few benefits I ’ve noticed from structuring my activities and hitting the mental gym :
Rapid learning .
It ’s no secret I barely study for exams .
My grade point average for my first year of University was a 4.2 out of a 4.5 ( my lowest mark was one B + ) .
And this is while taking courses with high failure rates such as Calculus , Asian History and Computer Science .

Logical thinking .
I ’ve been told one of the biggest assets to this blog is my ability to discuss problems with a clear line of logic and reasoning .
I believe this is an ability I ’ve greatly improved over the last few years through mental training .

Creativity .
This month I wrote about 25 articles for this blog , 15 articles as a freelancer and a handful of guest posts .
The volume of posting ideas I get is large enough that I now need to put a more strenuous filter for quality .

Memory .
I ’ve gone from almost complete absent mindedness to above average memory .
Learning memory tools such as linking and pegging have given me new methods to store information .

Focus .
When I started meditating to improve focus over a year ago , I found it hard to control a visual scene or keep out distracting thoughts .
I ’ve since noticed huge improvements so that I can hold images , ideas or focal points even with a fair degree of distraction .
I ’m still starting out , but the future looks promising .
Creating a mental fitness routine
There are two major ways to construct a mental fitness routine :
Balancing projects / activities to ensure all mental “ muscles ” are being worked intensely .
Setting aside time to hit the mental gym with activities solely for the purpose of building brainpower .
I use a combination of the two .
Unlike physical exercise which is hard to reach a high intensity in routine life , you can structure your day to ensure you are working mental muscles .
You just need to ensure that you are working all mental muscles , not just one or two .
If you go to the gym and just work biceps , you ’ll have big arms but be completely weak everywhere else .
Varied mental exercises will ensure you can handle all problems and ideas .
Here are twenty ideas for starting a mental fitness routine .
I do n’t suggest trying to implement them all .
Instead either set aside fifteen minutes a day for one of these or integrate one of them into your routine .
Journaling – Writing down your thoughts is a great tool for problem solving .
Every journal session I have , I leave amazed with the answers to tough problems I can come up with .
Journaling is your Universal Machine of the mental gym , providing good workouts for creativity , logic and focus .
Meditation – I ’ve only recently started to find serious uses for meditation in my mental regimen .
Before I saw meditation as a more spiritual than practical activity .
Now I ’ve come up with several different meditations to work different mental muscles : Visualization – One I ’ve been working on I call : eating the white apple .
Visualize a white apple and hold it in your mind .
Then imagine yourself eating it a bite at a time .
Experience all the sensations of touch , taste , sound , smell and sight .
The hard part is keeping the mental image of your apple consistent with where and how you eat it .
I can usually only go about 10 bites before the mental image degrades .

Focused Breathing – Start by slowing your breathing to about 10 - 15 seconds per breath .
Next focus on one specific part of your body on the inhale .
Select a new focus on the exhale .
You can then move this to noticing specific sounds or senses .
A good exercise in focus .

Self - Dialog – Meditation makes it easier to talk with yourself .
You can invent characters that can dialog with you , helping explore ideas .
I believe journaling is an easier form of introspection than meditation , but they both have their strengths .
Cycle Hobbies – Take up new activities regularly .
This will keep your learning curve steep so your mind is always engaged at a high intensity .
I ’ve dabbled in painting , dancing , speaking , running , music , woodworking , programming , design and many others .
Peripheral Activities – Do n’t just take new hobbies , take ones that are vastly different from each other .
Being a mile wide does n’t just improve mental fitness , it gives you a broad base of metaphors for creativity .
Read One Book Per Week – I strive to read one book each week .
Sometimes this can be difficult with time constraints , but the benefits are impressive .
If you want to save time on this one , learn speed reading .
Engaging Fiction – Engage yourself in movies , books or television that makes you think .
Television that makes you think might sound like an oxymoron , but the medium is n’t all bad if you know where to look .
Engaging does n’t just mean entertaining , but that it actively challenges your assumptions .
Puzzles – I like to do crosswords and computer game puzzles .
Solitary game playing can keep your mind sharp as long as the learning curve is steep and it does n’t become routine .
Competitive Games – Games that require strategic thinking are excellent ways to boost your logic and empathizing skills .
Chess may be an intellectual favorite , but newer games can hold more promise by being much more diverse , and having a deeper range of strategic options .
Explore Another ’s Perspective – Empathy is a mental , not just an emotional , ability .
Exploring another ’s perspective hones your ability to think through another ’s eyes .
Although empathy is often dismissed as being touchy - feely and not logical , the ability to think from another ’s perspective is an advanced mental ability that does n’t develop until we are several years old .
Create Regularly – I always like to have a project on the go .
After finishing my latest e-book , I ’ve been itching for a new challenge .
I think I ’ll be redesigning the entire website in the next month or two .
Thought Experiments – Einstein was famous for thought experiments .
This kind of reasoning ability is a mark of intelligence .
Ask yourself , “ What if ? ” Break Routines –
Try consciously breaking one of your habits , just for a moment .
Eat a different breakfast .
Take a different route to work .
Sleep in the opposite direction .
New Cultures – Expose yourself to different worldviews .
I found going to University and meeting people from vastly different cultures to have a big effect on my own ideas .
Learn Outside Your Interests – Do n’t stick to what you like .
As a geek who knows C++ and watches Star Trek , I was n’t sure whether I ’d like dancing .
But I took a Latin dancing course and found it to be both fun and interesting .
People told me I was an introvert who would n’t make a good public speaker .
I just finished my Competent Toastmaster and Competent Leader awards from the Toastmasters program .
Friendly Debate – Discuss , do n’t argue .
When you are in a debate you should try to persuade , but welcome opposing ideas not as attacks but opportunities .
Debating forces you to examine your opinions .
Teach –
When I used to teach First Aid as a lifeguard , I was often surprised at how much better I understood the material through teaching it .
Writing articles for this blog organizes those ideas inside my head .
Practice New Skills – Mastery may be useful , but I do n’t think it is as valuable to mental discipline as just getting the basics .
Unless a skill is useful to you , I ’d suggest trying to learn different skills just to adequacy and then moving to something different .
It can take six months to understand 80 % of a subject and sixty years to understand 95 % .
Force Constraints –
Try washing yourself with your eyes closed .
Cooking without sauces .
Reading upside down .
Extra constraints make problems more challenging , ramping up the mental intensity required .
Interlink – Holistic learning is about linking ideas together .
Spend some time to explore a subject and ask yourself how the pieces fit into other information .
This will organize your thinking and improve your understanding .
Increase Mental Intensity – Force yourself to use your brain more .
All these ideas are just specific implementations to increase the mental intensity you face .
Focus , strategy , logic and creativity are just a few of the mental muscles you should be exercising more regularly .

What is water ?
Everyone should know that water is the base of life .
Without food human can live for a few weeks but withouth water just a few days .
Water is amazing .
If you look at it you 'll understand this expression .
In different forms water is in the every thing on our Planer : it 's in humans , in animals , in plants , in the earth , in the clouds , etc ...
I just want to show you some of beatiful water landscapes I wondered .
I hope after this photoreport you 'll smile .
A young reader argues that the media still does n't get it :
Another thing worth noting is , I belong to a Ron Paul group on Face Book , the college - networking site .
The membership rate of growth has been astounding ; I joined a few weeks ago when we numbered a little over 2,000 ; now we 're at 12,000 and climbing .
I can tell you with confidence that Face Book has been the central hub of the Ron Paul online Blitz with outgrowths and initiatives such as students4paul.com and Republican Caucus Storm .
Here ’s a small example of how serious we are :
I 'm a passionate Ron Paul supporter , as are very many people approximately my age .
I do n't have a landline telephone , I ’m not a registered Republican and I get practically all of my news from “ alternative ” resources ( such as your blog ) .
People like me are not on the pollsters ’ radar .
As some in the political analysis field have begun to suspect , traditional polling methods are blind to technology driven structural changes in political participation / awareness .
Assuming the online support translates into real efforts to get out the vote , Dr. Paul is a stealthy but real contender .
The largest Barack Obama group on Face Book has over 300,000 members .
Ron Paul ’s 12,000 sound like small potatoes in comparison … at first glance .
Our group just finished meeting a $ 12,008 fundraising goal within 5 days of its inception ( the deadline was 6/30 ) .
5 days .
Obama 's group of 300 K also has a fundraiser and has raised $ 17,000 since the founding of the group !
That 's well over 90 days .
Publicly displayed records show that Obama 's group had about 700 contributors ( which is a .2 % participation rate ) .
Ron Paul 's group has approx 12,300 members at present and met our target with 155 contributors ( 1 % participation rate ) .
The average donation was $ 50 .
Remember , we 're all college students or recently graduated .
Mathematically speaking , Dr. Paul ’s group raised money at a rate of 20 cents per person , per day to meet its goal , while Obama ’s group can only muster .06 cents ( 6/100ths of a cent ) pp. pd. Mathematically , Ron Paul ’s supporters are 333 times more passionate ( in terms of dollars donated ) about their candidate than Obama’s .
This is because Obama 's appeal is mostly superficial .
Additionally , there is a significant difference in the quality and substance of political discussion between the respective membership populations .
Paul ’s supporters come from all over the political landscape and are almost universally intelligent ; I ’ve gotten into debates over economic methodology and arguments over a priori epistemology , discussed the economic incidence of a national sales tax based on elasticity of demand , the noxious history of central banking , and speculation on what a non-interventionist foreign policy would mean for the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Amazingly , there is no discernable “ group - think ” , only independent minds ’ coming together under the banner of liberty .
By contrast , Obama ’s message boards are populated with regurgitations of his website boilerplate , swipes at other candidates and gushing screeds about how great he is , ( admittedly , we have some of that too ) , how much “ hope ” he inspires , how he ’ll “ change ” things , because he ’s the “ future ” and various other platitudinal , saccharine adulations .
( oh , and “ buttsecks " ) .
Also , even with his celebrity and exposure , Obama ’s group is bleeding members by the day , while we ’ve been growing healthily .
So in closing Andrew , I believe Ron Paul is a major Dark Horse .
With 70 % of the public against propping up the clusterf **k of Iraq ( one of if not the top issue in America ) , he ’s the only Republican on the same page .
You and I know that all it takes is a small group of impassioned individuals to change the world .

Firmin Emolo , to be buried on Saturday , is one of the most unusual casualties of the war in Iraq .
Specialist Emolo was fondly remembered by his comrades
But Emolo's origins , as his name suggests , were not in Detroit or San Francisco , but in Ivory Coast .
The 33 - year - old was a close cousin of Nanan Boa Kouassi III , king of the Agni ethnic group in the east of the West African country .
So how did a member of an Ivorian royal family end his days as a US soldier ?
Paratroopers he served with remember him as always vigilant in his duties , one of the most physically fit soldiers , extremely proud to be in the army
Major Gen David T Zabecki
" Like many of our young men , he went to America to study , " explains family friend and local member of parliament Boa Thiemele Edjampan .
" Then he married an American , got American nationality , and joined the military . "
Unusually , the US military flew Specialist Emolo 's remains back to Ivory Coast , so he could be buried in his home town of Abengourou .
Emolo was not well known in Ivory Coast , but some Ivorians have been surprised to learn that one of their countrymen died in Iraq .
' Proud '
US Major Gen David T Zabecki accompanied the body as it arrived at Abidjan airport and paid tribute to the Ivorian - American soldier .
" As a soldier Specialist Emolo was one of the best .
I will always remember his smile , he had a beautiful smile
Sabine Emolo
US soldiers in crisp green uniforms carried his coffin onto a plinth bearing an Ivorian flag , a potent symbol of the young man 's dual loyalties .
Some 100 friends and family members wept at the airport gathering , as trumpets played in his honour .
Sabine Emolo , Firmin 's sister , spoke , in a voice that trembled slightly with emotion , of the money Firmin sent home to his family , and his pride in being a soldier .
" I can't regret him joining the army , " she told the BBC .
" I can only regret that he went so soon . "
Dog tags
She insisted that he should be buried in Ivory Coast , a decision the king is thought to have approved of wholeheartedly .
The king lead the tributes to his relative in the death notices in the local newspapers .
" The king is a very important man in Abengourou and throughout all of Ivory Coast , " says Mr Thiemele Edjampan .
" Even in the current political situation , when the king says something it is very important , because it is always for peace and reconciliation . "
Wearing a T - shirt with a photo of her brother , and his military dog tags around her neck , Sabine said she would never forget him .
" I will always remember his smile , he had a beautiful smile . "
Firmin Emolo's great objectives in life were to become American , and serve in the military .
He achieved them both , but he did n't live long enough to enjoy the achievement .

I want you to know that I love evolutionary psychologists , because the ideas , like “ girls prefer pink because they need to be better at hunting berries ” are so much fun .
Sure there are problems , like , we do n’t know a lot about life in the pleistocene period through which humans evolved ; their claims sound a bit like “ just so ” stories , relying on their own internal , circular logic ; the existing evidence for genetic influence on behaviour , emotion , and cognition , is coarse ; they only pick the behaviours which they think they can explain while leaving the rest ; and they get themselves in massive trouble as soon as they go beyond examining broad categories of human behaviors across societies and cultures , becoming crassly ethnocentric .
But that does n’t stop me enjoying their ideas .
This week every single newspaper in the world lapped up the story that scientists have cracked the pink problem .
“ At last , science discovers why blue is for boys but girls really do prefer pink ” said the Times .
And so on .
The study took 208 people in their twenties and asked them to choose their favourite colours between two options , repeatedly , and then graphed their overall preferences .
It found overlapping curves , with a significant tendency for men to prefer blue , and female subjects showing a preference for redder , pinker tones .
This , the authors speculated ( to international excitement and approval ) may be because men go out hunting , but women need to be good at interpreting flushed emotional faces , and identifying berries whilst out gathering .
Now there are some serious problems here .
Firstly , the test was n’t measuring discriminative ability , just preference .
I am yet to be given evidence that my girlfriend has the upper hand in discriminating shades of red as we gambol foraging for the fruits of the forest ( which we do ) .
But is colour preference cultural or genetic ?
Well .
The “ girls preferring pink ” thing is not set in stone , and in fact there are good reasons to suspect it is culturally determined .
I have always been led to believe by my father – the toughest man in the world – that pink is the correct colour for mens ’ shirts .
In fact until very recently blue was actively considered soft and girly , while boys wore pink , a tempered form of fierce , dramatic red .
There is no reason why you should take my word for this .
Back in the days when ladies had a home journal ( in 1918 ) the Ladies Home Journal wrote : “ There has been a great diversity of opinion on the subject , but the generally accepted rule is pink for the boy and blue for the girl .
The reason is that pink being a more decided and stronger color is more suitable for the boy , while blue , which is more delicate and dainty , is prettier for the girl . ”
The Sunday Sentinel in 1914 told American mothers : “ If you like the color note on the little one ’s garments , use pink for the boy and blue for the girl , if you are a follower of convention . ”
Some sources suggest it was n’t until the 1940s that the modern gender associations of girly pink became universally accepted .
Pink is , therefore , perhaps not biologically girly .
Boys who were raised in pink frilly dresses went down mines and fought in World War 2 .
Clothing conventions do change over time .
But within this study , was the preference stable across cultures ?
Well no , not even in this experiment , where they had some Chinese test subjects too .
For these participants , not only were the differences in the overlapping curves not so extreme ; but the favourite colours were a kind of red for boys and a bit pinker for girls ( not blue ) ; and they had more of a red preference overall .
Red , you see , is a lucky colour in contemporary Chinese culture .
And also snuggled away in the paper was the information that femininity scores on the Bem Sex Role Inventory correlated significantly with colour preference .
Now the BSRI is a joy from the 1970s , a self - rated test explicitly designed to measure how much you adhere to socially desirable , stereotypically masculine and feminine personality characteristics ( do it on yourself here ) .
You mark on the score sheet from one to seven how much you feel you suit words like theatrical , assertive , sympathetic , adaptable , or tactful ; and then your score is totted up at the end .
So women who describe themselves as “ yielding ” “ cheerful ” “ gullible ” , “ feminine ” and “ do not use harsh language ” also prefer pink .
Thanks for the warning , I ’ll try and use that to avoid them in future .
It ’s worth being critical and thoughtful about these stories , not because it ’s fun to be mean : but because that ’s what the authors would want , and also because stories about genes and culture are an important part of the stories we tell ourselves about who and what we are , our sense of personal responsibility , and the inevitability in our gender roles .

A pair of free - to - access vaguely bookish reviews of colour and gender here and here .
And here is an instructive vintage clipping courtesy of Prof Paoletti :
This story was updated on 28th September to report that the vulnerability has been patched .
Yesterday , we reported on an unholy trinity of Google vulnerabilities that put emails , private photos and website security at risk .
Today came word of a new weakness that makes it easy for bad guys to silently put a backdoor in Gmail accounts .
The technique comes courtesy of Petko D. Petkov , a researcher at GNU Citizen , who writes in a blog post that the backdoor is installed simply by luring a victim to a specially crafted website while logged in to Gmail .
The naughty site uses a sleight of hand known as a multipart / form - data POST , which writes a filter to Gmail that causes all email with attachments to be forwarded to collect@evil.com .
Petkov did n't provide a proof of concept or detailed documentation , but Ryan Naraine of the Zero Day blog writes here that the exploit was demonstrated for him .
The bug " is particularly nasty because of the way the exploit works without any user action and the fact that it ’s difficult for the average Gmail user to know that emails are being stolen , " he writes .
Users are n't likely to notice a filter has been added unless they think to check the " Filters " section of their Gmail Settings .
A Google spokesman on Thursday said company engineers had repaired the problem .
" We worked quickly to address the recently reported vulnerability , and we rolled out a fix , " he said .
" We have not received any reports of this vulnerability being exploited . "
Petkov 's discovery is just the latest way people can be burned when entrusting their personal data to Google .
Yesterday , various researchers showed how a vulnerability in the Google search appliance , which the company sells to webmasters , can be used to inject code and overwrite content on the pages of third - party sites .
Another flaw made it possible to steal photos designated as private on the Picasa application .
Google also suffered from a vulnerability that resided in the so - called polls application , a part of Google Groups , that made it possible to steal contacts and messages from Gmail accounts .
A Google spokesman on Monday afternoon said the flaw had been fixed . ®
Give Her Your Passion by Eric Disco
“ So I made her smile , now what ? ” he says to me .
This was no small feat for him .
It was a workshop in Miami .
He had never approached this many women in his life .
And he made them all smile .
They were attracted to him .
But he had nothing else to say after the first 30 seconds .
So he was ejecting from conversations .
You can open a conversation with a girl , but where do you go from there ?
I start asking him questions about himself .
Where he worked , what he likes to do for fun .
What are his hobbies , what are his true interests ?
What was the most fun he had in the last month ?
At first I found out he “ worked in a kitchen . ”
But as we talked more , his answers revealed a whole different side to him .
He loved cooking and passionately talked about it .
He was into philosophy and loved being with his friends .
He had an iconoclastic sense of humor .
Women want to see your passion .
They want to know what you really care about .
I ’m in love with music .
I love to talk about it .
I once mentioned to someone that I probably talk about music too much .
But they said that they like to talk about it with me because they can see my face light up when I talk about it .
People can tell when you love what you ’re into .
Women love it .
This guy Osho has an interesting perspective on it :
Women love a deluded man .
They are always searching for a deluded man , somebody who is mad and insane because they find a deluded man more attractive than an ordinary man .
The insane , deluded man has certain magnetism ; he is full of possibilities , dreams .
Women love dreamers .
That ’s why women fall in love with people who have great illusions about themselves .
An ordinary man is one who has no illusions ; no woman is attracted towards an ordinary man .
A deluded man looks magical .
He has magic , his eyes flare up with something unknown , something not of this earth , something of beyond and that is the desire of the woman .
He has the sense of possibility and that sense of possibility gives him the quality of magic .
This is the reason lot many beautiful women hang around musicians , singers and actors .
Everybody is bored with their lives .
There are few things more exciting than being with someone who is passionate about what they do .
You do n’t need to be a rock star for women to be attracted to your passion .
It can be whatever you are into , whether it ’s rock climbing , chess , or stamp collecting .
Your passion will come out .
Next time a girl asks “ what you do ? ” , instead of monotonously giving her a job description , try answering the question “ What are you passionate about ? ”
What are you truly interested in ?
What have you been thinking a lot about lately ?
What have you been reading about ?
If you are going to take the time to connect with someone , why not talk about what YOU really WANT to talk about ?
It will show .

I am frightened to death of George Bush .
I fear a secret government .
I abhor a government that refuses to supply the Congress with requested information .
I am against a government that refuses to tell the country with whom the leaders of our country sat down and determined our energy policy , and to prove how much they want to keep that secret , they took it all the way to the Supreme Court . …
For me , as a Republican , I feel that when my party gives me a dangerous leader who flouts the truth , takes the country into an undeclared war and then adds a war on terrorism to it without debate by the Congress , we have a duty to rid ourselves of those who are taking our country on a perilous ride in the wrong direction .
If we are indeed the party of Lincoln ( I paraphrase his words ) , a president who deems to have the right to declare war at will without the consent of the Congress is a president who far exceeds his power under our Constitution . ”

WACO , Tex. , Aug. 27 — Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , whose tenure has been marred by controversy and accusations of perjury before Congress , announced his resignation in Washington today , declaring that he had “ lived the American dream ” by being able to lead the Justice Department .
Mr. Gonzales , who had rebuffed calls for his resignation for months , submitted it to President Bush by telephone on Friday , a senior administration official said .
There had been rumblings over the weekend that Mr. Gonzales ’s departure was imminent , although the White House sought to quell the rumors .
Mr. Gonzales appeared cheerful and composed when he announced that he was stepping down effective Sept. 17 .
His very worst days on the job were “ better than my father ’s best days , ” he said , alluding to his family ’s hardscrabble past .
“ Thank you , and God bless America , ” Mr. Gonzales said , exiting without responding to questions .
In Waco , President Bush said he had accepted the resignation reluctantly .
He praised his old friend as “ a man of integrity , decency and principle ” and complained of the “ months of unfair treatment ” that preceded the resignation .

John Conyers is flat out wrong – 2.4 dead American soldiers a day times 546 days wrong !
Constitutional liberties flying out the door wrong !
Political expediency and advantage over integrity and the best interests of our Democratic Republic wrong .
ImpeachforPeace.org just received a phone call from the offices of www .
WorldCan’tWait.org regarding the meeting which just took place in with John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) , the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , in his offices in DC with a contingent of peace and justice lobbyists including Cindy Sheehan , Ray McGovern , Rev. Lennox Yearwood , Ann Wright , Debra Sweet , Dave Lindorff , David Swanson , Jodie Evans , Medea Benjamin , Kevin Zeese , Tina Richards and others .
Apparently Conyers has been convinced that waiting another year and a half with unrepentent , unpunished criminals in the White House at a cost of 2.4 dead American soldiers / day is an acceptable price to pay for anticipated Democratic Party victories in 2008 .
Will the real John Conyers , Jr. please stand up ?
Does someone have a proverbial ‘ gun to his head ’ ?
Has his family been threatened ?
What is going on ?
Is there any way that we can get Conyers to read George W. Bush versus the U.S. Constitution : The Downing Street Memos and Deception , manipulation , Torture , Retribution , and Coverups in the Iraq War and Illegal Domestic Spying Compiled at the Direction of Representative John Conyers ?
It is a really good read , with lots of research and detail .
I liked it so much , in fact , that I ordered an autographed copy from Mr. Conyers at a cost of an $ 80.00 donation to his re-election fund .
I want my money back .

Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears weekly on CNN.com .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The Bush administration and the leadership of the Democratic Party are preparing to take another legislative leap at imposing a massive illegal alien amnesty on American citizens .
And the mainstream media are complicit in advancing this thinly veiled blanket amnesty .
Instead of asking and answering important questions about why our immigration laws are n't being enforced and why we 're permitting pervasive document fraud , the national media seem hell - bent on trying to obfuscate the issue , shamelessly playing with language , equating legal immigration with illegal immigration while obviously trying to preserve the illusion of objectivity .
Too often , the language of the national media describes illegal immigration as " migration " and illegal aliens as " undocumented immigrants , " even though many of them have lots of documents , most of which are fraudulent or stolen .
Some media outlets have taken to calling illegal aliens " entrants . "
Whether such language is meant to engender sympathy or to intentionally blur the distinction between legal and illegal , the mainstream media are taking sides in this debate .
The Arizona Republic , for example , used " undocumented immigrant " more than 80 times in 36 separate stories in the past month alone ; the term appeared as many as 12 times in one article on " migration , " according to our Lexis - Nexis search .
At the same time , " illegal alien " appeared a total of only nine times during that span , with seven of the references coming from readers ' opinions , one from a quotation and one from an editorial .
The mainstream media report as if America would no longer be a welcoming nation if we stopped illegal immigration .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Why do the national media conveniently and routinely neglect to report that the United States brings in more lawful immigrants than the countries of the rest of the world combined ?
Each year , we accept 2 million immigrants legally .
We give a million legal immigrants permanent residency every year .
We bestow citizenship on 700,000 people a year and provide almost half a million work - related visas a year .
Illegal immigration , in fact , has the potential to change the course of American history : Demographers at the Brookings Institution and the Population Reference Bureau paint a troubling picture of the future of our democracy .
As more illegal aliens cross our borders and settle in large states like California , Texas and Florida , congressional seats will be redistributed to these bigger states following each decennial Census .
States with low levels of immigration will ultimately lose seats as a result .
Unfortunately for American citizens , this seismic shift in political representation will be decided by noncitizens that cannot vote .
Congress will soon take up so - called comprehensive immigration reform , and a bipartisan House bill would probably admit 400,000 guest workers a year .
And since any plan calling for eventual legalization would include family members who live outside the United States , the legislation would open our borders to tens of millions of people .
The Heritage Foundation 's Robert Rector estimated that the 2006 version of the McCain - Kennedy bill would have added an additional 66 million immigrants over the next 20 years .
The bill may change , but that estimate has yet to be refuted .
There 's no question this type of mass immigration would have a calamitous effect on working citizens and their families .
Professor Carol Swain , professor of law and political science at Vanderbilt University and author of " Debating Immigration , " would like to see more people speak up for the sectors of society most affected by illegal immigration .
" How many African - American leaders have you seen come out and address the impact that high levels of illegal immigration [ are ] having in the communities when it comes to jobs , when it comes to education , when it comes to health care ? " she asked .
" And often , these low - skilled , low - wage workers compete in the same sectors for jobs . "
Let 's have a vigorous open debate on illegal immigration in this country , and let 's begin with the facts .
Estimates of illegal aliens in this country range from 12 million to 20 million people .
Why does n't our government know how many there are ?
Should n't this Congress and this president at least recognize that the industries in which illegal aliens are employed in the greatest percentages also are suffering the largest wage declines ?
And should n't there be an economic impact statement researched and delivered to this Congress , this president and the rest of us before any legislation granting amnesty is even considered ?
Should n't we first bring the facts of illegal immigration out of the shadows ?

ActiveRecord is a funny thing .
On the outside it looks great – it neatly maps relational data to Ruby objects and provides an easy to use API via its domain specific language .
But on the inside , it contains two suprising architecture flaws that make it difficult to extend and negatively impact performance .
The Vietnam of Computer Science
Mapping object to relational data turns out to be quite tricky .
There are so many failed object - relational mapping systems that the whole field has been called the Vietnam of Computer Science .
The problem is that objects and tables do n’t map cleanly to each other , and the more you try to automate the process the more complex your code becomes , and sooner or later your system becomes too hard and too slow to use .
The approach that I think works best , and ActiveRecord follows , is too keep things relatively simple .
An record in a table is mapped to an object , and any related tables are mapped to associations that contain one or more object ( depending if the relation is one to one or one to many ) .
And that ’s it , anything past that risks descending into the morass of failed object - relational mappings .
ActiveRecord gets bonus points because it makes it easy to define such mappings via its Domain Specific Language ( DSL ) – the familiar methods : has_one , : has_many , etc .
Botching Columns
But underneath its exterior , ActiveRecord has a couple of architecture flaws in the way that it handles columns ( attributes ) .
The first issue is that ActiveRecord botches its implementation of columns .
Reading and writing data from a database requires converting the data from its textual representation ( provided by the database ’s client APIs ) to and from Ruby objects .
Let ’s look at how Rails does it for Postgresql :
A quick glance at some code shows the problem :
def translate_field_type(field_type ) case field_type when /\[ \ ] $ / i then ' string ' when / ^timestamp / i then ' datetime ' when / ^real| ^money / i then ' float ' when / ^interval / i then ' string ' when /^(?:point|lseg|box| " ? path " ?|polygon|circle ) / i then ' string ' when / ^bytea / i then ' binary ' else field_type #
Pass through standard types .
end end def default_value ( value ) # Boolean types return " t " if value =~ / true / i return " f " if value =~ / false / i # Char / String / Bytea type values return $ 1 if value =~ /^'(.*) '::( bpchar|text|character varying|bytea ) $ / # Numeric values return value if value =~ /^-? [ 0 - 9 ] +( \. [ 0 - 9 ] *)?/ #
Fixed dates / times return $ 1 if value =~ /^'(.+) '::( date|timestamp ) / #
Anything else is blank , some user type , or some function # and we can't know the value of that , so return nil .
return nil end
Having large case statements in an object - oriented language is a sure sign your design is flawed .
The fundamental problem is that the implementation above is not extensible – you ca n’t easily add your own field types .
You could argue that that extensibility was not a design goal of ActiveRecord , but that would be silly .
Even if you agreed that ActiveRecord should only support a few limited data types ( which I do n’t ) there are still enough differences between databases that having an extensible system would clean up the internals of ActiveRecord and get rid of the grungy code above .
And more importantly , it would let users add their own data types .
And that is important .
For example , with MapBuzz we need to support Postgres ’s geometry types and we would also like to support its full text search types .
Overriding Rails to support them is an exercise in annoyance since it requires overriding various core methods in the Postgresql adapter .
The way this should have been implemented is introducting a Column object .
The column object ’s api would be simple – it would have a serialize and derialize method .
Note that ActiveRecord does indeed have a column object , but its very weird implementation .
For example :
def klass case type when : integer then Fixnum when : float then Float when : decimal then BigDecimal when : datetime then Time when : date then Date when : timestamp then Time when : time then Time when : text , : string then String when : binary then String when : boolean then Object end end
This code is clearly trying to be much too clever .
Keep it simple stupid !
There should be a TimeColumn , FloatColumn , etc .
That way , a developer can add their own column types – so for us a GeomColumn .
Attributes
The second issue , which is related , is the way that column values are handled .
ActiveRecord stores data read from a database in a hash table called attributes .
But suprisingly , the attributes hash table is also used to store Ruby objects .
Thus the data stored in the attributes hash table may either be a Ruby object ( in serialized format ) or the text returned from the database ( unserialized ) .
This is a horrible design for two main reasons .
First , it means that every time an attribute is accessed there has to be code to check to see if its its in string format not .
If it is , the data must be converted to Ruby , which causes a performance hit .
Second , it means that ActiveRecord cannot keep track of which attributes have changed and which have not .
That ’s important , because it means that ActiveRecord updates every column even when just one column changes .
Besides being a performance hit , it means that ActiveRecord will corrupt your database if you are not careful .
That happens when a table contains a column type that ActiveRecord is not familiar with – a good example being a ts_vector field in Postgresql .
ActiveRecord will attempt to update it using the wrong value although the column has n’t changed at all .
So what ’s a better solution ?
A pure object - oriented solution would introduce a Field object , which has four fields – the raw value ( from the database ) , the serialized value ( the ruby object ) , a reference to the column object which knows how to serialize / deserialize the field and a changed column .
But that ’s pretty heavy - weight since you ’re introducing an extra object per field per record .
An alternate solution would be too introduce three hash tables per record – one to hold the raw values , one to hold the serialized values and one to hold the changed flag .
You would also want to store references to the records columns , most likely on the class itself ( so if your table is called parents , then store the column information on the Parent class ) .
Fixing Active Record
The good news is that the Rails team is looking at these issues .
In particular , Michael Koziarski has recently posted a patch that introduces the concept of a separate hash table to store serialized values .

Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This
The US House of Representatives today passed a bill that closes a " loophole " that allowed President Bush to circumvent the Senate confirmation process for federal prosecutors .
The legislation , authored by Senator Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) , passed the House with a vote of 306 - 114 .
It has already cleared the Senate ( 94 - 2 ) , and it is expected that Bush will sign it into law .
The provision that this legislation will change was inserted into the USA Patriot Act reauthorization last year , and allowed the Attorney General to appoint US Attorneys indefinitely without Senate approval .
It came to light after eight US Attorneys were fired late last year .
" Congress has spoken , and it is clear that we want accountability .
Both the House and Senate have passed legislation to ensure that the Senate confirms every U.S. Attorney , " Senator Feinstein said in a statement .
" Many unanswered questions remain , including who in the Department of Justice put the names of eight U.S. Attorneys on the list for removal .
We will continue this investigation until we flesh out who did what , when , and why . "
The " Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 " will restore the provision for appointing replacement prosecutors to the process that was law between 1986 and 2006 .
Under the new law , the Attorney General will be able to appoint interim prosecutors for 120 days .
If the president has not sent a nominee to the Senate for confirmation within that time , the authority to appoint an interim attorney will fall to a district court .
AMERICA is watching Don Imus ’s self - immolation in a state of shock and awe .
And I ’m watching America with wry amusement .
Since I ’m a second - class citizen — a gay man — my seats for the ballgame of American discourse are way back in the bleachers .
I do n’t have to wait long for a shock jock or stand - up comedian to slip up with hateful epithets aimed at me and mine .
Hate speak against homosexuals is as commonplace as spam .
It ’s daily traffic for those who profess themselves to be regular Joes , men of God , public servants who live off my tax dollars , as well as any number of celebrities .
In fact , I get a good chuckle whenever someone refers to “ the media ” as an agent of “ the gay agenda . ”
There are entire channels , like Spike TV , that could n’t fill an hour of programming if required to remove their sexist and homophobic content .
We ’ve got a president and a large part of Congress willing to change the Constitution so they can deprive of us our rights because they feel we are not “ normal . ”
So I ’m used to catching foul balls up here in the cheap seats .
What I am really enjoying is watching the rest of you act as if you had no idea that prejudice was alive and well in your hearts and minds .
Ecologist Maira Nurkisheva is driving over what was once the northern shore of the Aral Sea , a vast inland lake straddling the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan .
Rusting abandoned ships dot the sandy seabed .
Some have been scavenged for scrap metal ; the others provide shade for irritable herds of Bactrian camels .
There are few other signs of life .
When we reach the nearby village of Birlistik , which used to overlook a bay on the sea , we see that its mud-walled huts now face an insecticide - laced desert , filled with tumbleweeds and toxic shrubs , that stretches as far as the eye can see .
Yet the villagers all speak enthusiastically of the boget , or dam , that is part of the grand waterworks project for which Nurkisheva is a consultant .
Fifteen - year - old Parxhat Kutmanbetov explains in Kazakh , and Nurkisheva translates : " I 've never seen the sea .
But now I am sure the sea is coming back . "
If all goes as planned , within a few years the Aral Sea could creep back to within three miles of the village .
Revival of the shrunken sea hinges on an $ 85 million renovation of Kazakhstan 's dilapidated system of river canals , sluices , and channels , culminating in an eight - mile dam across the middle of the northern part of the sea .
The effort , a collaboration between the World Bank and the oil - rich Kazakh government , aims to reverse the decades of desiccation that have shriveled one of the world 's biggest inland bodies of water .
Four decades ago , the Aral Sea offered a constant supply of fish .
Two dozen species thrived in its waters , including caviar - rich sturgeon , pike perch , and silver carp , known locally as fat tongue .
The sea spread over more than 26,000 square miles , and ships could travel 250 miles from the northern port of Aralsk , in Kazakhstan , to the southern harbor of Muynak in Uzbekistan .
But Soviet - sponsored irrigation projects , begun in the 1950s , diverted water from two rivers that fed the sea : the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya .
By the late '90s , the Aral Sea was known as the world 's fastest - disappearing body of water .
It had then shrunk by more than half and lost nearly three - fourths of its volume .
Now , after decades of grim losses , the news from the Aral Sea is good :
Since the dam 's completion last August , the smaller , northern part of the Aral Sea has swelled by 30 percent , flooding more than 300 square miles of parched , sun-bleached seabed .
For thousands of years , people have lived in the Aral Sea basin , which served as an oasis on the Silk Road , the trading route that linked China to Europe .
" Three thousand years ago , this was an agricultural region , " says Philip Micklin , an Aral Sea expert and geographer emeritus from Western Michigan University .
" You 'd have seen wooden irrigation canals all along the Amu Darya . "
Even in 1558 , Anthony Jenkinson , an envoy for Queen Elizabeth I , foresaw trouble : " In short time all that land is like to be destroyed , and to become a wilderness for want of water . "
Soviet planners in the 1950s diverted much of the rivers ' flow to water fields of rice and cotton in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and in farther - flung Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
The irrigation system was so leaky that many canals lost more than 50 percent of the diverted river water en route to the fields , which cut the amount flowing into the sea .
By the 1970s , everyone could see that something had gone terribly wrong .
" The sea was dying in front of my eyes , " remembers fishery director Agilbek Aimbetov .
" We survived on enthusiasm alone , " he says , using a popular Soviet - era euphemism for working for little or no pay .
Not only was the sea drying up , it was growing lethally salty .
Like the Great Salt Lake in Utah , the Aral Sea has no naturally occurring outlets and over time collects salt from river deposits .
With less water flowing in , the process accelerated .
By the late 1980s , 10,424 square miles of seafloor had become desert and was layered with toxic salts .
Water salinity had risen from 10 grams per liter in the 1950s , when the sea was healthy , to about 26 grams per liter in 1990 .
( At 35 grams per liter , it would be as salty as the ocean . )
All 24 species of fish disappeared .
The water " was n't quite salt paste yet , but nothing could survive in it , " says Masood Ahmad of the World Bank , who was project leader for the massive undertaking in Kazakhstan .
" No biological life was possible . "
The effects rippled throughout the region .
Without this source of food or water , only a few dozen of the 180 known native land - animal species survived the desiccation .
When the fishing industry collapsed in the 1980s , thousands of locals fled their villages to search for a new life in larger cities .
Those remaining behind eked out an existence on the land .
Tuberculosis reached epidemic proportions , and infant mortality rates quadrupled , with acute respiratory diseases accounting for 50 percent of the deaths .
Potable water became scarce throughout the area , and even breathing the air was risky .
Chemical runoff from agricultural fields simply dried on the seafloor and was ferried back into towns with the first winds .
By 1990 the shrinking waters had separated into two parts — the northern " Small Sea " in Kazakhstan and the southern " Large Sea " in neighboring Uzbekistan .
As the seas evaporated , hard - packed sand replaced water around the hundreds of islands that had dotted the sea and had provided a haven for wildlife .
When the waters vanished around Vozrozhdeniya Island , a Soviet germ - warfare facility for open - air testing of anthrax , plague , and smallpox in the southern Aral Sea , U.S. officials in 2000 became so worried that they sent funds and experts to clean up buried stockpiles of the remaining lethal bacteria .
In 2002 the U.N. estimated that winds carried 200,000 tons of salt and toxic sand each day throughout the Aral Sea region and thousands of miles beyond , sometimes reaching as far as Russia 's Arctic north — a problem that still continues .
" Everything is polluted with herbicides , metals , and salt , " says the Aralsk regional hospital 's head doctor , Arginbau Asanbaev .
Experts believe the ecological disaster has displaced more than 100,000 people and affected the health of more than 5 million people throughout the region .
Plans to save the sea abounded ; " assessment fatigued " locals joked that if each visiting scientist had brought a bucket of water , the sea would be filled .
The Soviets dreamed up a $ 40 billion scheme to divert rivers flowing into the Arctic Sea into the Aral instead , but the plan was shelved for lack of cash .
After the Soviet Union collapsed , desperate Kazakh villagers built a primitive dam out of sand to keep the water that trickled into the northern sea from draining away into the southern portion .
The dam washed away in the late '90s .
After years of failed initiatives , bureaucratic negligence , and post - Soviet squabbling among former republics , there is now real hope for the Aral Sea .
The effort by the World Bank and the Kazakh government , begun in 2001 , has reconstructed nearly 60 miles of canals , sluices , and waterworks , dramatically improving water distribution in Kazakhstan .
The river flow now efficiently irrigates fields along the banks of the Syr Darya and runs into and rejuvenates the dried - up Aral Sea .
The Kok - Aral Dam , the project 's centerpiece , traps the increased flow from the Syr Darya into the northern Aral Sea , preventing it from draining away into the southern Aral Sea , most of which lies in neighboring Uzbekistan .
Composed of packed fine sand topped with coarser sand , the dam spans eight miles and looks like a slightly elevated gravel road .
Its long , gentle slope protects it from being washed away .
The dam was finished in August 2005 .
In just seven months , the water level near the dam rose from 126 to 138 feet , fanning northward over 310 square miles of parched seabed and adding about 28 million cubic feet of lifesaving water .
Optimists had hoped that in 5 to 10 years , flow from the Syr Darya influx would result in a significant spillover into the southern sea .
In February 2006 , the dam 's spillway opened far ahead of schedule , providing a preferred fishing hole for locals .
Kudabai Zhienbayev , the leader of the sparsely populated region , says : " There are seven wonders in the world , and this dam is the eighth .
To divide the sea in two and save it — it 's a miracle . "
Alan Howitt , project manager for the enormous construction effort , says improved river management overall has been key .
When he first saw the Soviet - era channels and control gates along the once - mighty Syr Darya , he was shocked .
" They were rusted and full of holes .
It was a mess . "
His engineers covered holes with steel plates , widened sluices , and in some areas even straightened the river .
The flow of the Syr Darya soon doubled to 28,252 cubic feet per second .
With water levels rising , thickets of reeds have cropped up along the banks of the Syr Darya , providing harbor and food for waterfowl , which in turn has led to more Asiatic foxes , wolves , and wild asses , or kulans , and boars .
But the creature that excites leading Aral Sea specialist Nick Aladin , head of the Brackish Water Laboratory at the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg , is the cladoceran , known as the jumping water flea .
In his lilting Russian accent , Aladin explains that " Cladocera are very , very tasty for all fish .
Even the piranhas in my home aquarium love them . "
When the Syr Darya and the Aral Sea were choked off , the region 's 12 species of Cladocera dwindled to one or two .
The return of the fleas , and the countless species that feed on them , says Aladin , " is a very good sign . "
The next phase of the project will bring further improvements that benefit the north , perhaps a higher dam or an additional dam that would allow waters to flow even further northward .
Other possibilities include hydropower and a greater emphasis on fishery development , which could draw funding for both government and private commercial fishing enterprises .
With rumors circulating of fishermen making upwards of $ 800 a day , villages closest to the dam are already vying for international investment .
Zhienbayev , who grew up not far from here , gazes at the fishermen drawing in net after net .
" I 'm so happy .
I 've waited my whole life for this .
Not long ago this was all sand ; we called this the Dead Sea . "
One of the fishermen from his village , 26 - year - old Darxhan Rysmakgombetov , comes to shore with dozens of carp flapping violently in his net .
" I caught these in an hour , " he says , beaming .
Until recently , the only fish that could survive the salt levels were brine shrimp and a special salt - tolerant flounder that had been introduced in 1979 .
Locals thought the fish was " very strange looking , " said Zhienbayev .
" No one wanted to eat it . "
With increased river flow , the salt level has been dropping , reaching about 14 grams per liter this summer .
The water by the dam , which I sampled , is still somewhat briny but hardly the salty , chemical cocktail I 'd expected .
Because of releases from local hatcheries , 11 species , including pike perch , silver carp , and vobla — a delicacy when dried — are now thriving .
Zhienbayev whispers that he has " a commercial secret . "
Last year , during a preliminary attempt to release sturgeon into the lakes around the Aral Sea , he and his villagers surreptitiously stashed away 100 fingerlings in a hatchery pond .
That pond is the centerpiece of his dusty village , Tastak , where locals proudly display a wheelbarrow full of gasping , knobby - spined sturgeon , soon to be full of what the villagers call their black gold — caviar .
Once the salinity of the Aral Sea drops to half what it is now , in perhaps two years , larger hatcheries will begin releasing sturgeon into it .
Several years ago the U.N. predicted that the Aral Sea might disappear entirely by 2020 , and that fate is still plausible for the southern portion .
While oil - rich Kazakhstan has the resources to invest in longer - term solutions , the resource - poor Uzbeks seem more inclined to search for oil in the barren sea bottom than to finance a rescue of the sea itself .
" It 's two parallel universes , " says Aladin .
" They are happy in the north and poor in the south . "
Philip Micklin , of Western Michigan University , says that despite spillover from the dam , the southern portion of the sea in Uzbekistan will probably shrink a little bit faster than it would have before the dam 's construction .
" That 's just the truth of it .
The Uzbek government did n't raise any objection to the dam , but it 's not going to help them . "
Aladin and Micklin contend that rerouting the Amu Darya , the southern sea's primary tributary , to flow into the western or eastern portions of the sea could slow or stop the shrinkage .
But more people in Uzbekistan depend on agriculture than in Kazakhstan .
Deciding how to apportion water resources in a poor land is " a difficult decision , " says Aladin .
" It 's like the mother of two children during the siege of Leningrad who must decide which child to keep alive , which one gets the bread . "
Even Masood Ahmad agrees it would be almost impossible to save the sea in its entirety .
" If we brought all river water back to the Aral Sea , it would still take more than 70 years to fill it back up , just like it took 50 years to bring it down . "
Of course , doing that would be ruinous for the farmers who rely on river water for agriculture .
One of the reasons for the project 's success is that the participants were limited to Kazakhstan .
Previous restoration efforts had stalled because of problems with cooperation among multiple states .
Nonetheless , the outcome of this project might hold the solution for other troubled waterways , such as the Salton Sea in California or Lake Chad in Central Africa .
In the meantime , the largest town on the northern Aral Sea , Aralsk , awaits the return of water to its withered harbor .
But even at a distance , the people are experiencing benefits .
The rising waters have already influenced the region 's weather , bringing clouds and rainstorms last May that had been absent for decades .
Farmers benefit because the increase in precipitation extends the growing season .
The town 's chief doctor , Asanbaev , sees other signs of improvement .
In the past year , the incidence of anemia among young women has decreased from about 70 to 80 percent to around 50 percent .
Like many locals , he thinks better nutrition is the reason .
Fish are easier to get now that the sea , once 62 miles away , is just 9 miles distant .
" Thanks to the rebuilding of this dam , there are already satellite dishes on our homes , cars in the streets , weddings , a new school , " boasts deputy mayor of Aralsk , Gabit Ospanov .
Yet he grows quiet when asked about neighboring Uzbekistan , home to the larger portion of the sea , which will reap few of the dam 's benefits .
" Each government must think of its own people , " he seems to recite .
" We showed them what to do .
Now they can do what they want . "

By getting rid of the junk you can free up a lot of space for the important things you need .
Some months ago , I wrote a Python implementation of Daniel Lemire ‘s Weighted Slope One collaborative filtering algorithm .
Steve Jenson sent me a pointer to his Scala implementation last week , but his code is a straight port of the Python version , not using any of Scala ’s tasty functional crunchiness .
In an idle period the other evening , I ported my Python code to Haskell .
module SlopeTwo ( Rating , SlopeOne , empty , predict , update ) where import Data .
List ( foldl ' ) import qualified Data .
Map as M newtype SlopeOne a = SlopeOne ( M.Map a ( M. Map a ( Int , Double ) ) ) deriving ( Show ) type Rating a = M.Map a Double empty = SlopeOne M.empty addT ( a , b ) ( c , d ) = let ( l , r ) = ( a+c , b+d ) in l `seq` r `seq` ( l , r ) update :: Ord a => SlopeOne a -> [ Rating a ] ->
SlopeOne a update ( SlopeOne s ) = SlopeOne .
M.map ( M.map norm ) . foldl ' update ' s where norm ( a , b ) = ( a , b / fromIntegral a ) update ' s rm = foldl ' ( \m ( k , v ) -> insert m k v ) s prod where prod = [ ( ( a , b ) , ( 1 , m - n ) ) | ( a , m ) SlopeOne a -> Rating a ->
Rating a predict ( SlopeOne s ) rm = let freqm = foldl ' insert M.empty [ ( a , b, r ) | ( a , m ) b / fromIntegral a ) freqm find m ( a , b ) = M.findWithDefault ( 0,0 ) b ( M.findWithDefault M.empty a m ) in M.filterWithKey ( \k v -> v > 0 && M.notMember k rm ) norm
The Haskell code uses essentially the same approach as the Python code , though of course it has to use purely functional maps instead of dicts ( hash tables ) , because hash tables do n’t make much sense in a functional language .
I also cut down the number of maps from two to one , which simplified the code a little .
Also , instead of doubly nested loops , the Haskell code uses single folds .
How can we replace nested loops with a single unnested equivalent ?
The answer lies in treating lists as control flow : we use a list comprehension to generate the cartesian product of two lists , after the following manner .
Congress voted this past week to authorize nearly $ 40 billion for the Department of Homeland Security , but the result will likely continue to be more bureaucracy and less security for Americans .
Five years into this new department , Congress still cannot agree on how to handle the mega - bureaucracy it created , which means there has been no effective oversight of the department .
While Congress remains in disarray over how to fund and oversee the department , we can only wonder whether we are more vulnerable than we were before Homeland Security was created .
I was opposed to the creation of a new Homeland Security department from the beginning .
Only in Washington would anyone call the creation of an additional layer of bureaucracy on top of already bloated bureaucracies “ streamlining . ”
Only in Washington would anyone believe that a bigger , more centralized federal government means more efficiency .
When Congress voted to create the Homeland Security department , I strongly urged that  at the least  FEMA and the Coast Guard should remain independent entities outside the department .
Our Coast Guard has an important mission  to protect us from external threats  and in my view it is dangerous to experiment with rearranging the deck chairs when the United States is vulnerable to attack .
As I said at the time , “ the Coast Guard and its mission are very important to the Texas Gulf coast , and I do n’t want that mission relegated to the back burner in a huge bureaucracy . ”
Likewise with FEMA .
At the time of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security , I wrote “ we risk seeing FEMA become less responsive as part of DHS .
FEMA needs to be a flexible , locally focused , hands - on agency that helps people quickly after a disaster . ”
Unfortunately and tragically , we all know very well what happened in 2005 with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
We know that FEMA ’s handing of the disaster did in many cases more harm than good .
FEMA was so disorganized and incompetent in its management of the 2005 hurricanes that one can only wonder how much the internal disarray in the Department of Homeland Security may have contributed to that mismanagement .
Folding responsibility for defending our borders into the Department of Homeland Security was also a bad idea , as we have come to see .
The test is simple :
We just ask ourselves whether our immigration enforcement has gotten better or worse since functions were transferred into this super bureaucracy .
Are our borders being more effectively defended against those who would enter our country illegally ?
I do n’t think so .
Are we better off with an enormous conglomerate of government agencies that purports to keep us safe ?
Certainly we are spending more money and getting less for it with the Department of Homeland Security .
Perhaps now that the rush to expand government in response to the attacks of 9/11 is over , we can take a good look at what is working , what is making us safer , and what is not .
If so , we will likely conclude that the Department of Homeland Security is too costly , too bloated , and too bureaucratic .
Hopefully , then we will refocus our efforts on an approach that does n’t see more federal bureaucracy in Washington as the best way to secure the rest of the nation .
New immigration rules will force undocumented workers to be fired Bush aides unveil tough enforcement rules for employers
People clamoring for a crackdown on illegal immigration got their wish with the Bush administration 's announcement Friday of sweeping new enforcement measures that will force employers to fire the millions of illegal workers they now employ .
" We strike at that magnet " of jobs , said Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff , announcing a new rule holding employers liable for workers whose Social Security numbers do not match government records .
The new rule takes effect in 30 days .
No state stands to feel the effects more than California , which has more illegal immigrants - an estimated 2.5 million - than any other state .
California farmers are expected to be among the hardest hit with their heavy reliance on Mexican field hands , the vast majority of whom are undocumented .
But service businesses will be heavily affected too , from hotels and restaurants to cleaning services and nursing homes .
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein predicted a " catastrophe " in the state 's $ 32 billion agriculture industry as the new rules become effective with the fall harvest .
But the proposal met no opposition from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , who issued a statement saying , " Securing our border remains a top priority for the New Direction Congress . "
The rule that will require employers to fire employees unable to clear up problems with their Social Security numbers 90 days after they 've been notified or face sanctions and a fine of at least $ 2,200 for a first offense .
Up until now , employers have routinely ignored what are called no -match letters .
" In certain industries and in certain states , there will be a very significant impact on the functioning of businesses or entire sectors , " said Deborah Meyers , a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute , a nonpartisan think tank .
" Some employers are going to find themselves having to fire significant portions of their workforces , and I think there will be employees - some who are authorized and some who are not - who will find themselves out of a job . "
Meyers predicted the fallout to be quite visible within six months .
Business groups pointed out that a significant fraction of no-match letters - including 11 percent for the work - authorized foreign born - are in error because of name changes and clerical mistakes , and could cause trouble for legal workers .
Immigrant rights groups said the rule could drive millions of illegal immigrants who are now paying taxes underground and drive businesses who depend on them to relocate overseas .
The system also has a big loophole that some experts warn could lead to more identity theft .
Social Security does not catch numbers that are valid but have been stolen and used by another person , increasing the incentive to steal valid Social Security numbers .
Hiring undocumented workers has been illegal for two decades , but until now , employers were not held liable for fraudulent documents .
" This is going to cause a lot of pain , but that pain I hope will be an impetus for our nation to get realistic and fix our broken immigration system , " said Larry Rohlfes , assistant executive director of the California Landscape Contractors Association .
" In the meantime , people are going to be hurt . "
Rohlfes predicted that many workers would not leave the country but go underground as unlicensed contractors , where they will not pay taxes .
" It 's going to hurt our remaining workers because the underground economy competes with us and because they have much lower costs , " Rohlfes said .
Much will hinge on how effectively the administration enforces the new rules .
" If you look at what ICE ( Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) has been doing , they 've been pretty busy , " said Karen Maarouf , director of product marketing for Workforce Logic , a Sonoma company that sells worker verification software .
Maarouf said employers have to report Social Security withholding on all workers , so the new rules will affect everyone .
The new crackdown follows a year of stepped - up workplace raids focused on criminal enforcement , as well as a significant tightening of the border with Mexico , including the addition of National Guard troops , new fencing in urban areas and a rapid expansion of the Border Patrol .
Until last year , only a handful of employers had been sanctioned for hiring illegal workers , and the chances of getting caught were for all practical purposes zero .
The administration came under intense attack from both parties for lax enforcement .
President Bush threw all that was left of his political heft into passing a broad overhaul measure that would have coupled an employment crackdown with broader avenues for businesses to obtain workers legally , through more permanent immigration slots , a special program for farmers , and a new guest worker regime .
To build support and allay charges that it was failing to enforce existing law , the administration ratcheted up enforcement across the board .
But fierce opposition by a Senate minority , led by Republicans but joined by some Democrats , and a powerful political backlash against those Republicans who led the effort , sank the legislation in late June .
Now the crackdown will occur without offering businesses a way to get more foreign workers .
Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said the aging of the U.S. workforce means the economy lacks the workers it needs , but the administration will try to streamline current temporary worker programs to make them easier to use .
Those include the visa program for temporary farmworkers known as H2A , as well as another program for nonfarm seasonal workers who work everywhere from ski resorts to crabmeat processors .
This may prove little consolation to California businesses , however , who complain the programs are bound by red tape and in any event cannot admit enough workers to meet their needs .
Gutierrez said he would also be looking at changes to the temporary programs for highly skilled workers , the H - 1B visa , heavily used in Silicon Valley , a category under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality
Act by which noncitizens can enter the United States for three years if they work in a specialized field and their employers cannot fill the position locally .
That program admits 85,000 workers a year , and this year the quota was met for the next fiscal year on the first day applications were accepted .
Much of the crackdown until now has focused on criminal enforcement against employers who knowingly hire illegal workers , and is up to 742 cases this year .
" We do get a lot of tips ; we get a lot of informants , " Chertoff said .
" It 's amazing , the number of people who come forward and tell us about illegality in the workplace . "
The new rules essentially expand the definition of " knowingly " to include failing to fire anyone whose Social Security number does not match government records .
About 12 million people are estimated to be in the country illegally , and about half a million more have been arriving each year .
They have moved beyond traditional immigrant states like California and Texas and into the South and Midwest , where their presence has created a voter backlash and spawned state and local laws intended to make it difficult for illegal immigrants to work and even find housing .
Illegal immigrants make up about 5 percent of the civilian workforce , according to the Pew Hispanic Center .
Most have arrived since 1990 .
Many have children born in the United States who are citizens - which adds up to about 64 percent of the children in unauthorized families , or 3.1 million children , Pew estimates .
Most illegal migrants crossed the border from Mexico and farther south , but about 40 percent arrived legally from all other parts of the world and overstayed their tourist or student visas .
Illegal workers tend to be concentrated in agriculture and other low - wage industries , including household help , food packing and manufacturing , construction , food service and hotels .
These industries are likely to face the most scrutiny .
The new crackdown could put pressure on Congress to at least pass piecemeal immigration legislation - especially a farmworker legalization program known as AgJobs and strongly backed by Feinstein and other California politicians , and the DREAM Act , which would offer children brought into the country illegally a path to permanent residency if they enroll in college or the military .
As part of the stepped - up enforcement , the Department of Homeland Security said it would expand an electronic verification system called " Web Basic Pilot " to all federal contractors , as well as continue to train state and local law enforcement to help enforce immigration laws .
The number of Border Patrol agents is expected to rise to 18,300 by the end of the year ; there will also be 370 miles of fencing along with other technology such as vehicle barriers and camera and radar towers that are now being constructed .
Also , the administration announced that it would implement a long - delayed exit verification system at border crossings to find out who is overstaying their visas .
That program , called US - Visit , has been hampered by the cost and technological problems .
The administration said it would plow ahead with plans to require all travelers to use passports , despite the enormous backlogs that delayed travel by U.S. citizens earlier this year .
The new rules of enforcement
What happened : New rules proposed Friday by the Bush administration will require employers to fire employees unable to clear up problems with their Social Security numbers 90 days after they 've been notified of such discrepancies in what are called no -match letters .
What it means :
Hiring undocumented workers has been illegal for two decades , but until now , employers were not held liable for fraudulent documents .
Employers who fail to comply will face fines and sanctions .
What 's next :
The new rules take effect in 30 days .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan successfully tested on Thursday a cruise missile capable of carrying a variety of warheads , including nuclear , the military said .
The Babur Hatf VII missile has a range of 700 km ( 435 miles ) .
It was last tested in March .
“ It was a successful test , ” a military official said on condition of anonymity .
The test was meant to validate the design parameters set for the missile , a separate military statement said .
President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz greeted scientists on the test firing and “ assured complete support in the development plans of all strategic projects , ” the statement said .
The Babur Hatf VII is a terrain - hugging , radar avoiding cruise missile .
The missile was first tested in 2005 .
Since , then its range has been enhanced to 700 km , from 500 km previously .
Nuclear - armed Pakistan and India routinely carry out missile tests despite a peace process they launched in early 2004 , and both have agreed to inform each other of such tests in advance .
The two South Asian neighbors carried out tit - for - tat nuclear weapons tests in 1998 .

Lots of people have written clever things about writing monads - their mathematical structure , properties etc .
I wrote a Test Monad for my FilePath library , which I 've since refined for Hoogle .
The inspiration for this comes from Lennart Augustsson , who gave a talk at fun in the afternoon on ways to abuse Haskell syntax for other purposes .
For the testing of the parser in Hoogle , I want to write a list of strings , versus the data structures they should produce :
In Haskell , the most syntactically pleasant way of writing a list of things is usingnotation in a monad .
This means that eachoperation should be in a monad , and thebind operation should execute one test , then the next .
We also need some way of " executing " all these tests .
Fortunately this is all quite easy :
The basic type is , which has only one value , being .
To represent failure , simply call , which is failure in all Haskell programs and allows you to give a useful error message .
The helper functionis provided to pin down the type , so you do n't get ambiguity errors .
The Monad instance simply ensures that all the tests are evaluated , so that if any crash then the whole program will crash .
The Show instance demands that all the tests passed , then gives a message stating that .
We can then layer our own test combinators on top , for example for parsec :
Thisfunction takes a parsec parser , an input and an output .
If the parse fails , or does n't produce the correct answer , an error is raised .
If the test passes , then the function calls .
It 's then simple enough to define each test set as : Hereis defined differently for each do block .
By evaluating one of these test blocks in an interpreter , themethod will automatically be called , executing all the tests .
I 've found this " monad " lets you express tests very succinctly , and execute them easily .
I moved to this test format from stand - alone files listing sample inputs and expected results , and its proved much easier to maintain and more useful .
" Dave is dead . "
The words came at the end of the second day of what was supposed to be a character - forming experience , a chance for 12 people to " experience the wilderness to the fullest " .
Instead , the trek through the mountains and desert of Utah in the mid-western US left David Buschow , a fit 29 - year - old US air force veteran and security guard from New York dehydrated and hallucinating , his eyes bulging and tongue swollen .
Less than 10 hours after setting off from the group 's overnight camp on the second day , Buschow collapsed and died .
According to the coroner 's report , he died from " dehydration and electrolyte imbalance due to hiking in hot environmental temperatures with inadequate water and electrolyte replacement " .
But , an inquiry has found , the three wilderness camp instructors accompanying the group did have water .
They chose not to offer it to Buschow , preferring that he attempt to complete the day 's task .
Buschow died knowing he was just 100 yards from the spot where water had already been found .
On Friday the family of the dead man sued the school running the course and its guides , including Shawn O'Neal , who was with Buschow when he died .
" He paid to experience wilderness .
Instead of learning how to survive on his own , he was made to die , " S Brook Millard , a lawyer for the family , told Associated Press .
Advanced dehydration
Buschow 's death highlights the lack of regulation covering wilderness camps in Utah and other areas of the US .
His trek was run by the Boulder Outdoor Survival School , whose courses are licensed by the US Forestry Service .
The service owns the land and grants the school a permit to operate there .
But there appears to be little if any state or federal oversight of courses for adults .
The participants on the 28 - day course , which cost $ 3,175 ( £ 1,600 ) per person , set off at 10 am on July 17 last year with three instructors .
Their task for the day was to hike through the oppressive heat only drinking where they found water .
But the group was unable to find water until 7 pm .
By that time , Buschow and another member of the group were suffering from the effects of advanced dehydration .
" It 's hard to imagine how they could justify not giving this fellow water if they had it , " said Paul Auerbach , a leading authority on wilderness medicine .
" Who cares whether he finishes the course or not ?
The participants may want to push themselves , but there 's a point at which it becomes foolish . "
The school has denied responsibility , saying that Buschow signed a waiver and was aware that water would not be carried on the first three days of the trek .
Its owner , Josh Bernstein , who also presents an archaeological history programme on the Discovery channel , told Associated Press : " The group appeared to be within the normal parameters we 've seen on the trail over the years .
Many were , understandably , tired , but morale was high and the participants were determined to continue ... [ Buschow ] seemed capable of completing the hike to camp that evening . "
The record of the day , reconstructed from witness statements and interviews carried out by law enforcement and the Forest Service , tells the story of the participants being led into hostile terrain in the most gruelling conditions .
The group , which included some Britons , set off for the six - mile trek mid-morning , having spent the previous night sleeping in the open .
As temperatures rose above 35C ( 95 F ) some found it increasingly difficult to cope with the heat , the lack of water , the exercise and the high altitude of Utah 's Dixie National Forest .
Buschow had brought a water bottle with him but was told to carry it empty .
As the day progressed and he became increasingly tired , his pack was divided between the rest of the group to carry .
Most of the participants were aware that Buschow was having problems .
One remembered Buschow saying that he was not a wuss but that " something was not right " .
His breathing was laboured , he was vomiting , falling and hallucinating and he consistently complained of cramping pains in his legs .
The instructors advised him to eat pine needles .
After taking the entire day to hike the six miles to Cottonwood Canyon , the group eventually reached water .
But 100 yards short , Buschow once again " plopped down " on the ground , with an instructor at his side .
A Forest Service summary of that instructor 's statement is chilling .
" They were within 100 yards of the next water source , " it reads .
" Buschow dropped down again on the trail .
Buschow was repeatedly encouraged to get up and continue to finish the walk - Buschow said he could not go on .
He was encouraged again , telling him people can go further than what they think they can .
Buschow requested that [ the instructor ] get water for him .
[ Instructor ] said he would not leave him and that they would rest awhile .
Buschow was laying down at this time on his stomach .
" Then , [ the instructor ] ' had a bad feeling and saw no sign of Buschow breathing , no chest movement ' .
Buschow did not respond to his name or shaking , he was turned over and his eyes were glassy . "
The instructor yelled out three " hoots " , the agreed distress signal , and the other instructors - one of whom was a trainee - ran to help .
Two of them , together with two students trained in first aid , tried for half an hour to resuscitate him , while the third climbed a ridge to phone for help .
When a rescue helicopter arrived an hour and a half later , Buschow was dead .
It has since emerged that two of the group members were offered and accepted water from instructors on the trek .
Buschow was not given the option .
The school said that by signing a waiver , " Mr Buschow expressly assumed the risk of serious injury or death prior to participating . "
The local county attorney 's office and the Utah attorney general 's office declined to bring a case against the school or Mr Bernstein , saying that there was insufficient evidence .
Leading Neocon : Trying to assign responsibility for Abu Ghraib is ' an abomination ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 29 , 2007
Print This Email This Chris Matthews reported on MSNBC's Hardball Wednesday that " the only Army officer to face a court - martial for the Abu Ghraib case was cleared of the charges against him by a military jury the other day . "
" So the question remains , " continued Matthews , " who 's to blame ? ...
And was the scandal at Abu Ghraib a result of the Bush administration 's policy ? "
He then invited Frank Gaffney , head of a leading Neoconservative think - tank , the Center for Security Policy , and Jon Soltz of the anti-war VoteVets.org to debate the question .
" There 's a couple of issues , " answered Soltz to the question of whose fault it was .
He acknowledged that the low - level military policemen who carried out the abuses had not been properly trained but also insisted that " this is about a much larger issue of this administration .
George Bush in 2002 ... decided that he was n't going to support the Geneva Conventions .
...
Then you have Alberto Gonzales , who gives us a very limited idea in his memorandum of what torture really is .
Then Donald Rumsfeld exploits that memorandum and comes up with these ... enhanced interrogation techniques . "
Gaffney , in contrast , tried to cast the very idea of holding anyone in the administration responsible for Abu Ghraib as more of an " abomination " than the original offenses , stating " I believe that the persistence of the attention given to what clearly was a low - level gang of very perverted people behaving in a despicable fashion ... and the fact that , frankly , we 're having this discussion now , is revolting to me . "
" We 've got people who are determined to destroy this country , " Gaffney went on , " and this notion that only by giving them all of the protections of the Geneva Conventions will we be conducting ourselves in a moral fashion , I think is ridiculous .
The truth of the matter is , Don Rumsfeld did n't have anything to do with Abu Ghraib .
I do n't think the president , Dick Cheney ... had any knowledge of it .
...
And the fact that we persist in trying to find somebody like that to blame for this is an abomination . "
Soltz replied , " When your president of the United States stands up and says we have moral authority but then revokes the use of the Geneva Convention in combat , he 's undermined the morality of every soldier who 's volunteered to served our country .
Our officers in the military are against this administration on the issue .
...
Our soldiers need that moral authority in combat to defeat the enemy .
Anything less is undermining their mission . "
Gaffney argued in response that law - breakers do not actually deserve the protection of the law .
" We are a country of laws , but when you start applying the laws to people who do not earn their application you debase the law , " he said , concluding that it would therefore be improper to offer Constitutional or Geneva Convention protections of any kind to non-military insurgents .
Matthews then attempted to refocus the debate on his original question , asking Soltz , " Do you believe that this came from civilians at the top , involved in Gitmo and brought this over , to use over there , and this was a policy ?
Or was it a corrupting result of just people with too much time on their hands and not enough direction ? "
" It 's both , " replied Soltz .
" Because you have an administration that loosened the concept of us supporting the Geneva Convention . "
" Do you have evidence that this came from civilians in the Pentagon ? " asked Matthews .
" Absolutely , " responded Soltz , referring again to public statements by Bush and Rumsfeld .
" No , he does n't have evidence , " said Gaffney .
" He 's imputing to what he claims to be the source of all evil something that did not actually have an impact in Abu Ghraib .
And more to the point , it would be actually corrosive to our position vis-a - vis these terrorists to give them the treatment that he apparently thinks they ought to have . "
Soltz and Gaffney then spoke over one another , with Soltz emphasizing , " I care about our American men and women in combat .
... I 've been in combat , you have n't .
...
In the first Gulf War ... the enemy surrendered to us in combat because they know we treat them humanely .
It 's a force multiplier for our troops . "
" If we let this go , the world will see us saluting it , " concluded Matthews .
" If somebody 's not punished with authority here , the world will say we hid this problem .
... I have never heard of enlisted men being so original in policy - making . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Hardball , broadcast on August 29 .
The Alex Jones Radio Show had Jason Bermas back on to go over the latest news about World Trade Center Tower 7 .
Although Bermas slipped and said his first name on national radio , ( with an international Internet audience ) he is still refusing to confirm the identity of his source , or release the full 20 minute interview ( until the unscheduled release of the Final Cut ) .
Some people do not believe a movie release date is the proper timetable for truth .
It is clear that the man on the tape is Barry Jennings , Deputy Director , Emergency Services Department , New York City Housing Authority .
Mr. Jennings has already gone on the record .
On 911 he was on the news covered with debris , like many survivors seen on television that day .
Barry Jennings has put his full story on the record with Loose Change , and wanted to remain anonymous until the movie is released .
If Jason Bermas had not said his name , that may have been possible , but that is no longer the case .
On the morning of 911 Barry Jennings with Mr. Hess , one of Rudy Giuliani 's highest ranking appointed officials , New York city 's corporation counsel , ( Hess is a Yale and Harvard graduate , a lawyer who has represented the United States in numerous major cases ) .
It was just after the first attack on the North tower , but before the second plane hit the South Tower , when Barry Jennings escorted Michael Hess to the World Trade Center Tower 7 .
Mr. Jennings recalls a large number of police officers in the lobby of WTC 7 when they arrived .
The two men went up to the 23rd floor , but could not get in , so they went back to the lobby and the police took them up in the freight elevator for a second try .
When they arrived on level 23 , at the Office of Emergency Management they found it had been recently deserted , " coffee that was on the desk , smoke was still coming off the coffee , I saw half eaten sandwiches " .
At that point he made some phone calls , and an un-named individual told them to " leave , and leave right away " .
Jennings and Hess then proceeded to the stairs , and made it to level 6 , when there was an explosion , and the stairwell collapsed from under their feet , Mr. Jennings was actually hanging , and had to climb back up .
They made it back up to level 8 , where Barry Jennings had a view of the twin towers , both buildings were still standing .
This is an important detail , as many debunkers have used Mr. Jennings statements out of context to claim the damage came to WTC 7 from the towers collapsing , not the case according , to Mr. Jennings .
The interview has been cut off where they say how they made it to the lobby , but when they did make it down , Mr. Jennings found it destroyed and littered with dead bodies .
He said it looked like , " King Kong had came through it and stepped on it , so destroyed , I did n't know where I was .
So destroyed that they had to take me out through a hole in the wall , that I believe the fire department made to get me out . "
Shortly after he made it out , he was seen on several news channels telling his story .
Mr. Jennings is still confused as to why Building 7 had to come down at all , and does not accept the official reason that the noises he heard were from a fuel oil tank , " I know what I heard , I heard explosions " .
Michael
Hess has not made any public statements about that morning with Barry Jennings , perhaps we can call on wearechange.org to document Michael Hess 's account of the events on 911 .
Since September 12 2001 , there has been growing controversy surrounding World Trade Center 7 .
In the past few months more people are questioning the governments explanation , and the Main Stream Media 's failure to ask important questions .
In February the BBC 's live report from 911 saying that WTC 7 collapsed a half an hour before the collapse had occurred was completely ignored by the MSM .
Around the same time Rosie O'Donnell pushed her 30 million viewers to Google WTC 7 .
Now Loose Change has captured a 20 minute long interview with a completely credible source , this is huge news , and hopefully they will feel compelled to release some more of the interview .
Alex Jones is the executive producer of the latest edition of Loose Change , thus disabling his ability to speak freely about the issue .
Hopefully this and other reports will help get Barry Jennings to come out to the public as soon as possible .
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission has faced seemingly continuous criticism for years , however in May 1999 it released a decision that generated near - universal praise .
The New Media Decision , which adopted a hands - off regulatory approach to new media ( the CRTC 's press release overstated the ruling by headlining that the " CRTC Wo n't Regulate the Internet " ) , was widely regarded as the right decision at the right time .
Since that ruling , a remarkable array of new media services – including podcasting , Internet streaming and online video sites – have emerged outside of the traditional broadcast regulation model .
Despite the success , recent submissions to the CRTC suggest that a growing number of stakeholders are increasingly wary of their unregulated counterparts and may be gearing up for a fresh look at Internet regulation .
The issue began to percolate last June , when Canadian Heritage Minister Bev Oda asked the CRTC to conduct a six - month consultation on the effects of changing technology on the radio and television industries .
The CRTC report , which was quietly released in mid-December , went almost unnoticed , yet submissions from broadcasters , copyright collectives and labour unions all point to an increased regulatory role for the CRTC .
The underlying theme of many stakeholder submissions is that unregulated new media represents a threat to the current regulated Canadian content model .
For example , SOCAN , a copyright collective , implausibly argues , " Canadians have fewer Canadian programming choices available to them when they use new technologies than they do when they access conventional television and radio stations . "
Based on that analysis , SOCAN argues for a reversal of the new media decision , stating that " there is no reason why those who use new technologies to broadcast content should not be subject to the Broadcasting Act's Canadian Content requirements – including Internet service providers , other new media , satellite radio and mobile television broadcast undertakings . "
SOCAN is by no means alone in promoting more Internet regulation in the name of Canadian content .
ACTRA , which represents more than 21,000 performers , argues that the CRTC should be " the catalyst for the commission to review its New Media Decision as early as possible . "
The Friends of Canadian Broadcasting go even further , maintaining that " Canadian broadcasting policy should recognize new delivery systems such as MP3 players , satellite radio receivers , and interactive Web clients as part of the new Canadian broadcasting system .
If the commission is unable or unwilling to regulate their content , it should be charged with ensuring that a percentage of the revenue they generate from the distribution of these services is circulated into the system . "
While the CRTC is unlikely to join Viacom in seeking a slice of YouTube 's revenues , both the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting and the Canadian Conference of the Arts buck Industry Minister Maxime Bernier 's emphasis on telecommunications deregulation by pointing to that industry as a potential source of revenue for Canadian cultural funding .
The broadcaster perspective surprisingly also envisions greater regulatory involvement .
Although the Canadian Association of Broadcasters does not call for the re-consideration of the new media decision ( it actually seeks lighter regulation for all broadcasting media ) , it expresses concern about the implications of Internet video – particularly streaming video from U.S. broadcasters – for the Canadian market .
The CAB seeks to recast Canadian broadcast history by maintaining that " from its very beginnings , a separate rights market has been a central objective of the Canadian broadcasting system and an underpinning of Canadian broadcasters ' ability to support Canadian content . "
According to the CAB , a core goal of Canadian broadcast policy has been the reliance on cheap and profitable U.S. content in order to subsidize the creation of unprofitable Canadian content .
With the growing popularity of Internet streaming , the CAB fears that U.S. broadcasters will simply stream their programming into Canada and thereby diminish the value of those programs on Canadian television networks .
Indeed , all the major U.S. networks already freely stream some of their prime - time programming within the U.S. , and last month NBC and News Corp. , the owner of the Fox Network , unveiled plans for a YouTube competitor .
In response , the CAB seemingly wants the CRTC to erect barriers to Internet streaming , concluding that " all reasonable public policy measures and instruments will be needed to maintain the integrity of a separate and distinct Canadian program rights market . "
While the CAB is right that the Internet is erasing the distinction between geographic markets and that U.S. broadcasters are likely to stream on a global basis in the near future , the likely impact on Canadian content is precisely opposite of what it suggests .
Rather than reducing the production of Canadian content , Internet streaming and new media create incentives for more Canadian productions since profitability in the emerging environment will depend upon original content that can be distributed across all platforms , old and new .
If Canadian broadcasters are unable to rely on cheap U.S. programming , they will be forced to compete by investing in their own original content .
This will dramatically alter Canadian content production from one mandated by government regulation to one mandated by market survival .

It is increasingly clear that the blossoming of new media is a threat to old business models , not to Canadian content .
Eight years after the CRTC's new media decision , it still stands as the right decision at the right time .

There was a time , not so long ago , when science seemed to understand how the universe worked .
Everything – us , the Earth , the stars and even exotic - sounding supernovae – was made of atoms which were all created at time - zero : the Big Bang .
In between the atoms was nothing , a void : quite literally , ' space ' .
But recently things have started to unravel .
There is , it seems , a lot more to the universe than meets the eye .
According to the best estimates , we only really know what about 4 % of it is made of .
But if only 4 % is made of atoms , what about the rest ?
The rest is made of mysterious entities about which very little is understood , with equally mysterious names : dark matter and dark energy .
The accidental discovery
In 1974 the astronomer Vera Rubin , was working on a project investigating stars at the outer edges of galaxies .
What she discovered was quite a surprise .
Shortly after the apple fell on his head , Newton famously declared that gravity was ' universal ' .
An apple falling on Earth obeys the same mathematical rules as an apple falling on the other side of the Universe .
In the same way that the Sun controls the orbiting planets by exerting gravity on them , a spiral galaxy must be controlled by the gravity - giving black hole at its centre .
It has long been known that Pluto , at the edge of our solar system , travels much slower than Mercury , close to the Sun .
In fact observations like these allowed Newton to pin down his laws in the 17th century .
When Vera Rubin did her work on galaxies she expected to find that as you reach the edge of a galaxy the stars would be moving much slower than those close to the centre .
But it did n't work out like that at all .
She found that almost all of the stars in spiral galaxies are racing around the centre at approximately the same speed .
This was very strange .
Could it be that Newton 's laws were n't really universal and did n't apply in galaxies ?
Questioning Newton seemed unthinkable , so the majority of scientists went down a different route altogether .
Rather than variable gravity , they argued , there had to be something else in galaxies , something that was providing extra gravity .
With extra gravity , the stars would be pulled harder , and would travel faster – as Rubin 's observations suggested .
And the name they gave to this extra stuff ?
Dark matter .
But what is dark matter ?
Two men at Princeton University – Professors Peebles and Ostriker – looked further into dark matter .
They even suggested that there was at least 10 times more of it than there was ordinary matter .
But despite its growing acceptance , dark matter 's real identity remained completely unknown .
Nothing that particle physics came up with appeared to fit the bill .
Even the newly - discovered neutrino had the wrong characteristics .
What was needed was something with mass but also something which does not interact with ordinary matter .
Professor Tim Sumner from the Imperial College London believed he had the answer – a new , hypothetical particle called the neutralino .
It is thought to have the right mass and exist in suitably vast quantities – but has never been detected .
If dark matter is everywhere in our galaxy , then it must be present here on Earth .
In fact thousands of tonnes of the stuff must be passing through the Earth every day .
It does n't interact with ordinary matter , so it can pass straight through it , whatever ' it ' is : us , the Earth , everything we 're familiar with .
The bottom of a mine , away from the cosmic rays and atmospheric particles on the surface , is the perfect place to try to detect a signal .
So that 's exactly what Professor Sumner tried to do , with a detector located at the bottom of Europe 's deepest mine on the coast in Cleveland , northern England .
If his team detected a neutralino , then a Nobel Prize would surely follow .
But the search has so far proved fruitless .
Doubting Newton
Not everyone was so keen though .
In 1974 , while most scientists decided to pursue dark matter , Israeli astrophysicist Professor Milgrom tried something even more audacious – he tried to rewrite Newton 's laws of gravity .
Knowing this would n't exactly be welcomed by the rest of the community , he worked at his theory in private until he was ready to unleash it on the world in 1981 .
He called it Modified Newtonian Dynamics ( MOND ) and used it to showed how gravity could be a little stronger than previously thought , across the huge distances that galaxies cover .
But surely Newton could n't have been wrong ?
Milgrom continued to work on the theory and has since begun to attract admirers and recruit like - minded people .
The longer the identity of dark matter remains a mystery , the more credence will be given to his ideas .
A deeper mystery
In 1997 Professor Saul Perlmutter opened another can of worms .
While looking at the expansion of the universe , he accidentally discovered that not only were all stars and galaxies moving away from each other , they were doing so at greater and greater speeds .
This meant that our future selves might one day look up to a sky without stars ( they 'd all be too far away ) .
It also meant that ' something ' was pushing the stars apart .
This anti-gravity force was completely new to science , but again what it actually was remained a mystery .
It did however have a name : dark energy .
It turned out that the universe is 4 % ordinary matter , 21 % dark matter and 75 % dark energy .
That 's a lot of stuff that no one really understands .
Inevitably then , this Standard Model has its sceptics – not everyone believes that such a huge and important set of theories can be based on so little physical evidence .
Professor Mike Disney from Cardiff University even went as far as to suggest that this was n't " physics at all – just fairies at the bottom of the garden " .
In response the dark matter believers , led by Professor Carlos Frenk at Durham University , have produced impressive computer simulations of the Universe .
These apparently show that dark matter and dark energy have been vital to the development of the Universe .
Without their influence the galaxies , stars and planets , and indeed life itself , would never have come to be .
The results of the WMAP satellite survey appear to confirm the quantity of each of the ' dark ' components .
So despite the growing popularity of Milgrom 's MOND idea in some quarters , dark matter still has the backing of the vast majority of scientists .
The standard model , with its officially approved mix of atoms , dark matter and dark energy , is the latest in a long line of brilliant ideas .
Every civilisation since the year dot has had its own cosmological model .
Every few decades or centuries , it has been replaced by something better .
Whether we are the privileged generation living in the time of the right idea remains to be seen .
Is dark matter here to stay ?

Semper Fi
A hard cold rain is falling .
The bistro is almost empty .
I ’m up front reading the paper waiting for customers .
The door swings open .
I feel a blast of cold wet air hit my face .
A young man , about twenty one , walks in .
“ Are you open ? ” he asks .
“ Yes we are . ” I reply hopefully .
“ Do you have a vegetarian menu ?
“ Well not specifically but we have pasta and I ’m sure we can make you something .
What kind of vegetarian are you ? ” I reply .
“ I ’m not vegetarian .
My date is . ” he answers .
“ Do you know if she can eat fish or dairy ?
It would help if I knew . ”
“ I do n’t know her that well . ”
“ Ah a blind date ? ” I say smiling .
“ Yeah I just got back from boot camp and a friend of mine set up the date .
I saw a picture .
She ’s really pretty . ” he says .
“ I ’m sure she is . ”
“ But her girlfriend called and told me she was vegetarian .
I have no idea how where to take her . ” he says nervously .
Oh man if this kid was in boot camp he has n’t been with a girl in months .
He needs help .
“ Well bring her here .
I ’ll take care of you myself and make sure it works out . ” I offer .
“ Thank you sir . ” he says relieved .
Kids are calling me “ sir ” now .
As I take down his info I ask him where he completed boot camp .
“ Parris Island ” he announces proudly .
“ Ah the Marines . ”
“ Yes sir .
If your gonna sign up – sign up with the best . ” he says
“ Semper Fi to that . ” I reply .
That elicits a big smile .
This is a really nice kid .
He has an easy going manner and an innocent face .
I ’m feeling rather paternal .
I want to make his evening go smoothly .
“ Ok sir you ’re all set .
See you at eight o’clock . ”
I say
He thanks me , shakes my hand , and leaves .
As he walks into the rain my stomach twists into a knot .
I realize he is probably going to Iraq .
Horrible images of this kid screaming in pain or lying dead in a dusty road fill my head .
I shake my head to clear it .
I try and reassure myself .
Statistically I know this kid will probably walk away from his military career with a few tattoos and even more bad drinking stories .
That ’s cold comfort .
I knew this kid for only a moment .
Imagine how his mother feels .
For the first time I realized on a gut level how young most of our soldiers are .
From my perspective they ’re children .
I find myself worrying about this kid .
Will he be ok ?
Will he be scared ?
Will he have the things he needs to survive ?
I read in the paper today that during a “ town meeting ” morale talk in Iraq some servicemen laced into the Secretary of Defense .
The asked him why there was n’t enough body armor to go around .
Why their vehicles lacked adequate protection .
Taken aback Rumsfeld stated “ You go to war with the army you have .
Not the army you wish you have . ”
If I was at that town meeting that answer would have pissed me off .
Then again my relationship with authority has always been tenuous at best .
I ’m sure it pissed off the parents of a lot of servicemen and women .
Rumsfeld never saw combat .
Neither will his children .
If my Marine was his grandson he might be singing a different tune .
Now I am not gonna get into whether the war in Iraq is right or wrong .
Sometimes war is necessary .
Sometimes it is n’t .
I ’m only a waiter .
What do I know ?
But one thing is certain .
War is not measured in territory gained or causes won .
It is measured in blood spilt ; limbs shattered , and lives prematurely ended .
Meeting this kid tonight brought that reality home .
Eight o’clock comes and goes and no young Marine .
Maybe his date went south .
Maybe he thought my place was too expensive .
That ’s too bad .
I wanted to pull out my waiter charm , flatter his girlfriend , and help him get laid .
Hey – it ’s my way to support the troops .
As I walk to my car I think about that young man .
I hope he ’ll be all right .
I hope he comes home .
Semper Fi kid .

The recent spate of police brutality is no accident .
It ’s not a freak coincidence , it ’s the way it ’s always been .
Would I sound like a paranoid conspiracy theorist if I said that the increasing militarization of the police is a carefully shepherded phenomena designed to slowly ensnare us in a web of oppression and fear ?
Well , I do n’t care , because them ’s the facts , man !
Four Recent Outrages
You ’ve probably heard about the recent tasering of a U of Florida student who tried to ask John Kerry a few questions ( but did n’t seem interested in hearing an answer ) .
The kid , Andrew Meyer , was being kind of a dick and he overreacted and basically caused that situation by freaking out ( notice how the cops lept into action when he mentioned Skull and Bones ) .
He is now famous for pleading “ Do n’t Taze me , Bro ! ” shortly before he had 50,000 volts applied to his nuts .
This kid ’s annoying dorkiness does n’t absolve the police / security folks of responsibility .
The fact that they tasered a guy who was subdued and on the ground is reprehensible .
If you have six cops surrounding a suspect ( who should ’ve been escourted out , not arrested ) there is absolutely no need to taser him .
Then there ’s an older video that just made it on Digg showing a police officer shooting an Air Force security officer at point blank range for no apparent reason .
There was an investigation and a trial and — ( surprise ! )
Officer Ivory Webb was cleared on all counts .
Next we have the case of the delinquent granny who was finally brought to justice .
Her crime ?
Not watering her lawn :
Betty Perry is charged with resisting arrest and failing to maintain her landscaping , both misdemeanors .
She was arrested July 6 after failing to give her name to a police officer who visited her home .
During a struggle , Perry fell and injured her nose .
She spent more than an hour in a holding cell before police released her .
I bet we all feel safer with Ms. Perry behind bars .
If you think the police can’t top that , think again .
Next is the case of the wheelchair - bound schizophrenic :
Officers said they arrived to find Delafield in a wheelchair , armed with two knives and a hammer .
Police said the woman was swinging the weapons at family members and police .
Within an hour of her call to 911 , Delafield , a wheelchair - bound woman documented to have mental illness , was dead .
Family attorney Rick Alexander said Delafield ’s death could have been prevented and that there are four things that jump out at him about the case .
“ One , she ’s in a wheelchair .
Two , she ’s schizophrenic .
Three , they ’re using a Taser on a person that ’s in a wheelchair , and then four is that they tasered her 10 times for a period of like two minutes , ” Alexander said .
According to a police report , one of the officers used her Taser gun nine times for a total of 160 seconds and the other officer discharged his Taser gun once for a total of no more than five seconds .
Now , I ’m sure that was a difficult situation , but I fail to see why it was necessary to taser an old woman in a wheelchair .
Surely a person who ca n’t walk can be restrained fairly easily .
In fact , we know she was not a threat because the lady cop managed to shock her for a total of 160 seconds — almost 3 minutes .
And now she ’s dead .
A Fluke Spurt of Stupidity ?
So where did I find all of these stories ?
Did I go to a site dedicated to monitoring police brutality like CopWatch ?
No .
I found them all on Digg .
All on the same page !
Now , this is no doubt more than normal , but it points to a larger problem in our society :
The police are out of control .
And that ’s exactly the way certain people want it .
The Real Role of Cops
You see , there ’s a common misconception about police .
Some people ( mostly white , middle class folks ) think that the police are here to “ protect and serve ” everybody .
But notice that their motto does n’t say anything about protecting everybody , or even treating everybody equally .
It ’s conspicuous by its absence , in fact .
The truth is that the police are paid to protect and serve the ruling class and the ruling class mostly needs protection from the underclass .
America is a classist society , just like the U.K. or India .
The rich and poor divide is sometimes as stark as the difference between slums and condos .
Poor people naturally get angry and even violent when they realize that their situation is completely hopeless .
No amount of hard work will get you rich when your only job skills are burger - flipping and bathroom - scrubbing .
So sometimes the poor take matters into their own hands and try to steal something from the rich .
That ’s where the police come in .
If you rob a house or steal a car you will be arrested ; simple as that .
But what happens when the rich steal from the poor ?
For the most part : Nothing .
The elite can literally write our laws with a few well - placed campaign contributions .
They can make their left illegal while they continually try to box the underclass in with obscene violations of the first amendment like free speech zones .
The elite ghettoize our inner cities , offshore our jobs , make helpful drugs illegal , send our children to die in pointless wars , kill all those who stand in their way and terrorize the rest of us with servile propaganda and there ’s not a goddamn thing anyone of us can do about it .
Asside from high - profile cases like Enron , the elite are completely free to run wild and reshape society to their liking .
And the way they seem to like it is :
The rich can do whatever they want , the poor and middle class must be monitored constantly and arrested instantly if they step out line .
The police subconsciously know this .
They know that becoming a cop grants them power over others , but they seem to know not to abuse this power when it comes to rich people .
You do n’t see a bunch of people in Lexuses getting pulled over on Cops .
That ’s not because they ’re not speeding and not doing anything illegal .
I bet there ’s a lot of cocaine in a lot of glove compartments in a lot of Lexuses ( would that be “ Lexi ” ? ) .
But the cops know better than to fuck with the rich .
The rich have lawyers , they have friends in the force , they have resources and most important , they know politicians who can put the squeeze on the captain and get you reassigned to guarding the Taco Bell .
Poor people have none of these connections or resources .
It ’s fine with the rich if you want to oppress poor folk ; in fact it ’s pretty much encouraged .
The rich know that by giving the cops special privileges they can secure the fealty of the police .
So the police are permitted to act like they own the place as long as they do n’t step on the toes of the elite — the only people who outrank the cops in our society .
So the real role of cops in society is to protect the elite from the underclass , which includes the middle class , but the middle class is mostly pacified by TV , material goods and beer .
The police are free to get their jollies off by knocking a few heads together as long as they do n’t beat up the son of somebody powerful .
The elite like how the cops are hated and feared by the poor and respected and feared by the middle class .
This gives the elite free reign since the cops fear and respect the upper class , the only group of people more powerful that themselves .
The Militarization of the Police
Gang members know the police as just another gang ; a more powerful one , but a gang nonetheless .
But the people who control the police ( the elite , if you have n’t been paying attention ) are increasingly arming the police as if they were a standing army .
The militarization of the police has occurred mostly over the last 50 years and is spurred by two bullshit ideological wars :
The War on Drugs and the War on Terror .
The police in most major now have enough armament to invade and occupy a small country .
Hell , we could ’ve sent our cops to Iraq and they probably would have done a better job at containing the populace since they ’re more thoroughly trained for that sort of thing than the army .
That ’s no accident .
The cops are an army ; an army of the elite .
Their enemy , let there be no doubt , is you .
The plan is to make America into a fascist state : Amerika .
They started slowly and carefully , and as they ’ve gained strength the police have gradually been let off their leash , but the end result is inevitable : a police state .
It ’s not like this has n’t happened before .
In the late 1800s and early 1900s this country was consumed by labor strife .
The Socialist Party was founded to look after worker ’s right and communism was gaining strength because the Robber Barons ’ form of capitalism was so completely corrupt that there was no difference between the Government and Big Business ( sound familiar ? ) .
Hand of the Oligarchy
The Rockefellers basically controlled this country like it was theirs .
When they had labor troubles they simply called in the police .
The police busted heads and smashed the ranks of the striking workers and forced them to return to work for pitiful wages .
The idea that the police can act as an arm of the Oligarchy is unfortunately not a new one .
Things got better for awhile , but now we seem to headed right back to where we were a hundred years ago .
If anything the propaganda is a hundred times better now ; many people think the police are there to protect everyone , but that simply is n’t the case .
In many poor neighborhoods , if you call the cops they might show up four hours later .
The nicer your neighborhood , the quicker the response .
Many poor folks do n’t even bother calling the cops .
This , again , is not a new phenomenon : in fact , that ’s how the Mafia got its start .
The Italian and Irish Mobs began because a person of Italian or Irish descent could not expect to be treated fairly under the law .
They knew that they had to take care of each other or nobody would ; certainly the cops were more likely to beat you over the head with a baton than listen to your tale of woe .
Like our current gang troubles the Irish Mafia was made possible by Prohibition .
When a popular product is made illegal it can be extremely lucrative for those on the wrong side of the law ; so much so that they can buy influence on the other side of the law and corrupt the entire system in the process .
Now the blacks are the new Irish and they have no pull with the cops , even though many black people are on the force ( just like with the Irish ) .
The difference is that the cops look after each other first , regardless of ethnicity .
Once you are a cop you belong to a special club which is virtually above the law .
As long as you do n’t violate the Blue Code of Silence you can expect to reap the rewards of being superior to the underclass .
Tale of the Tasers
The weapons a cop receives are a totem to his power over others .
Normal people are not allowed to openly carry dangerous weapons around , especially as the second amendment has been eroded .
An officer ’s gun identifies him as a member of a powerful group and symbolizes his social superiority and separateness from the masses .
Tasers are the new nightsticks .
Cops will use a taser at the drop of a hat because it makes compliance push - button easy .
It should be noted that taser are not nonlethal ; they are “ less lethal ” which is how I would describe a knife versus a gun .
In no way are tasers harmless ; they ’ve been responsible for hundreds of deaths in the last few years .
Between tasers , pepper spray , nightsticks and ray guns the police have all sorts of “ less lethal ” devices to ensure submission .
Add in handguns , shotguns and the heavy artillery used by SWAT teams and you have enough firepower to conquer a major rebellion … which seems to be the plan .
The Oligarchy seems to be expecting trouble from us , the unruly populace .
I can only wonder why , but perhaps they know how foul and oppressive their policies are .
If so , they ca n’t plead ignorance to our plight ; they are in fact responsible for it .
The Oligarchy has no love for democracy ; they clearly prefer fascism ; it ’s so much more convenient .
Sadly , many Americans agree .
But you know , “ oligarchy ” , “ fascism ” , “ democracy ” and “ freedom ” are just big , abstract concepts .
At the end of the day it all comes down to what we experience in the world .
This video is but a small example of the arrogance and violent entitlement that many cops feel :
Cops see their badge as a license to take the law into their own hands .
Do n’t like the customer service you ’ve received ?
Pepper - spray ’em and arrest ’em .
If any of us did the same thing we would be in jail for a long time , but this cop got off scot free .
There ’s justice for you ; Amerikan - style .
Interview with Hamas Co-Founder Mahmoud Zahar ' We Will Try to Form an Islamic Society '
Mahmoud Zahar -- a founder of Hamas , and one of its most militant hardliners -- has called for an Islamic state in the Gaza Strip .
After the Hamas takeover of the territory last week , he 's also threatened Fatah with more violence in the West Bank .
Andy McCarthy ’s exclamation of despair :
We know that Ron Paul did great in the Republican presidential debate sponsored by Fox News and held in Durham , New Hampshire , because how else can we explain neocon Andy McCarthy ’s exclamation of despair over at the National Review group blog ?
“ Why , ” he cried out in anguish , “ is there so much cheering for Ron Paul ? ”
As the last of the neoconservative dead - enders , holed up over at “ The Corner , ” mutter darkly , Paul , the ten - term libertarian Republican congressman from Texas , is stealing the spotlight from the so - called frontrunners .
For the first time in many a moon , we witnessed a genuine knock - down drag - out brawl between presidential contenders : a real mix - up in which Rep .
Paul , the only antiwar candidate in the GOP pack , succeeded in framing the debate around his challenge to neocon orthodoxy on the all - important issue of foreign policy .
By the way , thanks to Fox News for their brazen hostility to Paul , which blew right back in their faces .
The refusal to even acknowledge him until a good twenty minutes into the debate , and Chris Wallace ’s consistently sneering tone when a question finally came Paul ’s way , did n’t stop the Texas troublemaker from stealing the show anyway .
Go here for the video , so you can hear the dripping sarcasm in Señor Wallace ’s voice as he characterizes the Paulian position on Iraq as “ pretty simple . ”
Okay , so you want to get out , but what  asked Wallace  about “ trying to minimize the bloodbath that would certainly occur if we pull out in a hurry ? ”
A great deal of Paul ’s growing appeal as a candidate lies in his apparent inability to emulate the bromidic grammar - challenged phrases that pass for stirring political rhetoric these days .
Instead , he cuts to the chase with a few razor - sharp sentences , and his answer to Wallace did not disappoint his fans :
“ The people who say there will be a bloodbath are the ones who said it would be a cakewalk , it would be slam dunk , and that it would be paid for by oil .
Why believe them ?
They ’ve been wrong on everything they ’ve said .
Why not ask the people  ( interrupted by cheers )  why not ask the people who advised not to go into the region and into the war ?
The war has not gone well one bit . ”
This is an extremely effective trope , politically , for Ron , and that is his alacrity in identifying and going after the Bad Guys , in this case , the crew that lied us into war and is now trying to blame everyone but themselves for the debacle .
As the US position in Iraq becomes more untenable by the day , awaiting only a Beirut - style attack on the Green Zone to underline the finality of our failure , the urge to hold someone responsible for what General William E. Odom rightly calls the biggest strategic disaster in our history grips large portions of the electorate .
Who lost Iraq ?
The question is even now being asked , and one ’s answer seems to largely depend on ideological and partisan allegiances .
The neocons blame Bush : he did n’t follow their instructions to the letter , you see , by putting their sock puppet , Ahmed Chalabi , in charge from the beginning .
The Israelis , too , blame Bush : now they ’re saying that they always wanted him to go after Iran , not Iraq  perhaps he got the two countries mixed up , somehow .
McCain also blames Bush , claiming that the war has been “ mismanaged , ” although we hear very little about how he would manage to occupy a nation of some 30 million souls that resent and have come to hate the American presence .
And we have n’t even gotten to the Democrats , who , naturally , blame the Great Decider for practically everything  an inadequate explanation for the disastrous course of the past six years that they nonetheless think is sufficient for their purposes .
This is a blunt sword with which to slash away at the Republicans , and yet Paul has found a sharper instrument , one that cuts to the quick and provides the electorate with what they ’re looking for  a truly deserving scapegoat .
But we ’ll get to that in a minute .
Wallace also asked if Paul would “ leave troops in the region to take out any al Qaeda camps that are developed after we leave , ” and Paul ’s answer , interwoven with his riff on “ they were wrong then , why should we believe them now ? ” , takes an unequivocal position 
“ Yes , I would leave , I would leave completely ”  that outflanks any of the ostensibly antiwar Democratic candidates , and yet still resonates with the old conservative adage , “ win or get out , ” which dates back to the Vietnam era .
Paul , however , goes beyond a mere critique of the present policy , and offers a coherent and comprehensive alternative , succinctly and with real passion in his voice :
“ I am less safe , the American people are less safe for this .
It ’s the policy that is wrong .
Tactical movements and shifting troops around and taking in 30 more and reducing by five , totally irrelevant .
We need a new foreign policy that said we ought to mind our own business , bring our troops home , defend this country , defend  ( bell sounds )  our borders ”
What ’s this  a presidential candidate who thinks in terms of principles ?
And a Republican , to boot !
Good lord , we ca n’t have that !
What is he , some kind of kook ?!
Wallace ’s fangs extended to their full length before Paul was done , and he leapt at the chance to pull off a Fox News - style on - air smear :
“ So , Congressman Paul , and I ’d like you to take 30 seconds to answer this , you ’re basically saying that we should take our marching orders from al - Qaeda ?
If they want us off the Arabian Peninsula , we should leave ?
( Laughter . )
You have thirty seconds to tell us why you ’re not a terrorist - loving , pro-jihadist tool of radical militant violent crazed bloodthirsty Islam and Osama bin Laden ’s best friend  go !
PAUL : “ No ! ( Cheers , applause . )
I ’m saying  ( laughter ) 
I ’m saying we should take our marching orders from our Constitution .
We should not go to war  ( cheers , applause )  we should not go to war without a declaration .
We should not go to war when it ’s an aggressive war .
This is an aggressive invasion .
We ’ve committed the invasion of this war , and it ’s illegal under international law .
That ’s where I take my marching orders , not from any enemy .
( Cheers , boos . ) ”
As the reporter for National Public Radio put it :
“ A mixture of boos and applause that followed indicates just how divided even a Republican audience in New Hampshire is over the issue of Iraq . ”
The raucous debate over Iraq was the leitmotif and high point of the New Hampshire debate , and the only antiwar candidate in the pack was right in the middle of it , expressing the doubts and anger of the thirty - six percent - plus of Republican primary voters who now think the war was a mistake and want us out .
Brownback , offered the chance to rebut Paul ’s apostasy , demurred , and instead babbled about Tom Friedman ’s idea of a “ political surge , ” which is shorthand for acknowledging failure .
Mike Huckabee , however , chose to take on Paul when Wallace asked him about the pessimistic prognosis of the latest National Intelligence Estimate , which says the “ surge ” wo n’t stem the rising tide of violence nor bring about a viable government for Iraq .
So why continue ?
With the unerring instinct of a born crowd - pleaser , Huckabee went straight into that old riff about the Pottery Barn Rule , cribbed from Colin Powell :
“ We have to continue the surge .
And let me explain why , Chris .
When I was a little kid , if I went into a store with my mother , she had a simple rule for me .
If I picked something off the shelf of the store and I broke it , I bought it .
“ I learned do n’t pick something off the shelf I ca n’t afford to buy .
“ Well , what we did in Iraq , we essentially broke it .
It ’s our responsibility to do the best we can to try to fix it before we just turn away because something is at stake .
Senator McCain made a great point , and let me make this clear .
If there ’s anybody on this stage that understands the word honor , I ’ve got to say Senator McCain understands that word  ( applause , cheers )  because he has given his country a sacrifice the rest of us do n’t even comprehend .
( Continued applause . ) ”
Notice that there are few , if any , facts in the above - quoted peroration .
Just a cute little anecdote about him and his mom , and , furthermore , one that we have heard before , which simulates the warm fuzziness of folksy wisdom and yet has no real content .
A personal anecdote and a rather odd analogy  comparing a country of 30 million living persons , with a history that predates the dawn of civilization , to an item sitting on a shelf in a store , an object to be examined , priced , bought , and sold , says more about the wrongness of this war of conquest , and more eloquently , than any of its critics have so far managed .
Honor  is there any honor in this war ?
Most Americans think the cost of this conflict is n’t worth it  that it was a mistake to go in , and it ’s a mistake to stay in .
That ’s what Ron Paul believes , too , but not the Huckster , who appeals to the heart , not the head , and who ’s selling the “ surge ” and the war aims of this administration with an emotional demagoguery that belies his mild persona .
Turning to Paul , he addressed him directly :
“ And on this issue , when he says we ca n’t leave until we ’ve left with honor , I 100 percent agree with him because , Congressman , whether or not we should have gone to Iraq is a discussion that historians can have , but we ’re there .
We bought it because we broke it .
We ’ve got a responsibility to the honor of this country and to the honor of every man and woman who has served in Iraq and ever served in our military to not leave them with anything less than the honor that they deserve .
( Cheers , applause . ) ”
I ’m sure the Iraqi people would be very interested to learn that they have been bought : does that mean they ’ll all get green cards and engraved invitations to emigrate once we leave ?
I hardly think so .
As for the honor of this country , it has suffered quite enough at the hands of warmongers and opportunists , who spared no effort in their campaign to drag us down into this quagmire  including “ outing ” a CIA agent , falsifying “ intelligence , ” and engaging in systematic deception to fit the “ facts ” around a pre-conceived conclusion .
Defending the nonexistent “ honor ” of these people  which is not the same as the honor of this country  is n’t worth a single life , either American or Iraqi .
Paul homed right in on the logical error at the core of the Huckster ’s honor - mongering :
“ The American people did n’t go in .
A few people advising this administration , a small number of people called the neoconservative hijacked our foreign policy .
They ’re responsible , not the American people .
They ’re not responsible .
We should n’t punish them .
( Cheers , applause . ) ”
Here ’s the blame - the - neocons theme popping up again , and quite opportunely .
Paul ’s focus is admirable : he goes right for the jugular , and hits it unerringly .
Who lost Iraq ?
Was it us , the American people , as the neocons imply , because we did n’t have the spine to stick it out ?
Neocon military guru Max Boot once bemoaned the lack of American casualties in Afghanistan , because such a supposedly easy victory would n’t prepare us for the coming slaughter : today , presumably , the bloodshed has lived up to Boot ’s expectations , and he must be satisfied with some 3,500 dead and 40,000 - plus with major wounds .
Boot ’s point , however , was that the American people lacked the toughness it takes to run an empire : they are too squeamish about taking casualties .
This theme of our supposed moral deficiency has run through the War Party ’s propaganda , especially now that the Iraq war is hugely unpopular , amounting to a taunt :
Are we tough enough to tough it out until victory ?
Do we have what it takes ?
This  what might be called the argument from machismo  worked in the beginning , but has long since lost its power to intimidate .
And Paul is hardly one to be intimidated by such a facile playground jibe .
Instead of reacting defensively , he went on the offensive and challenged the premise behind the Huckster ’s emotional appeal to our collective “ honor ” by pointing an accusing finger at specific individuals , namely , the neocons .
This “ we are all to blame ” collective guilt - tripping is n’t going to go over very well with the electorate , for the very good reason that they know it is n’t true .
The War Party conducted their own “ shock and awe ” campaign on American shores before Bush ever unleashed a more deadly version in the skies over Baghdad .
We all heard the neocons  Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz , former CIA director James Woolsey , Bill Kristol , and whole platoons of laptop bombardiers tapping away in the hangars of the American Enterprise Institute  say it was going to be a “ cakewalk , ” and that the Iraqi people would greet us as “ liberators . ”
We heard them round the clock in the run-up to war , declaring , with utter certainty , that those “ weapons of mass destruction ” were a threat to the entire region , and a challenge to US national security that had to be answered with force .
We heard these same voices echoing and elaborating on the administration ’s talking points , including the supposed threat posed by Iraq - inspired terrorism right here on our shores .
Now this same crew is braying that we can’t leave , that we have a moral obligation to clean up the mess they made , and that to fail to do so is to risk losing our honor .
What honor we had was lost the moment we went to war under false pretenses .
The only way to recapture it is to retrace our steps , to conduct a thorough investigation in order to discover how and why we were deceived into invading and occupying Iraq  and , most important of all , by whom .
After all , we ca n’t do much about our looming defeat on the battlefield , because the announced war aims of the administration never were achievable , but we can find and punish those responsible for pushing such a reckless strategy .
That is the implicit program behind Paul ’s jibes at the neocons , and it is very effective , as indicated by the loud applause and cheering that greeted the candidate ’s remarks .
The Huckster , in answer , reached into his bag of emotional salves and demagogic snake - oil , and pulled out a Lincolnian trope to fit the occasion :
“ Congressman , we are one nation .
We ca n’t be divided .
We have to be one nation under God .
That means if we make a mistake , we make it as a single country , the United States of America , not the divided states of America .
( Cheers . ) ”
Oh really ?
If the head lemming goes over a cliff , the rest have a patriotic duty  or is that a compulsion ?
 to follow him .
This is the red-state fascist Leader Principle drawn out to its logical conclusion : we must commit collective suicide  in the name of “ unity . ”
One nation , under the neocon hucksters who sold us a rotten bill of goods , indivisible , with climbing debt for all and war profits for the few .
How convenient for the War Party  and how the Republicans are dreaming if they think they can get away with this , even with their alleged “ base . ”
Paul was speaking for a lot of rank - and - file Republican voters when he replied :
“ No .
When we make a mistake , it is the obligation of the people through their representatives to correct the mistake , not to continue the mistake !
( Cheers , applause . ) ”
Paul wins this argument because he is here showing that the Huckster has already conceded  by acknowledging that we did indeed “ break ” Iraq , instead of liberating it .
If we continue to occupy it , we continue the process that will lead to its final break - up : our presence makes the situation worse , not better , and this is what the Huckster is tacitly admitting .
The belief that we ’ll somehow get a different result by engaging in the same actions is tantamount to madness .
The Huckster protested that Congress is stepping into the breach , but Paul would have none of it :
“ No !
We ’ve dug a hole for ourselves and we dug a hole for our party !
We ’re losing elections and we ’re going down next year if we do n’t change it , and it has all to do with foreign policy , and we have to wake up to this fact .
“ HUCKABEE : Even if we lose elections , we should not lose our honor , and that is more important to the Republican Party . ”
Let ’s stop a moment , here , and note this extraordinary admission : the Huckster is saying , well , we ’re going to lose anyway , so why not nominate me ?
If you were a Republican , would you find that very inspiring ?
Aside from that , however , there ’s the question of how many lives the War Party ’s “ honor ” is worth .
3,500 ?
10,000 ?
50,000 ?
These are questions the Huckster ’s emotion - laden appeals to American machismo are designed to quell , but they require answers .
Here is Paul ’s answer , as , a seventy - something man standing straight as an arrow , he raised his voice over the applause and the catcalls :
“ We ’ve lost over 5,000 Americans over there in Afghanistan and Iraq and plus the civilians killed .
How many more do you want to lose ?
How long are we going to be there ?
How long  what do we have to pay to save face ?
That ’s all we ’re doing is saving face .
It ’s time we came home ! ”
Whose face are we saving ?
Whose honor is at stake ?
Not America ’s , because , as Paul pointed out , it was n’t the American people who wanted this war , and it was n’t they who conducted a campaign to convince themselves and the world that Iraq was a deadly threat that had to eliminated .
It was the neocons who wanted this war , who planned it , who agitated for it , and who finally got their heart ’s desire when the bombs began to fall on Baghdad .
It is their honor that is at stake  and , as we all know , the honor of those who never had any to begin with cannot be compromised .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I ‘ve been blogging over at Taki ’s Top Drawer : check it out .
It occurs to me that my previous post could give the impression that I think of depression as something that can be effectively handled by a little think - fu .
I do n’t .
Depression is vicious , bad stuff .
If you or someone you care about has depression , grab yourself a copy of _Against Depression_ by Peter Kramer .
It ’s a discussion of how depression is understood in our culture and includes a roundup of current research on depression — and apparently more has been learned about it in the last 10 years than in the previous 50 .
That stuff about “ serotonin makes you happy , depressives have low serotonin , so if you take SSRIs it will make you happy ” ?
It ’s nowhere near that simplistic , and nowhere near that benign .
We are far from fully understanding depression but from what we do understand about it , it is way more complex than that , and more importantly , it is progressively degenerative .
The more you have it the more you are prone to have it .
Mild episodes tend to lead to severe episodes .
It involves a “ stuck switch ” which keeps the brain from turning off the stress hormones that come out during fear situations , and the stress hormones themselves damage mechanisms which are involved in shutting themselves off so it ’s a vicious cycle .
And the damage done is permanent .
It ’s as if there ’s a path towards severe depression and with each day of depression you take a step down it , and when you manage to get out of depression then you can stop walking down the path , but when another episode hits you start off as far down the path as you walked the last time .
So grab yourself a copy of _Against Depression , _ and read it , if it ’s a topic that matters to you .
The important new research has n’t really begun to filter into discussions of depression out in the mainstream of American discourse , so unless you ’re a researcher or very well informed doctor you ’re not going to hit this information without going looking for it .
Behold , the Xbox 360 Laptop mk2 !

グラディウス」1本だけの裏技だったが、ほかのコナミ作品にも同じコマンドが収録されるに伴い「コナミコマンド」の名称が確立されることとなる。本記事の冒頭でも触れているが、1990年12月21日発売のスーパーファミコン版「グラディウスIII -伝説から神話へ-」では「上上下下左右左右BAで自爆」という罠を仕掛けるまでに至った。「コナミ作品ではとりあえずコナミコマンドを試す」というプレイヤの心理を突いた非常に高等なジョークであるといえる。左と右を、スーパーファミコンで新たに追加されたボタン、LとRに置き換えた、上上下下LRLRBAでフルパワーアップが使用できる。スーパーファミコンの発売直後にリリースされた作品であり、せっかくだから新しいボタンを使いたかったという開発者の心理がうかがい知れる。DSなんだから、とりあえずタッチパネル使っとけ！みたいな。
その後、任天堂ハードが主流ではなくなり、プレイステーション(プレイステーション2)でグラディウスの新作がリリースされるようになる。コントローラからAボタン、Bボタンが消え、コナミコマンドも「上上下下左右左右×○」に変わってしまった。
少年たちが大人になり、時代が変わり、コマンドが変わってしまっても、当時、貧弱なグラフィックのグラディウスにのめりこんでいった少年たちの心の中の片隅にはいつまでも「上上下下左右左右BA」がひっそりと居続け、呼び出されるときを待っているのではないだろうか。ふと、人生に疲れを感じたとき、コナミコマンドを打ってファミコンに触っていた頃の純粋な心を取り戻して欲しい。そんな30歳前後の元少年たちへのメッセージをこめて、この機能を実装しました。ウソです。
History Lesson Part 1979 [ Mar. 21st , 2005 | 02:55 am ]
The American Caliban I was born in 1964 and grew up in Southern California .
Technically , I was born in the last year of the Baby Boom , although I think of the Boomers as people 15 or 20 years older than I , the ones who went through the sixties as young adults .
I do n't have much in common with those people .
We were the last of the real boom , though .
All the way through school the class behind us was much smaller .
As we left school , the world around us changed dramatically .
The infrastructure around me as I grew up was excellent .
As real estate prices went up , so did property tax , which by law funded the schools , local emergency services , and a plethora of other basics .
I received an excellent education in the public school system straight through high school .
The roads were paved , the police and fire got there in 3 minutes , the county health care system hummed along without trouble .
If you lived in suburbia and were at least holding on to the bottom rung of the middle class in the 1970s it was a good time .
In the late 1970s , the apartment owners ' association in California hired a man named Howard Jarvis as their lobbyist in Sacramento .
His task was to help them with their taxes .
He succeeded .
Jarvis and Paul Gann wrote an amendment to the state constitution .
To pass it , they used a feature of California law in which the people may petition the state to put a constitutional change on the ballot for referendum .
It can then be passed by popular vote .
The constitutional change Jarvis wanted was a rollback in property taxes .
This was enthusiastically accepted as a tax revolt .
Jarvis got people angry about their property taxes , and they demanded a reduction .
Since California 's real estate prices are high and always going up , the taxes paid went up fast too , and he made a convincing case that the politicians in Sacto were taking all our money .
The people enthusiastically supported Proposition 13 , and passed it .
Property taxes were reduced and fixed .
The trick was to hold on to your property ; if you bought or sold after 1978 you 'd lose your exemption .
This tremendously favored Jarvis 's employers , who rarely sell or buy their commercial real estate , and not so much homeowners , who traditionally trade up quite a bit in this state .
New homeowners were S.O.L .
This fact was pointed out but mainly ignored .
The day Proposition 13 passed , everything changed .
In one way , the change was obvious .
Schools , law enforcement , fire & rescue , and health care services had been murdered but were still walking with the knives in their backs .
As I was leaving high school in 1983 the educational system was starting to feel the stab .
Most of the musical groups and the drivers education program got axed the next year , for example .
While I was in college the trauma care system in Los Angeles County fell apart .
Increased fees of all kinds appeared for local government services .
After - school and summer - school programs for poor kids were shut down .
Bit by bit , the mechanisms of government died off like Hal at the end of 2001 .
The other change was bigger .
Suddenly , government services were the enemy .
It was time to cut taxes everywhere , because of the " fat " and the " politicians " as Jarvis and his friends artfully put it .
Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 with the promise to go to Washington and shut down Big Government .
Tax cuts everywhere were the rage .
" Grass roots " movements funded by groups like Jarvis 's employers sprung up in many states .
And any program with social , medical , or educational function was a target .
Mental health programs , preschools , the arts , all got axed .
Things got stuck this way , and have n't gotten unstuck .
To this day , politicians must promise tax cuts to be elected .
" Tax and spend liberalism " is a surefire way to tag your opponent as a loser .
The ratchet goes one way : toward less tax .
Restore a tax or raise one and you 'll lose an election .
And in California especially , anyone with the money to buy TV time had a good chance of changing the constitution by popular vote .
The result in California has been schools without pencils , prosecutors who can only afford to pursue felonies , closed hospitals , and bankrupt municipalities .
Upon being hired as Arnold Schwarzenegger 's finance consultant during the last gubernatorial election , Republican billionaire investor Warren Buffett pointed out that he paid less tax on his house in California that his house in Omaha , and suggested repealing Proposition 13 .
He was shut up instantly by panicked political consultants .
He had touched kryptonite .
The passage of Proposition 13 for me marks the end of an era of well - funded infrastructure and the beginning of the new populist demagoguery , which is now at its greatest extreme yet .
The talk - radio epidemic of the 1990s made extreme right - wing ideology respectable .
The craziness of Ross Perot and Tim McVeigh is now available 24 hours a day on FOX News , and the President is a folksy idiot who never met a tax he liked .
Since there 's no more need for the fig leaf of a balanced budget , the government just spends on deficit .
The mad as hell media crowd ran out the Governor of California Proposition 13 style , with a petition and a charismatic celebrity .
Reaching directly to the people with television , as both Jarvis and Ronald Reagan did , the moneyed establishment could get us to act against our interests by pushing a button or two .
In true cryptofascist style , our new masters spend only on war and subsidies to their friends .
They grandstand on issues of " moral " significance , and promise to beat up those " people in Washington " , who are of course not them .
Their constant weapon is mass media , especially talk radio and conservative " news " television .
And the worst possible insult , the executioner 's brand and mark of shame , is " liberal " .
I am a liberal because I remember a time before Jarvis , before President Reagan , before Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter , before Homeland Security , before any of the splendid little wars in Grenada and Nicaragua and Iraq , before all of this .
i remember a time when I was in school and we had pencils and books and art supplies and an orchestra to play in and 25 students per class or less , and summer school every summer , and a free breakfast if your parents were broke , and a school nurse , and a school psychologist .
I remember when it only cost $ 430 a quarter to go to UCLA .
I remember a time before libraries were shut down .
I remember health care when we had an operative trauma network .
I remember when welfare was a safety net and not a punishment .
I am , in fact , a tax and spend liberal because that 's what government does .
It taxes and spends because we ask it to .
The only questions are whom to tax and on what to spend , and anyone who says otherwise is a liar .
I remember the world before Californians voted for Proposition 13 in June 1978 .
That 's why I 'm a liberal , and that 's why I gave you today 's history lesson .
Thanks for listening .
Radio talk - show host Laura Schlessinger is appealing to news media outlets to respect her son ’s privacy amid an Army investigation into whether he is behind a lurid personal Web page that featured cartoon depictions of rape , murder , torture and child molestation .
The posting on MySpace.com drew the Army ’s attention after the Salt Lake City Tribune reported this month that the Web page was credited to and included photos of Deryk , the 21 - year - old son of the outspoken radio personality known to millions as “ Dr. Laura . ”
She can be heard locally on KFI - AM ( 640 ) .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Monday May 28 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 47 words Type of Material : Correction
Dr. Laura :
An article in Business on Friday about an Army investigation involving the son of radio talk show host Laura Schlessinger over a lurid MySpace Web page identified the newspaper that broke the story as the Salt Lake City Tribune .
It is the Salt Lake Tribune .
According to the Tribune , the Web page , which has since been taken down , included a photograph of a bound and blindfolded detainee , accounts of illicit drug use and a blog entry headlined by a series of obscenities and racial epithets .
Laura Schlessinger ’s publicist issued a statement Thursday stating that the Army “ is investigating who is the actual author of the MySpace website . ”
Army spokesmen in Afghanistan , where Deryk reportedly is stationed , could not immediately be reached for comment .

Celebrated by many for her traditionalist views -- and criticized by others for the same -- the talk - show host is perhaps best known for her trademark chirp , “ I ’m my kid ’s mom ! ” and her advice to mothers to stay at home with their young children .
Deryk ’s tour of duty is well known to listeners :
Many callers seeking out Dr. Laura ’s advice begin by thanking her for her son ’s service .
The radio host has taken a break from writing her column in the Santa Barbara News - Press but not from her other work .
“ She just needed a break , ” her spokesman , Mike Paul , wrote in an e-mail .
Matthew D. LaPlante , the Tribune reporter who broke the story about the Army investigation , had drawn a rebuke from Schlessinger for an earlier article in which he quoted her as saying Army wives should stop “ whining . ”
She posted a reply on her website stating that her position was taken out of context .
As a “ military mom , ” she added , she whines to her husband about how scared she is for her son , but “ I never whine to my son when he is able to call between missions ” for fear of distracting him from his life - and - death duties .

The newspaper ’s reader advocate said the Tribune was flooded with calls and e-mails complaining about the article .
LaPlante said he stood by the accuracy of his quotes .
The article about the MySpace page said one blog entry read : “ Yes !!!
I LOVE MY JOB , it takes everything reckless and deviant and heathenistic and just overall bad about me and hyper focuses these traits into my job of running around this horrid place doing nasty things to people that deserve it ... and some that do n’t . ”
The website ’s author indicates he is stationed in Kandahar , Afghanistan , where , he writes , “ godless crazy people like me ” have become “ a generation of apathetic killers . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Monday said he reluctantly accepted the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , whose " good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons . "
Alberto Gonzales and his wife , Rebecca , have lunch with President and Laura Bush at the Bush ranch Sunday .
After months of standing by his top prosecutor and " close friend , " Bush spoke briefly in Texas to praise Gonzales , saying the attorney general endured " unfair treatment that has created harmful distraction at the Justice Department . "
Bush said it 's " sad that we live in a time when a talented and honorable person " is impeded " from doing important work . "
Solicitor General Paul Clement will serve as acting attorney general , Bush said , until a nominee has been confirmed by the Senate .
Earlier in Washington , Gonzales announced his resignation , saying , " I have lived the American dream . "
The first Latino to helm the Justice Department said his " worst days as attorney general have been better than my father 's best days . "
Watch Gonzales on his " worst days " as top prosecutor »
Gonzales described public service as " honorable and noble " and thanked Bush for his friendship .
" Yesterday I met with President Bush and informed him of my decision to conclude my government services as attorney general of the United States effective September 17 . "
Neither Bush nor Gonzales took questions from reporters .
Some senior administration officials floated Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff as a possible replacement , but others waved CNN away from Chertoff , saying that his nomination could run into problems because of his role during Hurricane Katrina .
A congressional source familiar with deliberations about Gonzales ' replacement told CNN that the successor will not be Chertoff and that senior administration officials are " playing you guys , " referring to the media .
A source close to Chertoff said of a possible nomination , " this would be a surprise to Mike . "
New York Sen. Charles E. Schumer , a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , also suggested that a Chertoff confirmation hearing would be contentious .
" I would say there are a lot of questions about Michael Chertoff that will have to be answered . "
Schumer said .
" I would n't say yes ; I would n't say no .
It 's an open book .
It 's possible , but its hardly a slam dunk .
There are some names who could be a slam dunk . "
Schumer , one of Gonzales ' chief critics , appealed to the administration " to work with us to nominate someone whom Democrats can support and America can be proud of . "
Sen . Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee who has criticized Gonzales ' leadership of the Justice Department , called his resignation " a major helpful turn of events . "
Specter suggested current or former senators , or someone well - known to the committee would be a good nominee to replace Gonzales .
" There has to be somebody with very solid professional qualifications , somebody who 's an experienced lawyer and has demonstrated the kind of judgment that the attorney general is called upon to display , " Specter said .
A senior administration official " aware of discussions " said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten is looking for a Washington establishment - type , in the model of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and White House counsel Fred Fielding .
Another name that emerged is Larry Thompson , a former deputy attorney general who currently serves as vice president and general counsel for PepsiCo .
But a spokeswoman for the company said , " We are very fortunate and pleased , but he is very happy in his role here . "
According to senior administration officials , when Thompson has been approached in the past to return to the government he has turned down offers , saying he is happy in the private sector .
Aides at the highest level and other top officials received no warning about the Gonzales announcement , Justice Department sources told CNN .
They were not informed until a meeting Monday morning , sources said , when Gonzales acknowledged he would be reading a statement later in the day .
Although Bush had long stood by Gonzales , many members of Congress from both sides of the aisle had called on him to quit after the firing of several U.S. attorneys in 2006 -- terminations which were alleged to have been politically motivated .
Senior Justice Department officials say Gonzales ' resignation is not expected to affect the scope or pace of an ongoing internal investigation into the U.S. attorneys ' dismissals and other issues .
" Alberto Gonzales was never the right man for this job , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday .
" He lacked independence , he lacked judgment and he lacked the spine to say no to Karl Rove . "
Rove , another longtime Bush official and his top political adviser , also resigned this month .
" This resignation is not the end of the story , " Reid warned .
" Congress must get to the bottom of this mess and follow the facts where they lead , into the White House . "
Throughout Gonzales ' time as attorney general , controversies surrounded his positions on issues such as U.S. interrogation techniques and the wiretapping of conversations between Americans and suspected terrorists overseas .
In the probe into the U.S. attorney firings , the Senate Judiciary Committee looked into whether the administration may have fired some or all of the U.S. attorneys for political reasons .
In his testimony before the committee on multiple occasions , Gonzales repeatedly seemed to contradict himself , other members of his department or Justice Department documents .
Gonzales also was at the center of a dispute over the controversial no -warrant eavesdropping program authorized by Bush and his testimony that there was no dissent among administration officials over the program .
Gonzales later sent a letter to Senate leaders acknowledging he " may have created confusion " in his testimony .

CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux , John King , Dana Bash , Jeffrey Toobin and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
All About Alberto Gonzales
Rove blamed for Attorney firings in Gonzales hearing ; Specter raises prospect of impeachment Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday July 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Senator Patrick Leahy kicked off an oversight hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales by accusing top White House adviser Karl Rove of playing a key role in the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
" The accumulated and essentially uncontroverted evidence is that political considerations factored into the unprecedented firing of at least nine United States Attorneys last year , " the committee 's chairman said .
" The evidence we have been able to collect points to Karl Rove and the political operatives at the White House . . "
Leahy also described a Justice Department in a state of ' crisis . '
He worried that most of the senior leadership in the department had resigned .
" I would joke that the last one out the door should turn off the lights , but the Department of Justice is more important than that , " he stated .
" We need to shine more light on the Justice Department , not less " The Vermont Democrat went on to criticize Gonzales for failing to be forthcoming with information about the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's use of National Security Letters and said it pointed to an inability to trust Gonzales and the Bush administration .
" With a history of civil liberty abuses and cover ups , this administration has squandered our trust , " he warned .
Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the ranking Republican on the committee , also said that Gonzales ' acceptance of responsibility was not sufficient .
" That is not enough , " he said .
" The question is whether or not the Department of Justice is functioning as it must . "
Specter criticized Gonzales for failing to give a clear explanation for why the prosecutors were fired .
He also slammed the White House for lacking flexibility in preparing oversight .
" Now we have a very remarkable turn of events : we now have the announcement that the administration will preclude the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from bringing a contempt citation , " he said .
" The president in that manner can stymie Congressional oversight ... if that is to happen , the president can run the government as he chooses . "
Specter then suggested the possibility of appointing a special prosecutor because he said the President had a conflict of interest .
He went on to also offer the alternative that the Senate could try a contempt charge of its own , or consider the model of the impeachment of Alcee Hastings , a former federal judge who now serves as a Democratic Congressman from Florida .
Attorney General downplays FBI privacy violations Gonzales focused his opening statement on questions relating to the PATRIOT Act and the government 's Terrorist Surveillance Program .
He emphasized the need to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" This situation is unacceptable  we must quickly reform FISAs outdated legal framework and ensure that the Intelligence Community is able to gather the information it needs to protect the Nation , " Gonzales argued in his prepared opening remarks .
The Attorney General did not focus his remarks on the US Attorneys controversy , which he only discussed in his prepared testimony .
Senator Leahy then raised the 500 complaints to the Intelligence Oversight Board relating to National Security Letters used by the FBI to request wiretaps , and the subsequent lack of follow up .
Gonzales defended the oversight procedures used to monitor the system and ensure that civil liberties are not violated .
" A violation of IOB may not be a violation of the PATRIOT Act , " Gonzales insisted .
" We 're talking about intentional , deliberate misuse of the PATRIOT Act , not when some agent writes down the wrong phone number in a National Security Letter . "
Senator Leahy challenged him on what ' appropriate actions ' had been taken in response to PATRIOT Act violations .
The Attorney General 's answer was vague .
" We institute training ... or disciplinary action against the agent , " he responded .
Specter lambastes Gonzales on executive power Senator Specter then engaged in a testy series of exchanges with the Attorney General .
First , he brought up the visit of Gonzales as White House Counsel to the hospital bed of then - Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2004 .
The White House wanted Ashcroft to overrule a decision by James Comey , then serving as acting Attorney General , that an intelligence program was not legal .
Gonzales insisted that the program being discussed in the hospital room meeting was not the administration 's domestic wiretapping program .
" The visit to the hospital was about other intelligence activities .
It was not about the Terrorist Surveillance Program , " he said .
" Mr. Attorney General , do you expect us to believe that ? "
Specter quipped back .
Gonzales demurred , but then defended the effort to ask Ashcroft to overrule Comey , who was serving as head of the Justice Department while the Attorney General was recovering from surgery .
" There are no rules governing whether or not Attorney General Ashcroft can decide ' I 'm feeling well enough to make this decision , ' " he insisted .
Specter answered Gonzales angrily .
" Attorney General Gonzales , he had already given up his authority as Attorney General , " the Pennsylvania Republican scolded , adding that Ashcroft was under sedation as Gonzales insisted that Ashcroft could reclaim his authority whenever he wanted .
" You 're not making any progress here , " Specter quipped .
Specter then angrily asked if the White House 's current assertions of executive privilege threatened the current form of government in the United States .
" Do you think constitutional government in the United States can survive if the president has the unilateral authority to reject congressional inquiries on grounds of executive privilege , and the president then acts to bar the Congress from getting the judicial determination as to whether that executive privilege is properly invoked ? "
Specter queried .
Gonzales then attempted to insist that his recusal from decision - making related to the US Attorneys investigation prevented him from answering .
The response seemed to make Specter angrier .
" I 'm not asking you a question about something your recused of .
I 'm asking you a question about Constitutional Law , " he fired back .
Specter then went on , " I 'm not going to pursue that question because I see that it 's hopeless . "

Photos by Chris Crocker . ]
Escape from Real Bitch Island Nineteen and gay , too effeminate to hide , and persecuted by haters in his small town , Chris Crocker turned to the web to vent .
Now he 's a huge YouTube celebrity .
Is the internet Chris Crocker 's ticket out ?
Chris Crocker will reveal just about anything , except where he lives .
He has too many haters for that now .
Instead , he tells his fans that he 's a resident of Real Bitch Island .
A girly boy can't be too careful these days .
At least , not when he lives in a small town in the rural South and , as Chris likes to remind , has more MySpace friends than Lil ' Kim and almost as many as Britney Spears .
Those MySpace friends — Chris prefers the term " fans " — hang on his every MySpace bulletin .
They beg for the attentions of the young man with the lilting Southern drawl and the fake eyelashes , declaring their love , their amazement at his boldness , their gratitude .
They mimic his online videos : the sex - filled confessions , the wild monologues , and the messages to his generation that have all become viral video hits .
They send tons of e-mail , with subject lines such as " OMG !!!OMG !!! OMG !!! " and " You are fucking awesome ! ! ! "
Over on YouTube , where Chris also posts , the total number of views for his videos long ago passed the one million mark .
Among the people far away from Real Bitch Island who are tuning in : Cassie , the R&B star , who has a subscription to the Chris Crocker video stream on her YouTube page ; Glenn Meehan , a Los Angeles producer who recently inked a deal with Chris to develop ideas for a TV show ; and Matt Sunbulli , MTV's " web correspondent , " who has requested a Chris Crocker video for the MTV website .
" He 's got this incredible energy , " Meehan , the L.A. producer , told me .
Sunbulli , the MTV correspondent , told me Chris has " virality . "
For a 19 - year - old who lives with his grandparents and who originally started posting MySpace rants as a way of getting in the face of his small Bible Belt community , the interest from Hollywood and New York is potentially life altering .
It offers something Chris has only recently begun to believe is within reach : an escape from the South , an escape made possible by the entertaining distress signals that he 's been sending out over the internet for almost a year .
" I do n't want it to pass me by , " Chris told me a few weeks ago when I visited him on Real Bitch Island .
Intrigue had drawn me across the country to see him : I wanted to hang out with the guy behind the viral videos , but more than that , I wanted to find out what life is like for this new type of teenager — a young man connected in ways that let him transform his rural frustrations into national online fame , but who is still painfully disconnected .
To get to Chris , whose real last name and location I had to promise not to disclose , I boarded a nonstop flight to a former Confederate state , then climbed aboard a tiny propeller - powered plane , which took me to a small regional airport .
Next came a drive in a rental car to a hotel sandwiched between two rural highways .
The following morning , Chris was sitting in my passenger seat .
He was wearing low - rise jeans , a pinstriped velvet blazer , and a white hoodie , beneath which he wore a yellow tank top with " I 'm always chasing rainbows " emblazoned on the front .
We 'd just left the driveway of his grandparents ' house , where he'd met me standing near a " God Bless America , United We Stand " sign , installed by his grandfather , a devout Pentecostal who worships at a nearby church .
For a young man whose online confidence is a huge part of his allure , Chris , with his worries about being passed by , was sounding , for a brief and uncharacteristic moment , vulnerable — as if all this approaching opportunity were a plane high on the horizon , a groan of engines coming closer to his island , but without a clear commitment to actually pluck him off .
When I first saw them , I did n't interpret Chris 's videos as flares sent up by a young gay man marooned in a sea of rednecks .
I thought they were something else entirely .
This was back in April .
One morning , a couple of my gay friends in Seattle were laughing hysterically , imitating some guy named Chris Crocker and talking about a particular video of his they 'd seen on YouTube .
The video is Bitch , Please , and it's one of Chris 's most popular .
Since it was uploaded to YouTube two months ago , it 's been viewed nearly 300,000 times ; on MySpace , where it 's been since December , the number of views is well over 850,000 .
In the video , Chris , wearing a soft white cotton warm - up jacket over a gray T - shirt , his wide eyes and flared nostrils close to the camera , goes through " the many variations of ' bitch , please ' " — offering increasingly angry versions of the phrase , complete with hair flips , bared teeth , and hand gestures — because , as he says at the close of the video in a gentle , instructive voice , the variations " come in handy in many areas of life . "
On paper , the segment sounds like just another gay white boy trying to " talk black . "
But there is something so unselfconscious and nakedly furious about Chris 's presentation that it holds you .
He is a train wreck of marginal characteristics — effeminate , Southern , flamboyantly gay at a young age , uncensored — and they make it hard to stop watching .
The proof of this is not just in the number of times Bitch , Please has been viewed , but in its imitators .
On YouTube , people of different ages and races have posted response videos in which they gamely try to do Chris 's monologue themselves — the ultimate web compliment .
A number of these imitators are black , creating an odd , post- race , parallel YouTube universe in which black imitates gay - white imitating black .
At first , I 'd figured this level of border crossing and taboo tweaking had to be emanating from an urban area , from a source steeped in cultural collision and promoting some sort of high - concept agenda .
I 'd guessed Chris was an art student , young looking but not actually that young , who was lying about his age and living somewhere in Manhattan — a Real Bitch Island if there ever was one .
I could n't quite figure out what to make of the videos that featured Chris 's " grandmother " sitting on her worn brown couch in a suburban - looking living room , but , with apologies to his grandmother , I 'd guessed she was a drag queen and that a house on Long Island had been borrowed for some shoots .
I was n't the only one .
The Chris Crocker fans I know were divided on their initial guesses about him , and this divide mirrors the divide in experience between gays who had the bad luck to be born in intolerant parts of rural America and those who did not .
The gays I know who have never lived in a small , conservative town ( people like myself ) thought Chris must be an ironic urban art - fag with something to say about the absurdity of fagginess or race relations .
Those who have lived in rural America pegged him immediately as a type they know well , or once were themselves — the seething gay kid , trapped in a place that can't tolerate homosexuality and punishes flamboyance .
One such friend from a small - minded town told me that if he'd had access to YouTube when he was younger , he could easily have been Chris Crocker .
Which reminds , even though it 's becoming increasingly hard to imagine :
There was a time , not so long ago , when even Chris Crocker could not have been Chris Crocker — could not have sat in the Bible Belt and downloaded news of the wider , gay - tolerant world and , in response , uploaded his singularly bizarre and angry take on gay life and his intolerant town .
In that time before YouTube and MySpace and internet connections in rural America , this , too , could not have happened : I could not have become one of Chris Crocker 's MySpace friends , which I did shortly after watching Bitch , Please .
I could not , the next day , have sent Chris a MySpace message in an attempt to figure out who the heck he was .
And I could not have learned , heartbreakingly , that Chris is not some art student in Manhattan , as I 'd initially guessed — and , I suppose , on some level , hoped — but rather a 19 - year - old trapped in a stifling Southern town that he hates , and which seems to hate him .
In Chris 's most watched video , This and That , which has been viewed more than 420,000 times on YouTube and nearly 1.6 million times on MySpace , he sits on his grandmother 's couch , knees scrunched to chest , Converse up on the coffee table in front of him .
He 's wearing an orange T - shirt , black eyeliner , and two jelly bracelets on his right wrist .
The clip is short , only 46 seconds , and it's a message to his haters , the type of people who go to his MySpace and YouTube pages and post comments similar to this one , posted in late May on YouTube : " Ew .
You are the biggest faggot in America .
Please , do us all a favor , and throw urself in front of some ongoing traffic . "
When I first watched This and That , I saw it as a message from Chris Crocker to these virtual enemies , a fictional character responding to hecklers in his audience .
" Hey what up , everybody ? " the video begins .
" This is Chris . "
His tone is singsong at first , but then it turns serious : " I 'm still kinda blowing smoke out my ears because the haters just refuse to give it up , you know ? "
He shifts his expression from exasperation and disappointment to anger .
" And to the people who be saying , you know , this and that : Yo , girl , I do n't understand .
Look at this , girl ! "
He sits back on the couch , crosses his legs , and pulls up his right T - shirt sleeve to reveal a slender shoulder and a skinny upper arm .
" To the bitches that wanna fight me !
To the bitches that wanna fight me !
Girl , look at this , bitch . "
He flexes his tiny bicep .
" You wanna fight me ? "
His tone is menacing , but now he 's pulling up his shirt to reveal a scrawny chest .
The disjunction between his violent tone and the seriously limited physical firepower that he 's flashing is absurd — as absurd as the idea that anyone would see this waify kid as a threat worthy of violence .
" Girl , what is it , girl ?
What I got to hide , nigga , what I got to hide ? "
He leans into the camera and starts shouting , rocking his head back and forth in anger , blond highlights flopping this way and that .
" Because bitch , you wanna fight somebody , bitch ?
Let 's go , girl !
I 'm standing right here ; you ai n't sayin ' shit to me , girl .
I been standing at the mall ; ain't nobody walking up to me , girl . "
I viewed this video , originally , as a brilliant way of mocking his virtual haters , the type of people who were anonymously telling him to go jump in front of traffic .
But not long after I landed on Real Bitch Island , Chris took me to the nearby mall , a small cavern of beige floor tiles and pasty patrons , and gave me a tour that offered a new way of looking at this video , a way that made it much less funny .
As we walked around , past the Sunglass Hut , past the pushy smells of scented candles and baking cookies , people stared hatefully at us , and mostly at him .
They stared hard , with the kind of presumed right to glare that people in more sophisticated places would n't dare show .
Chris ignored it all , checked out the cover of the latest W magazine at a bookstore , pronounced it boring , and then nonchalantly showed me the mall video arcade whose back room he'd hid in when , one day while shopping , he'd heard a girlfriend of his shout : " Run , Chris ! "
He 'd turned around , that day at the mall , to see a gang of boys chasing him down , coming at him over the beige tiles .
He knew he could n't stand and fight and win .
He knew that was only a fantasy , perhaps suitable for a web video but not for real life .
He ran .
Chris and I are sitting at Shoney's , where the silverware comes wrapped in a plastic sleeve , airplane - style .
He 's wearing better makeup than most of the waitresses .
He orders biscuits and gravy and a glass of sweet tea .
Across the street is a Kmart and , near that Kmart , the beauty - supply store where Chris buys his mascara ( Max Factor Lash Protection ) and eyeliner ( Palladio ) .
Later he will demonstrate for me , on the inside of his wrist , how Palladio goes on like a juicy pen and does n't smudge .
For now , we 're talking about his life growing up in a place where his presence can stir up so much anger .
I 've had us seated in a back booth , where I presume he 'll feel more comfortable .
He does n't seem to need this extra consideration .
" I was totally myself from day one , " he tells me , legs crossed , shoulders back , chin thrust forward .
We talk about his boyfriends ( " At least I got to use him as a prop for a while , " he says of a recent one , who pretended to be Chris 's brother in a video spoof on gay - brother incest ) .
We talk about his therapists ( the bad one , who , he said , told him to listen to his grandmother , and the good one , who , he said , did n't ) .
We talk about his ambitions .
Around us in the restaurant , heavyset men inch their way along the breakfast buffet and women in loose sweatshirts share the latest gossip .
Chris seems perfectly at ease and self - possessed , only lowering his voice , and then only lowering it slightly , when we talk about his femininity .
" It 's not like I 'm a woman inside a man 's body or anything , " he says .
" But I 'm definitely more feminine than masculine . "
In kindergarten , Chris brought Barbie dolls to school for show and tell .
At home , when he was allowed , he wore dresses made for him by an indulgent relative .
In fourth grade , a fascination with Aaron Carter , the little brother of one of the Backstreet Boys , led him to get his first blond highlights .
A later fascination with Avril Lavigne led him to start dressing like her — " You know , jelly bracelets stacked up my arms , kinda faux punk . "
He always loved to dance and perform .
He entered talent shows at the local YMCA and took clogging classes .
In seventh grade , he tried , without success , to start a gay - straight alliance at his middle school .
Around the same time he started an e-zine that encouraged young gay kids to come out .
It quickly drew 3,000 subscriptions .
" I 've always been very active in the gay community online , " he tells me .
However , offline , at school , where there was no gay community save for himself , Chris got called all the standard names .
" I was so used to being harassed , I did n't even keep track of who did n't like me , " he says .
One day in the locker room a guy picked him up by his neck and held him against a locker until he turned blue in the face .
The gym teacher watched and did n't intervene .
That was toward the end of his last year of middle school .
Not long after , he went to a fair designed to help students pick the local high school that was best for them .
As he sat by himself , listening , he began to hear taunts , and then noticed that people in the room were pointing at him and snickering .
He took a Sharpie and wrote " keep staring " on the back of his hand .
He made a fist , rested his chin on it so those taunting him could see what he had written , and kept listening to the presentations .
But Chris realized that high school , as he put it , " was n't going to work out . "
His grandparents seem to have reached the same conclusion .
He 's lived with them since he was 4 , when they took over caring for him because his father and mother were n't in a position to do so .
I was n't allowed inside the home of Chris 's grandparents , and I was n't allowed to talk to his grandfather , who does n't know much about Chris 's internet fame .
But I was allowed to talk to his grandmother on the phone after agreeing not to ask her directly about Chris 's homosexuality .
I started with a question that I thought might force us to talk about homosexuality anyway , without breaking my ground rules .
I asked his grandmother , a 60 - year - old manager for a janitorial maintenance company , why she 'd decided to pull Chris out of public high school and teach him herself .
She did n't bite .
" There was a lot of people he did n't like , " she told me .
" And a lot of people did n't like him , either . "
She added : " Chris is not really a rough and tough person . "
Chris was homeschooled for high school , taught by his grandmother after she got off work .
He spent much of the rest of his days online or watching TV .
One of his favorite shows is The View — " all my girls " is how he describes the show 's female hosts .
Chris does n't look up to gay male icons at all .
When I ask , he can't think of one he admires .
" I 'm not really inspired by many men , even if they 're gay , " he tells me .
" I 'm more inspired by women who are accepting of gay men than gay men . "
I can't help but think of his grandmother when he says this .
It 's clear from the videos in which she appears that Chris and his grandmother enjoy a complicated relationship , loving but testy , in which Chris 's homosexuality is always the subtext , but is rarely addressed directly and never completely accepted .
" She 's so in denial she thinks it 's not obvious that I 'm gay , " he told me at one point during the two days I spent with him .
At another point he told me that when his grandmother found out he was gay , " she told me I needed an exorcism , and was dead serious . "
Most young men like Chris , at loggerheads with their families and unwelcome in their communities , quickly give up .
They either adapt to a closeted lifestyle or they run off to a big city , locate that city 's gay neighborhood , take a job in a coffeeshop or bar or theater , and start anew .
Chris may still do that .
He 's given himself until mid-June , the anniversary of his first internet video , to leverage enough money and opportunity out of his internet fame to escape his small town .
If that does n't work , he says , he 'll consider doing something more old - fashioned , like buying a bus ticket .
Ironically , the internet is the reason he did n't run away long ago .
It 's been a salve for his isolation , and improving communication technologies ( the cell phone , the digital camera , the text message ) have helped Chris thwart , at every turn , his grandparents ' attempts to keep him distant from a gay life .
The best example : Around age 13 , despite the disapproval of his grandmother , Chris had his first boyfriend .
The boyfriend lived in New York .
His name was Angel .
The two met online because they were both young , gay , out , and publishing e-zines .
They were together five years .
Chris describes it as the most serious relationship of his life , even though the two never met in person .
Instead , they chatted incessantly online , and had a florid phone sex life .
When , one day , Chris 's grandmother overheard them having phone sex and blocked Angel 's number in an attempt to break them up , Chris quickly found a fix :
He offered to have regular chats with a pedophile he met online in exchange for prepaid phone cards , which he then used to call Angel .
Another example of how the web made him more than his town and family ever could have : the way that Chris , a white Southern kid in an almost all - white Southern town , learned to talk like a ghetto black woman .
In his This and That video , Chris closes with a line that seems to have confounded most of his YouTube imitators , and certainly confused me .
He is saying , " What 's your tea like that ? "
When I asked him what this phrase is all about , he told me that he 'd picked it up on the party line .
" What party line ? " I asked .
It turned out it was a party line that he'd found through the website talkee.com , which compiles lists of free phone party lines around the country .
This particular line is run out of Los Angeles and is filled with flaming black men , black drag queens , and trannies from Compton .
They take on names like Candy Cane and Chocolate and Charmane ( " She 's like my muse , " Chris says ) , and they dial in to the party line to berate each other about their breath , their weight , and so on .
Chris likes to call in under the guise of an alter ego , Penelope .
Lately , however , people have caught on and have taken to calling him Cracker .
To ask " What 's your tea ? " on the party line , Chris explained , is to ask , " What 's your problem ? "
One of the characters Chris plays in his online videos is Earl Annie Edna , a Bible - believing older woman who seems a thinly veiled parody of his grandmother .
Earl Annie has a television show , and Chris 's grandmother is the only guest , ever .
One episode begins with Chris , wearing a shiny purple dress and Tammy Faye–caliber makeup , speaking into the camera :
Chris :
Hi everybody !
This is Earl Annie once again .
I 'm out here putting out a message once again that we gotta get rid of Chris .
And right now I 'm sitting here with one of my biggest supporters .
Hi !
( He pans the camera to his grandmother , seated on the brown living - room couch . )
Grandmother : Hello .
Chris : How you doin ' ?
Grandmother : Not good .
( She looks unhappy to be there , but willing to play along .
After some more banter ... )
Chris :
You do n't like Chris , do you ?
Grandmother : Chris who ?
Chris : Bitch , why you on my show ?
Grandmother : I do n't know .
Chris :
I thought I was here to interview someone against Chris .
( Shouts offstage ... )
Get in the people who do n't like him !
What 's this bitch doing here ?
Grandmother : I like him .
Chris :
You like him ?
Grandmother : Uh-huh .
Chris :
Do you know what he stands for ?
Tarnation !...
Get off my show !
Grandmother : Okay .
When we spoke on the phone , Chris 's grandmother did n't quite seem to grasp the size of her audience ( and Chris 's ) , but she knows the videos are being posted online , and she knows that the other day , some kid at the local Walgreens came up to her and said , " You 're Chris Crocker 's grandmother ! "
Of his internet fame and the offers it 's bringing him , she says : " I guess it 's good , I just do n't want him traveling and going places far away where we do n't know anyone personally .
It 's not like I 'm trying to be bossy or this and that , I just do n't want him to get hurt ....
We 've seen and heard too much on TV about the things that happen on the internet . "
Chris wants to go to L.A .
Ideally , he wants his own TV show .
Meehan , the L.A. producer , thinks it could happen .
Sunbulli , the MTV correspondent , is a bit more skeptical .
" He has a lot of disadvantages going his way , " Sunbulli said of Chris .
The first disadvantage : the newness of this notion that the web can be used as a " talent pool " for big media ; the industry is still going through a learning curve on that , Sunbulli told me .
The second : Chris 's all - over - the - map videos , which range from sexy to serious , confessional to inspirational , and spoof to ambush interview .
" Chris is hard to define , and anything that 's hard to define in the industry is hard for them to accept , " Sunbulli said .
Third : the anything - goes atmosphere of the web , which is both a current help and future hindrance for Chris .
" The web , at the end of the day , is unfiltered , " Sunbulli told me .
" You can get away with swearing ; you can get away with everything you can't get away with on air .
Unless a producer can come in and conform him , and he 's willing to be conformed , he has a very difficult road ahead . "
One of the ideas that Meehan , the producer , has is to get the permission of Chris 's grandparents to shoot a reality show in their house .
The irony of this actually happening , of course , would be that Chris makes it onto television but does n't get to leave Real Bitch Island .
He 's worried about this , worried that his appeal is contingent on the way he clashes with his current location , and on the " comedy gold mine " that is his family .
But if a reality TV show were to happen , he told me , he 'd happily do a year of Real Bitch Island reality and then try to parlay it — finally — into a ticket off .
On my last night in town , I pick Chris up in his grandparents ' driveway and we head to the next town over , which has a gay club , one that people come from all around to attend .
We pass a giant car racetrack , and miles of signs advertising chicken strips and the price of gas .
I told Chris to bring some CDs , and he 's brought Britney Spears ( the whole discography ) .
We 're listening to In the Zone .
Britney and Courtney Love are part of the all - female pantheon that Chris worships ( " Even if they 're a mess , they 're true to themselves , " he says ) .
He also has Madonna and Tori Amos on hand .
We talk about astrology for a bit .
Chris long ago jettisoned religious belief , but he appears to have replaced it with a fanatic faith in the zodiac .
He told me that he used MySpace to check my sign before he agreed to an interview .
The conversation drops off , and I suggest we pass the time by calling the L.A. party line .
He puts my cell on speakerphone and calls in .
Someone named Michelle is in the middle of a rant .
Chocolate , another party - line regular who has become a friend and confidant of Chris 's , is also on .
He teases Michelle for a bit and then he and Chris go into another " room " to chat in peace .
Chris tells Chocolate that he has an " interviewer " with him who wants to know what the party line is all about .
" Tell him it 's a mess , " Chocolate replies .
" Because you got bitches like Michelle in here running their mouth all day . "
Chris then tells Chocolate that we 're headed to the club , and that he 's anxious because he 's probably going to run into Scottie , the ex-boyfriend from his brother - incest video .
" Are you gonna throw him shade ? " Chocolate asks .
" I 'm just gonna pay it , " Chris replies .
Chocolate approves .
The club is so discreet it looks like a hardscrabble church — just a fluorescent - lit reader board out front of a nondescript building , with a huge parking lot in back .
People sometimes drive through the parking lot , Chris tells me , yell " fag , " and throw beer bottles at the clubgoers .
It does n't sound like the gay bars I 'm used to , and I ask him whether it 's safe to go .
He dismisses my nervousness ; he 's so used to the low - level danger of being gay in his area that it does n't register anymore .
Chris shows his ID and gets a stamp that warns the bartenders not to serve him , since he 's only 19 .
He 's wearing Daisy Duke cutoffs , tube socks with red stripes pulled way up his calves , and a wife - beater with " I 'm not gay " written on it in lipstick .
A drag queen in a silk floral dress is auctioning men off to help her raise money for a trip to Atlanta .
She nets about $ 35 .
The crowd is more diverse here than you 'd find in a city with more gay clubs ; apparently , when there 's only one place to go , the dykes crowd in with the sporty boys and the drag queens and the old men and the young Real Bitches .
That 's who I 'm with , the bitches .
Scottie has arrived — 19 like Chris , waify like Chris , and wearing a pink wife - beater .
He has a new boyfriend in tow , wan and unimpressed .
We all lean up against one bar and survey the room .
" I hate these people , " Chris says .
Scottie talks about his own plans to go to L.A .
" It 's going to kill this place , " he says .
There is an odd undercurrent of barely checked violence swirling around us .
A guy in a Polo shirt comes up to Scottie and wants to fight him .
The guy , I 'm told , is supposedly straight , but no one believes it .
Maybe he 's trying to prove something .
Scottie stares him down , even though this guy is bigger than him , and I notice something I had n't noticed before : a scrappiness to both Scottie and Chris , no doubt born of necessity .
The guy in the Polo shirt leaves , a string of threats trailing him .
Another drag queen divides the room in two and has one side chant " Fuck You " while the other side chants " Kiss My Ass . "
The point is to be loudest .
" Andrew ! " Chris yells .
A light - skinned black guy turns and comes over to chat .
I ask Chris afterward if they 're good friends .
He says no , they just know each other from MySpace , and have never met in person before tonight .
A young woman recognizes Chris , also from MySpace , and comes over to talk .
Her name is Vanessa .
She 's 19 , too .
" I just love what he does for the gay community , " Vanessa tells me .
" He 's just putting himself out there and showing that we are around and that we are important , too . "
I ask her what she wants to do with herself .
Without hesitation , she gives me the same answer as Scottie and Chris .
The same urgent distress signal .
The same plea for a means of escape .
" I want to get the fuck out of here . "
This entry inaugurates a new series on patterns that I hate .
Hate is a strong word , perhaps a better name would be “ patterns that I ’ve frequently seen lead to ruin ” .
But that seemed too long .
Anyhow , the singleton pattern is the hands - down # 1 pattern that can lead me to froth at the mouth .
When a programmer first stumbles on GoF , Singleton seems to be the pattern that they first latch on to because it ’s so easy to understand ( just one class ) .
Novice programmers doing their first design will often break out subsystems and access them via singletons .
Why is Singleton evil ?
Hides dependencies – A component that uses one or more singletons is hiding crucial information about your dependencies .
It does n’t take long for calls to a singleton to creep through your code base like kudzu , slowly attaching itself to every class in the system .
Exposing that dependency forces you to think about it as you use a component .
It also makes it more reusable as the caller can understand its requirements and how they might be satisfied .
Hard to test –
The hidden coupling of users on a singleton makes testing a nightmare as there is no way to mock out or inject a test instance of the singleton .
Also , the state of the singleton affects the execution of a suite of tests such that they are not properly isolated from each other .
Hard to subclass – Since initialization occurs in a singleton in static code , it is not amenable to subclassing because subclasses inherit the initialization code without the chance to override it .
It ’s a lie ! ( in most Java systems ) – Singletons in Java are based on static variables , which are held per-classloader , not per-VM .
In most systems of any complexity these days ( any based on an app server , OSGi , Eclipse , plugins , etc ) many classloaders will be involved .
In that case , it is quite easy for two plugins to create their own instance of a singleton .
Sometimes this is done by design and is desirable .
But it ’s also easy to screw up .
It ’s also usually critical that the singleton get created in the right classloader , which can make lazily constructing the singleton tricky .
A singleton today is a multiple tomorrow – It ’s not at all unusual to discover that you now need 2 or more of something you previously only needed one of .
Hard - coding the singleton pattern into your code makes it impossible to satisfy that demand later .
This probably seems really weird if it has n’t happened to you , but it has happened more than once to me .
What is the alternative ?
First , it is important to separate the “ need for one of something in my system ” from the “ singleton pattern ” .
It ’s perfectly reasonable to want one of something but to avoid using the singleton pattern .
In other words , the problem is in the pattern , not in the goal .
When a singleton seems like the answer , I find it is often wiser to :
Create an interface and a default implementation of your singleton
Construct a single instance of your default implementation at the “ top ” of your system .
This might be in a Spring config , or in code , or defined in a variety of ways depending on your system .
Pass the single instance into each component that needs it ( dependency injection )
This alternative will give you the effects of a singleton , but makes the dependencies clear in the components that need it , allows a singleton to be mocked ( via the interface ) , subclassed , proxied , and tested .
But I already have a bunch of singletons in my code !
Sometimes , you ’ll have a system ( built by you or someone else ) that is heavily dependent on some singletons .
Often , you will find this annoying as you try to test and / or add functionality to the system .
To refactor the singletons out of your system , you need to start from each point of use and allow the singleton to be set as a dependency on the component using it , rather than calling to the singleton ’s getInstance ( ) method .
Doing so moves the singleton access ( but not use ) up one level .
Repeat until the singleton ’s getInstance ( ) method is called in as few places as possible ( ideally one ) .
At this point , all components in the system declare their dependence on the concrete singleton class and that singleton class is instantiated at a very few points at the “ top ” or your architecture ( then passed down through the systems ) .
Next , it ’s time to apply some classic refactoring .
Most importantly , we want to change the concrete singleton class into an interface and move the existing concrete implementation into a new default implementation class implementing the interface .
Finally , you ’ll probably want to cleanup the calls to getInstance ( ) with either a call to new the concrete default implementation or a factory method that can do that for you .
This transformation should make all of your components dependent on an injectable , interface - defined component , which is easy to mock or swap in during unit testing of the component itself .
It also typically makes testing of the concrete singleton implementation itself a breeze compared to the prior implementation .
Note that the first phase of bubbling the singleton instantiation up through the architecture can be done as slowly as needed and does not need to be done all at once .
You ’ll find the second phase is fairly easy with any modern IDE once you get to that point .
But I really , really , really want to use a singleton
There are still some cases where singletons are a valid choice .
One is logging .
Logging is so pervasive that unless you use some fairly heavy - handed dependency injection or AOP , it is not feasible to inject every class in the system with a logger .
Instead , this is a case where using static methods or singletons are probably worth the compromise .
Another common use is to obtain a handle to a service locator ( think JNDI ) that knows how to access everything else .
This is actually one way to change your entire system from using many singletons to using one singleton that knows how to find the others .
This is a valid technique that addresses some of the inherent problems ( mockability , testing ) with singletons and may be a less invasive change to a legacy code base .
Swing or other client - side UIs are another case where singletons may be a valid choice .
In the case of a Java desktop app , it is likely that you have more complete control over your deployment environment than you do in a server - side application .
In this case , it can be acceptable to have a manager class managing some state as a singleton in the VM .
However , my preference would be to go the extra step to expose that dependency .
If you do really need to use a singleton , please make sure you initialize it safely !
This concludes the first pattern I hate .
I ’ll be back soon to talk about another .

The exact cause of the blaze aboard the train is not yet known
Enlarge Image
At least 20 people were taken to hospital with poisoning after the fire caused a massive toxic cloud .
Remaining local residents were told to use gas masks and stay indoors .
Ukrainian authorities are trying to establish what caused the crash , but said there was no suggestion of sabotage or terrorism .
The freight train , which was en route from Kazakhstan to Poland , derailed near Lviv , a town not far from the Polish border in western Ukraine on Monday night .
Fifteen of the train 's 58 cars overturned , six of which then caught fire , officials said .
The toxic yellow cloud caused by the blaze covered an area of 90 sq km ( 34.7 sq miles ) above 14 villages near Lviv before dispersing on Tuesday .
Fire - fighters wearing masks and protective clothing managed to extinguish the fire after several hours .
' Grave catastrophe '
Phosphorus compounds are mainly used in fertilisers , but can also be used to produce pesticides , cleaning products and explosives .
The chemical can cause damage to the liver , the heart or the kidneys if consumed .
In many cases exposure can be fatal .
Many people were evacuated at their own request .
Deputy Prime Minister Olexander Kuzmuk , who on Tuesday compared the spill to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster , has since insisted there is no health risk to surrounding villages , the AFP news agency reported .
Other officials have been careful to play down any comparisons with Chernobyl and said they had minimised the risk to public health .
" The cloud of a toxic gas dispersed and there is no threat to people 's lives , " Ihor Krol , a spokesman for the Emergency Situations Ministry , told the Associated Press .
Msaba Zungu and Thabitha Thusi , both 60 , were seized from their homes near Manguzi in KwaZulu - Natal province .
Students and adults dragged them to a sports field where they were doused with petrol and set alight on Sunday .
Manhlenga High School pupils accused the women of being witches after they began to suffer strange crying fits .
Investigators said Ms Zungu died at the scene and Ms Thusi succumbed to her burns injuries on Monday .
Police captain Jabulani Mdletshe told the BBC News website : " On 17 August , the students at the mixed high school began to cry randomly and they did not know why .
" The students held a couple of meetings and allegedly decided the problem was these two women were witches who had cast a bad muthi ( spell ) on the school .
" At 8 pm on Sunday , some students and community members allegedly took the women from their homes to a football field and set them on fire . "
No arrests have been made but police are following a positive line of inquiry , said Capt Mdletshe .
The Non-Paradox of Choice
Decision theory has an interesting idea , an observation really : too much choice may cause paralysis by analysis .
This same idea has also been recently popularized as ‘ The Paradox of Choice ’ by Berry Schwartz .
I think it ’s an unfortunate name , it makes for a great eye - grabber at the store , but it is also highly misleading .
Mike Reining ’s article ‘ Stop Offering Your Customers Too Many Choices ’ caught my eye , it fell into the ‘ paradox ’ trap :
More choice = less sales .
When I 'm asked to provide critiques of people 's sites one of the biggest crimes I see is the presence of too many options for a product that is unknown .
When a customer is first being introduced to your product - do n't give them 10 flippin ' options to choose from .
Do n't even give them 2 options !
Point them in ONE direction .
‘ Paradox ’ is too strong
I disagree with Mike .
The paradox of choice does not imply that having more choice makes us unhappy , but rather , that at some point , too much choice makes us less happy about our decisions .
Notice that this does not imply that choice is inherently bad , it ’s a far weaker statement , but it does carry some important implications .
I think the root of the problem lies in the fact that nobody wants to be sold .
We do n’t like being tricked , and we are always skeptical about an over - enthusiastic salesperson .
What we want , is to feel in control ; we want to be sure that our decisions are optimal - we want the ‘ best ’ deal .
Having said that , if there is only one option for a product , then we have a monopoly .
Is that the best choice ?
Well , probably not .
Lack of competition rarely fosters creation of ‘ best ’ products .
Now imagine we have two products .
Great , now we can weigh our options and choose what suits us best ; we ’re better of at this point .
Same trend continues for having 3 , 4 , 5 , … , 10 choices .
However , at some point , when the number of options becomes too large , there is an inflection point , and later the dreaded state of paralysis by analysis ( diagram above ) .
The sheer number of different products makes it impossible for us to weigh every option in a reasonable amount of time - you can no longer be sure that you ’re getting the best possible deal .
A pessimist might say :
Choice is good
We might have been happier if there was less choice , but the reverse does not follow .
Having none or very little choice does not make us happy .
Let ’s make this concrete :
You are looking for a digital camera , a DSLR to be exact , how does this affect you ?
Well , if there was only one choice , then it would be only a question of money .
Given two choices you could find a review and compare the cameras feature by feature .
In the end you will choose what suits you best .
Same goes for 3 , 4 , 5 options .
Only one problem , assume that we have about a 100 different options - do you really have the time or the patience to find the absolute best one in that haystack ?
Probably not , you ’ll become a satisficer , you ’ll settle for the optimal solution you found , but it may not be the absolute best decision in itself .
Here is another way to illustrate this problem :
Imagine that all possible cameras and their ‘ utility ’ , or the value for the money , is shown in this 3D - Plane .
You want the best choice - that ’s the camera at the top of the biggest peak .
However , because there are so many different choices , and features , you might actually settle for a ‘ local optima ’ .
This could happen for a number of reasons , one of which is time .
Time is valuable , and sometimes we simply cannot afford to spend much of it to make our decisions .
And that ’s the ‘ paradox ’ , or the problem with too much choice - when we ca n’t measure it all , we are always left with a feeling that we might have missed something big , something better .
End result : we feel worse .
Solution : experts , magazines , friends - anything or anyone that can provide a shortcut in our decision making process .
Barry Schwartz argues that we need to become satisficers , or settle for ‘ local optima ’ more often than not because if you always try to get the absolute best , you ’ll simply exhaust yourself .
After all , you might do extensive research before you buy your DSLR , but you might not care if you get the absolute best pair of shoes .
There is nothing wrong with that , and in fact , that is exactly how most people go about their daily life .
So is this really a paradox ?
Building new products
Does paralysis by analysis imply that companies should avoid adding options into new products ?
I do n’t think so .
This is a completely unrelated issue - it has far more to do with design aesthetics and product strategy , which depends on the market niche , than with consumer psychology .
We all love to express ourselves through choices we make : the way we dress , the gadgets we use , etc .
Scion was the first company to offer customized cars from the factory and they have been very successful .
Do n’t be scared of choice ; embrace it , because we love it , and we need it .
Just be aware that swamping the user with too much , especially all at once , might cause a decrease in satisfaction .
Information designers , I hope you are paying attention .

of domestic animals anyway .
The only breed of sheep in Iceland is the native North European Short
Tailed sheep brought by the settlers , the Vikings , 1100 - 1200 years ago
Without them Icelanders would not have survived throughout centuries of
hardship on an isolated island just south of the Arctic Circle .
Even grazing
in winter had to be utilized to the utmost and somehow a unique , small
population of sheep developed which displayed outstanding abilities to help
the farmers and shepherds to manage the flock on pasture , namely
leadersheep .
Although farming practices have changed and thus the role of
these highly intelligent sheep with special alertness and leadership
characteristics in their genes .
There is still a population of 1000 - 1200 sheep
within the national population of just under 500,000 .
Most of the leadersheep are coloured and horned , even four - horned in a few cases .
They have a slender body
conformation , long legs and bones generally , yet of lighter weight than other sheep in the flock because they
have been selected for intelligence , not for meat traits .
Leadersheep are graceful and prominent in the flock ,
with alertness in the eyes , normally going first out of the sheep - house , looking around in all directions ,
watching if there are any dangers in sight and then walking in front of the flock when driven to or from
pasture .
They may even guard the flock against predators .
There are many stories on record about their ability
to sense or forecast changes in the weather even , refusing to leave the sheep - house before a major snowstorm .
One wonders how better use could be made of such genes in the future .
We certainly want to preserve the Icelandic leadersheep .
Interested individuals founded the Leader - Sheep
Society of Iceland in April 2000 .
Amongst the priorities is to improve the individual recording of these sheep
throughout the country and plan their breeding more effectively .
We know that the best leadersheep are found
in flocks in NE Iceland but farmers in all parts of the country are interested in their conservation .
Support is
also coming from individuals who are not keeping sheep .
Icelandic sheep , not least leadersheep , have clearly a
special role in our culture .

MRI scans were used to spot differences
A Yale University team found activity in parts of paedophiles ' brains were lower than in other volunteers when shown adult , erotic material .
The journal Biological Psychiatry said this was the first real - time evidence of differences in thought patterns .
A forensic psychologist from the UK said drug treatments for paedophilia might be possible .
This deficit may predispose individuals who are vulnerable to paedophilia to seek other forms of stimulation
Dr John Krystal , Editor , Biological Psychiatry
There is increasing evidence that problems in certain areas of the brain may contribute to feelings of sexual attraction towards children .
In a few cases , patients with a brain tumour in a particular part of the brain have developed such feelings , only for them to go away when the tumour was removed .
The Yale study used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , a technique which allows the activity within the brain to be recorded as the patient is thinking .
They found that when known patients with paedophilic feelings were asked to look at adult pornography , a part of the brain called the hypothalamus , which is known to be involved in arousal and hormone release , was less active than in other volunteers .
More generally , the more extreme the paedophilic behaviour was rated , the lower the activation in a part of the brain called the " frontal cortex " .
However , Dr John Krystal , the journal 's editor , said he did n't know whether this particular pattern of brain activity could be used to predict someone 's risk of paedophilia .
But he said : " The findings provide clues to the complexity of this disorder , and this deficit may predispose individuals who are vulnerable to paedophilia to seek other forms of stimulation . "
Drug treatment
Lead researcher Dr Georg Northoff added : " Our results may thus be seen as the first step towards establishing a neurobiology of paedophilia which ultimately may contribute to the development of new and effective means of therapies for this debilitating disorder . "
In the UK , many experts are looking to the biology of the brain to explain not just paedophilia , but other types of compulsive criminality .
Dr Keith Ashcroft , a forensic psychologist at the Centre for Forensic Neuroscience , in Lancashire , said that other evidence pointed to problems in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain being linked to paedophilic thoughts .
He said : " Sexual behaviour is very complex , especially as some people are not aroused by visual stimuli , but by touch instead .
" I am campaigning for the use of anti-schizophrenia drugs in paedophilia , as these act on a similar part of the brain and may be useful . "
RFID microchips implanted in humans ?
Who would think of such a thing ?
Here are a few examples :
You 're not even safe from being ' chipped when you 're dead .
But you 'll be safe in Wisconsin , if State Representative Marlin Schneider , D - Wisconsin Rapids , gets his bill passed .
A proposal moving through the Wisconsin Legislature would prohibit anyone from requiring people to have the tiny RFID chips embedded in them or doing so without their knowledge .
Violators would face fines of up to $ 10,000 .
Verichip Corporation , based in Florida , has federal approval to implant these rice grain - sized RFID chips in people .
The procedure is very similar to getting a shot ; typical sites for implantation are the back of the hand and the upper arm .
Wisconsin 's former governor Tommy Thompson supported the idea of chip implantation for medical identification reasons ; he even joined Verichip 's board of directors .
However , he has n't gotten the chip himself .
If this bill passes , Wisconsin would be the first state to ban mandatory microchip implants .

Mrs Horsman is allowed to take her daughter to and from school
Fran Horsman wrote four letters to Loddon Junior in Norfolk , questioning how the school , which her 10 - year - old daughter Gaby attends , was run .
Chair of school governors Chris Boswell said Mrs Horsman , who was a parent helper , could come to school events with the head 's permission .
He said he was sad the relationship had broken down but he stood by the ban .
Mrs Horsman said she would write a letter to Ed Balls , Secretary of State for Children , Schools and Families .
Her daughter Gaby said : " I do n't understand why she is being banned .
It 's just really weird because other mums and dads are allowed to go in and out of the school but my mum 's not . "
' Parent 's job to question '
Mrs Horsman can only walk her daughter to and from the school - she cannot go inside without an official appointment .
She claimed it was because of the four letters she wrote to the school .
In one she spoke of her " total despair at the general state of affairs " , while another said " there is no justification for having every class of mixed year groups " .
Mrs Horsman told the BBC : " Part of my job as a parent is to question what goes on at the school and to make sure my daughter gets the best possible education . "
A letter from the chair of school governors said the school had consulted its legal team and any further negative correspondence could be viewed as offensive .
Scouts ' barbecue
Chris Boswell , chair of governors , said : " I am saddened that the relationship between the school and one of our parent helpers has deteriorated to the extent that the governors have felt it necessary for her to stay away from the site other than to bring or collect her child from school .
" We wrote to the person involved back in July , setting out our concerns , and explaining the basis for our decision .
" If the person concerned wishes to discuss an issue with the school we have asked her to simply make a prior appointment .
" Over the summer the school has had no issue with her attending sports day and a scouts ' barbeque for example . "
The digestive system is a group of organs working together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body .
Food passes through a long tube inside the body known as the alimentary canal or the gastrointestinal tract ( GI tract ) .
The alimentary canal is made up of the oral cavity , pharynx , esophagus , stomach , small intestines , and large intestines .
In addition to the alimentary canal , there are several important accessory organs that help your body to digest food but do not have food pass through them .
Accessory organs of the digestive system include the teeth , tongue , salivary glands , liver , gallbladder , and pancreas .

Digestive System Anatomy
Mouth
To achieve the goal of providing energy and nutrients to the body , six major functions take place in the digestive system :
Food begins its journey through the digestive system in the mouth , also known as the oral cavity .
Inside the mouth are many accessory organs that aid in the digestion of food — the tongue , teeth , and salivary glands .
Teeth chop food into small pieces , which are moistened by saliva before the tongue and other muscles push the food into the pharynx .
Teeth .
The teeth are 32 small , hard organs found along the anterior and lateral edges of the mouth .
Each tooth is made of a bone - like substance called dentin and covered in a layer of enamel — the hardest substance in the body .
Teeth are living organs and contain blood vessels and nerves under the dentin in a soft region known as the pulp .
The teeth are designed for cutting and grinding food into smaller pieces .

The teeth are designed for cutting and grinding food into smaller pieces .
Tongue .
The tongue is located on the inferior portion of the mouth just posterior and medial to the teeth .
It is a small organ made up of several pairs of muscles covered in a thin , bumpy , skin - like layer .
The outside of the tongue contains many rough papillae for gripping food as it is moved by the tongue ’s muscles .
The taste buds on the surface of the tongue detect taste molecules in food and connect to nerves in the tongue to send taste information to the brain .
The tongue also helps to push food toward the posterior part of the mouth for swallowing .

The taste buds on the surface of the tongue detect taste molecules in food and connect to nerves in the tongue to send taste information to the brain .
The tongue also helps to push food toward the posterior part of the mouth for swallowing .
Salivary Glands .
Surrounding the mouth are 3 sets of salivary glands .
The salivary glands are accessory organs that produce a watery secretion known as saliva .
Saliva helps to moisten food and begins the digestion of carbohydrates .
The body also uses saliva to lubricate food as it passes through the mouth , pharynx , and esophagus .
Pharynx
The pharynx , or throat , is a funnel - shaped tube connected to the posterior end of the mouth .
The pharynx is responsible for the passing of masses of chewed food from the mouth to the esophagus .
The pharynx also plays an important role in the respiratory system , as air from the nasal cavity passes through the pharynx on its way to the larynx and eventually the lungs .
Because the pharynx serves two different functions , it contains a flap of tissue known as the epiglottis that acts as a switch to route food to the esophagus and air to the larynx .
Esophagus
The esophagus is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach that is part of the upper gastrointestinal tract .
It carries swallowed masses of chewed food along its length .
At the inferior end of the esophagus is a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter or cardiac sphincter .
The function of this sphincter is to close of the end of the esophagus and trap food in the stomach .
Stomach
The stomach is a muscular sac that is located on the left side of the abdominal cavity , just inferior to the diaphragm .
In an average person , the stomach is about the size of their two fists placed next to each other .
This major organ acts as a storage tank for food so that the body has time to digest large meals properly .
The stomach also contains hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes that continue the digestion of food that began in the mouth .
Small Intestine
The small intestine is a long , thin tube about 1 inch in diameter and about 10 feet long that is part of the lower gastrointestinal tract .
It is located just inferior to the stomach and takes up most of the space in the abdominal cavity .
The entire small intestine is coiled like a hose and the inside surface is full of many ridges and folds .
These folds are used to maximize the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients .
By the time food leaves the small intestine , around 90 % of all nutrients have been extracted from the food that entered it .
Liver and Gallbladder
The liver is a roughly triangular accessory organ of the digestive system located to the right of the stomach , just inferior to the diaphragm and superior to the small intestine .
The liver weighs about 3 pounds and is the second largest organ in the body .
The liver has many different functions in the body , but the main function of the liver in digestion is the production of bile and its secretion into the small intestine .
The gallbladder is a small , pear - shaped organ located just posterior to the liver .
The gallbladder is used to store and recycle excess bile from the small intestine so that it can be reused for the digestion of subsequent meals .
Pancreas
The pancreas is a large gland located just inferior and posterior to the stomach .
It is about 6 inches long and shaped like short , lumpy snake with its “ head ” connected to the duodenum and its “ tail ” pointing to the left wall of the abdominal cavity .
The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine to complete the chemical digestion of foods .
Large Intestine
The large intestine is a long , thick tube about 2.5 inches in diameter and about 5 feet long .
It is located just inferior to the stomach and wraps around the superior and lateral border of the small intestine .
The large intestine absorbs water and contains many symbiotic bacteria that aid in the breaking down of wastes to extract some small amounts of nutrients .
Feces in the large intestine exit the body through the anal canal .
Digestive System Physiology
The digestive system is responsible for taking whole foods and turning them into energy and nutrients to allow the body to function , grow , and repair itself .
The six primary processes of the digestive system include :
Ingestion of food Secretion of fluids and digestive enzymes Mixing and movement of food and wastes through the body Digestion of food into smaller pieces Absorption of nutrients Excretion of wastes
1 Ingestion
The first function of the digestive system is ingestion , or the intake of food .
The mouth is responsible for this function , as it is the orifice through which all food enters the body .
The mouth and stomach are also responsible for the storage of food as it is waiting to be digested .
This storage capacity allows the body to eat only a few times each day and to ingest more food than it can process at one time .
2 Secretion
In the course of a day , the digestive system secretes around 7 liters of fluids .
These fluids include saliva , mucus , hydrochloric acid , enzymes , and bile .
Saliva moistens dry food and contains salivary amylase , a digestive enzyme that begins the digestion of carbohydrates .
Mucus serves as a protective barrier and lubricant inside of the GI tract .
Hydrochloric acid helps to digest food chemically and protects the body by killing bacteria present in our food .
Enzymes are like tiny biochemical machines that disassemble large macromolecules like proteins , carbohydrates , and lipids into their smaller components .
Finally , bile is used to emulsify large masses of lipids into tiny globules for easy digestion .
3 Mixing and Movement
The digestive system uses 3 main processes to move and mix food :
Swallowing .
Swallowing is the process of using smooth and skeletal muscles in the mouth , tongue , and pharynx to push food out of the mouth , through the pharynx , and into the esophagus .
Peristalsis .
Peristalsis is a muscular wave that travels the length of the GI tract , moving partially digested food a short distance down the tract .
It takes many waves of peristalsis for food to travel from the esophagus , through the stomach and intestines , and reach the end of the GI tract .
, and reach the end of the GI tract .
Segmentation .
Segmentation occurs only in the small intestine as short segments of intestine contract like hands squeezing a toothpaste tube .
Segmentation helps to increase the absorption of nutrients by mixing food and increasing its contact with the walls of the intestine .
4 Digestion
Digestion is the process of turning large pieces of food into its component chemicals .
Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces .
This mode of digestion begins with the chewing of food by the teeth and is continued through the muscular mixing of food by the stomach and intestines .
Bile produced by the liver is also used to mechanically break fats into smaller globules .
While food is being mechanically digested it is also being chemically digested as larger and more complex molecules are being broken down into smaller molecules that are easier to absorb .
Chemical digestion begins in the mouth with salivary amylase in saliva splitting complex carbohydrates into simple carbohydrates .
The enzymes and acid in the stomach continue chemical digestion , but the bulk of chemical digestion takes place in the small intestine thanks to the action of the pancreas .
The pancreas secretes an incredibly strong digestive cocktail known as pancreatic juice , which is capable of digesting lipids , carbohydrates , proteins and nucleic acids .
By the time food has left the duodenum , it has been reduced to its chemical building blocks — fatty acids , amino acids , monosaccharides , and nucleotides .
5 Absorption
Once food has been reduced to its building blocks , it is ready for the body to absorb .
Absorption begins in the stomach with simple molecules like water and alcohol being absorbed directly into the bloodstream .
Most absorption takes place in the walls of the small intestine , which are densely folded to maximize the surface area in contact with digested food .
Small blood and lymphatic vessels in the intestinal wall pick up the molecules and carry them to the rest of the body .
The large intestine is also involved in the absorption of water and vitamins B and K before feces leave the body .
6 Excretion
The final function of the digestive system is the excretion of waste in a process known as defecation .
Defecation removes indigestible substances from the body so that they do not accumulate inside the gut .
The timing of defecation is controlled voluntarily by the conscious part of the brain , but must be accomplished on a regular basis to prevent a backup of indigestible materials .
Digestive Disorders
Many diseases and health conditions - such as ulcers , GERD , IBD and celiac disease , just to name a few - lead to dysfunction in our digestive system .

Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .

REST Issues , Real and Imagined
I think that most of the debate about REST focuses on the wrong things , leading developers down the garden path at the expense of their productivity and the success of their projects .
Time and time again , I ’ve seen folks who are new to REST get caught up on small stuff like this ;
False Choice : “ High ” vs. “ Low ” REST
Lots of blog space has been devoted to figuring out what PUT and DELETE are good for , leading many to believe that they have to choose a direction , “ High ” or “ Low ” ( as popularised by Don ) .
I ’ve seen developers who decide they ca n’t do “ pure ” REST , and so think that the only alternative is POX - style RPC services , with nothing in between .
This is n’t an earth - shatterning choice to make ; the truth is that you ’re just choosing what methods you ’ll use , based on the semantics of your application , and how well those methods are chosen by the tools you ’ll use .
Is this a reason for a schism in the Web ?
Hardly ; there are much more fundamental splits in WS -* services ( e.g. , whether to use SOAP encoding , RPC , etc. ) .
Red Herring : The Evils of POST
If you dip into REST discussions a bit , you may leave with the impression that POST is the anti-REST , and it should be avoided at all costs .
However , if that ’s true , why did the Great Roy allow POST to be foisted upon HTTP ?
Perhaps it has a place in RESTful applications after all — as long as it ’s used intelligently .
This usually becomes obvious when you ’re deep in the bowels of resource - modelling an application , trying to figure out how to represent a complex operation as state — only to realise that there ’s no need to expose all of the details , if there were just some way to say “ hey , submit this for processing ! ” POST is the correct answer .
Red Herring : URI Design
When somebody first “ gets ” REST , they often spend an inordinate amount of time agonising over the exact design of the URIs in their application ; take a look over on rest - discuss , for example .
In the end , though , URI design is a mostly a cosmetic issue ; sure , it ’s evidence that you ’ve thought about good resource modelling , and it makes things more human - intelligable , but it ’s seldom worth spending so much time on it .
I ’d worry a lot more about cacheability , extensibility and well - defined formats before blowing out my schedule on well - designed URIs .
For me , the high points are broadly exploiting the hierarchy , allowing relative references , and making sure that tools ( e.g. , HTML forms ) can work well with my URIs ; everything else is gravy .
Red Herring : Cookies Are Bad
Cookies get a lot of grief , and they are certainly abused on the Web today .
However , they ’re not intrinsically bad ; there are uses where they ’re appropriate , as long as they do n’t try to do the job of the URI as well .
Given the poor state of the standard mechanisms for HTTP authentication , for example , it ’s not unreasonable to use them for passing credentials .
False Choice : Machines vs. People
There ’s an insistence from some quarters that somehow , HTTP and REST are only good for people sitting behind browsers .
I think that this has been solidly and obviously disproven , and find it difficult to believe that such continued , vigourous assertions are anything other than FUD .
shrug
How About Some Real Issues with REST ?
All of the above is not to say that there is n’t anything to improve about the state of HTTP and REST in the world .
The most obvious issue that everybody trips up over is authentication — HTTP authentication is unbelievably primitive , and while there are promising things on the horizon , we ’ve still got a long way to go .
Another issue is shared with ws -* services ; formats are hard .
In particular , while XML is popular , most use of it is horrible , and the tools do n’t encourage good practice .
You could count the number of people who can write an XML schema that ’s extensible and versionable on both hands .
JSON is promising , but it does n’t have a schema language , and it ’s also pretty limited .
The tools for REST are primitive as well ; Marc ’s JSR looks promising in this direction , but a lot more work needs to be done , in a number of dimensions .
Finally , one of the deeper REST constraints is using hypertext as the engine of application state .
Designing applications and tools that are smart enough to update themselves based upon what happens on the Web is n’t in reach for today ’s tools .
That ’s not to say that they ’re not possible .
Saturday , September 15th , at 12 pm , international and Israeli activists joined Palestinian activists and villagers in the village of Qusin to protest the system of control imposed upon them by the Israeli army .
The region has seen a rise in demonstrations of this sort recently , with roadblock removal demonstrations happening also in the nearby town of Sarra .
There is a road that connects both of these towns , and others , to Nablus , and to the Nablus - Tulkarem road .
This road has been deemed usable only by Israelis , it turns what is normally a five minute journey to Nablus into at least one hour .
This constitutes daily harassment for people going to work , going to school , or even just visiting family .
People gathered together in the village of Qusin and marched towards the roadblock that prevents them from accessing this road , in Qusin it takes the form of a yellow gate chained shut .
Villagers with international and Israeli support rallied at the gate , singing , chanting , and opened it for general use .
After some celebrations at the newly opened gate this non-violent demonstration decided to return to the village , but soldiers from an army base nearby spotted them and ran down the hill , preventing them from going back peaceably to their homes .
Soldiers began to push the people gathered there , threatening them all alike .
The press were threatened and assaulted as much as the demonstrators , with one journalist saying the commander told him “ stop filming or I will break your camera ! ” .
The soldiers did not want any evidence of what was going to happen next .
Tear gas and rubber - coated metal bullets began to shoot off into the crowd , the demonstrators scattered , unable to reach their home and faced with extreme army violence .
People ran down a hill into a field , trying to find an alternative way of reaching their village .
The army stood on the road , firing more tear gas and rubber - coated metal bullets at moving targets below .
Some of the soldiers chased people into the fields , and were seen beating Palestinians .
They were also caught pointing their guns at people at point - blank range and threatening to fire .
One international was shot in the hand at a distance of 10 meters by a rubber - coated steel bullet and required medical attention , with blood shooting from her hand “ like a geyser ” as one witness reported .
Under Israel ’s own military law , it is illegal to fire rubber coated steel bullets from a distance closer than 40 meters .
The soldiers were therefore in direct violation of their own military law when undertaking these actions today .
Another international and five Palestinians were also shot but did not need to go to the hospital .
While most people had scattered , many international and Israeli observers were on the road asking the military to calm down and use less violence .
After it was clear the demonstration was over , these people were all arrested .
In the end six Israeli activists , five international activists , and two Palestinians were arrested .
The Palestinians were handcuffed and blindfolded and no information about their status has been confirmed .
Three of the international activists and one Israeli are being charged with the false allegation of assaulting an officer while being arrested .
Although these claims are entirely baseless lies , journalists were kept away from the scene of the arrest to prevent demonstrators from having proof of their innocence and it will be a case of one person ’s word against the other .
*** UPDATE ***
As of September 19th , all the demonstrators have been released .
Those injured and hospitalized have returned to their homes and are recovering .
We are still trying to raise money for the Palestinian demonstrators , 8,000 shekels ( around 2,000 dollars ) are urgently needed to pay for the bail costs for both men .
It is extremely important to support the villagers of Qusin who have only begun to wage nonviolent struggle against an illegal and brutal Israeli occupation .

In other words , you may lose fewer pounds than if you expended the same number of calories on an aerobic activity like brisk walking or swimming , but you will be stronger and better toned .
With greater muscle mass , your basic metabolic rate will rise and you will burn more calories all day and night .
And since muscle holds less water and takes up less room than the equivalent weight of fat , by shedding fat and gaining muscle you can lose inches and sizes without losing actual pounds on the scale .
Keep in mind , though , that the time spent doing resistance exercise burns fewer calories than if the same time were spent on aerobic activities .
Mr. La Forge pointed out that how skilled you are at your chosen activity also influences the calories burned .
Those less skilled make unnecessary movements or have to work harder at the activity , using more calories an hour than those who perform it efficiently .
That may sound like it is an advantage to be unskilled , but there is a significant downside :
Those with less skill tend to tire faster and thus spend less time at the activity .
They are also more prone to overuse injuries .
Another factor in caloric burn is the increased number of calories the body uses after a workout .
Both aerobic and resistance exercises raise energy expenditure over the next 12 to 24 hours , but the range is great — from 10 to 150 calories , depending on the type of activity and how long and vigorously it was done .
Though it does not sound like much , it can add up over the long run .
Your Body Counts , Too
People who are overweight or obese burn more calories proportionately doing the same activity , for the same duration and at the same intensity , than those of normal weight .
But some people compensate for the calories burned by eating more or doing less .
If you exhaust yourself by overexercising , you may do less routine activity for the rest of the day , reducing the caloric benefit of your workout .
Or if you know you expended 300 extra calories in your morning workout , you may — consciously or otherwise — make up for them by eating more that day .
On the other hand , many people find that a vigorous workout before lunch or dinner diminishes their appetite and reduces their overall caloric intake , adding to the weight loss resulting from the exercise itself .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp. has no plans to cut the price of its PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) at present to pep up demand and counter surging sales of Nintendo ’s rival game console Wii , Sony ’s president said on Friday .

Sony President Ryoji Chubachi also said in an interview that operating profit margin at its mainstay electronics unit , which makes hot - selling Bravia LCD televisions and Cyber - shot digital cameras , was likely to exceed its 4 percent target for the current year to March 2008 .
“ At present we have no plans , ” Chubachi told Reuters when asked whether Sony had any plans to cut the PS3 price .
Sony has packed cutting - edge technology such as a Blu-ray high - definition optical disc player into the PS3 , driving up production costs and making its retail price more than twice as expensive as the Wii .
The higher price tag and lack of attractive software titles have been cited as main reasons the PS3 has been trailing the Wii in sales , and analysts have been widely expecting Sony to soon slash the price to spur on demand .
In a Reuters poll of four game analysts this week , three expected Sony to cut PS3 prices by $ 100 by the end of the year , while one analyst said a cut of $ 150 is more likely .
The PS3 , with a 60 - gigabyte hard disk drive , carries a price tag of $ 599 in the United States , while the Wii sells for about $ 250 .
“ If you take a look at how PlayStation and PlayStation 2 have taken off , this is not such an unusual start , ” Chubachi said .
When the PS2 made its debut in 2000 , Sony was initially criticized for lack of strong titles , and some software publishers said the machine was too complex to develop for .
Sony eventually overcame those difficulties and has sold more than 120 million PS2 units , making it the top - selling video game console ever .
In a sign of lack of confidence on the side of investors , however , Sony , which has sales eight times as big as Nintendo , was overtaken by the Kyoto - based company last week in market capitalization and bumped off the list of Japan ’s 10 most valuable companies .
Chubachi said the company was on track to hit its target of a 5 percent operating profit margin for the year to March 2008 , and its electronics division will likely exceed the 4 percent target .
The margin targets , set in 2005 , have been considered as the most visible indicator of success for turnaround efforts by Chief Executive Howard Stringer and Chubachi .
“ We set the targets when the electronics division was not doing so well .
But we saw some recovery in the unit , and it now can make a bigger contribution for Sony ’s effort to hit a 5 percent margin , ” Chubachi said .
Sony was late in shifting its resources to flat TVs , but an alliance with South Korea ’s Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. in liquid crystal display ( LCD ) panel production and massive marketing campaigns helped the company become the world ’s largest LCD TV maker by revenues in 2006 .
“ There once was a time when Sony was classified as a member of the losing camp ( in the electronics sector ) ...
But this is the final year of Sony ’s revival phase , ” Chubachi said .
“ We will keep our eyes on the targets never to miss them . ”
Despite Chubachi ’s determination , there are nagging worries in the market that if it is forced to cut PS3 prices substantially to stir up demand , a larger - than - expected loss at the game unit could derail Sony ’s plan for the 5 percent margin .
Analysts , on average , expect Sony to post an operating profit margin of 4.9 percent for the current business year , according to Reuters Estimates .
Ahead of Chubachi ’s comments , shares in Sony closed up 1.2 percent at 6,540 yen , while the Tokyo stock market ’s electrical machinery index , which fell 0.79 percent .
Sony shares have gained 28 percent since the start of the year , outpacing the sub - index ’s 9 percent rise .
The stock performance , however , is overshadowed by a 59 percent jump in Nintendo shares .

Washington , DC - Today , the American Civil Liberties Union urged the Senate Judiciary Committee once again to demand that the attorney general answer its questions thoroughly and honestly .
In his third appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee this year , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales faces tough questions about a litany of issues , including the firings of US attorneys , the FBI ’s use of datamining and the abuse of National Security Letters ( NSLs ) .
In previous testimony , Mr. Gonzales frequently left questions unanswered and , in 2005 , misled a Senate committee about his knowledge of civil liberties violations connected with misuse of NSLs .
" Mr. Gonzales ’s tenure at the Department of Justice has been marred by disgrace and deceit , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" With every new scandal , it becomes more obvious that this attorney general does not have the best interests of the American people in mind .
From the firings of highly qualified US attorneys to the NSL cover - up , it seems that Mr. Gonzales is more interested in pursuing the president ’s agenda than pursuing justice . "
Mr. Gonzales is also expected to be asked about his role in the NSA ’s warrantless wiretapping program - specifically , the hospital visit he paid to then - Attorney General John Ashcroft on the night of March 9 , 2004 .
Former acting attorney general James Comey revealed that Mr. Gonzales and then - White House Chief of Staff , Andrew Card , attempted to convince Mr. Ashcroft to renew the program over his objections .
The committee is currently seeking the legal rationale for the program through subpoenas , having extended its original deadline of July 18th at the White House ’s request .
" This attorney general ’s failure to cooperate with the committee shows a lack of respect for Congress and for the American people , " added Fredrickson .
" Members of Congress have been extraordinarily patient with this attorney general but now is the time for straight answers - if not , the Senate should exercise all of its authority to get the answers it needs .
There is no doubt that our democracy and the separation of powers lie in the balance . "

Emacs already has decent completion capabilities .
Any time there 's a list of possible answers , you can press Tab for completion .
When there 's more than one possible completion , it brings up a list for you .
I like to see the list of possible completions without pressing Tab or ? .
In XEmacs , I use two packages , iswitchb and icomplete to get a list of completions as I type , at least for switching buffers and for minibuffer inputs :
( require ' iswitchb ) ( setq iswitchb - buffer - ignore '( " ^ " " * Buffer " ) ) ( add - hook ' iswitchb-define-mode-map-hook '( lambda ( ) ( define - key iswitchb - mode-map " " ' iswitchb - next - match ) ( define - key iswitchb - mode -map [ del ] ' iswitchb - prev- match ) ( define - key iswitchb - mode - map [ bs ] ' iswitchb - prev- match ) ( define - key iswitchb - mode - map [ right ] ' iswitchb -next - match ) ( define - key iswitchb - mode-map [ left ] ' iswitchb- prev-match ) ) ) ( icomplete - mode 1 )
In Emacs22 , I use ido instead of iswitchb .
It works for both switching buffers and for opening files :
( setq ido - confirm - unique - completion t ) ( setq ido - default - buffer - method ' samewindow ) ( setq ido - use - filename - at - point t ) ( ido - mode t) ( ido - everywhere t ) ( set - face - background ' ido - first - match " white " ) ( set - face - foreground ' ido - subdir " blue3 " ) ( icomplete - mode 1 )
If you 're really into the power of completion , be sure to check out the icicles package by Drew Adams .
It has a lot more features , and it has some things that look incredibly useful .
It works for buffers , files , and the minibuffer , and it allows you to chain together multiple commands in powerful ways .
If icicles looks so good , why am I using ido and icomplete ?
It 's because they come with Emacs22 .
The bar is higher for third party packages because it's an added dependency .
I can't just tell a friend to put something into their .emacs ; I have to tell them to download it and add to their load - path and so on .
I wish there was a standard Emacs package system .
I do plan to try out icicles and other packages once I 've finished exploring the standard set of packages that comes with Emacs22 .
Update [ 2015 ] : I now use helm , even though it 's a third party dependency .
Since I wrote this post in 2007 , emacs added a package system so it 's much easier to try out third party packages .

Bush : ' Alpha Male on the Cruise Ship ' By Robert Parry
May 18 , 2006 W hen future historians scratch their heads and wonder how George W. Bush came to lead the worlds most powerful nation at the start of the Twenty - First Century , it might help them to know that many Americans found his type familiar  and thus reassuring .
Bush was the alpha male on the cruise ship .
He was like the wise - cracking guy leading a pack of vacationers out of the elevator toward the all - you - can - eat buffet bar , while poking fun at Charlie for getting too much sun on his bald head or at Mildred for putting on a few extra pounds .
The others in the group titter with nervous amusement , fearing their ribbing will come next .
Like that dominant male on the cruise ship , Bush exhibits a freedom to mock the appearance of almost anyone , holding up both American citizens and foreign leaders to public ridicule for how they look .
At a joint White House press conference May 16 with Australian Prime Minister John Howard , as the two men stood side by side , Bush slipped in a couple of zingers about Howards bald head and supposed homeliness .
Bush joshed ,  Somebody said ,  You and John Howard appear to be so close , dont you have any differences ? 
And I said , yes , he doesnt have any hair .
Getting a round of laughs from reporters , Bush moved on to his next joke :  That s what I like about John Howard ,  Bush said .
 He may not be the prettiest person on the block , but when he tells you something you can take it to the bank . 
Howard played the role of gracious guest , smiling and saying nothing in response to the disparaging comments about his physical appearance .
Though many men are very sensitive about losing their hair , Bush seems to find their baldness a source of humor , a way to put them in their place .
At a press conference on Aug. 24 , 2001 , Bush called on a Texas reporter who had covered Bush as Texas governor .
Bush said the young reporter was a fine lad , fine lad ,  drawing laughter from the national press corps .
The Texas reporter then began to ask his question ,  You talked about the need to maintain technological 
But Bush interrupted the reporter to deliver his punch line :  A little short on hair , but a fine lad .
Yeah .
As Bush joined in the snickering , the young reporter paused and acknowledged meekly ,  I am losing some hair . 
Bush exhibits other physical alpha - male tendencies , such as when he greets another man by cupping his hand behind the mans neck , a sign of both affection and control .
Bush also demonstrates whos boss by assigning goofy nicknames , often tied to a persons appearance .
Bush called two different tall , male reporters  Stretch  before eventually dubbing the taller one  Super Stretch . 
Tart Tongue
Over the years , Bush has regularly poked fun at the looks of both close friends and casual acquaintances .
While Texas governor , Bush lined up for one photo and fingered the man next to him .
 Hes the ugly one ! 
Bush laughed .
[ NYT , Aug. 22 , 1999 ]
Other times , Bush goes beyond playful banter and just tongue - lashes people who have gotten on his wrong side .
In 1986 , for instance , Bush spotted Wall Street Journal political writer Al Hunt and his wife Judy Woodruff having dinner at a Dallas restaurant with their four - year - old son .
Bush was steaming over Hunts prediction that Jack Kemp  not then - Vice President George H.W. Bush  would win the Republican presidential nomination in 1988 .
Bush stormed up to the table and cursed Hunt out .
 You [ expletive ] son of a bitch ,  Bush yelled .
 I saw what you wrote .
We re not going to forget this .
[ Washington Post , July 25 , 1999 ]
In one of Campaign 2000 s most memorable moments , Bush uttered an aside to his running mate Dick Cheney about New York Times reporter Adam Clymer .
 There 's Adam Clymer  major league asshole  from the New York Times ,  Bush said as he was waving to a campaign crowd from a stage in Naperville , Ill .
 Yeah , big time ,  responded Cheney .
Their voices were picked up on an open microphone .
Bush even seems to take pleasure from holding power over a persons life or death .
In an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson at the start of Campaign 2000 , Bush joked about how condemned murderer Carla Faye Tucker pleaded for her life with him as Texas governor .
 Please dont kill me ,  Bush whimpered through pursed lips in an imitation of the woman whom Bush put to death .
Later , during a presidential debate , Bush again made light of people facing the death penalty in Texas .
While arguing against the need for hate - crimes laws , Bush said the three men convicted of the racially motivated murder of James Byrd were already facing the death penalty .
 It s going to be hard to punish them any worse after they re put to death ,  Bush said , with an out - of - place smile across his face .
Beyond the inaccuracy of his statement  one of the three killers had received life imprisonment  there was that smirk again when discussing people on Death Row .
Quick Temper
Over the years , Bush has gained a reputation , too , for dressing down subordinates .
Former Bush speechwriter David Frum painted a generally flattering portrait of Bush in the 2003 book , The Right Man , but Frum acknowledged Bushs autocratic behavior and harsh humor .
Bush is impatient and quick to anger ; sometimes glib , even dogmatic ; often uncurious and as a result ill informed ,  Frum wrote .
When referring to environmentalists , Bush would call them green - green lima beans ,  according to Frum .
Bushs hot temper also has complicated U.S. foreign policy , including the tense relations with North Korea .
During a lectern - pounding tirade before Republican leaders in May 2002 , Bush insulted North Koreas diminutive dictator Kim Jong
Il by calling him a pygmy ,  Newsweek reported .
The slur quickly circulated around the globe .
While many Bush backers find his acid tongue and biting humor refreshing  the sign of a politically incorrect politician  some critics contend that Bushs off - handed insults fit with a dynastic sense of entitlement toward the presidency and toward those he rules .
Some observers of the Bush Family say George W. inherited this imperious style from his mother , Barbara , more than from his father , George H.W. Bush .
Mrs. Bush is known for flashes of prickly humor , such as describing Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 as a word that rhymes with rich . 
After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Mrs. Bush demonstrated a stunning lack of empathy for the disasters victims , many of whom had lost homes and family members .
While visiting New Orleans evacuees at the Houston Astrodome , she noted how poor they were before the flood and then quipped ,  this is working very well for them . 
By contrast , George H.W. Bush is generally gracious in social settings , though he has been known to hurl insults at his campaign opponents , such as calling Al Gore  Ozone - Man in 1992 or dismissing Gore and Bill Clinton as bozos . 
While always ready to deliver insults , the Bush family is famously thin - skinned about receiving them .
For instance , George H.W. Bush restricted Newsweeks coverage of his 1988 presidential campaign after the magazine published a cover photo of Bush with the headline ,  Fighting the Wimp Factor . 
His eldest son , George W. Bush , doesnt even want to take chances with unfriendly audiences .
He routinely has his advance teams and Secret Service details weed out people from his speeches who might be inclined to heckle him or ask hostile questions .
Indeed , between his pre-screened crowds and his layers of protectors , Bush has gone through five - plus - years as President with barely a single note - worthy incident of anyone challenging him to his face .
Unlike alpha males in the wild , Bush has managed to mark out his territory knowing that virtually nobody  not another head of state nor a private citizen  is in any position to contest his supremacy .

CBS : Female airman claims rape , ends up on trial herself David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 29 , 2007
Print This Email This CBS News reported Tuesday on a current case that calls into doubt the Air Force 's promise , after a scandal four years ago , of better treatment for alleged rape victims .
The case is that of Airman Cassandra Hernandez , who has stated that she was raped by three fellow airmen .
Hernandez gave an exclusive interview to CBS in which she admitted having drunk " a lot " at a party before accompanying three male colleagues to a dorm room .
She acknowledged that her memory of events is fuzzy , but said she definitely remembers saying " No " and trying to push the men away .
The three men allege that Hernandez started taking off her clothes and that the sex which followed was consensual .
A hearing was originally set on the rape charges , but after harsh pre-trial questioning , Hernandez decided not to testify .
At that point the Air Force brought lesser charges against all four airmen , citing Hernandez for underage drinking and " indecent acts . "
The three men accepted minor punishments , while Hernandez refused .
She is now facing a court - martial and could be jailed or expelled from the Air Force .
At the same time , the three men have been granted immunity in their testimony against her .
It is that outcome that has so alarmed advocates for rape victims and raised a concern that -- regardless of whether Hernandez is correct in her accusations -- the case will have a chilling effect in the future .
According to the Los Angeles Times , Hernandez ' attorneys have released a statement saying that " ' important , relevant evidence ' was denied them during discovery and that Hernandez decided not to plead to the same indecent - act charge as the three airmen because ' she was told that she was considered guilty unless she proved herself innocent . ' "
" The system failed Hernandez , " one of her attorneys told CBS .
The following video is from CBS 's Early Show , broadcast on August 28 .

Homo erectus had an unexpected neighbour , and a surprising lifestyle too .
Mine ’s bigger than yours : the size of H. erectus skulls differs widely National Museums of Kenya / F. Spoor and J. Reader .
Two fossils unearthed in Kenya have added a new dimension to our view of life at the birth of our Homo genus .
They show that two ancestral human species seem to have lived cheek - by - jowl in the same area , much as gorillas and chimpanzees do today .
Both skull fragments were found by anthropologists digging near Kenya 's Lake Turkana , adding to the impressive list of early human fossils unearthed here .
One of the fossils , an upper jawbone from the species Homo habilis , is dated at 1.44 million years , much younger than most fossils of this species .
The other fossil is an almost complete — but faceless — Homo erectus skull .
Dated at 1.55 million years , the skull is far smaller than any other from this species — suggesting to the researchers that , as is the case with modern gorillas , there was a large size differences between the sexes in H. erectus .
Walking abreast
The fact that these two species seem to have been contemporaries is a surprise to anthropologists , say Fred Spoor of University College London and his colleagues , who discovered the hominin fossils seven years ago and now describe them in this week 's Nature1 .
Anthropologists have tended to see the evolution of Homo species as a linear progression , beginning with H. habilis and passing through H. erectus before ending up with modern humans .
But it seems the path through time was broad enough for more than one species to walk abreast , with H. erectus and H. habilis living in the same place at the same time for as much as half a million years .
Spoor and his colleagues argue that this makes it less likely that H. erectus was a direct descendant of H. habilis , instead suggesting that there is a common ancestor yet to find .
The two species are thought to have lived side by side in much the same way as modern chimps and gorillas coexist in central regions of Africa — by adopting different habits and diets .
" To live in the same area for half a million years they must have found their own niches — different diets , maybe different migratory routes — to minimize competition , " says Spoor .
" When food is scarce , when there 's a drought or something , it becomes very important that you 're not in each other 's way . "
Harem of females
The new H. erectus skull also changes our ideas about the nature of this species .
" What is truly striking about this fossil is its size , " comments Spoor .
The fact that the skull — probably belong to a young adult — is so small suggests that the size range of H. erectus was much larger than we imagined .
The researchers infer from this that the males of H. erectus were much bigger than the females .
By comparison , there is a relatively slight difference seen between the sexes in our own species .
A greater inequality of size has implications for the way the creatures lived .
ADVERTISEMENT
H. erectus has always been viewed as similar to H. sapiens in both body shape and lifestyle .
Spoor points out that the new discovery suggests a family set - up more akin to that of modern gorillas in which dominant males mate with a harem of females .
" If we look at those primate species that have large sexual dimorphism , their groups usually involve one dominant male — the silverback if you 're talking about gorillas — multiple female mates , and then perhaps a few non -dominant males that hang around , just waiting for their chance , " Spoor says .
A similar set up is inferred from fossils of the earliest hominins , such as the australopithecines , but there has been a widespread assumption that sexes of more or less equal sizes arose when our ancestors ditched their more ape - like characteristics , evolving from Australopithecus into the more genteel Homo .
To find such a difference in H. erectus , Spoor says , " was quite a surprise , actually " .

From catastrophic sea level rise to jarring changes in local weather , humanity faces a potentially dangerous threat from the changes our own pollution has wrought on Earth ’s climate .
But since nothing in science can ever be proven with 100 percent certainty , how is it that scientists can be so sure that we are the cause of global warming ?
For years , there has been clear scientific consensus that Earth ’s climate is heating up and that humans are the culprits behind the trend , says Naomi Oreskes , a historian of science at the University of California , San Diego .
A few years ago , she evaluated 928 scientific papers that dealt with global climate change and found that none disagreed about human - generated global warming .
The results of her analysis were published in a 2004 essay in the journal Science .
And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the National Academy of Sciences and numerous other noted scientific organizations have issued statements that unequivocally endorse the idea of global warming and attribute it to human activities .
“ We ’re confident about what ’s going on , ” said climate scientist Gavin Schmidt of NASA ’s Goddard Institute of Space Science in New York .
But even if there is a consensus , how can scientists be so confident about a trend playing out over dozens of years in the grand scheme of the Earth 's existence ?
How do they know they did n’t miss something , or that there is not some other explanation for the world ’s warming ?
After all , there was once a scientific consensus that the Earth was flat .
How can scientists prove their position ?
Best predictor wins
Contrary to popular parlance , science can never truly “ prove ” a theory .
Science simply arrives at the best explanation of how the world works .
Global warming can no more be “ proven ” than the theory of continental drift , the theory of evolution or the concept that germs carry diseases .
“ All science is fallible , ” Oreskes told LiveScience .
“ Climate science should n’t be expected to stand up to some fantasy standard that no science can live up to . ”
Instead , a variety of methods and standards are used to evaluate the viability of different scientific explanations and theories .
One such standard is how well a theory predicts the outcome of an event , and climate change theory has proven to be a strong predictor .
The effects of putting massive amounts of carbon dioxide in the air were predicted as long ago as the early 20th century by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius .
Noted oceanographer Roger Revelle ’s 1957 predictions that carbon dioxide would build up in the atmosphere and cause noticeable changes by the year 2000 have been borne out by numerous studies , as has Princeton climatologist Suki Manabe ’s 1980 prediction that the Earth ’s poles would be first to see the effects of global warming .
Also in the 1980s , NASA climatologist James Hansen predicted with high accuracy what the global average temperature would be in 30 years time ( now the present day ) .
Hansen 's model predictions are “ a shining example of a successful prediction in climate science , ” said climatologist Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University .
Schmidt says that predictions by those who doubted global warming have failed to come true .
“ Why do n’t you trust a psychic ?
Because their predictions are wrong , ” he told LiveScience .
“ The credibility goes to the side that gets these predictions right . ”
Mounting evidence
Besides their successful predictions , climate scientists have been assembling a “ body of evidence that has been growing significantly with each year , ” Mann said .
Data from tree rings , ice cores and coral reefs taken with instrumental observations of air and ocean temperatures , sea ice melt and greenhouse gas concentrations have all emerged in support of climate change theory .
“ There are 20 different lines of evidence that the planet is warming , ” and the same goes for evidence that greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere , Schmidt said .
“ All of these things are very incontrovertible . ”
But skeptics have often raised the question of whether these observations and effects attributed to global warming may in fact be explained by natural variation or changes in solar radiation hitting the Earth .
Hurricane expert William Gray , of Colorado State University , told Discover magazine in a 2005 interview , " I 'm not disputing that there has been global warming .
There was a lot of global warming in the 1930s and ' 40s , and then there was a slight global cooling from the middle ' 40s to the early ' 70s .
And there has been warming since the middle ' 70s , especially in the last 10 years .
But this is natural , due to ocean circulation changes and other factors .
It is not human induced . ”
Isaac Newton had something to say about all this :
In his seminal “ Principia Mathematica , ” he noted that if separate data sets are best explained by one theory or idea , that explanation is most likely the true explanation .
And studies have overwhelmingly shown that climate change scenarios in which greenhouse gases emitted from human activities cause global warming best explain the observed changes in Earth ’s climate , Mann said — models that use only natural variation can’t account for the significant warming that has occurred in the last few decades .
Mythic ice age
One argument commonly used to cast doubt on the idea of global warming is the supposed predictions of an impending ice age by scientists in the 1970s .
One might say : First the Earth was supposed to be getting colder ; now scientists say it ’s getting hotter — how can we trust scientists if they ’re predictions are so wishy - washy ?
Because the first prediction was never actually made .
Rather , it ’s something of an urban climate myth .
Mann says that this myth started from a “ tiny grain of truth around which so much distortion and misinformation has been placed . ”
Scientists were well aware of the warming that could be caused by increasing greenhouse gases , both Mann and Schmidt explained , but in the decades preceding the 1970s , aerosols , or air pollution , had been steadily increasing .
These tiny particles tended to have a cooling effect in the atmosphere , and at the time , scientists were unsure who would win the climate - changing battle , aerosols or greenhouse gases .
“ It was unclear what direction the climate was going , ” Mann said .
But several popular media , such as Newsweek , ran articles that exaggerated what scientists had said about the potential of aerosols to cool the Earth .
But the battle is now over , and greenhouse gases have won .
“ Human society has made a clear decision as to which direction [ the climate ] is going to go , ” Mann said .
Future predictions
One of the remaining skeptics , is MIT meteorologist Richard Lindzen .
While he acknowledges the trends of rising temperatures and greenhouse gases , Lindzen expressed his doubt on man ’s culpability in the case and casts doubt on the dire predictions made by some climate models , in an April 2006 editorial for The Wall Street Journal .
“ What the public fails to grasp is that the claims neither constitute support for alarm nor establish man 's responsibility for the small amount of warming that has occurred , ” Lindzen wrote .
To be sure , there is a certain degree of uncertainty involved in modeling and predicting future changes in the climate , but “ you do n’t need to have a climate model to know that climate change is a problem , ” Oreskes said .
Climate scientists have clearly met the burden of proof with the mounting evidence they ’ve assembled and the strong predictive power of global warming theory , Oreskes said -- global warming is something to pay attention to .
Schmidt agrees .
“ All of these little things just reinforce the big picture , ” he said .
“ And the big picture is very worrying . ”
COLOMBO , Sri Lanka ( AP ) — Recent clashes between government forces and Tamil guerrillas in the northeast have killed at least 20 guerrillas and five government soldiers , the defense ministry said Thursday .
Government troops killed 10 fighters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on Wednesday in Trincomalee , 140 miles northeast of the capital , Colombo .
Two government soldiers also were killed .
Another major battle took place in Batticaloa , 70 miles south of Trincomalee .
Eight rebels and three soldiers were killed .

Things tables do better than CSS
There are certain things that CSS does not do as well as table layouts .
For instance , say you have a black side nav bar that you want to extend the whole height of your content .
With a table layout , this is a piece of cake : just give that < td > a black background .
We can do this with CSS , but it requires a different way of thinking .
If we give our nav div a black background , the black will only extend until the nav ' runs out ' .
On most pages , the content is longer than the navigation , so this is no good .
Instead we could tile a black GIF in our content div and give this div enough left padding , but if our navigation is longer than our content , this wo n't work either .
Another way to tackle it is to tile the black GIF on the background of our < body > , which is fine unless you want to use another image for the background of your < body > .
Or , we can wrap our content in a ' wrapper ' div and tile the image in that div .
However , this is adding non-semantic fluff to our markup .
And , of course tiling background images wo n't work at all if you want the width of your navigation to be fluid .
Like we said , there are things tables do better than CSS .
But in the end you need to ask yourself if all the baggage that comes with using tables for layout instead of data is worth it .
“ In another thirty years people will laugh at anyone who tries to invent a language without closures , just as they ’ll laugh now at anyone who tries to invent a language without recursion . ” — Mark Jason Dominus
You might be wondering what all of the talk about closures is about , really .
You might be scratching your head at the boring examples that just run a simple little counter inside a function .
You might be wondering how functional programming can be more fundamental than ( and even able to subsume ) object oriented programming .
You might be disappointed that Mark Jason Dominus has n’t gotten his book up on - line , yet .
You might be willing to settle for a quick dumb example in Common Lisp written by an average developer .
If any of the previous guesses are right , you came to the right place .
In this text file , you ’ll find a mere 16 13 lines of code that define a small chunk of OOP in Common Lisp .
The code should not only be understandable to beginners , but it was actually written by a beginner – so it should also hopefully give an indication of how easy it is to build “ new ” fundamental - ish programming concepts onto Common Lisp .
An “ obi , ” as I define it here , is somewhat like an object , but there are some key differences .
( I call my version of an object an “ obi ” because I ’m implementing just a very small piece of OOP . )
An “ obi ” is a hash table wrapped up in a closure .
The closure provides one of the main pillars of OOP : encapsulation .
Nothing in your program can mess with the variables inside of closure without interacting through the function call that the closure provides .
The hash table provides a place to store all of your properties and methods .
Because Lisp is dynamically typed and because functions are first - class objects , there ’s really no need to make a difference between properties and methods .
In an “ obi , ” functions are just one of the many information types that can be stored in the hash table .
In the example below , we see an obi being used from the REPL prompt .
Its color and shape properties are set and also a function called add is put in and called .
The “ . ” is used in Common Lisp to notate a dotted list , so I used ~ to represent “ get ” , ~ > to represent the create / set a property / method , and ~! is used to represent a call to an obi ’s function :
; SLIME : The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs
CL - USER > ( setf f ( create - obi ) )
#<COMPILED-CLOSURE CREATE-OBI-1 >
CL - USER > ( ~> f ‘ color ‘ red )
RED
CL - USER > ( ~> f ‘ shape ‘ square )
SQUARE
CL - USER > ( ~ f ‘ color )
RED
T
CL - USER > ( ~ f ‘ shape )
SQUARE
T
CL - USER > ( ~> f ‘ add #’+)
#<SYSTEM-FUNCTION +>
CL - USER > ( ~! f ‘add ‘ ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ) )
28
Obi ’s lack any form of “ type ” – in fact , you can add additional properties and methods to them at any time .
Even if you do n’t intend to use Common Lisp in a production application , this is an option that should be in your mental tool box .
You may not always need to resort to using inheritance or subclassing to create a variation of an object you defined .
If you think a little bit more functionally , you can abstract out the bulk of the design and then allow other developers to customize its use by setting or overriding some of the key functions .
Of course , in a wide - open typeless setting , that ’s a feature you get whether you think you want it or not !
For a much more elegant and substantive example of how to implement OOP in Common Lisp with an insanely small amount of code , see Paul Graham ’s Ansi Common Lisp .
PS If anyone knows how to trick WordPress into letting me display Lisp code without destroying the indenting , please let me know .
PPS Looking at the search engine traffic coming in here , I see that ( besides all of the people trying to figure out carriage returns in Emacs ) there are a few coming to the site for stuff like “ lisp closures , ” “ oop in lisp ” and “ lisp hash tutorial . ”
Hopefully this post will provide a little more substance for those folks than the previous drivel I ’ve spewed forth here in my clumsy efforts to get used to some of these new ideas .
PPPS
Please forgive the hyperbole in the title .

Militant Islam does not just appeal to the angry and the poor
There is a popular misperception that only the destitute or ill - educated are drawn to the ranks of militant Islamic organisations .
But nothing could be further from the known facts .
It is true that the appeal of political Islam - from the militant to the more moderate versions - is quite strong among the poor , because it promises a just and equitable society free from corruption and oppression .
But the leaders and the middle echelons of such groups are often well - educated middle class men .
The 19 young men behind the 9/11 attacks on Washington and New York six years ago were middle class university graduates or students .
Not to mention , of course , the leader of al - Qaeda himself , Osama Bin Laden , the son of a Saudi billionaire , and his second - in - command , Ayman al - Zawahiri , an Egyptian - trained doctor from a very well - known and respected middle class family in Cairo .
Many of the leaders of Palestinian Islamist groups , such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad , are either medical doctors , engineers or university professors .
And the oldest and most influential movement of political Islam , the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , whose doctrine is blamed for the mushrooming militant groups across the world , is largely an organisation of middle class professionals .
Islamic ' utopia '
Islamist groups are not only transnational in ambition , with members who do not recognise national boundaries , but they also have a wider appeal across the class barrier .
The lure of an Islamic utopia , where justice and virtue prevail according to a puritanical version of Islam , is too strong to resist for rich and poor alike .
For some it is an end that justifies any means .
Some believe that their ' Islamic utopia ' is not only an answer to the problems of their own societies , but for the entire world
It is particularly attractive for young idealists who want to make the world a better place .
While far - left groups during the 1960s and 70s ( such as Bader - Meinhof in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy ) justified violence on the grounds they were battling an evil capitalist order , young Islamist militants feel justified in their jihad against what they see as an immoral and oppressive world order .
The lawyers , the engineers , the doctors and the students who once led the struggle for national liberation against colonial powers are again the standard - bearers of a movement that claims to have a cure for all the ills of their societies .
However , some Islamists are more ambitious and believe that their " Islamic utopia " is not only an answer to the problems of their own societies , but for the entire world , including the " decadent West " .
Ironically , their global ambition has become all the more visible because of the very global forces they wish to vanquish , including of course America 's global " war on terror " .

When the Brazilian government failed to defend his tribe against loggers and miners , the leader found a high - tech ally 1 / 7 Back to Gallery
The journey from the September 7th Reserve deep in Brazil 's Amazon forest includes a two - hour , four - wheel - drive jeep trip on a bumpy dirt road , a 10 - hour bus ride and 14 hours on three airplane flights .
But Amazon Chief Almir Surui knew it was the first step in his struggle to forge an alliance he hopes will save his 1,200 - member tribe .
Almir says loggers and miners have already killed 11 Surui chiefs -- Surui is both the common surname and name of the tribe -- who tried to prevent them from entering their lands over the past five years , and he says Brazilian government officials have failed to stop the violence .
So the 32 - year - old indigenous leader , a stocky man who often dons a headdress made from feathers of Amazonian birds , opted for another route -- an appeal to Google .
During his visit to the Bay Area late last month , Almir , the first Surui to graduate from college , asked the folks at Google Earth for high - quality satellite imagery that would allow the tribe to monitor loggers and miners , who have no legal right to operate on the tribe 's 600,000 - acre reserve about 1,600 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro .
His plea fell on receptive ears with company officials in Mountain View , who are now at work on a plan to let the Surui use Google 's technology to raise awareness of their plight by working with satellite providers to vastly improve image resolution .
" The Amazon rain forest and its indigenous peoples are disappearing rapidly , which has serious consequences both locally and globally , " said Google Earth spokeswoman Megan Quinn .
" This project can raise global awareness of the Surui people 's struggle to preserve their land and culture by reaching more than 200 million Google Earth users around the world . "
This is not the first time Google Earth has helped environmental or humanitarian causes .
Last year , the Mountain View company joined with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to map out destroyed villages in Darfur , with the Jane Goodall Institute to follow chimpanzees in Tanzania , and with the U.N. Environment Program to illustrate 100 areas around the world that have been severely deforested .
In the case of the Amazon , Almir says improved satellite images would not only keep tabs on loggers and miners but would also help strengthen Surui culture by cataloging medicinal plants , hunting grounds , ancestral cemeteries and sacred sites .
" We want people to know that these territories are not just empty swaths of green as seen by satellite , but the homes , supermarkets , museums , libraries of a people who depend on these areas for their survival , " said Vasco van Roosmalen , Brazil director for Amazon Conservation Team , an Arlington , Va. , organization that provided the tribe 's 22 villages with laptop computers , handheld Global Positioning System devices and satellite maps .
Brazilian officials " are sensitive about their image regarding illegal loggers , " van Roosmalen said , " and are increasingly aware the world is watching . "
Large - scale incursions into the country 's tribal territories began in the 1970s soon after the completion of the 2,000 - mile Trans - Amazon Highway .
Indian tribes found themselves battling road builders , ranchers , farmers , loggers and miners .
Partly as a result , Brazil 's indigenous population has declined from an estimated 4 million before the first Europeans landed to about 700,000 today .
An estimated 400,000 live in Amazon reserves .
About 20 percent of the rain forest has been cut down .
In 1988 , a new Brazilian constitution guaranteed indigenous tribes the right to live on their ancestral lands .
Almost 600 reserves were established , encompassing 12.5 percent of Brazil 's territory .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has added four new reserves since taking office in 2003 .
Yet many of these areas exist only on paper , activists say , partly because Brazil 's environmental agency has just one forest ranger for every 650 square miles at its 278 federal preserves .
The country 's Indian Affairs Bureau has " acknowledged a lack of resources to protect indigenous lands from encroachment ... depends on the understaffed and poorly equipped federal police for law enforcement on indigenous lands , " according to the U.S. Department of State 's 2006 human rights report .
As a result , between 60 and 80 percent of all logging in the Amazon is illegal , environmentalists say .
Illegal loggers , hungry for the tribe 's mahogany and other valuable hardwoods , are not happy with Almir 's campaign .
On a recent 10 - day U.S. tour , Almir asked the Organization of American States to provide him with protection after receiving several death threats and being told that loggers had offered $ 100,000 to two Surui youths to kill him .
Brasilia has yet to make good on a promise to send him bodyguards , Almir says .
" I am not Chico Mendes , " he said , referring to the Amazon rubber tapper leader and environmental activist who was killed by ranchers in 1988 .
" I do n't want to be a hero .
I am afraid , but that wo n't stop me from going home to fight for what I believe in . "
In past years , Almir challenged the World Bank when its funds destined for indigenous groups did n't arrive .
He sued the state of Rondonia after it failed to provide the tribe such basic services as water wells and health clinics .
He has also encouraged the Surui to export crops such as coffee , Brazil nuts and acai , the latter an Amazon berry rich in nutrients that has become a favorite staple at such U.S. outlets as Jamba Juice .
" I am not against using the forest to make a living , " he said .
" But the environment must be respected in a sustainable and harmonious way . "
Almir fears some Surui chiefs will succumb , as they have in the past , to huge bribes offered by loggers .
" Our plan wo n't provide money tomorrow , " he said .
" I am very worried that when the rains stop , loggers will come and offer money , money , money . "
Google officials say they hope their alliance with the tech - savvy Almir is the start of something entirely new in the Amazon .
" We are starting with Chief Almir ... because his tribe is the most advanced in their mapping skills and in their vision for positive use of technology , " said Google Earth 's Quinn .
" We hope this project will inspire other Amazon tribes . "
PBS documentary
Chief Almir Surui will be featured in " Children of the Amazon . "
The film , by Berkeley resident Denise Zmekhol , will air on PBS sometime next year .
Paying taxes feels good , say researchers .
The surprising discovery , based on brain scans , can also predict which people are most likely to donate cash to charity .
Bill Harbaugh at the University of Oregon in Eugene , US , and colleagues gave 19 female university students $ 100 , and told them some of this money would have to go towards taxes .
Each volunteer then read a series of 60 separate taxation scenarios involving $ 0 to $ 45 in taxes , knowing that one of the scenarios would be selected at random and the related amount be subtracted from their $ 100 .

Secret pleasure
As the participants viewed the tax scenarios , their brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
Surprisingly , whenever the students read the taxation scenarios , scientists saw a spike in activity within two of the brain ’s reward centres – the nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus .
Harbaugh says that people probably like paying taxes more than they admit .
He believes the results of his new study help explain the widespread compliance with tax laws .
“ We like to complain about it , but based on what we do , we are not as opposed to it as we like to say , ” Harbaugh says .
Economist Robert Frank of Cornell University comments that tax - paying might stimulate positive feelings in the brain because the process helps equalise the burden of helping others .
Harbaugh then repeated the experiment , but instead of the money being given in taxation , the scenarios related to charity donations , and the participants could choose to give their money .
Bigger boost
These brain scans suggest that donating money creates an even greater boost in brain reward centres than paying mandatory taxes .
Harbaugh explains this bigger boost has to do with the fact that voluntary donations are a personal choice : “ You feel better because it was your agency that made the difference .
Usually , when you are giving , people are watching , ” he says , which can be an ego boost .
Harbaugh was also able to predict a person ’s generosity based on their brain response to paying tax .
The 10 subjects who showed the greatest brain activity in response to hypothetical taxes in the first part of the study later chose to donate money twice as often as the other nine subjects .
At the end of the experiment , those whose brains responded more positively to tax - paying generally gave about $ 17 to charity , while the other nine subjects gave $ 10 , on average .

If you think that the idea of a morning person or an evening person is nonsense , then postgraduate student Martin Sale and his colleagues from the University of Adelaide have news for you .
They have found that the time of day influences your brain ’s ability to learn — and the human brain learns more effectively in the evening .
And by identifying at what point in the day the brain is best able to operate , rehabilitation therapy can be targeted to that time , when recovery is maximised .
“ Our research has several future applications , ” Mr Sale says .
“ If the brains of stroke patients can be artificially stimulated to improve learning , they may be able to recover better and faster . ”
The researchers used a magnetic coil over the head to stimulate nerve activity in the brain , and linked it to an electrical stimulus of the hand .
Mr Sale , from the School of Molecular and Biomedical Science at the University of Adelaide , discovered that the brain ’s capacity to control hand movements is influenced by the time of day .
His study found that larger changes are induced when the experiments are performed in the evening , as compared with mornings .
“ Such time - of - day variations in function are not unusual .
Organisms are adapted to the continual change in light and dark during a 24 hour period to avoid predators and to reproduce faster , ” he says .
“ For example , the petals of many flowers only open during the day , while some organisms only reproduce at night .
In humans , these rhythms are governed by a variety of hormones that control many bodily functions . ”

Nugent defends right to threaten Democrats during his concerts David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 30 , 2007
Print This Email This Rocker not so forgiving when ' threats ' were directed other way Rocker Ted Nugent said trying to explain his fantasies of executing prominent Democrats that he aired in the middle of a recent show would be " like trying to explain an orgasm to a eunuch . "
In an interview on the O'Reilly Factor Wednesday night , Nugent was criticized over video from a recent concert during which he encouraged Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to " suck on my machine gun " and referred to Senator Hillary Clinton as a " worthless bitch . "
" Rock and roll is too much fun .
...
Trying to explain the intensity of irreverent , over - the - top rock and roll is like trying to explain an orgasm to a eunuch , " Nugent said when asked why he launched such personal attacks .
" If some people do n't get it , I 'm not here to help them through the quagmire . "
However , the conservative rocker was not so forgiving when " threats " were directed his way .
In an appearance on Fox News 's Hannity and Colmes earlier this summer , Nugent criticized a liberal blogger who joked of plans to " shoot " him and Rush Limbaugh .
" This guy is obviously a nutcase , but he 's actually making a statement to assassinate fellow Americans , " Nugent said at the time .
The avid hunter and gun advocate said he felt like his life was threatened , and " my family is taking it very seriously . "
The offending quote from the blog said , " I 've got dibs on Rush , as soon as it's legal and lawful to shoot him .
Whoever wants Ted Nugent is welcome to him . "
" They 've threatened to kill me , " Nugent said , referring to what he said were previous attempts on his life .
" We got the files with law enforcement .
This guy is obviously a nut case .
But he is actually making a statement to assassinate fellow Americans .
In his concert rant , Nugent did not explicitly say he wanted to " shoot " Obama or Clinton , but it remains unclear whether the Secret Service could interpret his invitations to " suck " or " ride " his machine guns as a threat on the candidates ' lives .
Nugent said he keeps his events " PG - 13 " at family events like state and county fairs , and he boasted that shows on his latest tour have been selling out across the country .
But he defended his right to say anything at shows not meant for children .
" At an outrageous , over - the - top , rock & roll event like the House of Blues ... as long as no laws are broken and no one gets hurt , nothing is sacred , " Nugent said .
The video of Nugent 's Obama rant comes from an Aug. 23 performance at a casino in Oroville , CA .
It was first posted online by YouTube user KEVDOGEDOG .
Nugent , a Michigan native who is considering a run for that state 's governor , dismissed suggestions that his comments were overly personal and inappropriate .
" To try to make a comment in a meaningful , sincere way from the rock & roll stage is really apples and grenades , " Nugent said .
" ... ( Comedian ) Sam Kinison did n't really believe in sex with a Volkswagen Beetle .
We 're talking about staged outrage . "

It ’s summertime and the Carnies are out in full force .
In the 30 mile radius around my house , there has to be at least 4 Ferris wheels begging kids to entice their parents to come in and blow $ 100 trying to win a $ 2 stuffed animal .
Tonight , I decided that enough was enough .
I am sharing information given to me by a game operator at a Carnival in Rosemont , IL .
Their carnival was up about a month ago .
Here is how you can beat a few of those popular Carnival schemes :
The Ladder Game : I have easily dropped $ 100 on this game over the last 2 years .
The trick to beating this game is to avoid touching the rungs of the ladder .
Your hands and feet should ALWAYS be on the rope .
The rungs provide a false sense of security and in reality , they throw off the balance of the ladder .
Just be sure to apply an equal amount of weight to each side .
This is still a damn tough trick but this will indeed help .
I did it 3 times in a row at a carnival and then I was asked to leave the game .
The ole machine gun shooting a star :
This game is pretty much BS but we all want to be Rambo right ?
The ONLY way to ever beat this game is if you shoot a complete circle around the star .
Most people try to start at the center and move out because by nature , hitting the center means you have good aim ( darts , etc . ) .
In this game , you can forget that .
You simply do n’t have enough pellets to hit the middle and move out .
Basketball Shot :
Come on , we all know that rim is tight and the backboard is made of pure steel .
The key here is is to , like Jordan , hit nothing but net .
A bank shot off the backboard will generally rebound crazily because of its composition .
NOW .. you have to know that the rim on these is anywhere from .5 ″ to 1 ″ narrower than a regulation NBA rim so you better do a little King James and hit it .
If not , you ’re cooked .
Dart games :
If you have your own darts like I do , bring them .
Most Carnies will let you use them .
If not , just throw the dart towards the middle of the board and use an arc .
Do n’t aim because Carnie darts are seriously designed to fade fast , meaning they will plummet .
Aim high and let ‘ er rip !.
Those are the tips provided straight from a game operator at a carnival .
If you guys happen to have more info , let loose in the comments .

Those suffering from advanced stages of macular degeneration may by the end of this year be able to halt and even reverse vision loss caused by the age - related eye disease .
If , that is , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) gives ophthalmologists the green light to implant new miniature telescopelike devices in patients ' damaged eyes .
The optical prosthetics , tiny enough to be balanced on a fingertip , dramatically improved the vision of about two thirds of the 206 patients studied in a 24 - month clinical trial , according to a new study published in Archives of Ophthalmology .
" This is a good device and it offers hope for people with no other options , " says lead author Kathryn Colby , an ophthalmologist and director of the Joint Clinical Research Center at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston .
There is no known treatment to correct macular degeneration ; until now physicians have focused on trying to reduce the risk of the disease and keep it in check with laser treatment , eyewear with special magnifying capabilities , and nutritional supplements including antioxidants and zinc .
Age - related macular degeneration affects more than 1.75 million Americans , a number projected to climb to almost three million by 2020 thanks to the country 's rapidly aging population , according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health 's National Eye Institute .
Macular degeneration is a disorder of the central retina , or macula , that causes the afflicted person to see a dark spot in the center of his or her field of vision , impairing the ability to read , recognize faces and watch TV .
The implantable mini-scope , developed by Saratoga , Calif . - based VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies , works with the eye 's cornea like a telephoto system , rendering an enlarged retinal image designed to reduce the area of diminished vision .
Once implanted , the device protrudes 0.1 to 0.5 millimeter beyond the surface of the pupil but does not touch the corneal endothelium , a layer of cells lining the back of the cornea .
This is not an easy fix , however , and surgeons are developing special techniques to properly and swiftly implant the device without damaging the eye .
The device is a compound telescope system that consists of a glass cylinder that is 4.4 millimeters in length and 3.6 millimeters in diameter and houses wide - angle micro-optics .
The cylinder fits into a one - piece polymethylmethacrylate case with two rigid polymethylmethacrylate haptics that protrude like tiny arms and hold the device in place behind the eyeball 's natural lens .
Polymethylmethacrylate is a clear plastic that is traditionally used as a shatterproof replacement for glass in places such as hockey rinks and large aquariums .
The tiny telescope is virtually undetectable because it is implanted inside the eye , and mostly covered by the iris , the colored portion of the eye .
During a 24 - month clinical trial , Colby ( and fellow ophthalmologists David Chang of the University of California , San Francisco , Doyle Stulting of Emory University 's Eye Center in Atlanta , and Stephen S. Lane of Associated Eye Care in Stillwater , Minn . ) developed and tested a preferred technique for implanting the device to most effectively treat bilateral end - stage macular degeneration , which most commonly afflicts people over the age of 55 .
The device can treat either form of age - related macular degeneration : the dry stage , where the delicate tissues of the macula become thinned and slowly lose function , or the less common wet stage that 's caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels behind the macula .
The 206 patients in the study shared a number of characteristics , including stable , untreatable , age - related macular degeneration in both eyes with visual acuity no better than 20 /80 but no worse than 20/800 , along with good peripheral vision .
A year after the trial was completed , 90 percent of patients were able to see two lines better on a reading chart , and 67 percent were able to see three lines better , which is the equivalent of doubling their vision , says Chet Kumar , VisionCare 's director of business and market development .
Although implantable miniature telescopes are not a cure for macular degeneration , " FDA approval ( of VisionCare 's technology ) will take a very desperate group of people and give them some hope , " says Lane , a principal investigator at Associated Eye Care , who implanted six devices during VisionCare 's Phase I trial .
Researchers are hopeful that implantable miniature telescopes will usher in successful treatment for patients with age - related macular degeneration .
" We are waiting for the FDA to approve the device , '' Colby says , " so we can begin placing the device . "

The White House promptly accused the Democratic - led Congress of looking for a fight and failing to understand separation of federal powers .
“ The committee is rejecting accommodation because they prefer just the kind of political spectacle , ” said spokesman Tony Fratto .
On a party - line vote of 7 - 5 , a House of Representatives Judiciary subcommittee rejected the contention that Bush ’s claim of executive privilege allowed Miers ’ not to attend its hearing or testify on what she knows about fired prosecutors .
“ I hereby rule that those claims are not legally valid , and that Ms. Miers is required pursuant to the subpoena to be here now and to produce documents and answer questions , ” said subcommittee Chairwoman Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat .
After her panel adopted the ruling , Sanchez said , “ This subcommittee and the full committee will take under advisement what next steps are warranted . ”
Internal documents show Miers was involved in a plan that originated at the White House and stretched to the Justice Department that led to the dismissal last year of nine of the nation ’s 93 U.S. attorneys .

Despite administration claims to the contrary , critics charge the ousters seemed politically motivated , perhaps to even influence probes of Democratic or Republican lawmakers .
Unless the White House reaches a compromise with lawmakers , the House Judiciary Committee could vote to hold Miers in contempt of Congress .
If the full House of Representatives concurs , the case would be referred to a U.S. attorney to seek a grand jury indictment .
Bush has offered to allow Miers and other current and former White House aides to talk to lawmakers , but only behind closed doors , without a transcript and not under oath .
Democrats have rejected it , but have pushed for compromise since a court fight could stretch beyond Bush ’s second term , which ends in January 2009 .
Miers finds herself in the middle of this battle two years after the president withdrew his nomination of her to the U.S. Supreme Court following opposition from fellow conservatives .
Miers refused to attend the House hearing under orders from Bush a day after another former White House aide , Sara Taylor , testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in its investigation of the fired prosecutors .
But at Bush ’s direction , Taylor refused to answer a number of questions about the firings .
Bush and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have said the dismissals were justified , but mishandled .
With the support of Bush , Gonzales has rejected bipartisan calls to resign .
Rep. Chris Cannon , a Utah Republican , said unless Democrats produced evidence of wrongdoing , “ It is time for the majority to stop swaggering its power in this Congress , to clothe itself in prudence and to back off this pointless constitutional showdown . ”
May 3 , 2007 has been awarded the title " Super Thursday " in the United Kingdom as voters in England , Scotland and Wales go to the polls in a series of national and local elections .
While it is widely expected that the voting in local elections in England will be used to give outgoing Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labour party a bloody nose , and with the campaign for the Welsh assembly unlikely to cause too many surprises , most of the interest will focus on Scotland .
Outside of Scotland , the vote to choose councilors for all the country 's 32 local authorities will barely make any impact but the potential shockwaves from the election for the Scottish Parliament could reverberate around Europe .
The manifestos of the eight contesting parties naturally focus on domestic Scottish issues but the biggest topic -- that of Scottish independence -- has wider implications for the United Kingdom and beyond .
Out of the eight contesting parties , only the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) , the Scottish Socialist Party ( SSP ) and the Solidarity party have made the election promise of a referendum on Scottish independence should they get elected to the Holyrood parliament .
According to recent polls , Scotland is on the cusp of a potentially historic shift in power .
The most telling survey results point to an end to the Labour Party ’s 50 - year dominance of Scottish politics with forecasts showing the SNP set to win 50 of the 129 parliamentary seats , seven more than Labour , as dissatisfied Labour supporters turn to the most palatable alternative .
End of 300 - year marriage
Will the Union be cast asunder by Scottish nationalists ?
However , while an SNP success would be a huge step towards ending the marriage between England and Scotland which was set up 300 years ago , it would not necessarily lead to the creation of an independent Scotland .
Proportional representation makes it nearly impossible to win an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament .
So even if the SNP emerges with the most votes , it will be hard to find coalition partners favoring an independence referendum .
The three mainstream parties -- Labour , the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats -- have all left the independence issue out of their manifestos .
In addition , public opinion has recently ebbed on the topic .
A survey late last year showed that a slight majority was in favor .
Now , only about 27 percent of Scottish voters want to dissolve the union .
The SNP promises to give the people the chance to vote on independence after three years of national governance , meaning that if it is successful in Thursday ’s parliamentary elections , the SNP would put the question to the country in 2010 .
An expanded EU role for Scotland
SNP leader Alex Salmond has a European vision
Ahead of such a referendum , the SNP would have to address the concerns of those who reject the idea of independence .
It is likely that it would do so by offsetting the fears over a loss of financial and political support from England with a vision of an expanded role -- and increased prosperity -- within the European Union .
Scotland , as a part of the United Kingdom , is already a member of the European Union and the SNP believes that this would continue to be the case if independence from the rest of the UK was achieved .
However , Atsuko Ichijo , an expert on Scottish nationalism at Kingston University , London , believes that the situation could be much more complicated than that .
" The SNP 's position is that , because Scotland is part of the EU already as a constituent part of the UK , when Scotland becomes independent both Scotland and the rest of the UK will inherit the UK membership and ' share ' it between them , " Ichijo told DW - WORLD .DE .
However , she added , the European Commission has raised questions about this assumption .
There are a number of constitutional difficulties the EU would face if it allowed Scotland to " inherit " membership in the bloc under UK membership .
" The fact of the matter is , there is no precedent in which a member state has split into smaller units with each demanding to continue EU membership , " she said .
" I do not think there is any definitive answer to the question of what form independent Scottish membership of the EU would take . "
EU states concerned over Scottish plans
The Basques would welcome Scottish independence
Should Scotland become independent and join the EU as a separate state from the rest of the UK , it could encourage other independence movements campaigning for autonomy within Europe .
It could also anger countries like Spain who play unwilling hosts to strong independence movements and who would fear the precedent a breakaway Scotland would set , such as the Catalans and Basques in Spain , the Flemish in Belgium and the people of northern Cyprus .
" They would welcome the Scottish precedent because that would make it easier for them to do the same .
Also it would have an impact on the debate on ' reconfigured sovereignty ' or ' post- national sovereignty ' , which would most likely be exploited by other independence / autonomist movements across Europe and beyond , " Ichijo said .
In addition to increasing the pressure on countries with strong independence movements , a Scottish succession could also provide a headache for the European Union itself if it led to a sudden increase in entities achieving autonomy within the bloc .
" It would certainly cause a lot of practical problems for the EU , especially in the areas of membership votes and the distribution of votes at the European Council and European Parliament , " said Ichijo .
" At a more abstract level , there would inevitably have to be a complete rethink about the whole constitutional nature of the EU . "
Dr Hwang went from national hero to national disgrace
South Korean Woo Suk
Hwang became famous after claiming to have extracted the world 's first stem cells from a cloned embryo .
It emerged he had lied about his work , and the source of the cells .
But analysis in the journal Cell Stem Cell reveals he may have produced stem cells from human eggs alone - potentially even more useful .
I 've always promoted the idea that efforts should be made to produce embryos from human eggs
Professor Azim Surani , Cambridge University
The Hwang episode , uncovered in 2005 , is one of the most notorious scientific scandals of recent times .
His work at Seoul National University earned him the status of national hero , and even led to his face appearing on a set of commemorative stamps .
Unethical eggs
Hwang said that he had created cloned human embryos by placing the nucleus from the cell to be cloned into a " hollowed out " human egg , then managed to extract stem cells from the resulting embryos .
Scientists are excited about the potential of stem cells because they are the body 's " master cells " , with the potential to become any cell type in the body , perhaps replacing those lost through ageing or disease .
However , it later became clear that he had used eggs from young female researchers at his laboratory to create the embryos , itself a major ethical breach - and that the resulting stem cells did not come from cloned embryos .
With his research discredited , he was dismissed from his post at the university , and charged with fraud and embezzlement .
The latest twist came from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in the US , who looked closely at his data , and found the cells were actually from a different type of embryo .
' Virgin birth '
Researchers said that the distinct " genetic fingerprint " of the stem cells means they may be the first in the world to be extracted from embryos produced by the so - called " virgin birth " method , or parthenogenesis .
This happens when eggs are stimulated into becoming embryos without ever being fertilised by sperm , and has been achieved in animals .
However , before Hwang , no one had managed to produce a human embryo using parthenogenesis which lived long enough to allow the extraction of viable stem cells .
Dr George Daley , who led the analysis , told the BBC's Science In Action programme : " Unfortunately at the time they published their work they did not know what they had done so they had mistakenly isolated these parthenogenic embryonic stem cells , and yet misrepresented them as true clones .
" In fact they had produced the world 's first patient - specific embryonic stem cell , and that is very valuable .
" Scientists interested in modelling complex diseases would like to be able to move a patient 's own cells into a petri dish in their embryonic form . "
' More useful '
Professor Azim Surani , from the University of Cambridge , has carried out years of experiments to produce parthenogenetic stem cells from mice .
He said Hwang had probably inadvertently stimulated the human eggs to begin dividing while trying to produce cloned embryos .
Professor Surani said Hwang 's unwitting step forward might actually prove more useful than efforts to clone human embryos , which he had claimed fraudulently .
" I 've always promoted the idea that efforts should be made to produce embryos from human eggs - it is far less ethically challenging , and the efficiency of these cell lines is likely to be higher than those produced from cloned embryos , " he said .
However , scientists do not know how significant the lack of contribution from the father 's DNA will be .

WASHINGTON , Aug. 16 ( AP ) —
Ninety - nine soldiers killed themselves last year , the highest suicide rate in the Army in 26 years of record - keeping , a new report says .
Nearly a third of the soldiers committed suicide while in Iraq or Afghanistan , according to a report released Thursday , which said 27 deaths were in Iraq and 3 in Afghanistan .
The report said that the 99 confirmed suicides by active - duty soldiers compared with 87 in 2005 and that it was the highest raw number since 102 suicides were reported in 1991 , the year of the Persian Gulf War .
Investigations are pending on two other deaths .
Officials reported 948 suicide attempts , but there were no comparisons for previous years .

Whitesnake 's hits include Here I Go Again and Is This Love
Writing on his website , the Whitesnake singer said the bear broke into a guest bedroom on Wednesday morning .
Coverdale , 55 , recounted how he ran at the animal with an air horn canister and scared him into the garden .
The British singer , formerly of Deep Purple , said bear attacks had become a " daily worry " and that authorities had warned he may have to move out .
His first face - to - face encounter with a bear came in July , as he was " rinsing a cup or two at the kitchen sink " .
For some reason , I do n't think these guys care for rock
David Coverdale
The singer said he could feel the animal 's breath on his hand as he closed the kitchen window , before he " ran around " the house to make sure all the other entrances and exits were secure .
" I 'd like to think it was the smell of my fab cooking that seduced him , " said Coverdale , " but it was only a slightly charred bagel ! "
Bear trap
Black bears have increasingly become urbanised
The animal also took the opportunity to swim in the singer 's pool .
" We now have a big bear trap in the garden , " said Coverdale .
" For some reason , I do n't think these guys care for rock ! "
The Lake Tahoe area , on the border of California and Nevada , is experiencing a rise in bear home invasions .
The animals , which can weigh as much as 400 lb ( 180kg ) , have become less wary of humans after years of being fed and finding scraps in dustbins .
Authorities in the area say a drought last winter has exacerbated the problem , with bears coming down from higher ground to search for water .
Whitesnake scored a string of hits in the 1980s with songs like Here I Go Again and Is This Love .
On Sunday , Aug. 19 , the Peace Coalition of Monterey County held a public meeting at the Unitarian Universalist Church in Monterey , Calif .
The main topic of discussion was Iran .
My local chapter of Libertarians for Peace is a member of the Coalition , and so I had volunteered to speak at the event , to tell what I know about Iran ’s history and economics .
The other speaker was Paola Gilbert , an English professor at Monterey Peninsula College .
What follows is the talk I gave , plus some highlights from Professor Gilbert ’s talk .
As was mentioned in my introduction , I ’m a member of the local chapter of Libertarians for Peace .
I ’m also an economics professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and a research fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford .
I also write a regular column on www.Antiwar.com.
I want to make five points , starting with the issue on which I ’m least expert and continuing in order of my expertise .
But the overarching point I want to make is that the way governments get more power over us is to scare us , to make us afraid of various things .
Governments run by Democrats have things they want us to be afraid of so that we will support their policies .
Governments run by Republicans try to make us afraid of other things so that we will support them and their policies .
The Iranian government tries to make people afraid so that people will support its policies .
Governments around the world do that .
Now , of course there are some things we should be afraid of .
I ’m afraid of jumping off cliffs , for example .
And there are some things that government warns us about that we should fear .
But how afraid should we be ?
And , since the topic today is Iran , how afraid should Americans be that the Iranian government will harm them ?
My answer is " not very . "
That brings me to my first point .
One of the things that some people in the U.S. have used to make us afraid is the famous quote from Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad about " wiping Israel off the map . "
Here ’s the problem : from what I can tell , he never said that .
I have no expertise in Farsi , and so I could be wrong here .
But one expert in Farsi , Arash Norouzi , wrote an article on the Web on January 18 , 2007 , laying out what Ahmadinejad did and did not say .
With my 10 - minute time limit , I do n’t want to go into it in much detail , but I do want to highlight one word that Ahmadinejad used in his famous quote : " rezhim-e . "
What does that sound like to you ?
[ Members of the audience answered " regime . " ]
Right .
So what he was saying was that the Zionist regime should be eliminated .
This is not at all the same as proposing that a country be wiped out .
Democrats want the Bush " regime " eliminated , and Republicans wanted Bill Clinton ’s " regime " eliminated .
I should add that al - Jazeera itself quoted Ahmadinejad as saying that Israel should be wiped off the map .
This has less credibility than appears , though , because al - Jazeera is Arabic and has no special expertise in Farsi either .
Moreover , the Arabs and the Iranians in the Middle East have often been at odds , and it is plausible that al - Jazeera , funded by the government of Qatar , was trying to portray Iran in a bad light .
The second point I want to make is that one cannot understand Iranians and how they think about the world without understanding the important role in their lives of the 1980 - 88 war between Iran and Iraq .
A minimum estimate of Iranian lives lost in that war is 300,000 .
By the time the war had ended , Iran ’s population was 60 million  meaning that Iran had lost about one half of 1 percent of its population .
To put that in an American context , consider how many American lives were lost in the Vietnam war : approximately 58,000 .
In 1970 , by which time most of the U.S. deaths had occurred , the U.S. population was about 200 million .
Had we lost the same one half of 1 percent , our war deaths would have been a staggering 1 million .
This is 17 times the number actually killed and 2.5 times the number of U.S. lives lost during World War II .
My third point is about war for oil : given the amount of oil we in America consume and the large percentage of our consumption we import , is there a case for making war to obtain oil ?
My answer is no .
I actually answered this question in an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal in August 1990 , before the first Gulf War .
When Americans over age 40 think about governments in other countries reducing the supply of oil , they tend to think of line - ups for gasoline .
But no foreign government , no matter how powerful , can make us line up for gasoline .
Only our government can do that , by imposing price controls on gasoline that prevent the price from rising to the point where the amount demanded equals the amount supplied .
Result : shortages and line - ups .
Our line - ups in the early 1970s were due to the price controls on the U.S. economy that Richard Nixon had imposed on Aug. 15 , 1971 .
And the line - ups in the late 1970s were due to the fact that the price controls on oil and gasoline were retained until Ronald Reagan eliminated them .
But could n’t governments of oil - producing countries make us worse off by cutting off oil to the United States ?
Not really .
Imagine that Venezuela , which ships oil to us , decides to cut its shipments , with the purpose of hurting U.S. consumers .
But if Venezuela wants to maintain its output , it has to find new buyers for this freed - up oil .
So it does .
Then the producers that some of those new buyers had been purchasing from will have freed - up oil to sell to  guess who ?
 people in the United States .
So it ’s like a game of musical chairs , where the number of people equals the number of chairs .
It makes for a boring game , but when it comes to oil supply and international trade , boring is good .
In fact , it ’s even easier than I ’ve suggested to avoid being the victim of a selective embargo .
Oil is traded internationally , and the ownership of a tanker of oil changes multiple times as it crosses the ocean .
So , whomever a particular government sells its oil to is not necessarily the same entity as who ends up with the oil .
My fourth point is that Iranians have some reason to fear the United States , based on past history .
One reason many Iranians hated the U.S. government was that , in 1953 , the CIA , with Kermit Roosevelt and Norman Schwarzkopf Sr. leading the charge , had given money to dissidents in Iran who deposed the democratically elected premier , Mohammed Mossadegh , and reinstalled the shah of Iran .
The shah created a secret terrorist police force , SAVAK , that tortured its own citizens and imprisoned political opponents .
The CIA helped train SAVAK .
On domestic policy , the shah undertook a highly inflationary monetary policy that caused the value of the Iranian currency to plummet .
Inflation , torture .
Funny how that pisses people off .
Interestingly , when James Woolsey , former director of intelligence for the Clinton administration ’s CIA , spoke at the Naval Postgraduate School in August 2003 , he addressed the 1953 uprising in response to a question from me .
During his speech , Woolsey had stated that the war with militant Islam had begun in November 1979 when some Iranians took over the U.S. embassy .
I asked him whether he did n’t think it might have begun in 1953 , when the CIA helped depose Mossadegh .
Laughing , Woolsey replied that , as Winston Churchill had said , when it came to the Middle East , the Americans , after doing many wrong things , would always end up doing the right thing .
In other words , Woolsey seemed to admit CIA complicity , but dismissed the idea that this mattered because the U.S. , at some point , ( he did n’t specify when ) had gotten it right .
The bad consequences of the U.S. government ’s intervention in 1953 have been horrendous and cannot be laughingly dismissed .
In 1980 , by the way , President Jimmy Carter , asked at a press conference whether he thought " it was proper for the United States to restore the shah to the throne in 1953 against the popular will within Iran , " answered , " That ’s ancient history . "
Have any of you ever had a course in ancient history ?
In the course , did you cover events that happened just 27 years earlier ?
My fifth and final point is that some people ’s prima facie evidence for their claim that the Iranian government wants to develop nuclear weapons is not evidence at all .
I ’m not claiming that the Iranian government does not want to develop nuclear weapons : I do n’t know .
But one major alleged piece of evidence for this conclusion is not really evidence .
And to show why , I need to bring in a concept from economics , the concept of " opportunity cost . "
Imagine that you have an oil well that contains enough oil to supply annually three times the amount you would ever want to use in a year .
Suppose that one of your main current uses of oil is to generate electric power for your ranch .
Would you want to buy electric power from someone else , power that is generated by burning some other fuel , or , possibly , made by a nuclear reactor ?
It ’s a trick question .
You ca n’t answer it without comparing two crucial numbers : the cost of the oil you use to generate power and the price you would pay for the alternate form of electricity .
If , for example , the cost to you of generating your own power were 7 cents per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) and the cost to you of buying electric power were 9 cents per kWh , then , all other things equal , you would want to make your own .
If , on the other hand , these numbers were reversed , then , all other things equal , you would want to buy your electric power .
The opportunity cost of the oil you use is the value of the highest - valued alternate use of the oil .
Even though you could use the oil yourself , you also could choose to sell it .
And if you could get a high enough price for it , then it might well be cheaper for you to sell the oil and buy electric power made from some other fuel .
Many people , when they hear the term “ opportunity cost , ” think of a concept that they learned in an economics class years ago but did n’t think mattered much .
In fact , “ opportunity cost ” is a powerful concept in economics that can explain a lot of behavior we see around us  from why high - income people almost never use the bus ( due to the high opportunity cost of their time , which actually makes the bus very expensive relative to airplanes ) to why hotel rooms in Manhattan are so much smaller than rooms in Houston ( due to the high opportunity cost of land in Manhattan compared to Houston . )
In fact , the concept of opportunity cost is so powerful that it leads to an alternate explanation of the behavior of Iran ’s government in recent years .
When the Iranian government announces that it wants uranium enrichment in order to have nuclear power , many people scoff at the idea .
“ Why , ” they say , “ would the Iranians want nuclear power ?
Look at all the oil they have . ”
Here ’s the way the U.S. Joint Economic Committee put it in the opening sentence of a March 2006 report :
" Iran ’s vast oil and gas resources undermine the Iranian regime ’s claim that its nuclear program is needed for domestic energy generation . "
But these oil and gas resources do n’t undermine the regime ’s claim at all , as the concept of opportunity cost makes clear .
Now it ’s possible that the Iranian government is lying : it is , after all , a government , and governments often tell lies .
But it ’s also possible that the Iranian government is telling the truth .
And opportunity cost is the relevant concept that helps us see how .
Just as in my ranch example , Iran may find its oil less valuable in generating power than in selling on the world market .
The numbers for Iran are similar to the hypothetical numbers I gave for the ranch .
In 2005 , Iran produced 4.2 million barrels per day and exported two - thirds of its barrels , or 2.7 million barrels per day .
That Iran would want to consider exporting even more is especially easy to understand when you consider that world oil prices this year have averaged more than $ 65 a barrel , which is , adjusted for inflation , about double the world price as recently as 2003 .
Iran ’s opportunity cost for oil has risen .
Again , I emphasize that I do n’t know enough about the situation to know what the Iranian government ’s motive is for wanting to go more nuclear .
But my point is a narrower one : you ca n’t simply , as the U.S. Joint Economic Committee did , observe two facts  that the Iranian government wants more nuclear production and that Iran is a net exporter of oil to the world  and conclude that , of course , Iran ’s goal is to have nuclear weapons .
The concept of opportunity cost explains why .

Peter Shor 's original paper has good discussion of the issues but I found the description of the correction algorithm a little laconic .
John Preskill 's Lecture Notes were probably the most useful document .
A student term paper by Dheera Venkatraman was also pretty useful though I was confused for a while by what might be considered errors in it .
Quantum computers promise great things , but that promise will only come to be if quantum computers can be made reliable .
In order to achieve that reliability we need qubits that can maintain their state for extended periods of time .
Unfortunately , just about any type of interaction between a qubit and its environment can render the qubit useless .
But there is a solution - a quantum error correcting code .
This is very similar to classical error correcting code in which a number of bits are stored , in a distributed fashion , over a larger set of bits , in such a way that if some of the bits are corrupted , the original state can be recovered .
In the following will be some code to simulate the implementation of one of these codes : the nine bit Shor code .
Firstly , let me include the quantum monad that I 've developed over earlier weeks :
Remember thatis the type of elements of a vector space overwith a basis whose elements are labelled by elements of .
I 'm using the letteras I 'm thinking of elements ofas being weights .
It 's useful to be able to apply transforms to all of the weights : is an instance ofand .
Vector spaces form monads because you can specify a function between vectors spaces in terms of how it maps basis elements in the first vector space .
The monad bind function lifts the function on basis elements to the entire vector space .
It'd be cool if the bind function forcould simplfy our vectors by collecting together multiples of the same basis elements .
Unfortunately this is tricky to do for reasons described in Eric Kidd 's recent Set monad article .
Instead I 'll use an explicit function , , that collects our terms together .
I 've also used a crude method for throwing out terms that probably ought to be zero .
A better solution might be to work only with rational numbers , or exact algebraic numbers .
And here is the quantum monad :
There are a number of ways to apply functions to vector spaces .
I 'll be writing functions on the right so that I can apply operations to a quantum state reading from left to right .
So here 's a bunch of combinators to implement this .
First there 's ordinary function application :
Then there are functions that operate on the vector space by simply relabelling the basis :
Then there are functions that map fromtobut are defined by how they act on the basis elements of As I mentioned last post on entanglement , we can form states for joint independent systems using the tensor product :
The tensor product is a lot like a multiplication table .
The coefficient ofinis the product of the coefficients ofandinandrespectively .
If two systems are unentangled then you can simulate the physics of each part separately .
So it'd be nice to have a way to test whether or not a given state is unentangled , in other words , to test whether a state is a tensor product .
As I 'm not developing a serious application here , here 's a quick and dirty algorithm that more or less does what anyone would do when faced with the task of recovering the row and column headings from a multiplcation table : recoversandfrom ( up to multiplication by a complex number with unit norm ) but it gives garbage if the argument is n't a tensor product .
So we need to test whether or not the original vector is the tensor product of the inputs .
So here 's a test of how close the original is to the product of the putative factors :
We 'll be doing lots of stuff with tensor products so it 's useful to have some tools to apply functions to one or other factor :
If a bit is athen by rights , a qubit should be a .
But I thinkandlook nicer so I 'm usinginstead .
So here 's the fundamentally quantum rotation operator :
Althoughis a map , usingit becomes a mapto .
Note that theargument is n't float data inside a quantum device , it 's a hard - coded feature of the hardware itself .
For example , if we chooseto beandwe get the standard square root of not operation and its inverse :
( You may be wondering about the use ofin my definition of .
There 's an interesting story behind that involving what I think is one of the weirdest features of physics .
For another day . ) I'm also goint to manipulate lots of lists of qubits so here are some tools for that :
So here 's a statement of the problem .
We have a qubit , ie .
something of type .
But quantum systems are very delicate and our qubit may wander into a different state .
In particular , after a time t it will be as ifhas been applied to it , except that we can't control .
We need to find a way to recover the original qubit .
In fact , it 's worse than that : our qubit is in some environment which we can consider to be a list of qubits .
So our state is given by an instance ofand the interaction might not simply be a rotation of the qubit but an operation that entangles the qubit with the environment .
This might happen if the qubit is n't perfectly isolated .
Let 's forget about the full generality here and consider just one type of data corruption - a qubit that might or might not have been flipped .
How can we make a device robust against such occurences ?
Well this is practically identical to the problem of making classical data robust against noise .
We can simply use a 3 bit repetition code to store our qubits as three qubits .
So here 's an implementation of a function to repair a codeword from the classical 3 bit repetition code :
But there are a couple of problems with this .
Firstly this is a many - to - one map becauseand , say , both get mapped to [ 0,0,0 ] .
In quantum mechanics , all of our maps need to be unitary , and in particular , invertible .
A many - to - one map is n't invertible .
Secondly , we 're creating a register , and again this is not an invertible operation .
These two problems will actually cancel each other out because the apparent destruction of information that comes about from our many - to - one map can be fixed by allowingto carry that information away .
And we can ensure reversibility by using a supplied register rather than creating a new one :
It 's easy to write an inverse for this function so it's a valid unitary transform .
But it 's actually a bit tedious to write out all thoses .
So we can cheat a bit .
Let 's just assume there 's an infinite supply of input zeroes and use them at our leisure .
We no longer need to write thes , we just note that every time we assign a value to a new register the hardware engineer building your device installs some means of import zero qubits .
Theregister in the above function will never be touched again .
But we can't simply throw it away .
It 's a kind of side effect and we 'll call these bits ancillae .
We 'll have lots of these side effects that we need to collect up , so here 's the final quantum repetition codeword repair code :
There 's one last thing we could do to this code : the pairs being handed in and out of this function are essentially just instances of themonad .
So we could just squirrel away our ancillae inside a monad .
I wo n't do that here because I think it 's good to see everything explicitly when figuring this stuff out for the first time .
But think about the bits that we'd be writing out .
They correspond to information , or entropy , that we 'd ultimately like to pump out of our device as exhaust .
In other words they are heat .
So this monad would , in effect , be a heat monad .
I found this amusing given what I wrote in reason number eight in my list from last year .
So far so good .
But that only corrects one type of error : a bit flip .
But note that it also protects superpositions from bit flips .
So let 's take a quantum state built from repetition codewords placed in an empty environment :
Now corrupt the last bit :
And repair it : Although we have repaired the state of our system , the state of the environment has changed .
But that 's fine because this state is still an unentangles tensor product of the environment and our system .
You can see this just by looking at the state , but for peace of mind useto see that the deviation from being a tensor product is the zero vector .
But that 's still only a narrow class of error that we can fix .
Another type of error mapstobut mapsto .
This is known as a phase flip .
One way to view this as as a flip in a rotated basis :> phaseFlip x = x ->- hnot ->- fmap flip ->< unhnot > pFlipAtM i = mapAtM i phaseFlipThere 's a nice strategy to protect against phase flips : rotate our data into a basis where phase flips become ordinary flips , and use the repetition code .
So we 'll use these two states to represent 0 and 1: So let 's make a state that is a superposition of these states in some environment : Corrupt the middle bit with a phase flip :
And repair it : Comparingandwe see that the repair is successful .
Unfortunately , we can use this scheme to repair phase flips , but not plain flips .
We need a scheme that can repair both of these .
So now we turn to Shor 's ingenious solution : use both of these schemes as the same time .
So we 'll use the scheme that protects against phase flips with the twist that instead of using three qubits we use three triplets of qubits .
We can use the three triplets to fix phase flips and we can use the three bits within a triplet to fix flips .
We 'll represent 0 and 1 usingandas defined here : Repair is a little more complex before .
First we use 6 ancilla bits to fix qubits within each triplet using the repetition code three times :
We also use two ancilla bits to locate phase flips between the triplets .
will be applied in a rotated basis insideNow we can pull all of this together into a single process to repair both kinds of error :
So now all that 's needed is to try corrupting some qubits to see if we can repair them .
Let 's try a more complex superposition with a more complex corruption :
This is all well and good .
But there are more ways to corrupt a qubit beyond simple flips .
Let 's mess up our state using two additional kinds of ' noise ' that we have n't discussed .
Firstly , instead of just flipping , we 'll rotate one of the bits .
Secondly , we 'll additionally ' leak ' that bit to the environment so as to cause decoherence .
We 've discussed solutions to neither of these problems , so let 's see what happens .
A minor miracle has taken place .
The Shor code is robust against just about anything you can throw at a single qubit .
In fact , any code that can survive flips and phase flips of a single qubit can survive any kind of corruption , including entanglement with the environment .
( Despite having read the proof , I was still pretty surprised when the code actually worked ! )
And that gives researchers one hope that these methods might serve as ways to make quantum computing reliable .
I 'll mention a couple more things in closing .
Firstly , nowhere above have I mentioned wavefunction collapse , observations or superoperators .
You do n't need any of these things to define the Shor code and show that it can correct errors .
( You probably do need some extra assumptions about quantum mechanics if you want to calculate probabilities of various outcomes in the event that the code fails - eg. due to multiple qubits being corrupted . )
And secondly , despite it being my April 1st post last year , I still have the doubts I expressed here about quantum computing .
Oh ... and expect those lines to take a few seconds to evaluate .
When you simulate the Shor code you 're performing computations in a 512 - dimensional vector space !

Britain is preparing territorial claims on tens of thousands of square miles of the Atlantic Ocean floor around the Falklands , Ascension Island and Rockall in the hope of annexing potentially lucrative gas , mineral and oil fields , the Guardian has learned .
The UK claims , to be lodged at the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf , exploit a novel legal approach that is transforming the international politics of underwater prospecting .
Britain is accelerating its process of submitting applications to the UN - which is fraught with diplomatic sensitivities , not least with Argentina - before an international deadline for registering interests .
Relying on detailed geological and geophysical surveys by scientists and hydrographers , any state can delineate a new " continental shelf outer limit " that can extend up to 350 miles from its shoreline .
Data has been collected for most of Britain 's submissions and Chris Carleton , head of the law of the sea division at the UK Hydrographic Office and an international expert on the process , said preliminary talks on Rockall are being held in Reykjavik , Iceland , next week .
Mr Carleton believes the Falklands claim has the most potential for acrimonious political fallout .
Britain and Argentina fought over the islands 25 years ago , and the value of the oil under the sea in the region is understood to be immense : seismic tests suggest there could be about 60bn barrels under the ocean floor .
Britain has been granted licences for exploratory drilling around the islands within the normal 200 - mile exploration limit and any new claim to UNCLCS would extend territorial rights further into the Atlantic .
" It would be beyond the 200 - mile limit but less than 350 miles , " said Mr Carleton , who is involved in preparing the submission .
" It effectively joins up the area around South Georgia to the Falklands .
It 's a claim but how it 's handled has not been decided yet .
The Argentinians will say it 's not ours to claim .
It 's all a bit tricky . "
Martin Pratt , director of research at Durham University 's international boundaries research unit , added : " The Russians may be claiming the Arctic but the UK is claiming a large chunk of the Atlantic .
Some states might ask why a big power is entitled to huge stretches of the ocean 's resources thousands of miles away from its land , but that 's the way the law is . "
Because of the sensitivities - earlier this year Buenos Aires scrapped a 1995 agreement with the UK to share any oil found in the adjacent waters - the first formal application from the UK is likely to centre on Ascension .
The volcanic island , 1,000 miles from the African mainland , sits just to one side of the mid-Atlantic ridge .
No gas or oil is likely to be found below the surrounding waters but there could be significant mineral deposits on the ocean floor .
Talks have already begun between Ireland , Iceland and Denmark for the division of rights far out into the north Atlantic .
It includes the island of Rockall and the sub-sea Hatton ridge .
The competing claims are nowhere near final resolution although Ireland and the UK have agreed a common boundary .
Other countries that have submitted claims to the ocean floors around remote overseas dependencies have run into fierce resentment from neighbouring nations .
France , which this summer registered its claim to thousands of square miles around New Caledonia , in the Pacific , has received protests from Vanuatu warning that the claim has " serious implications and ramifications on Vanuatu 's legal and traditional sovereignty " .
Russia was criticised this summer for making claims beneath the Arctic Ocean .
The UN body has been progressing slowly through its casework .
The process of extending the normal 200 - mile limit requires volumes of technical evidence of submarine soundings .
According to the convention on the law of the sea , applicant states may register their rights by " establishing the foot of the continental slope , by meeting the requirements stated for the thickness of sedimentary rocks " .
Once demarcated , the ocean floor may then be claimed up to 60 nautical miles from the bottom of the continental slope .
When territorial rights have been obtained , states have the right to extract any minerals , natural gas or oil discovered in the annexed seabed .
There is a deadline of May 2009 for claims from the UK and other countries to be submitted , although states that ratified the treaty later have more time .
" The amount of technical data required is massive , " said Mr Pratt .
" Australia recently submitted 80 volumes . "
In the past , Greenpeace has described the process as a " land grab " .
· This article was amended on Friday September 28 2007 .
About 60bn barrels of oil are estimated to be lying under the seabed around the Falkland Islands , not 60 m , as we said in the article .
This has been corrected .
Hackers brazenly posted sensitive information including home addresses and phone numbers for 1,200 eBay users to an official online forum dedicated to fraud prevention on the auction site .
The information - which also included user names and email , and possibly their credit card numbers and three - digit CVV2 numbers - was visible for more than an hour to anyone visiting the forum .
The miscreants appeared to create a script that caused each user to log in and post information associated with the person who owned the account .
The script spit out about 15 posts per minute , starting around 5:45 a.m. California time .
An eBay spokeswoman said the posts were most likely the result of account takeovers and not of a security breach on eBay .
She also said the credit card numbers contained in the posts were not those eBay or PayPal had on file for those users .
eBay representatives have begun contacting all users whose information was posted to head off any further fraud and to learn more about the attack .
This screenshot , showing account details for eBay user Mark Bruno , was one of 1,200 posted to eBay 's Trust and Safety discussion board over a 90 - minute period on Tuesday morning .
eBay was forced to close the Trust and Safety forum for several hours to prevent the information from being accessed .
The board serves as the official forum for eBay to educate users about fraud .
" At this stage all we can confirm is it 's not a security breach from eBay , " spokeswoman Nichola Sharpe said .
" The teams have been on the case from the minute they saw it up there this morning .
We 're doing all we can to monitor it and keep on top of it . "
Black eye for eBay security
With 204 million registered users , the 1,200 accounts represents an tiny fraction of the eBay population .
Even still , the incident underscores the volume of information related to eBay users that 's available to malicious hackers and the ease with which they are able to get it and publish it .
It is only the latest black eye for eBay 's security team .
On at least three occasions earlier this year , a hacker who calls himself Vladuz was able to access restricted eBay servers so he could pose as an official customer service representative in user forums .
Indeed , Tuesday 's postings were affixed with a signature that read : " SGI Inc - emocnI gnitareneG rof snoituloS , " part of which is " Solutions for Generating Income " spelled backwards .
Vladuz was known to use the same phrase on websites he was affiliated with , though there is no way to know if he is the individual behind the latest stunt .
The Register spoke with two people whose details were posted .
Both confirmed that their accounts had been taken over in the past by someone who used their accounts to advertise tickets to February 's Super Bowl game , but failed to deliver them after buyers sent them money .
Once more unto the breach
Mark Bruno , one of the users , said he has changed his eBay password " two or three times , " only to learn later his account has been breached again .
Bruno was at work when contacted , and could not immediately confirm if he owned a credit card with the number contained in a post .
The other user was also unable to say if the credit card number attributed to her account was hers .
At the moment , it 's impossible to say if the credit card numbers were simply made up , or if they belong to the individuals and were simply cross-referenced from another source .
Either way , it 's tough to know why someone would go through the trouble of culling information associated with 1,200 eBay users and publish it smack dab under the noses of eBay 's security team .
" They could be boasting or bragging to bolster their nickname in the underground , " said Dan Clements , president of CardCops , a division of the Affinion Group that monitors online forums for stolen credit card information .
" It could be some sort of vandalism .
It could be an in - your - face type event for eBay .
Until you dig deeper , it 's hard to say . " ®

This battle is decidedly , and Midwesternly , pragmatic :
In 1993 , scab — a fungus also known as Fusarium head blight — tore through this region , wiping out thousands of acres of wheat , one of the prized crops in North Dakota , where agriculture remains the largest element of the economy .
Hard rains left water pooling in fields , giving the scab an opening .
It has turned up in varying degrees ever since , even as farmers searched for a cure .
On a recent afternoon , as rain pounded his 710 acres , Mr. Monson gloomily yanked the head off a stalk of his wheat , revealing for a visitor whitish , shriveled seeds — the telltale signs of scab .
When Mr. Monson began his efforts in the late 1990s , some here balked .
He remembered John Dorso , a former Republican leader , rolling his eyes and asking Mr. Monson if he knew what he was getting mixed up in .
But hemp , Mr. Monson argued , offered an alternative for North Dakota ’s crop rotation .
Its tall stalks survive similarly cool and wet conditions in Canada , just 25 miles north of here , where it is legal .
And it suits the rocky soil left behind here by glaciers — soil that threatens to tear up farm equipment for anyone who dares to plant crops like beets or potatoes beneath ground .
Years and studies and hearings later , few here have much to say against hemp — a reflection , it seems , of the state ’s urgent wish to improve its economy .
Recent hemp votes have passed the legislature with ease , though some questions linger .
How big a market would there really be for hemp ?
What about the worries of drug enforcement officials , who say someone might sneak into a farmer ’s field of harmless hemp and plant a batch of ( similar - looking ) marijuana ?
Such fears , Mr. Monson insisted , are silly in North Dakota , which is the 48th most - populous state , with fewer than 640,000 people .
This is the only state where voter registration is not required .
( Everyone would know , the logic goes , if someone who did not belong tried to vote . )
“ You ca n’t go down to get the mail around here without someone knowing , ” Mr. Monson said .
But Blair Thoreson , a Republican state representative who has voted against hemp measures , is less sure .
“ Everyone here knows everyone , ” Mr. Thoreson said , “ and yet we ’ve had a huge problem here with homegrown methamphetamine labs , too . ”
Roger Johnson , the state ’s agriculture commissioner , said hemp fields would be the worst places to hide marijuana .
Under state rules , he said , such fields must be accessible for unannounced searches , day or night , and crops would be tested by the state .
Also , he said , a field of hemp and marijuana would cross pollinate , leaving the drug less potent .
At 13,123 feet high , the massive , mountain - shaped building envisioned by Japan 's Taisei Construction Company would overshadow Mount Fuji itself by nearly 700 feet .
That 's the equivalent of NINE Empire State Buildings stood one upon the other !
The building , known as the X - Seed 4000 , is designed to house up to one million residents on as many as 800 floors !
Designers have had to consider tricky questions of temperature and pressure differentials between the base and topmost floors , and are looking to utilize solar power to solve these and other critical issues .
The cost , you ask ?
Somewhere between $ 300 and $ 900 billion ... what 's that , an Iraq War or two ?
Couple of manned Mars missions ?
Quite do - able - if you 're Japan , one of the world 's richest countries .
One might think the Japanese government would never allow the placing of an edifice the size of the X - Seed 4000 anywhere near sacred Mount Fuji , but Taisei 's plans call for the monumental mini-city to rise relatively close by , rising up upon huge caissons sunk deep into the mire underlying Tokyo Bay .
Could it happen ?
Well , skeptical citizens of Florence , Italy , scoffed at Leonardo da Vinci 's detailed drawings of helicopters and other flying machines .
Yet da Vinci 's dreams did take flight , centuries later .
I would n't rush to put down a deposit on a unit just yet , but Taisei 's outrageous X - Seed 4000 proposal has the same potential to fly high .

Two officers of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice in Saudi Arabia were attacked by two " inappropriately - dressed " girls , according to an article in the Asharq Alawsat .
According to Dr. Al - Marshood [ Head of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice in the Eastern province ] , the two commission members approached the girls in order to " politely " advise and guide them regarding their inappropriate clothing .
Consequently , the two girls started verbally abusing the commission members , which then lead to one of the girls pepper - spraying them in the face as the other girl filmed the incident on her mobile phone , while continuing to hurl insults at them .
The paper reports that the girls were escorted to a police station , where they apologized and were released .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The argument for free market economics — though we here at Mother Jones may have , on occasion , doubted its virtuosity — goes like this : Competition encourages innovation , and customers decide which innovations are worth keeping and get what they want in the process .
Here ’s a case in point : A small business called Creekstone Farms Premium Beef proposed testing all of its cows for mad cow disease .
Customers have long been skittish about mad cow disease , and testing would likely cause Creekstone ’s business to spike .
Innovation ?
Check .
Benefit to consumers ?
Check .
Fostering small businesses ?
Check .
But the USDA has intervened to block Creekstone from conducting the tests .
The rationale ?
It ’s not fair to agribusinesses , which buy , sell , and butcher so many cows that they could n’t possibly conduct the expensive test on all of them .
The USDA also alleged that “ widespread testing could lead to a false positive that would harm the meat industry . ”
Protecting the strong from the weak and putting dollars above lives are standard practice at the USDA , which is pretty much a trade group for agribusiness .
Mother Jones has highlighted other examples of the same mentality : Read about the USDA ’s watering down of organic standards here , and its past moves to block safety innovations here .
Now , for another reason to become a vegetarian .
PETA has petitioned Congress to create a tax break for non-meat eaters .
After all , the animal rights group argues , buying a hybrid vehicle entitles you to a tax break , although it reduces carbon emissions by only two - thirds as much per year as forgoing meat .
It seems like a pretty righteous idea to me ( full disclosure : I ’m a long - time vegetarian , though I might have had a tiny taste of prosciutto last night ) — the only problem is , how could the government determine who does and does not eat meat ?
Testing our poop is obviously out of the question : See above .
Having worked on structural steel buildings as a civil engineer in the era when the Twin Towers were designed and constructed , I found some disturbing discrepancies and omissions concerning their collapse on 9/11 .
I was particularly interested in the two PBS documentaries that explained the prevailing theories as determined by two government agencies , FEMA and NIST ( National Institute of Science and Technology ) .
The first ( 2002 ) PBS documentary , Why the Towers Fell , discussed how the floor truss connectors failed and caused a “ progressive pancake collapse . ”
The subsequent 2006 repackaged documentary Building on Ground Zero explained that the connectors held , but that the columns failed , which is also unlikely .
Without mentioning the word “ concrete , ” the latter documentary compared the three - second collapse of the concrete Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building with that of the Twin Towers that were of structural steel .
The collapse of a concrete - framed building cannot be compared with that of a structural steel - framed building .
Since neither documentary addressed many of the pertinent facts , I took the time to review available material , combine it with scientific and historical facts , and submit the following two theories for consideration .
Best Proxy site
The prevailing theory
The prevailing theory for the collapse of the 110 - story , award - winning Twin Towers is that when jetliners flew into the 95th and 80th floors of the North and South Towers respectively , they severed several of each building ’s columns and weakened other columns with the burning of jet fuel / kerosene ( and office combustibles ) .
However , unlike concrete buildings , structural steel buildings redistribute the stress when several columns are removed and the undamaged structural framework acts as a truss network to bridge over the missing columns .
After the 1993 car bomb explosion destroyed columns in the North Tower , John Skilling , the head structural engineer for the Twin Towers , was asked about an airplane strike .
He explained that the Twin Towers were originally designed to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707 ( similar in size to the Boeing 767 ) .
He went on to say that there would be a horrendous fire from the jet fuel , but “ the building structure would still be there . ”
The 10,000 gallons of jet fuel ( half capacity ) in each jetliner did cause horrendous fires over several floors , but it would not cause the steel members to melt or even lose sufficient strength to cause a collapse .
This is because the short - duration jet fuel fires and office combustible fires cannot create ( or transmit to the steel ) temperatures hot enough .
If a structural steel building could collapse because of fire , it would do so slowly as the various steel members gradually relinquished their structural strength .
However , in the 100 - year history of structural - steel framed buildings , there is no evidence of any structural steel framed building having collapsed because of fire .
Let ’s assume the unlikelihood that these fires could weaken all of the columns to the same degree of heat intensity and thus remove their structural strength equally over the entire floor , or floors , in order to cause the top 30 - floor building segment ( South Tower WTC # 2 ) to drop vertically and evenly onto the supporting 79th floor .
The 30 floors from above would then combine with the 79th floor and fall onto the next level down ( 78th floor ) crushing its columns evenly and so on down into the seven levels below the street level .
The interesting fact is that each of these 110 - story Twin Towers fell upon itself in about ten seconds at nearly free - fall speed .
This violates Newton ’s Law of Conservation of Momentum that would require that as the stationary inertia of each floor is overcome by being hit , the mass ( weight ) increases and the free - fall speed decreases .
Even if Newton ’s Law is ignored , the prevailing theory would have us believe that each of the Twin Towers inexplicably collapsed upon itself crushing all 287 massive columns on each floor while maintaining a free - fall speed as if the 100,000 , or more , tons of supporting structural - steel framework underneath did n’t exist .
In desperation , military suggests foot patrols can be safer than Humvees , tanks RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 22 , 2007 Print This Email This Top US commanders in Iraq have been encouraging soldiers in Baghdad to " get out and walk . "
In fact -- they 've been using those very words .
According to Friday 's LA Times , a counterinsurgency guidance memo " released last week by Army Lt. Gen Raymond T. Odierno , the commander of day - to - day military operations , urges Iraqi and American troops to ' get out and walk . '
" I would rather go out without any armor or gear , " one soldier told the Times .
" If an EFP hits the vehicle , you are dead anyway no matter how much armor you have .
It can take out an Abrams tank ; these 1114 [ armored Humvees ] are nothing . "
The paper notes that the memo argues that although Humvees offer protection , " they also make units predictable and ' insulate us from the Iraqi people we intend to secure . ' "
More to the point , according to soldiers interviewed for the article , walking is safer : " U.S. troops working the streets of the capital fear one Iraqi weapon more than others -- a copper - plated explosive that can penetrate armor and has proved devastating to Humvees and even capable of severely damaging tanks , " writes the LA Times Julian Barnes .
" The power of what the military calls an EFP -- for explosively formed penetrator , or projectile -- to spray molten metal balls that punch through the armor on vehicles has some American troops rethinking their tactics , " Barnes adds .
" They are asking whether the U.S. should give up its reliance on making constant improvements to vehicle defenses . "
The original draft of the memo , acquired by the Times , " notes that EFP attacks on Humvees damage them heavily .
" Instead , these troops think , it is time to leave the armor behind , and get out and walk . "
" Foot patrols , of course , are not a fail - safe method , " Barnes adds .
" On city streets , snipers remain a threat .
And bombs can still kill dismounted troops .
But when blasts occur in the middle of a foot patrol , the number of casualties are generally lower because the troops are more spread out . "

MARRIAGES should last for only seven years before the couple decide to go their separate ways or sign up for an extension , a German MP has proposed .
The time limit would lead to fewer divorces , according to Gabriele Pauli , a candidate for the leadership of Bavaria 's dominant conservative party CSU .
The " seven - year hitch " plan drew sharp criticism from party colleagues in Pope Benedict XVI 's home region .
German MP Gabriele Pauli said seven - year marriage contracts would slash divorce rates .
" My proposal is for marriages to run out after seven years , " Ms Pauli , a twice - divorced 50 - year - old who leads the local administration in the town of Fuerth , said as she presented her leadership program in Munich .
" That means that , in future , people would in future enter marriages only on a time - limited basis , and would then actively say ' yes ' to an extension . "
She argued that , since a high proportion of marriages end in divorce and many people stay married only for fear of separation or for financial reasons , " perhaps one can live better outside marriage " .
In the film The Seven Year Itch Marilyn Monroe plays a 22 - year - old television bombshell who distracts a married man from his seven - year relationship , sending him into a spin about his own wife 's behaviour .
The man becomes paranoid about being unfaithful while reading a book about how men have extramarital affairs after seven years .
The 1955 movie produced the most famous image of Monroe , as she " struggled " to hold down her dress while standing over a subway grate .
Ms Pauli conceded that " the fine points must still be cleared up " and said that " obviously , a lot stands against this " .
Her novel suggestion on marriage appeared unlikely to win her new friends in the CSU .
The party for decades has dominated socially conservative , solidly Catholic Bavaria , where Pope Benedict was born and grew up .

8 ‘ Health ’ Foods That Contain High Fructose Corn Syrup !
Busted !
High fructose corn syrup is incredibly cheap , partly because the U.S. government artificially fixes sugar prices and partly because corn is heavily subsidized ( not so much “ free market ” anymore as “ free lunch ” ) .
Clearly , your federal government loves you and hopes you get obesity and diabetes really soon so you can take advantage of all the great medical care that we do n’t have .
High fructose corn syrup is also terrible for you , and not even the most conservative of nutrition experts disagrees with that .
While there are a few slightly more terrible liquids out there – lighter fluid , for example – it ’s really a shame that the “ foods ” available to us are so commonly laced with HFCS .
And it ’s even worse that they ’re often promoted as being suitable for a healthy lifestyle or weight loss !
They may look very cute , but beneath the fiber sprinkles and happy labeling lurks the heart of darkness .
Really .
These eight “ health ” food products all contain high fructose corn syrup :
– Yoplait Yogurt
Every variety of Yoplait contains HFCS !
How much do you think it really costs
The Premium Yogurt ( aka Yoplait ) to slap some ultra- pasteurized milk products , a dash of pectin , and a swig of sweetener into each pretty little personalized bucket de diabetes ?
– Salad Dressings : Oh , the Love !
Most salad dressings contain corn syrup , but “ lite ” and “ reduced calorie ” versions are brimming with it .
Prior to the no-fat craze , salad dressings were typically made with cheap , poor - quality corn oil .
Now they ’re made with cheap , poor - quality corn syrup .
Dump them ( as in break up with them , not dump them on your salads ) .
Make your own dressings at home from cheeses , lemon juice , olive oil or balsamic vinegar .
– “ Smart ” Ice Cream Sandwiches
Many of the low - calorie ice cream treats are packed with upwards of 20 grams of this nutritionally deficient sweetener .
– Special K
It ’s high time for cereals to stop proclaiming health benefits .
Made from grains , gums and sugars , there ’s nothing smart about cereal for breakfast , no matter how special it may be .
Self - esteem for breakfast ?
– Cereals with the Heart Healthy Claims
Many breakfast cereals are loaded with sugars and processed junk , but because they have a few grams of fiber or are low in fat ( big deal ) , they are promoted as health foods .
Just steer clear of the middle aisles , period .
– 100 Calorie Snack Packs
When was the last time anybody starved ?
We ’re all in favor of portion control , but what ’s in the package matters .
You ’re much better off eating 100 calories of almonds or sugar snap peas than some processed cookie confection .
Although we know this might make a few friends a little cranky .
Thanks to Back in Skinny Jeans for exposing these sneaky sweets !

Hundreds of vegetable varieties have been lost from UK soils and are now illegal to grow .
But the conservation battle goes on
Judy Steele is growing a row of peas called Carruther 's Purple Podded in her Warwickshire garden .
She would not find this variety in her local garden centre or in any seed merchant 's catalogue .
In fact , it is illegal to buy seeds of this old variety .
But Steele is not a criminal or a botanical terrorist .
She describes herself as " a foster - mother for orphaned pea varieties , " and is one of 300 seed guardians for Garden Organic .
Garden Organic - formally known as the Henry Doubleday Research Association , based at Ryton , near Coventry - has developed an extensive seed library of 800 traditional vegetable varieties grown in Britain and which are now outlawed by European legislation .
" During Victorian times , seeds were available from local growers , and gardeners knew who to complain to if they did n't grow , but gradually seed companies got bigger and more remote , " says Sandra Slack , head of Garden Organic 's seed library .
" Plant breeders ' rights began in the 1920s .
To protect customers and to standardise the seed business across borders , the EU intervened in the 1970s , making sure that seed varieties were properly tested .
Unfortunately , testing is expensive and those varieties not tested were dropped .
If a variety has been dropped from the approved common catalogue , then its seeds can not be bought or sold . "
Extinction
These days , it is easier to grow cannabis than Carruther 's Purple Podded peas or Auntie Madge 's tomato or Mr Stiff 's bunching onion .
Worried that these old varieties would vanish unless they were in circulation , Garden Organic set up what it calls the Heritage Seed Library to rescue our vegetable treasures from extinction .
To stay within the law , a scheme was established whereby gardeners pay to become members of the seed library , and each year they are given a selection of six of the hundreds of varieties to grow .
This is not just a smart wrinkle to get around EU rules .
There are important cultural and scientific reasons for growing old kinds of vegetables .
Many varieties that find their way into the library are part of a very personal history , as well as contributing to local cultural identity and distinctiveness .
The pea called Carlin came from a family that had inherited it 100 years ago , when a great grandfather received seeds as a wedding present .
This variety dates back at least to Elizabethan times and is still eaten - doused in beer and mint - in parts of the north of England on the Sunday before Palm Sunday - known regionally as Carlin Sunday .
One version of the Carlin legend has it that a shipload of these peas arrived in Newcastle upon
Tyne when it was besieged in 1644 and saved many from starvation .
Seeds carry these stories through the generations , and also across continents .
Few beans can be as poignant as the Cherokee Trail of Tears .
In the winter of 1838 - 39 , Cherokee people in the US were forced to march from their lands in Georgia , over the Smoky Mountains in appalling conditions , to be confined in a reservation 1,000 miles away ; 4,000 died on the way .
The shiny black bean the Cherokee took with them is an important heirloom seed for the American organisation Seed Savers Exchange , based in Iowa , but it has also been grown in Britain for a long time and is in HDRA 's seed library .
In the last 100 years , 90 % of UK vegetable varieties have been lost from our soils .
The same thing has happened in the rest of the world .
This loss has been globalisation 's gain .
Only three corporations now control a quarter of the world 's seed markets , and many of the seeds available in catalogues are legally protected hybrids that cannot be saved , or wo n't come " true " if they are .
In developing countries , saving food plant seed - a traditional practice for which farmers and growers have been criminalised - is tied to the politics of globalisation through issues such as food sovereignty and intellectual property rights : whoever controls seeds controls a people 's ability to feed themselves .
In Europe and America , vegetable seed conservation is more about the custodianship of genetic and cultural heritage .
Heritage , in the sense of preserving the past , can become a selection of what we like about history and freezing it in time , even though the world that created it has long gone .
So it is with seeds .
To conserve the world 's food seeds for the future , the Global Crop Diversity Trust has built the " doomsday vault " , the first global seed bank , housed in a frozen bunker buried under the island of Spitzbergen , near the North Pole .
It is intended to protect 3 m seed samples from nuclear war , asteroid strike and climate change .
Seeds are more than a metaphor for our hopes for the future , and getting them growing - and contributing to biological diversity - can have more value than locking them up in a vault - especially when faced with climate change .
" Seed conservation is important , but if we keep growing these old varieties - many of which have adapted to very local conditions - we will understand more about their adaptability to changes in climate , pests and diseases , " Slack says .
" For example , peas prefer cooler conditions , and if you 're growing them in the north of England and the climate is warming , you might find that varieties such as Glorious Devon or Kent Blue will do better in the future than Lancashire Lad .
We are losing older and tougher varieties before we understand their adaptation to climate change .
Cancer treatment
" Also , we do n't know about the properties of all the varieties .
For example , colour pigments have been discovered that combat illnesses : the red in tomatoes helps prevent hardening of the arteries , greens are used in cancer treatment .
We have to make these connections and keep seeds available . "
Keeping these old varieties growing is what Steele 's row of Carruther 's Purple Podded is all about .
She will not eat the peas but will collect them to be stored in the seed library , as will the other seed guardian volunteers growing their peas , beans , kale , lettuce , tomatoes , turnips and radishes , so that they can be distributed to a growing number of gardeners .
" I do it for the fun of learning about these old varieties and about how to be self - sufficient , " Steele says .
" The biodiversity aspect is very important .
The Irish potato famine happened because there was no genetic diversity in the crop , so when disease struck , there was no resistance .
In Peru , farmers mix lots of potato varieties in the same field as insurance against disease .
Also , having heritage seeds in living form enables the plants to evolve in new conditions .
In 20 to 30 years ' time , there will be a different climate and we need varieties that can cope with that . "

Here ’s one for your No - Shit - Rocket - Science - Brain - Surgery file .
The problem , of course , is getting there from here .
Conventional farmers walk a fine line that is so close to ruin that it ’s mostly unthinkable for them to switch to organic methods .
They are under incredible pressure to perform because they often do n’t own the land that they ’re farming and a bank has a collar around their necks .
Any failure could spell ruin .
Of course , single crop or animal farming ( monoculture ) is impossible without dangerous poisons , expensive fertilizers and energy hungry equipment .
Without these Myths of the Machine , monocropping would end within months .
If you ’re smart , you wo n’t wait for conventional farmers to figure this out .
This transition has to be done voluntarily and gradually by people who are not held hostage by banks and debt .
In any sane system , most people would produce , trade , buy and sell small amounts of a large variety of unprocessed fruit , vegetables and other foods .
This system would be decentralized , localized and in balance .
In other words , the opposite of what we see today .
The importance of biodiversity CANNOT be overstated .
Increasing biodiversity in your system increases your food security .
Becky and I have experienced partial and total crop failure ( late blight took out some of our tomatoes and ALL of our carrot seedlings , on two different plantings , just disappeared ; we do n’t even know what ate them ) .
It was n’t a big deal because we were growing lots of other food crops .
The thing I find most fascinating about the article below is how “ experts ” are just starting to figure out some of the things that those of us on the fringes of this hideous and obscene system have known for a very long time .
Of course , we were right , they were wrong , and it ’s too late to change the system now .
What will vary are the actions that you will take to help yourself , your family and your community face what is upon us .

Organic food has long been considered a niche market , a luxury for wealthy consumers .
But researchers told a U.N. conference Saturday that a large - scale shift to organic agriculture could help fight world hunger while improving the environment .
Crop yields initially can drop as much as 50 percent when industrialized , conventional agriculture using chemical fertilizers and pesticides is converted to organic .
While such decreases often even out over time , the figures have kept the organic movement largely on the sidelines of discussions about feeding the hungry .
Researchers in Denmark found , however , that food security for sub -Saharan Africa would not be seriously harmed if 50 percent of agricultural land in the food exporting regions of Europe and North America were converted to organic by 2020 .
While total food production would fall , the amount per crop would be much smaller than previously assumed , and the resulting rise in world food prices could be mitigated by improvements in the land and other benefits , the study found .
A similar conversion to organic farming in sub-Saharan Africa could help the region ’s hungry because it could reduce their need to import food , Niels Halberg , a senior scientist at the Danish Research Center for Organic Food and Farming , told the U.N. conference on “ Organic Agriculture and Food Security . ”
Farmers who go back to traditional agricultural methods would not have to spend money on expensive chemicals and would grow more diverse and sustainable crops , the report said .
In addition , if their food is certified as organic , farmers could export any surpluses at premium prices .
…
“ These models suggest that organic agriculture has the potential to secure a global food supply , just as conventional agriculture today , but with reduced environmental impacts , ” Scialabba said in a paper presented to the conference .
Environment , Resistance | Posted in Collapse Top Of Page
Statements from the White House , including from the president , in support of Afghanistan were resolute , but behind them was a halting , sometimes reluctant commitment to solving Afghanistan ’s myriad problems , according to dozens of interviews in the United States , at NATO headquarters in Brussels and in Kabul , the Afghan capital .
At critical moments in the fight for Afghanistan , the Bush administration diverted scarce intelligence and reconstruction resources to Iraq , including elite C.I.A. teams and Special Forces units involved in the search for terrorists .
As sophisticated Predator spy planes rolled off assembly lines in the United States , they were shipped to Iraq , undercutting the search for Taliban and terrorist leaders , according to senior military and intelligence officials .
As defense secretary , Donald H. Rumsfeld claimed credit for toppling the Taliban with light , fast forces .
But in a move that foreshadowed America ’s trouble in Iraq , he failed to anticipate the need for more forces after the old government was gone , and blocked an early proposal from Colin L. Powell , then the secretary of state , and Mr. Karzai , the administration ’s handpicked president , for a large international force .
As the situation deteriorated , Mr. Rumsfeld and other administration officials reversed course and cajoled European allies into sending troops .
When it came to reconstruction , big goals were announced , big projects identified .
Yet in the year Mr. Bush promised a “ Marshall Plan ” for Afghanistan , the country received less assistance per capita than did postconflict Bosnia and Kosovo , or even desperately poor Haiti , according to a RAND Corporation study .
Washington has spent an average of $ 3.4 billion a year reconstructing Afghanistan , less than half of what it has spent in Iraq , according to the Congressional Research Service .
The White House contends that the troop level in Afghanistan was increased when needed and that it now stands at 23,500 .
But a senior American commander said that even as the military force grew last year , he was surprised to discover that “ I could count on the fingers of one or two hands the number of U.S. government agricultural experts ” in Afghanistan , where 80 percent of the economy is agricultural .
A $ 300 million project authorized by Congress for small businesses was never financed .
Underlying many of the decisions , officials say , was a misapprehension about what Americans would find on the ground in Afghanistan .
“ The perception was that Afghans hated foreigners and that the Iraqis would welcome us , ” said James Dobbins , the administration ’s former special envoy for Afghanistan .
“ The reverse turned out to be the case . ”
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice defended the administration ’s policy , saying , “ I do n’t buy the argument that Afghanistan was starved of resources . ”
Yet she said : “ I do n’t think the U.S. government had what it needed for reconstructing a country .
We did it ad hoc in the Balkans , and then in Afghanistan , and then in Iraq . ”
In America , the Republicans are seen as the party of money and wealth .
This perception is certainly accurate in one sense – the GOP is the favored party of the wealthy elite .
Unfortunately , the party is also supported in large numbers by those who have no wealth , and thanks to the policies of the Republican party , no hope of ever attaining any .
But they continue to support the party for reasons that seem irrational to us .
Why ?
In a nutshell , I want to argue here that they do so because the GOP has , through a long - term and exceptionally effective messaging campaign , drawn around itself the ideology of hope .
Forgive a brief over - generalization , but they ’re the party that preaches wealth and that tells people they can join the club ( never mind that the message is a lie , given our current economic policy structure ) .
In the popular frame , the Republicans are often seen as being about getting and having money while the Democrats are about taking your hard - earned money and giving it to people who did n’t earn it .
The GOP would have you believe that they are dedicated to creating wealth while their opponents are committed to redistributing wealth .
This is a powerful message in a nation framed by the Puritan work ethic .
The Democratic party does not at present have an effective counter - message that offers hope in ample measure .
Their policies and promises paint a picture of a comparatively flat economic landscape .
In essence , the party seems to say “ if you want to have enough , we can help you . ”
This is a viable and valid message for a rational population , but in America ’s media - saturated , hyper - consumerist culture “ enough ” is a glass ceiling message that does n’t parse as “ you can have X ” – instead , it parses as “ you can only have X . ”
People want to be well - off and if nothing else in the world is clear to us , it should be that hope trumps rationality every time .
Successful political action must appeal to the public ’s aspirations , because psychologically Americans are unwilling and unable to let go of the American Dream they ’ve been fed since they were toddlers .
This must change .
Now .
If other constituencies are to have access to genuine power and opportunity , the GOP wealth lie must be exposed for what it is and the parties that legitimately favor the creation of wealth instead of the hoarding of wealth must begin crafting messaging that fosters truth and policies that engender a new economic reality for the 99 % of Americans on the outside looking in .
In a pragmatic sense , this task falls most immediately to the Democrats .
However , all parties are implicated in the mission , as are all independents , because the Republican economic disenfranchisement project is aimed at the entirety of the culture .
In a very real sense this is n’t about Republicans vs. Democrats , it ’s Republicans vs. America .
Messaging : Framing wealth and opportunity
If all the people who would like to be rich vote for you , you ’ll win every election by a landslide .
The trick is capture the hearts , minds and imaginations of this key demographic .
The first step along this path is to internalize a core assumption : “ it is not the GOP , but those who oppose them , who stand for wealth in America . ”
And that word “ wealth ” is key – we should never be ashamed to use it , because it speaks directly to the aspirations of those we ’re addressing .
Wealth is not bad – you can do bad things with it , of course , as legions of Republicans have demonstrated .
But you can also do tremendously good things with it , like assure the health and welfare of your family and community .
When thinking , talking and writing about economic subjects , keep the following things in mind :
GOP policies favor the hoarding of wealth by an elect few .
Those who oppose them promote the creation of wealth by providing opportunity for the many .
The GOP promotes a rigged game where wealth is inherited and business is done via secret deals ; those who oppose them insist on a level playing field where wealth is achieved via a fair process .
The old frame of haves vs. have - nots is counter - productive , since people tend to identify with aspirations and identification with “ have - not ” is defeatist .
Even as we may hate them , we also want to be them ( or at least , we want to have the freedom and possibility that attends having what they have ) .
Instead , the message of hope that will end GOP ownership of the wealth frame revolves around the haves and the will - haves .
Although it ’s less catchy rolling off the tongue , another way to frame the haves is to emphasize that they ’re the “ keeps ” or “ keep - aways , ” which focuses on their greed and selfishness .
When possible , we should point to the idea that at its core we ’re seeing a struggle between old money and new horizons .
They ’re inbred and rule by downward pressure , while we leverage the inherent creativity bound up in America ’s birthright of diversity .
GOP policies build walls between people and the opportunity to attain wealth through their innovation and hard work .
Those who oppose the Republicans are building bridges to the American Dream .
The GOP - dominated establishment is a system of exclusion that prevents people from earning their way up the ladder of success .
Our system is one of inclusion where people are free to achieve their destiny .
Conservative - dominated businesses are obsessed with cutting costs , which is a code - word for “ people . ”
Those who oppose the GOP are committed to investing in the value of human ingenuity .
While they seek to offshore opportunity , we promote policies that onboard American talent .
They work to preserve a small , clutching aristocracy .
We believe in promoting a meritocracy where the only limits on human achievement are the abilities of the individuals or teams involved .
Despite the cynical language they use to talk about “ entitlements , ” no class of people in the history of the world act as entitled as those who were born to privilege .
The fat and happy feel entitled to power and money .
Those of us who are lean and hungry seek nothing more than the chance to earn it through our abilities .
Existing , pro-GOP policies are a lock on the gate of opportunity .
We promote policies that are a key to universal opportunity .
When you look hard at the GOP - enabled lobbying culture that has taken over Washington , it becomes painfully clear that they ’re about special interests .
We ’re about the public interest .
The GOP acts like a gang .
We promote policies that bring talented individuals together as teams .
The GOP talks a lot about free markets , where people excel by working in their own self - interest .
However , as their policies suck the chance for real profit out of the market they foster stagnation .
As we replace their policies with those that truly do allow people to reap the rewards of their work , we promote a new golden age of innovation .
The GOP divides us against each other , knowing that artificial notions of red vs. blue distract us from the real issues .
We unite all Americans in the pursuit of prosperity for all .
In GOP Land people succeed depending on how well they ’re plugged into the old - boy network .
Those of us who oppose them believe in creating productivity networks .
GOP policies are patently and exclusively self - serving .
Our vision replaces self - serving with self - sufficient .
It ’s ironic that those who scream the loudest about taxes because they allow others to leech off your hard work are the ones who profit massively off of the work of others .
The truth is that it ’s the GOP hoarding class that leeches off of those who actually produce .
The GOP favors a world where decisions are made in a smoke - filled back room .
We believe democracy and free markets work best when conducted in an open forum .
One of the most important ways that the GOP has gamed the system is through a long war to transform our schools into institutions of indoctrination .
We ’re not afraid of ideas – good ones can be adopted and bad ones defeated by smart minds .
We understand that universal wealth flows from an open system of education that encourages every person to be as brilliant as possible .
Ignorance serves the GOP .
Genius serves us all .
I suspect these linguistic tools are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg , but they should serve to get us started in our mission to create a new vocabulary around wealth .
If we win the battle over over the vocabulary , we will win the war .
Here ’s a more complete list of paired opposites for you to consider and integrate into your own vocabulary .
GOP America inherit achieve hoarding creating stale vibrant haves will - haves special interest public interest old - boy network productivity networks old money new horizons rigged game level playing field walls bridges inbred diversified establishment destiny oppress progress cost value money people exploitation stewardship spin truth stagnate innovate gang team pressure leverage dependent independent aristocracy meritocracy entitled earned fat & happy lean & hungry leech produce collude compete closed open selfish generous privilege justice lock key hold down boost up me us expedient ethical self - serving self - sufficient monolith distributed network lecture discuss few many exclude include discriminate accept reckless responsibility gratuitous accountable abuse enable secret deal fair process backroom open forum fixed fair discrimination equality indoctrination education stigmatize empower shelter invest lay off hire offshore onboard cut costs create value corporate cooperative false promises real hope ideology vision pander promote divide unite fiscally lavish fiscally responsible faith science belief proof anecdotes data born rich aspire to be rich corporate welfare fair corporations
( I do n’t see this list as comprehensive or complete ; I fully expect this list to grow and evolve over time , so feel free to add your own ideas . )
Policies to support the promise
It ’s obviously important that we deliver on this bold new promise .
At every turn , the policies proposed by Democrats , Libertarians , Greens and Independents must ask a simple question : “ in what way are we creating wealth ? ” I do n’t have the time or expertise to address all possible policy ideas here , but I will toss out what I think is an important starting point .
For starters , we have to make sure that people can afford the education they need to fuel their innovative and productive capabilities .
As it is now , the GOP is conducting an appalling War on Education that , among other things , makes sure that only the rich can get a college degree without going into hock until retirement age .
This system does not promote education as a way of climbing to the mountaintop .
It promotes education as a way of digging a very deep hole .
This is counterproductive in every way imaginable .
Instead of a system of financial aid that promotes permanent debt , we need a system that assures universal education .
But that ’s expensive .
No , talking about its expense is a manifestation of doomed cost - based thinking .
Instead , we have to understand that education is an investment not only in the future of the student , but in all our futures .
When that student becomes a brilliant entrepreneur , he creates hundreds , even thousands of jobs .
When she becomes the next Nobel - winning researcher , she innovates a solution to our burgeoning energy problems and ushers in a new age of prosperity for the whole world .
When she becomes a doctor , she finds new and better ways of improving our quality of life .
When he becomes a teacher he inspires a new generation to greater heights than they could have dreamed of .
And so on .
Every dollar spent on education is an investment that generates tens to hundreds to thousands of dollars in returns – something a business - savvy conservative ought to know , but oddly seems not to .
Talk the talk , walk the walk
It has always been true that good thinking leads to good writing and speaking .
However , it is also true that effective language drives better thinking – language is a tool by which the mind engages and changes the reality around it .
This is why we have to begin reframing the language around wealth – when we look at it closely , it ’s not hard to see how a cynical , corrupt Republican vocabulary has led a lot of people to believe and act on ideas that are pure silliness .
To the extent that we can capture the linguistic terrain on which these important wars of ideas are fought , we assure that from here on out the language the public uses to think and decide about economic matters will be dictated by truth and productive , pro-social goals .
As always , I welcome comments on how we can improve these ideas .
Senate Republicans fed up with the war but not ready to abandon Iraq are seeking shelter in legislation that calls for a new war strategy without ordering a troop withdrawal .
The legislative effort , which picked up momentum Wednesday , marks a major departure from the stiff defenses Republicans have mounted since January to shield the White House from the Democratic drive to pressure President Bush to bring the troops home .
And it has prompted a vigorous reaction from the White House , which has dispatched senior officials to Capitol Hill to implore Republicans to wait until September , when the administration plans to deliver a major assessment of the U.S. policy in Iraq .
But more GOP lawmakers are staking out safer middle ground away from the unpopular president while still opposing a withdrawal deadline many see as irresponsible .

“ They are trapped , ” veteran GOP strategist Frank Luntz said .
“ In this day and age and in this environment , you ca n’t just say , ‘ I support the war . ’ ...
They are trying to find a way that is politically acceptable but still allows them to stick to their guns . ”
It is a politically perilous course .
The American public overwhelmingly favors withdrawing from Iraq , not simply adjusting U.S. strategy .
And antiwar activists who have been hounding GOP lawmakers in their home states for months deride the latest Republican proposals as too little too late .

“ There is no refuge for any Republican until the war is over , ” said Tom Matzzie , campaign manager for Americans Against Escalation in Iraq , a leading coalition against the war .
“ The important votes that people are going to pay attention to are the bills that end the war . ”
There is small but growing Republican support for efforts to do that , as the Iraqi government continues to make little progress in meeting goals Congress outlined two months ago .
Republican Sens. Gordon H. Smith of Oregon , Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine have all said they would vote for a measure that would order a withdrawal to begin within 120 days and limit the U.S. combat mission after April 30 .
On Wednesday , seven GOP lawmakers also backed a proposal in the Senate to mandate more time between deployments for soldiers who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan , a measure that would effectively force the Bush administration to reduce the number of troops in Iraq .
The measure , an amendment offered by Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) , a Vietnam War veteran , failed to clear the 60 votes needed , 56 - 41 .

And Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine joined Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) on Wednesday to sponsor a proposal to force the administration to immediately scale back the U.S. combat mission in Iraq .
“ I oppose the current strategy in Iraq and believe it is time to redefine our mission , ” Collins said of the proposal , which would limit U.S. forces to protecting American personnel , training Iraqis , securing Iraq ’s borders and conducing counter - terrorism operations .
But the rise in GOP support for measures challenging the White House still reflects only a fraction of the 49 - member Senate Republican caucus .
A majority succeeded Wednesday in blocking two proposals to limit troop deployments :
In addition to Webb ’s amendment , the Senate failed , 52 - 45 , to reach the 60 votes needed on a proposal from Hagel , another Vietnam War veteran , to cap the time that troops could serve in Iraq .
And most Republicans , even those uncomfortable with the current policy , continue to fervently oppose setting withdrawal dates .
“ It is very , very intemperate policy , ” Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) said on the Senate floor Wednesday , warning that it “ will lead to chaos . ”

Gregg is among a group of more than 40 Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate who are backing a less - restrictive measure that would urge the administration to implement the Iraq Study Group report ’s recommendations .
The bipartisan report released in December made 79 recommendations for a new strategy .
Some are broad , such as calls for a diplomatic initiative in the Middle East and for protecting the rights of women and minorities .
Other are specific , such as installing meters on Iraqi oil pipelines .
Many recommendations have been implemented .
And nothing in the proposals in Congress would compel the administration to alter its strategy .
“ This I would call a respectful nudge , ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) , the leading Senate Republican co-sponsor of the measure .
Alexander and Sen. Ken Salazar ( D - Colo. ) , were trying to attach the measure to the defense authorization bill .

A proposal being created by Sens. Richard G. Lugar ( R - Ind . ) and John W. Warner ( R - Va. ) , two of the party ’s most respected voices on national security and foreign affairs , similarly would only suggest a new mission in Iraq , Lugar said Wednesday .
“ As a practical matter , I do n’t think we can do anything that is going to force the administration , ” said Lugar , who helped set off the latest round of Republican defections with an impassioned critique of the president ’s Iraq strategy he delivered on the Senate floor 2 1/2 weeks ago .
The new GOP efforts have thus far generated a lukewarm response from Democratic leaders .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , a leading congressional war critic , said the Iraq Study Group proposal has “ the teeth of a toothless tiger . ”
But the new measures shift dramatically away from the gestures Republicans were making last spring .
In March , GOP senators responded to a Democratic withdrawal proposal with a resolution that simply expressed opposition to cutting funding to troops in the field .

And several congressional Republicans said they hoped their legislation would have a real effect on the president .
“ It would be a very loud and clear statement , ” said Rep. Michael McCaul ( R - Texas ) , a leading co-sponsor of the House Iraq Study Group legislation .
“ It would intensify pressure . ”
John Isaacs , a war critic who heads the Council for a Livable World , also said the impact of these new Republican legislative gambits should not be underestimated .
“ It ’s a pretty weak amendment , ” Isaacs said of the Iraq Study Group proposal .
“ But it ’s a way station for Republicans to come this far , and on Sept. 15 to take the next step . ”

Times staff writers Paul Richter and Richard Simon contributed to this report .
You know what I am talking about , and you have to admit that it is getting a little sad : they are some of the most ridiculous design patterns in software that are no longer required by physical or operating system demands , but they are still around .
Lazy developers and designers are opting to copy old patterns rather than creatively make use of new opportunities .
And that is what it is , laziness .
Plain and simple .
Welcome to Dead Paradigms , cousin and glasses - wearing cohort of Dead Media .
Web based “ collaboration ” applications are some of the worst offenders here .
Each one is a little funeral for old ideas on a new medium .
The culprits ?
The Team
The concept of a Team is useful in , well , amateur sports .
You want to practice together , build camaraderie and learn to trust eachother .
The Team breaks down in every sport eventually however .
Professional athletes sign individual contracts , become free - agents when they are able and simply go to whichever team will pay them the most .
Professionals should act similarly within their organization .
Having pre-defined teams , or groups , or any other artificial designation is an easy way of not having to deal with human nature — which is to be far more independent and transient .
It is a transference of corporate structure in to your software .
Are n’t you building software to solve a problem , rather than reflect a problem ?
Projects
Tagging helped murder the Project , but it is still hanging around .
Projects have defined beginnings , ends , tasks , milestones , participants and required results .
Real work does not happen in projects .
Projects are what people do when they are n’t doing anything useful .
Real work is ad - hoc .
It takes place when it is needed and it involves only those who need to be involved .
Really great work however , is open to everyone .
Projects counteract this .
They put up walls around what might be really great ideas .
They define who must work on the idea , even if that person is completely disinterested .
Projects can be measured , I concede , but it turns out that ad - hoc groupings are even easier and more valuable to measure .
Because measuring the success of a project can only result in an expected outcome , there is little room to identify patterns , trends and to foresee new needs for the organization .
Measuring and analyzing ad - hoc work and groupings is key to moving an organization ahead .
Permissions
Sometimes they are just a manifestation of Teams / Groups , but more often they are provided as a sort of beaurocratic lithium designed to appease the masses .
There are a few problems that flow from implementing rigid permissions .
The first is that you are n’t just defining what items are protected , you are defining how people can do their jobs .
In industrial - productivity models , we want to limit options in how each person can do their job .
By limiting what they do , and how they do it , we can increase output - efficiency .
Modern organizations have far more complicated needs however , and by increasing the amount of permissioning taking place , you are removing opportunities for self - directed and competent individuals to do their job , which can be many things in many places .
These are the same people who will detest having to ask to have their permissions increased .
And even more toxic paradigm is Visible ( post- action ) Permissioning .
This occurs when you allow an individual to see that an item or resource exists , but you then block their access to it .
Post - action permissioning is the pinnacle of laziness .
It shows that you do not have any appreciation for the end user .
The File
Do I have to say much here ?
Creating a File , Saving a File , Sending a File .
It ’s the one thing that is n’t going to go away for a long time , but it is dead dead dead .
I create content .
Sometimes in little bits , sometimes in bigger pieces .
The Page and The Document
In my mind , blogging killed both the Page and the Document .
Wikipedia uses the page well , but murdered the Document in cold blood .
A Page does not exist , in case you are wondering .
It is a figment of your imagination .
It was first required when we had to limit the size of the press .
Before that , parchment could be as big or as small as needed .
Before that , you certainly did n’t make a stone tablet in standard sizes .
That was wasteful .
So , why are you aiding and abetting the creation of Pages in your applications ?
Especially your web applications ?
Help users create bits of content and help them knit them together .
Save Button
What should a user have to Save that you should n’t have already saved for them ?
Now that PCs have 100 or more gigabytes of hard - drive space , and servers have terabytes of cheap data storage , you can afford to just Save whatever the user is working on .
They do n’t need to name a file , you can name it for them .
They do n’t need to remember where they put it , the user can just use Search to locate it .
Configuration
Applications have to start learning as they go .
If the user clicks on a particular item every time they use your application , why not make that easier for them ?
Applications are getting better at this .
Gmail does a great job of learning who your contacts are .
What opportunities are there for your application to learn from those who know best , your users .
You think you are smart and can make these decisions for them , but if you were really smart you would make software that could learn .
That is what a great teacher does after - all , they teach their pupils to learn .
By Julia Silverman , Associated Press — Calling for the impeachment of President Bush is catching on among those vying to take over Republican Gordon Smith ’s seat in the U.S. Senate .
On Tuesday , Portland lawyer and activist Steve Novick joined the fray , urging the House of Representatives to open impeachment hearings .
Novick is vying for the Democratic nomination with Rep. Jeff Merkley , D - Portland , the Speaker of the Oregon House .
Novick follows Independent candidate John Frohnmayer , who made the call for impeachment a centerpiece of his speech announcing his candidacy last week .
Novick is contending that impeachment is merited because of the administration ’s “ conduct in authorizing the illegal wiretapping of U.S. citizens , and offering faulty intelligence to make the case for the Iraq war , ”  according to a release from his campaign .
Frohnmayer , also an attorney , says that impeachment is warranted because of Bush ’s assertion that he has the authority to set aside any law passed by Congress , should it conflict with his own interpretation of the Constitution .
So far , Merkley has avoided any call for impeachment , though he has repeatedly linked Bush to Smith in speeches , and denounced the administration ’s decisions in the Iraq war .
[…]
Smith , of course , has made no calls for impeachment and regularly votes with the Bush administration on GOP priorities .
Smith voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq in 2002 and publicly supported Bush ’s war strategy until last December , when he called the Iraq policy “ absurd ”  and possibly criminal .

Muslims in the United States are much more assimilated into society than Muslims in Britain and elsewhere in Europe , according to a poll published yesterday .
The detailed survey , conducted by the Washington - based Pew Research Centre , found that American Muslims tended to have a better standard of living than their counterparts in Europe and were more comfortable with a society in which a majority believed in God compared with secular Europe .
Farid Senzai , an adviser on the survey and director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding , said : " The news overall is overwhelmingly positive .
The Muslim community here is less ghettoised than in Europe . "
Andrew Kohut , president of the Pew Research Centre , told a press conference that the estimated 2.4 million Muslims living in the US were " decidedly American in outlook " , believing that hard work could lead to advancement .
But the survey , called Muslim Americans : Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream , did disclose pockets within the community who are disaffected and sympathetic to violence and extremism .
The poll found that 8 % of American Muslims regard suicide bombings against civilian targets as justified .
Twice as many Muslims in Britain , Spain and France see such tactics as justified .
But the poll showed that among American Muslims under 30 , sympathy for suicide bombings jumped to 30 % .
In Britain it jumped to 35 % , Spain 29 % and France 42 % .
Mr Kohut described it as " one of the few troublespots " in the survey .
Support for violence was high too among African - American Muslims , who also tend to be among the most disaffected with their economic and social position .
US intelligence since 9/11 , and the war in Iraq , has focused on the radicalisation of parts of the Muslim community .
Only 40 % of respondents to the Pew poll , which interviewed 1,050 Muslims between January and April , said they believed a group of Arabs carried out the 9/11 attacks .

Warner ambushed by Iraq war protesters
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 16 , 2007 Print This Email This
Protesters from the anti-war group Code Pink confronted Sen. John Warner ( R - VA ) on Sunday with a " Bring the Troops Home Now " banner as he conducted an informal press conference outside following an appearance on ABC's This Week together with Sen. Richard Lugar ( R - IN ) .
Warner , the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and Lugar , the ranking minority member on the Foreign Relations Committee , recently proposed legislation that " would require Bush to submit by Oct. 16 a plan to ' transition U.S. combat forces from policing the civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq ' to a narrow set of missions : protecting Iraqi borders , targeting terrorists , protecting U.S. assets and training Iraqi forces . "
" Our forces are fighting today such that you can freely express your views in public , so allow me to finish my views , " said Warner to the protesters , asking them not to interrupt his statements .
After the press conference , a Code Pink representative challenged Warner , saying , " You said that Iraq is about free speech .
How is the occupation protecting our civil liberties ? "
" Our troops are fighting so that you can do this , " Warner insisted .
" No , they 're not ! " the protesters objected .
" That 's absolutely a disconnect . "
However , they then shook Warner 's hand cordially , saying , " We are delighted you 're taking the first move . "
The following video is from The Associated Press , released on July 15 .
You ever question the power of Facebook ?
I found out about a ministry that I 'm already in love with called Abort73 ... through an ad on Facebook .
And I love this ministry .
Abort73 is a ministry that is fighting to protect the lives of unborn babies .
They are not fighting with silly slogans , clinic bombings , or " chains of life " .
They are fighting with education .
Their website is packed full of information .
A lot of it is stuff I just do n't want to see .
But some people have to see to believe that there is an actual life being taken .
I love how they operate .
Since their weapon is information , much of their resources go toward their website .
They are so sincere about their ministry of education , they have what they call a " flex price " for their merchandise .
In other words , if you want , you can pay what it cost them to make the product .
Or , you can pay more if you feel led to do so , to further the ministry of Abort73 .
Here 's an example :
Their explanation of the flex price is this : " By allowing the buyer to set their own price , we 've made our shirts even more affordable for those with little money to spare , while giving those who are willing and able to pay more the opportunity to invest a few more dollars into this crucial ministry . "
Did I say I love this ministry ? "
Watch this video and then go to their website and buy something .
I 'm buying the shirt I showed above .
New Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) , is calling President Bush 's invasion of Iraq a " stark blunder " and says that his new scheme to send 21,500 more troops into the mess he created is just digging the hole deeper .
I wonder though .
It seems ever more likely to me that this whole mess was no blunder at all .
People are wont to attribute the whole thing to lack of intelligence on the president 's part , and to hubris on the part of his key advisers .
I wo n't argue that the president is a lightweight in the intellect department , nor will I dispute that Cheney , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and that whole neocon gang have demonstrably lacked the virtues of reflection and humility .
But that said , I suspect that the real story of the Iraq War is that Bush and his gang never really cared whether they actually would " win " in Iraq .
In fact , arguably , they did n't really want to win .
What they wanted was a war .
If the war they started had ended quickly with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , that would have served their purposes , at least for the short term .
Bush would have emerged from a short invasion and conquest a national hero , would have handily won re-election in 2004 , and would have gone on to a second term as a landslide victor .
But if it went badly , as it has , they figured he would still come out ahead .
He would be a wartime president , and he'd make full use of that role , expansively misdefining his " commander in chief " title to imply authority over the Congress and the courts , to grab power heretofore unheard of for a president .
This , I suspect , was the grand strategy underlying the attack on Iraq .
If I 'm right , there may have been method to the madness of not building up enough troops for the invasion to insure that U.S. forces could occupy a destroyed Iraq and help it rebuild , method to the madness of allowing looters free sway to destroy the country 's remaining post- invasion infrastructure , method to the madness , even , of allowing remnant forces of Hussein's to gather up stockpiles of weapons and even of high - density explosives , so they could mount an effective resistance and drag out the conflict .
So many apparently stupid decisions were made by people who should clearly have been too smart to make them , from leaving hundreds of tons of high explosives unguarded to cashiering all of Iraq 's army and most of the country 's civil service managers , that it boggles the mind to think that these could have been just dumb ideas or incompetence .
( L. Paul Bremer , for instance , who made the " dumb " decision about dismantelling the Iraqi army , prior to becoming Iraq 's occupation viceroy , had headed the nation 's leading risk assessment consultancy , and surely knew what all the risks were of his various decisions . )
I mean , we expect a measure of idiocy from or elected leaders and their appointees , but not wholesale idiocy !
This disaster has been so colossal , it almost had to have been orchestrated .
If that 's the case , Congress should be taking a hard look at not just the latest installment of escalation , but at the whole war project , beginning with the 2002 campaign to get it going .
Certainly throwing 21,500 new troops into the fire makes no sense whatever .
If 140,000 of the best - equipped troops in the world can't pacify Iraq , 160,000 are n't going to be able to do it either .
You do n't need to be a general to figure that out .
Even a senator or representative ought to be able to do it .
So clearly Congress should kill this plan .
Since it 's not about " winning " the war , it has to be about something else .
My guess would be it's about either dragging things out until the end of 2008 , so Bush can leave office without having to say he 's sorry .
But of course , it could also be about something even more serious : invading Iran .
We know Bush is trying mightily to provoke Iran .
He has illegally attacked an Iranian consulate in Iraq ( an act of war ) , taking six protected consular officials there captive .
He is sending a second aircraft carrier battle group into the Persian Gulf , and is setting up Patriot anti-missile missile bases along Iran 's western border .
This buildup has all the earmarks of a pre-invasion .
All that 's needed now is a pretext - - a real or faked attack on an American ship , perhaps , ala the Gulf of Tonkin " incident " that launched America into the Vietnam War .
The way I see it , either way the president is committing treason , because he is sending American troops off to be killed for no good reason other than for aggrandizing power he should n’t have , and / or simply covering his own political ass .
Treason is the number one impeachable crime under the Constitution , and we 're at a point where Congress is going to have to act or go down in history as having acquiesced in the worst presidential crime in the history of the nation .
Timezone / Date
You have not selected a timezone for eclipse timings , so all times are shown in UT ( essentially GMT ) .
Accuracy Due to the erratic rotation of the Earth , the time and location of the eclipse cannot be forecast perfectly .
This eclipse 's forecast is estimated to be accurate to within 2 km in distance and a few seconds in time .
A total eclipse of the Moon occurred on Tuesday 28 August , 2007 UT , lasting from 07:53 –13:20 UT .
The Moon was plunged into darkness for 1 hour and 30 minutes , in a deep total eclipse which saw the Moon 48 % of its diameter inside the Earth 's umbral shadow .
The visual effect of this depends on the state of the Earth 's atmosphere , but the Moon may have been stained a deep red colour for observers over the Americas , the Pacific , eastern Asia , and Australasia .
The partial eclipse lasted for 3 hours and 32 minutes in total .
The timings of the phases of the eclipse are as follows .
You would have been able to see each phase of the eclipse if the Moon was up at the corresponding time as seen from your location ; however the penumbral phase would have been very difficult to see in practice :
Penumbral eclipse began : 07:53:40 UT
Partial eclipse began : 08:51:16 UT
Total eclipse began : 09:52:21 UT
Maximum eclipse : 10:37:21 UT
Total eclipse ended : 11:22:22 UT
Partial eclipse ended : 12:23:28 UT
Penumbral eclipse ended : 13:20:57 UT
During this eclipse the Moon was just 2 days before perigee , making it fairly large .
At maximum eclipse it was 0.549° in apparent diameter , which is 3.5 % larger than average .

An initial disparity , even if known to the employee , might be small , Justice Ginsburg said , leading an employee , particularly a woman or a member of a minority group “ trying to succeed in a nontraditional environment ” to avoid “ making waves . ”
Justice Ginsburg noted that even a small differential “ will expand exponentially over an employee ’s working life if raises are set as a percentage of prior pay . ”
Justices John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer joined the dissent .
Ms. Ledbetter ’s salary was initially the same as that of her male colleagues .
But over time , as she received smaller raises , a substantial disparity grew .
By the time she brought suit in 1998 , her salary fell short by as much as 40 percent ; she was making $ 3,727 a month , while the lowest - paid man was making $ 4,286 .
A jury in Federal District Court in Birmingham , Ala. , awarded her more than $ 3 million in back pay and compensatory and punitive damages , which the trial judge reduced to $ 360,000 .
But the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit , in Atlanta , erased the verdict entirely , ruling that because Ms. Ledbetter could not show that she was the victim of intentional discrimination during the 180 days before she filed her complaint , she had not suffered an “ unlawful employment practice ” to which Title VII applied .
Several other federal appeals courts had accepted the employment commission ’s more relaxed view of the 180 - day requirement .
The justices accepted Ms. Ledbetter ’s appeal , Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company , No. 05-1074 , to resolve the conflict .
Title VII ’s prohibition of workplace discrimination applies not just to pay but also to specific actions like refusal to hire or promote , denial of a desired transfer and dismissal .
Justice Ginsburg argued in her dissenting opinion that while these “ singular discrete acts ” are readily apparent to an employee who can then make a timely complaint , pay discrimination often presents a more ambiguous picture .
She said the court should treat a pay claim as it treated a claim for a “ hostile work environment ” in a 2002 decision , permitting a charge to be filed “ based on the cumulative effect of individual acts . ”
In response , Justice Alito dismissed this as a “ policy argument ” with “ no support in the statute . ”
As with an abortion ruling last month , this decision showed the impact of Justice Alito ’s presence on the court .
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor , whom he succeeded , would almost certainly have voted the other way , bringing the opposite outcome .
The impact of the decision on women may be somewhat limited by the availability of another federal law against sex discrimination in the workplace , the Equal Pay Act , which does not contain the 180 - day requirement .
Ms. Ledbetter initially included an Equal Pay Act complaint , but did not pursue it .
That law has additional procedural hurdles and a low damage cap that excludes punitive damages .
It does not cover discrimination on the basis of race or Title VII ’s other protected categories .
In her opinion , Justice Ginsburg invited Congress to overturn the decision , as it did 15 years ago with a series of Supreme Court rulings on civil rights .
“ Once again , the ball is in Congress ’s court , ” she said .

Who Will Play Gonzales and Card and Addington in the Hollywood Movie of the Comey Testimony ?
Marty Lederman
Really , if Comey has not already sold the screenplay , he 's missing out on a big payday .
If you have n't already done so , READ THE TRANSCRIPT .
[ This might tell you all you need to know : Dahlia Lithwick gives it her usual sharp - honed , tongue - partly - in - cheek treatment . . . and you can't tell which parts are exaggerated for comic effect and which are true to life ! ]
Here 's the scene : Ashcroft has fallen ill with a severe case of gallstone pancreatitis .
He has handed over the reins of the Department to Comey -- Comey 's the Acting AG .
On March 9th , the same day that Ashcroft has his gall bladder removed , Comey and Goldsmith tell the White House that the NSA program is unlawful and that they wo n't sign off on it .
The President himself , of course , could overrule DOJ on the legal question -- but apparently is unwilling to do so , both because the subsequent resignation of the AG , DAG , and FBI Director would tip off the public that the President trusted David Addington 's jurisprudence more than he trusted the folks at DOJ , and because perhaps the NSA and the phone companies would not look too kindly on the idea of acting in accord with the President 's views when even John Ashcroft did not agree .
So the next evening , the White House -- probably the President himself , by Comey 's account -- calls Mrs. Ashcroft , and implores her to allow Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card to come to GW Hospital to persuade John Ashcroft , in his weakened and drug - induced post - operative state , to sign off on the program , i.e. , to overrule Comey even though Comey is the Acting AG .
Comey gets wind of the impending meeting at the hospital , and he rushes to a waiitng vehicle to get to the hospital -- using emergency equipment ! -- before the White House Chief of Staff and Counsel get there .
Comey ( literally ) runs up the hospital stairs to Ashcroft 's room .
While Comey is waiting for the two high - ranking White House officials to arrive , he calls the Director of the FBI for support , and then the FBI Director speaks to the AG 's security detail and -- this is the best part -- " instructed the FBI agents present not to allow me [ Comey ] to be removed from the room under any circumstances " !
Yes , if you think this sounds familiar , it is -- it eerily resembles the scene in which Michael Corrleone " protects " his father at the hospital in The Godfather .
With Jack Goldsmith as Enzo the Baker , and Alberto Gonzales as McCluskey the crooked cop .
( The President , of course , is Sollozzo .
Comey would be Michael , except that he 's a good 14 inches taller than Al Pacino . . . .
Oh , and then there 's the bit about how Comey refuses to meet with Andy Card -- the President 's Chief of Staff ! -- at the White House without an unbiased third party witness ( SG Ted Olson -- a/k/a Tom Hagen ) . )
And this is how the law is settled these days in the Executive branch of the greatest democracy in the world . . . .
P.S. It 's probably safe to say this is the first time in history that anyone has ever drawn a parallel between John Ashcroft and Marlon Brando .
Edwards launched a new Web site today , SupportTheTroopsEndTheWar.com .
Edwards is proposing that this Memorial Day , we take back patriotism .
I like it .
And his video appeal is well done too .
I ’m on a conference call with a number of Edwards supporters at the moment , and we ’ll be doing a smaller conference call with a few bloggers and Edwards in a few minutes .
As an aside , Edwards is the only major presidential candidate – meaning , versus Hillary and Obama – who has consistently reached out to our blog .
I ’ve defended all three candidates , from time to time , on TV and online .
For example , on CNN ’s Paula Zahn show earlier this week , I defended Hillary against the attacks of a Republican operative who loathed her and a Democrat who felt Hillary was n’t doing enough .
Did n’t hear a peep from her campaign afterwards .
Nor did I hear a peep the previous time I defended Mrs. Clinton on CNN against some rather vicious and demeaning attacks by two GOP operatives .
The Edwards campaign , however , routinely thanks us when we help them .
( I ’d also note that Edwards is the only major candidate to do a blogger conference call , that I know of .
We ’ve been trying to talk to candidate Hillary for a year now .
Nothing .
Oh yeah , Edwards also did n’t demand to know our questions for him in advance , unlike one candidate who wo n’t be named . )
It ’s not about ego and the need to be thanked .
It ’s about not being treated like somehow they ’re doing us a favor by letting us defend them .

Next to buying a home or funding your children 's education , buying a car is the most expensive purchase you 'll make .
And car - related expenses , such as gas , maintenance and insurance , can take a big bite out of your wallet .
Kicking a few tires is only half the battle .
Before you begin looking for a new car , you should know your limits and what you should be spending .
Experts say you should n't spend more than 10 percent of your gross income on car expenses , which includes the cost of the car along with insurance , gas and maintenance .
Once you decide on a price range , you 'll want to decide how much you can put down as a down payment and then negotiate the price of your car .
Too many buyers accept long financing arrangements in order to minimize their down payment .
If they decide to trade the car in the first year or so , they often find that they actually owe more on their car than it 's worth .
A good rule of thumb is never to finance more than 80 percent of the true cost --- the dealer 's invoice --- of the car .
At least 20 percent or more should be paid in cash or the equity of your trade .
Typically , after you negotiate the price of your car , the dealer will send you to their financing department .
While it 's true that dealers may have less restrictive credit requirements than banks , be wary of cut - rate financing deals that they frequently push .
These attractive 3 percent interest rates may apply only to certain models or short - term loans of up to 12 months .
Dealers make a lot of money on financing , even when it 's done through the manufacturer .
Tip :
Always negotiate the price before you reveal that you are thinking about dealer financing .
If they know ahead of time that you plan to finance , they will frequently try to confuse the issue by giving you a lower rate on a higher price or a lower price at a higher finance rate .
If you do decide to finance through the car dealer , you can negotiate the interest rate .
Dealerships usually have several loan sources , including local banks and the manufacturer 's credit company .
Each source sets their rates to the dealer .
It is important to investigate other sources for an auto loan ( such as your bank or credit union ) before you sign on the dotted line .
Investigate your financing options and find out from banks or credit unions if they have any special deals right now .
Another possibility is a home equity loan or line of credit .
With a home equity loan , you are borrowing against the value of your home .
Not only are interest rates lower than those for auto dealer loans , but the interest on home equity loans and lines of credit are usually tax deductible .
Proceed with caution , however , as you are putting your most valued asset on the line to purchase a depreciating asset that can be stolen .
I had read a few complaints that OS X font rendering was a little wonky , even from Joel Spolsky himself :
OS X antialiasing , especially , it seems , with the monospaced fonts , just is n't as good as Windows ClearType .
Apple has some room to improve in this area ; the fonts were blurry on the edges .
I did n't believe it until I downloaded the first beta of Safari 3 for Windows and saw it for myself .
Font rendering in Safari 3 Beta :
Font rendering in Internet Explorer 7 :
All of these screenshots were taken under Windows Vista .
It 's easier to see what 's happening if we zoom in a bit .
These images are zoomed 200 % with exact per-pixel resizing .
Safari on the top , IE7 on the bottom :
At first I was n't even sure if Apple was using ClearType - alike RGB anti-aliasing , but it 's clear from the zoomed image that they are .
It looks like they 've skewed the contrast of the fonts to an absurdly low level .
The ClearType Tuner PowerToy allows you to manually adjust the RGB font aliasing contrast level , as I documented in an earlier blog post , but I do n't think it can go as low as Apple has it set .
I am absolutely not trying to start an OS X versus Windows flame war here .
I used the quote above for a reason : there really is no single best way to render fonts ; results depend on your display , the particular font you 're using , and many other factors .
That said , I 'm curious why Apple 's default font rendering strategies , to my eye -- and to the eyes of at least two other people -- are visibly inferior to Microsoft 's on typical LCD displays .
This is exactly the kind of graphic designer - ish detail I 'd expect Cupertino to get right , so it 's all the more surprising to me that they apparently have n't .
Update : I have a followup post that explains the font rendering difference .
It looks like neither Apple or Microsoft is wrong ; it 's a question of whether you respect the pixel grid .
Over the last three years , this site has become far more popular than I ever could have imagined .
Not that I 'm complaining , mind you .
Finding an audience and opening a dialog with that audience is the whole point of writing a blog in the first place .
But on the internet , popularity is a tax .
Specifically , a bandwidth tax .
When Why Can't Programmers ..
Program ?
went viral last week , outgoing bandwidth usage spiked to nearly 9 gigabytes in a single day :
That was enough to completely saturate two T1 lines -- nearly 300 KB / sec -- for most of the day .
And that includes the time we disabled access to the site entirely in order to keep it from taking out the whole network . *
After that , it was clear that something had to be done .
What can we do to reduce a website 's bandwidth usage ?
1. Switch to an external image provider .
extremely minimalistic , the size of the images dwarf the size of the text .
Consider Unless your website is an all - text affair , images will always consume the lion 's share of your outgoing bandwidth .
Even on this site , which isminimalistic , the size of the images dwarf the size of the text .
Consider my last blog post , which is fairly typical :
Size of post text ~ 4,900 bytes Size of post image ~ 46,300 bytes Size of site images ~ 4,600 bytes
The text only makes up about ten percent of the content for that post .
To make a dent in our bandwidth problem , we must deal with the other ninety percent of the content -- the images -- first .
Ideally , we should n't have to serve up any images at all : we can outsource the hosting of our images to an external website .
There are a number of free or nearly - free image sharing sites on the net which make this a viable strategy : Imageshack
ImageShack offers free , unlimited storage , but has a 100 MB per hour bandwidth limit for each image .
This sounds like a lot , but do the math : that 's 1.66 MB per minute , or about 28 KB per second .
And the larger your image is , the faster you 'll burn through that meager allotment .
But it 's incredibly easy to use -- you do n't even have to sign up -- and according to their common questions page , anything goes as long as it's not illegal .

Flickr
Flickr offers a free basic account with limited upload bandwidth and limited storage .
Download bandwidth is unlimited .
Upgrading to a paid Pro account for $ 25 / year removes all upload and storage restrictions .
However , Flickr 's terms of use warn that " professional or corporate uses of Flickr are prohibited " , and all external images require a link back to Flickr .

Photobucket
Photobucket 's free account has a storage limit and a download bandwidth limit of 10 GB per month ( that works out to a little over 14 MB per hour ) .
Upgrading to a paid Pro account for $ 25 / year removes the bandwidth limit .
I could n't find any relevant restrictions in their terms of service .

Amazon S3
Amazon 's S3 service allows you to direct - link files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage , and 20 cents per GB transfer .
It 's unlikely that would add up to more than the ~ $ 2 / month that seems to be the going rate for the other unlimited bandwidth plans .
It has worked well for at least one other site .
I like ImageShack a lot , but it 's unsuitable for any kind of load , due to the hard - coded bandwidth limit .
Photobucket offers the most favorable terms , but Flickr has a better , more mature toolset .
Unfortunately , I did n't notice the terms of use restrictions at Flickr until I had already purchased a Pro account from them .
So we 'll see how it goes .
Update : it looks like Amazon S3 may be the best long - term choice , as many ( if not all ) of these photo sharing services are blocked in corporate firewalls .
Even though this ends up costing me $ 25 / year , it 's still an incredible bargain .
I am offloading 90 % of my site 's bandwidth usage to an external host for a measly 2 dollars a month .
And as a nice ancillary benefit , I no longer need to block image bandwidth theft with URL rewriting .
Images are free and open to everyone , whether it 's abuse or not .
This makes life much easier for legitimate users who want to view my content in the reader of their choice .
Also , do n't forget that favicon .ico is an image , too .
It 's retrieved more and more often by today 's readers and browsers .
Make favicon.ico as small as possible , because it can have a surprisingly large impact on your bandwidth .
Now that we 've dealt with the image content , we can think about ways to save space on the remaining content -- the text .
This one 's a no - brainer .
Enable HTTP compression on your webserver for roughly two - thirds reduction in text bandwidth .
Let 's use my last post as an example again : Post size 63,826 bytes
Post size with compression 21,746 bytes
We get a 66 % reduction in file size for every bit of text served up on our web site -- including all the JavaScript , HTML , and CSS -- by simply flipping a switch on our web server .
The benefits of HTTP compression are so obvious it hurts .
It 's reasonably straightforward to set up in IIS 6.0 , and it 's extremely easy to set up in Apache .
Never serve content that is n't HTTP compressed .
It 's as close as you 'll ever get to free bandwidth in this world .
If you are n't sure that HTTP compression is enabled on your website , use this handy web - based HTTP compression tester , and be sure .
Many web sites offer RSS feeds of updated content that users can subscribe to ( or " syndicate " ) in RSS readers .
Instead of visiting a website every day to see what has changed , RSS readers automatically pull down the latest RSS feed at regular intervals .
Users are free to read your articles at their convenience , even offline .
Sounds great , right ?
It is great .
Until your ealize just how much bandwidth all that RSS feed polling is consuming .
It 's staggering .
Scott Hanselman told me that half his bandwidth was going to RSS feeds .
And Rick Klau noted that 60 % of his page views were RSS feed retrievals .
The entire RSS ecosystem depends on properly coded RSS readers ; a single badly - coded reader could pummel your feed , pulling uncompressed copies of your RSS feed down hourly -- even when it has n't changed since the last retrieval .
Now try to imagine thousands of poorly - coded RSS readers , all over the world .
That 's pretty much where we are today .
Serving up endless streams of RSS feeds is something I 'd just as soon outsource .
That 's where FeedBurner comes in .
Although I 'll gladly outsource image hosting for the various images I use to complement my writing , I 've been hesitant to hand control for something as critical as my RSS feed to a completely external service .
I emailed Scott Hanselman , who switched his site over to FeedBurner a while ago , to solicit his thoughts .
He was gracious enough to call me on the phone and address my concerns , even walking me through FeedBurner using his login .
I 've switched my feed over to FeedBurner as of 3 pm today .
The switch should be transparent to any readers , since I used some mod_rewrite ISAPIRewrite rules to do a seamless , automatic permanent redirect from the old feed URL to the new feed URL : # do not redirect feedburner , but redirect everyone else RewriteCond User - Agent : (?! FeedBurner ) .* RewriteRule .*index.xml$|.*index.rdf$|.*atom.xml $
http://feeds.feedburner.com/codinghorror/
[ I , RP,L ]
And the best part is that immediately after I made this change , I noticed a huge drop in per-second and per-minute bandwidth on the server .
I suppose that 's not too surprising if you consider that the feedburner stats page for this feed are currently showing about one RSS feed hit per second .
But even compressed , that 's still about 31 KB of RSS feed per second that my server no longer has to deal with .
It 's a substantial savings , and FeedBurner brings lots of other abilities to the table beyond mere bandwidth savings .
The only thing left for us to do now is reduce the size of our text content , with a special emphasis on the elements that are common to every page on our website .
CSS and JavaScript resources are a good place to start , but the same techniques can apply to your HTML as well .
There 's a handy online CSS compressor which offers three levels of CSS compression .
I used it on the main CSS file for this page , with the following results : original CSS size 2,299 bytes after removing whitespace 1,758 bytes after HTTP compression 615 bytes
We can do something similar to the JavaScript with this online JavaScript compressor , based on Douglas Crockford 's JSMin .
But before I put the JavaScript through the compressor , I went through and refactored it , using shorter variables and eliminating some redundant and obsolete code .
original JS size 1232 bytes after refactoring 747 bytes after removing whitespace 558 bytes after HTTP compression 320 bytes
It 's possible to use similar whitespace compressors on your HTML , but I do n't recommend it .
I only saw reductions in size of about 10 % , which was n't worth the hit to readability .
Realistically , whitespace and linefeed removal is doing work that the compression would be doing for us .
We 're just adding a dab of human - assisted efficiency : Raw Compressed Unoptimized CSS 2,299 bytes 671 bytes Optimized CSS 1,758 bytes 615 bytes
It 's only about a 10 percent savings once you factor in HTTP compression .
The tradeoff is that CSS or JavaScript lacking whitespace and linefeeds has to be pasted into an editor to be effectively edited .
I use Visual Studio 2005 , which automatically " rehydrates " the code with proper whitespace and linefeeds when I issue the autoformat command .
Although this is definitely a micro-optimization , I think it 's worthwhile since it reduces the payload of every single page on this website .
But there 's a reason it 's the last item on the list , too .
We 're just cleaning up a few last opportunities to squeeze every last byte over the wire .
After implementing all these changes , I 'm very happy with the results .
I see a considerable improvement in bandwidth usage , and my page load times have never been snappier .
But , these suggestions are n't a panacea .
Even the most minimal , hyper - optimized compressed text content can saturate a 300 KB / sec link if the hits per second are coming fast enough .
Still , I 'm hoping these changes will let my site weather the next Digg storm with a little more dignity than it did the last one -- and avoid taking out the network in the process .
* the ironic thing about this is that the viral post in question was completely HTTP compressed text content anyway .
So of all the suggestions above , only the RSS outsourcing would have helped .
Like you , I ’ve been reading dire reports of declining species for many years now .
They have the value of causing us to pay attention to species in trouble , and the sad fact is that the only species likely to endure are the ones we humans manage to pay attention to .
There was a time when it was better , if you were a nonhuman species , to be ignored by humans because we trapped , shot or otherwise exploited all of the ones that got our attention .
But in the past 40 years , we have killed all those millions of birds or , let us say , unintentionally caused a dramatic population loss , simply by going about business as usual .
Agriculture has intensified .
So has development .
Open space has been sharply reduced .
We have simply pursued our livelihoods .
We knew it was inimical to wolves and mountain lions .
But we somehow trusted that all the innocent little birds were here to stay .
What they actually need to survive , it turns out , is a landscape that is less intensely human .
The Audubon Society portrait of common bird species in decline is really a report on who humans are .
Let me offer a proposition about Homo sapiens .
We are the only species on earth capable of an ethical awareness of other species and , thus , the only species capable of happily ignoring that awareness .
So far , our economic interests have proved to be completely incompatible with all but a very few forms of life .
It ’s not that we believe that other species do n’t matter .
It ’s that , historically speaking , it has n’t been worth believing one way or another .
I do n’t suppose that most Americans would actively kill a whippoorwill if they had the chance .
Yet in the past 40 years its number has dropped by 1.6 million .
In our everyday economic behavior , we seem determined to discover whether we can live alone on earth .
E.O. Wilson has argued eloquently and persuasively that we cannot , that who we are depends as much on the richness and diversity of the biological life around us as it does on any inherent quality in our genes .
Environmentalists of every stripe argue that we must somehow begin to correlate our economic behavior  by which I mean every aspect of it : production , consumption , habitation  with the welfare of other species .
This is the premise of sustainability .
But the very foundation of our economic interests is self - interest , and in the survival of other species we see way too little self to care .
Perhaps more than a week ago , while browsing around my site , I found this shocking message in the comments section :
I really do n’t know why something inside me told me the hacker - like message pointed to the Gravatar plugin installed on this site , but sadly , Googling around confirmed my suspicions .
Apparently it was a debugging message for the Gravatars2 plugin .
… Getting no gravatar back from gravatar.com is very common .
I removed the rougue “ SUCKAGE ” message that I had been using for testing .
Oops . :)
You can download the latest 2.5.3 release to get rid of that .
It only shows up when the gravatar downloaded from gravatar.com should have been valid , but was n’t ( the reason for the previous emergency release ) … »
Putting a message like that may seem fun ( in a geeky way obviously ) when it ’s for personal use only , but if you ’re writing it inside code somebody else will see , and might possibly get scared of , do n’t put it there !
But then I guess this is no MP and we are not teachers who can scold you for such silliness .
This is real life .
Gravatars
A gravatar is a globally recognized avatar .
A user can store an image that represents one online .
Upon registration the image is tied to the email address used during signup .
In order to be “ globally recognized , ” though , websites have to install code that recognize and display gravatars , say when a person comments on the website .
In my case , I ’m using WordPress , which has a plugin called Gravatars2 for supporting gravatars .
I like the concept of gravatars because it ’s hardly an endeavor that takes advantage of people .
It ’s just there to make the Internet more interesting .
Kinda like Intention Cloud and Totally Deserved .
But this may be exactly why Gravatar is experiencing problems .
Gravatar has been down for quite sometime ; that is , the site is currently closed to any new signups and it ’s got error messages all over .
This maintenance mode has been around for a long time now , which has me worried , even if it promises it wo n’t shut down .
It ’s not the same reason the WordPress plugin displayed the glaring glitch , but I started to wonder : what is the Web 2.0 world doing about this ?
The Next ( insert letter here ) Avatar
I ’m not talking about an OpenID or some other online identity system that ’s way too pompous for the layperson ’s simple whimsy .
So that thrown aside , are there any contenders for the role of gravatars in the webosphere ?
A favatar uses the favicon associated with the URL given instead of mapping an image to an email address .
The problem with this method is not everyone likes to make favicons as much as they like to make avatars .
I do n’t !— because favicons by default are so small !
16 x 16 pixels is just not my cup of tea .
Here ’s a WordPress plugin for favatars .
On the other hand , a pavatar is short for “ personal avatar . ”
Like favicons , they are usually stored on one ’s own server or image hosting account unlike gravatars stored on the Gravatar server .
To associate a pavatar to a URL , the following HTML code should be added to the home page of the said address :
< link rel= " pavatar " href = " http://example.com/path/my-pavatar.png " />
The other option is to upload the image as “ pavatar.png ” in the home page .
I like these two solutions because they come through where gravatar fails .
They also behave as though you ’re entering the URL for your avatar as you comment on a post without having to enter the exact image path anyway as it is already implied by the website you ’ve entered .
Of course , this is problematic for people with multiple personalities on the web .
Or those that do n’t have the authority to edit the home page HTML or save files to the home page folder .
I think that ’s why gravatars became popular .
What , No Web 2.0 Solution ?
What , no brilliant solution to this fairly simple whim ?
It ’s nothing a Web 2.0 application or hype could n’t possibly provide .
Maybe I missed a TechCrunch or Mashable ! post .
Identikit ( translated ) is a WordPress plugin that supports [ ( gr ) |p|f ] avatars .
That ’s just for WordPress though .
Still , I fear MySpace will become so large that it will set the standard for one ’s own online identity and that so many other web applications will bow down to it — if they have n’t yet .
I ’m talking about the personal side of the web , where identity matters , and not the corporate , formal , starchy part .
Which briefcase - bearing , suit - slinging git is interested in avatars anyway ?

Just what has happened to Courtney Love ?
The singer is a shadow of her former attractive self , and appears to be afflicted with a skin condition which has left her mouth looking sore and scabby .
The widow of dead rocker Kurt Cobain arrived at the Groucho Club in London sans make - up unwittingly revealing her scabbed mouth and spotty skin .
Scroll down for more ...
But being greeted by a posse of photographers as she arrived in a rickshaw was enough to drive Love to cover up the unattractive blemishes on her mouth .
And unsurprisingly , by the time she left , Love had applied a heavy - duty coating of make - up including a generous application of red lipstick .
Scroll down for more ...
However , the make - up did little to hide her increasingly freakish appearance .
In a message on her MySpace site , she recently revealed her regret at having had cosmetic surgery on her mouth during what she referred to as " my dark years . "
Love has since had corrective procedures but said her " mouth still looks wonky " and " I have to restore myself to not looking ridiculous . "
Scroll down for more ...
The actress and singer has also taken to wearing unnaturally bright blue contact lenses , and her shrunken outfit did little for her dramatically slimmed down body .
Despite the major weightloss , a reported 44 - pounds , it appears that her methods may be exacting a heavy toll on her once attractive looks as Love looks far from healthy .
Her straw - coloured hair is almost a perfect match for her deathly pallor , and the low - riding jeans , and cropped shirt she 's wearing do little to flatter her size zero figure .
Love , credits her new figure to visits to a clinic for " colonics and fasting " several times a year and eating a daily diet of two meal replacement shakes and " fish and macrobiotic food . "
Love explained : " Some people think it 's about weight loss , but it 's about detoxing . "
Scroll down for more ...
And she blasted actresses who claim their svelte figures are down to a healthy diet .
She said : " I hate reading magazines where the actresses are saying , ' Broccoli and fish , broccoli and fish . '
You liars .
You bulimic liars . "
Love underwent the lifestyle change after packing on pounds last year .
The reformed drug addict finshed her last stint in rehab , over two years ago .
Meanwhile , she recently revealed she is looking to her fans to provide inspiration for the lyrics for a new track after suffering a bout of writer 's block .
Scroll down for more ...
The former Hole frontwoman is finding it difficult to write fresh material and is calling on her loyal followers to help .
She wrote on her MySpace blog : " I need some help with lyrics .
" If I use them you will get a publishing fee .
If you feel more comfy copywriting before sending them , that 's cool too . "
One person she might want to avoid while visiting the UK is X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne .
Sharon alleged Courtney gave son Jack Osbourne drugs .

When the war in Lebanon ends , the US will have to piece together a whole new strategy for dealing with Iran – especially its nuclear program .
The Israeli- Hizbullah war has boldly ratcheted up Iran 's regional stature at the same time it has depleted US influence and prestige .
From the outset , the Lebanese conflict was about more than just Hizbullah .
Jerusalem and Washington were quick to point the finger of blame for the conflict at Iran , and it was with Iran in mind that Israel unleashed the full force of its air power in Lebanon .
The US , too , saw shock and awe in Beirut as an opportunity to convince Tehran of the West 's determination to bring it into compliance on the nuclear issue .
Tehran cleary received the message and viewed the US - backed Israeli war on Hizbullah as the first stage of a war on Iran .
But Tehran also used the occasion to send a message of its own to Washington .
While dutifully denying a direct role in the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers , Tehran nevertheless heaped praise on Hizbullah , hoping that its engagement with Israel might dampen enthusiasm for a military attack on Iran .
To further drive this point home , Hizbullah surprised Israel and the US by successfully testing a number of Iranian - made advanced weapons systems .
Iran 's ties to Hizbullah run deep .
It was Iranian clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders who first organized Hizbullah in the 1980s .
Since then , Tehran has bankrolled and armed Hizbullah 's war machine .
Many among the current leadership of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards have served tours of duty at Hizbullah 's headquarters in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon .
Over the past two decades , Hizbullah has evolved into a Lebanese political force , but it continues to rely on Iranian support to sustain its military capabilities .
Average Iranians resent their government 's generous support for Hizbullah when unemployment and poverty plague the Iranian economy , and many bristle at the risk that support for Hizbullah carries for Iran .
But Iran 's leaders see Hizbullah as an ally and an asset .
Hizbullah is a fruit of the Iranian revolution – the only time its seed found fertile soil outside Iran .
Tehran cannot back away from Hizbullah without acknowledging that the revolution is over .
Iran 's hard - line leaders , looking to rekindle revolutionary fervor at home , see their own values reflected in Hizbullah .
Nor will Tehran easily give up on a pro- Iranian force in the heart of the Arab world and an important instrument in confronting Israel and the US .
Tehran has basked in Hizbullah 's new - found glory , taking credit for a popular military adventure that has greatly weakened Iran 's traditional regional rivals – Jordan , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia .
Iran had hoped that its cooperation with the US in rebuilding a post - Taliban Afghanistan would lead to an opening in the relations between the two countries .
But Washington was not keen to build on that initiative .
It refused to engage Iran over the future of Iraq and instead focused its energies on containing Iranian influence in the Persian Gulf and rolling back Iran 's nuclear program .
In the Lebanese conflict , Iran has found an opportunity to underscore its regional importance .
The Iran - Hizbullah axis has hijacked the Palestinian cause and redefined the Arab - Israeli conflict .
Neither criticism by Arab governments nor fatwas ( religious edicts ) by radical Sunni clerics have slowed down Hizbullah 's and Iran 's rising stock .
As the US looks for a way out of the crisis , it is increasingly evident that it is Iran 's and not Washington 's traditional allies in the region that hold the key to solving the crisis , and Tehran hopes that Washington will come to realize that without Iranian cooperation it cannot ensure regional stability .
With a population of close to 70 million , more than 70 percent of which is literate , a vibrant culture , and a geographic spread from Central Asia and the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf , Iran is today a rising power in the Middle East .
Its large market , economic output , industrial potential , and vast oil and natural gas reserves make it central to American geostrategic and energy interests .
Over the past two decades , Tehran has nurtured cultural , economic , and political ties with various regional forces , most notably the Shiites of Iraq .
These ties confirm Iran 's regional status , just as they make it more difficult for the US to bring stability to the arc stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon without Iran .
In the coming months , Washington will have to look for ways to deal with a bullish Iran .
A policy of isolation and intimidation will no longer yield results and will serve to further destabilize the Middle East .
Hizbullah 's tenacious resistance has moreover devalued military power as a deterrent .
The war has not only failed to subdue Hizbullah militarily , but has made it politically stronger .
US objectives and interests would be better served by giving Iran a vested interest in stability .
That means including Iran in a new regional security framework .
The US should continue to demand that Iran curb its nuclear activities , abandon support of terrorism , and respect the democratic aspirations of Iranians .
The difference would be that with regime change no longer a threat , Iran will be more likely to find reasons to change its course .
