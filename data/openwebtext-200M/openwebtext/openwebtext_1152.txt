Science fiction is an existential metaphor , that allows us to tell stories about the human condition .
Isaac Asimov once said : " Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today — but the core of science fiction , its essence has become crucial to our salvation , if we are to be saved at all . "
Those words were uttered in an afterward at the end of the 200th episode of Stargate : SG1 by an guest actor in an otherwise comic storyline .
For all intents and purposes , it is a throwaway by a non-recurring character , but I still tear up whenever I hear that line because it goes to the core of why I love science fiction .
Many of the people involved in that episode , and most of the original series for that matter , are also involved in Stargate Universe , and if the premiere episode is any indication , the spirit of that attitude towards science fiction storytelling is alive and well .
This stage in the Stargate experience , coming after 10 years of the original SG1 series and five of the also excellent Atlantis , is something new .
It is a Stargate that could n't have been made before the success of the dark and powerful Battlestar Galactica , and I 'm sure a lot of the tone of this new show owes much to BSG 's legacy of gritty realism .
But in a way , SGU hits even closer to home because its gritty realism is a lot closer to the reality we know .
If you do n't know your Stargate history , the basics are this :
Millennia ago , an advanced race known as " The Ancients " created a network of stargates - portals through space - linking world all across our galaxy , and into the next .
The Ancients ascended to become beings of pure intellect , and removed themselves from the material world , leaving behind their technology .
Later on , a generally nasty race of parasites called the Goa'uld came along and mastered much of the Ancient technology , and started setting themselves up as gods wherever they went .
Including stopping by Earth and adopting many of our ancient cultures so as to better rule us .
We humans kicked them out way back in Egyptian times .
In the 1920's , we discovered a buried Stargate .
In the 1990 's we figured out how to activate it .
For the next dozen years or so , we explored our galaxy , and the next one over , fighting a whole batch of Goa'uld and other cosmic baddies , slowly gaining really cool technology and secretly using it to protect the planet , and the rest of the universe .
In very , very brief terms , that represents what Stargate : SG1 and Stargate Atlantis gave us : one of the longest - running and most richly - developed science fiction narratives ever created .
Producers Brad Wright and Robert Cooper gave us over three hundred hours of programming , and a background of technology and galactic history to surpass pretty much anything else on TV or film .
But the one thing you could always depend upon with Stargate was that the heroes - even if they died - would always win out .
The Stargate of those two shows was always based on a heroic - epic model of storytelling : if a primary character was put in jeopardy , it would only last an episode or two , and then everything would be okay again ( well , maybe it would take a season , like when Daniel Jackson died and ascended to become an Ancient himself for a while ) .
It was the nature of episodic television , and that was okay .
Stargate Universe does n't seem to agree with that .
Indeed , Wright and Cooper seem determined that SGU take strides beyond what we expect from episodic television .
Never under estimate your audience .
They 're usually sensitive , intelligent people , who will respond positively to quality entertainment .
That 's another quote from " 200 " ( it was a very meta episode ) , and also an idea that shines through in SGU 's premiere .
The episode uses a very familiar back - and - forth narrative structure , showing us current events , and and jumping back to what set those events up .
Typical television that uses this structure will invariably add screen graphics telling us " Two Days Ago , " or " Now , " because studio executives generally feel that viewers are idiots who can't follow a non-linear narrative .
SGU does n't do this .
SGU starts in the present , in spectacular fashion as people escaping some kind of danger are flung out of a stargate into a dark room on a dark ship , often landing on top of each other .
Then it pops back to show us some of the characters and their stories leading up to the scene , and THERE'S NO HAND - HOLDING !
The narrative jumps just happen , and we get them .
They make sense , they work , they have dramatic impact , and they make for good entertainment .
That 's storytelling , and it's a good sign that SGU respects its audience - all any good geek really wants .
Well , that and some cool tech .
Which SGU also has a -plenty .
What 's also very good about the premiere is how small it really is .
The span of time that passes is really only hours in the lives of the characters .
They are all brought together in one place , something really bad happens , and then they are thrown onto the Destiny , an Ancient ship traveling from galaxy to galaxy on a sort - of automated landlord 's tour of every stargate seeded across billions of lightyears of space .
And between the start of the episode and the end , all they really achieve is that a bunch of people die , and they buy themselves about 24 hours to live .
But what also happens is some tremendous character work that usually takes a show a season to establish and flesh out .
I do n't have the time to cover every character or actor , but I 'll list two standouts .
The first is Robert Carlyle as Dr. Nicholas Rush .
Rush is the brains behind the project to unlock the secret of the " ninth chevron " - basically figuring how to call really , really long - distance with a Stargate .
He 's obsessed with the project , and knows that unlocking vast galactic mysteries is just past the next corner , which makes him a little unstable , a little untrustworthy , and yet vital to the survival of everyone who ends up on Destiny .
Carlyle , best know in the states for The Full Monty , and his turn as a Bond baddie , just owns this role .
The subtlety of his reactions and the guarded , damaged passion of his desire to not be hated by those who depend upon his genius for their survival is amazing to watch .
The second is David Blue as Eli Wallace , the " comic relief . "
Well , there 's not a ton of comedy to the premiere of SGU ( something that may turn some of the SG faithful away ) , but the Eli character delivers what there is as the everyman representing ( in a way ) we as viewers .
But what 's really awesome is that he 's a true geek - indeed , his situation is one that many a geek has dreamed ( or even role - played ) .
In true Last Starfighter style , Eli is recruited to help the Stargate program after he solves a puzzle seeded in a popular videogame released to the public .
He is the ideal of the geek thrust into the totally awesome sci- fi situation , and he handles it like we as geeks know we would : he steps up to the plate using his geeky know - how to help .
And he takes pictures of everything with his iPhone .
The big question that hangs over all this is whether this is just a re-hash of Star Trek : Voyager , and will it suffer the same fate as Gilligan 's Spaceship : losing itself in alien - of - the - week stories and never daring to live up to its true narrative potential .
Time will tell , but from the impressive achievements of the premiere , I 'd say no .
Stargate Universe has a rich destiny all its own , and is on a course to achieve it .
Stargate Universe premieres October 2nd on Syfy .
For a long time now , Lamborghini has been supplying the Italian State Police with a new custom Gallardo each time there is a model refresh .
The most current vehicle in their fleet is a Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 - 4 capable of 203 mph , all decked out in blue and white po po livery , with flashing lights and all .
But what if Ferari ’s latest and greatest 458 Italia was introduced into this elite crime fighting squad ?
That ’s the question that artist S0ulcreat1ve has tried to answer with his quick police concept of the newest and fasest ‘ prancing horse ’ out of Maranello .
As for the current Lambo operated by the Italian Polizia Municipale , this Gallardo LP560 - 4 is pretty extraordinary .
It comes outfitted with all the latest gadgets and gizmos for running down crooks .
For example , an automatic licence plate registration system tracks and transmits plate information in real time to central command .
Specially mounted cameras offer live feeds from the car ’s vantage points to any police office .
The compartment that serves as a trunk in the front is used to carry a first - response medical kit and a refrigerated box for organ transplants that need a high - speed method of delivery .
You could just use a Life Flight helicopter but why bother when you ’ve got a Lamborghini LP 560 - 4 .
In any case , who knows if a Ferrari 458 Italia will ever come to light as a Polizia edition , but it ’s always nice to dream .
S0ulcreat1ve has made an impressive pass at this concept and we ’ll look forward to more from his creative mind .
For the time being , check out his video montage below as well as the real life photos of the Lamborghini currently in use .

Here ’s how it works for most of us : we decide that we need a vacation .
Somewhere sunny , somewhere hot .
We find a good vacation deal with Expedia.com ( or these secret prices on hotels from Orbitz , book it , and then load up on sunscreen .
You do n’t want to get sunburned while you ’re on vacation , right ?
Well … the situation is actually more complicated than that .
Every time when we go out , we make it a point to bring with us our sunscreen to prevent our skin from coming into direct contact with the sunlight .
We have been taught since we were little kids that direct sunlight may cause skin cancer and other terrible skin ailments .
Our dalliance with the sunscreen is therefore understandable because nobody wants to get cancer .
Nobody even wants to have any sort of disease that may leave ugly spots on their skin , leave alone having many health effects .
Better safe than sorry , right ?
What is Vitamin D ?
Vitamin D is often considered more of a hormone than a vitamin because it serves many functions in the body and its deficiency has many effects .
It is responsible for bone growth and bone remodeling .
Its deficiency makes the bones thin , weak and sometimes misshapen .
This could cause rickets in children and osteomalaciain adults .
It has other functions in the body as well , such as enhancing cell growth , body immunity and reducing inflammation .
It is therefore a very important vitamin in the body .
Here is why we need vitamin D .
Vitamin D Deficiency
Research has shown that increased sunscreen use has led to reduced production of Vitamin D in many people ’s bodies .
The reason for this is that many sunscreens have components such as SPF 15 and oxybenzone that hinder the production of vitamin D by great levels .
The research , which was published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association , found that approximately one billion people around the world suffer from Vitamin D deficiency .
This accounts for 14 % of the entire world population , indicating a cause for concern .
Researchers found that there are two main causes of Vitamin D deficiency ; chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes and inadequate exposure to the sun .
What to Do
But how do we ensure Vitamin D production in our bodies ?
Do we risk cancer by busking in the sun with our skin unprotected for lengthy periods ?
Well , no .
Not quite .
The most present source of vitamin D is direct sunlight .
There are vitamin D receptors in arguably every cell in the human body .
Therefore , the best way to increase the vitamin ’s production in the body is by ensuring that your skin comes into contact with direct sunlight over substantial amounts of time o a regular basis .
Doctors advice that we spend between five and thirty minutes out in the midday sun at least two times every week to ensure sufficient production of the vitamin .
During these sessions , it is important not to apply sunscreen on your skin due to its Vitamin D production hindrance tendencies .
Julian Hunte , the West Indies board president , has said that the Indian cricket board shot down a proposal mooted by the ICC to organise Test cricket around the four - year Test championship cycle .
Hunte 's revelation - the first official disclosure by an ICC board member following reports that the Test championship plan had faded - came in his report at the annual general meeting of the West Indies Cricket Board ( WICB ) this month .
" Initially , the ICC attempted to change the structure of the FTP beginning from 2012 in which international cricket would have more content and would play more as a Super League with a 4 - year structure resulting in a World Cricket Championship [ but this ] failed when the BCCI rejected that proposal , " Hunte said .
" This meant a return to the old practice of full members agreeing to a schedule of tours , which in effect places the power in the hands of the four biggest commercially valued members . "
Hunte does not mention who those four are , but it is common knowledge that the boards of India , England , Australia and South Africa enjoy a dominating presence in the ICC boardroom .
India earns a bulk of its revenue from TV rights and hence is not keen on a championship model that would lead to the setting up of a common broadcast cash pot .
It has , consequently , successfully pushed for the existing model , where members arrive at bilateral agreements with the danger of those at the bottom of the table being marginalised .
The post -2012 FTP is currently being finalised by the ICC , and Hunte said that the WICB " will seek to ensure that it is not disadvantaged " in the new schedule .
Hunte also claimed , in a section of the report that deals with IPL , that some ICC full members remain suspicious of the motives of private promoters in the game , and concluded by saying that world cricket is at the crossroads and much depends on decisions that will be taken by the ICC .
Hunte 's report deals extensively with the WICB 's dispute with its players that forced West Indies to name a second - string squad for the series against Bangladesh and the forthcoming Champions Trophy .
But those comments are on expected and previously stated lines and Hunte blames the players for choosing not to represent the team and showing the " highest form of disregard and disdain for West Indies cricket " .
What is surprising , though , is that the document , which is essentially a report on West Indies cricket , contains significant comments on the FTP and IPL .
He lists a set of concerns related to the rise of Twenty20 cricket while also admitting that players have " embraced " the BCCI 's IPL with its auctions and high - profile owners .
" The emergence of private promoters in cricket has been much debated and some Full Member countries retain their inherent suspicion of the real objectives of such promoters .
The ICC has drawn the line in relation to other leagues such the as ICL , which are not recognised by their home boards .
Conversely , decision - making at the ICC affecting the IPL is often seemingly under the influence of some Full Members .
The WICB remains convinced that Full Members should in some way benefit financially from the IPL and expect to see a general tightening up with respect to the issuance of Non-Objection Certificates .
With many challenges to be faced and overcome , the future of world cricket is now at the crossroads and much depends on the decisions which will have to be taken by ICC in the near future . "
Hunte 's concerns about the IPL are not surprising given that one of the roadblocks in the dispute between the West Indies board and players is the question of participation in the IPL .
Many of the West Indies players , including Chris Gayle , had wanted to be part of this year 's IPL but were forced to fly to England midway to take part in a Test series that they claimed was arranged without obtaining prior consent from their association .
The IPL - which comes under the BCCI - has since clarified that players who have retired and even those not on central contracts with their national boards need to get a two - year NOC from their boards to be eligible for the IPL .
The Champions League Twenty20 , of which the BCCI is a founding partner , has also invited Trinidad and Tobago , the West Indies ' domestic toppers in the format , to participate in the tournament starting October 8 with total prize money of $ 6 million and a guaranteed fee of $ 500,000 , apart from an unspecified payment for the respective national boards .
Not all Catholics agree with the church on this issue , and just this week over one hundred people joined a new group called Catholics for Marriage Equality .
" My model is Jesus and Jesus preached and practices love and inclusion .
That 's what I hope our church would do , " Elaine McGillicuddy said .
This was not the first time Maine 's Catholic Church has done a special collection to raise money to fight a controversial referendum question .
It was also done to fight partial birth abortions and physician assisted suicide .
Stand for Marriage campaign manager Marc Mutty said for the church , this is not a political issue -- it is a moral one .
And that asking parishioners to fund this cause was something the bishop felt compelled to do .
" It was crystal clear : it was his responsibility , his duty to do this , " Mutty said .
Not all Catholics agree , but Stand for Marriage hopes it can count on enough parishioners to use the power of prayer and the pocketbook to defeat same - sex marriage in Maine .
The raging debate over healthcare continued Saturday with the two major political antagonists trumpeting their arguments for and against changes in policy that could impact every American .
That would be President Obama and -- no , not Congressman Joe “ You Lie ! ” Wilson -- conservative broadcast dynamo Glenn Beck .
On his Saturday morning radio and YouTube broadcast , Obama spoke of “ an anxiety that ’s keeping more and more Americans awake at night . ”
“ Over the last twelve months , nearly six million more Americans lost their health coverage -- that ’s 17,000 men and women every single day .
We ’re not just talking about Americans in poverty , either -- we ’re talking about middle - class Americans .
In other words , it can happen to anyone … I refuse to allow that future to happen .
In the United States of America , no one should have to worry that they ’ll go without health insurance -- not for one year , not for one month , not for one day .
And once I sign my health reform plan into law -- they wo n’t . ”
Then the President boarded Air Force One for a quick trip to Minneapolis for a rally on health insurance reform .
Meanwhile , back in Washington Beck was broadcasting live on the Fox News Channel as part of something he ’s dubbed “ The 9 - 12 Project . ”
The occasion was a “ tea party ” march and rally organized by “ FreedomWorks ” to protest the “ irresponsible government takeover of our nation ’s healthcare , devastating new energy taxes , and trillions of dollars in red ink . ”
Some 450 tour buses were expected to bring protesters from around the country .
FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon predicted that it would be “ the largest gathering of fiscal conservatives that we ’ve ever had in the nation ’s capital . ”
Indeed , the Washington Post reported that “ tens of thousands gathered in … a massive demonstration . ”
“ Nobody ’s standing up for us , so we have to stand up for ourselves , ” said Phil Chancey , 66 , who drove to the District from Clinton , Tenn. , for the rally .
The sign he carried , deriding the president healthcare reform plan , read , “ OBAMACARE MAKES ME SICK . ”
In Minneapolis , meanwhile , Obama spoke for 40 minutes to what seemed like an enthusiastic campaign event -- rallying the faithful and no doubt gaining personal political energy himself .
For one thing , he said , the crowd was “ a lot more fun ” than the members of Congress he had addressed Wednesday evening .
There , and in his radio address , he pointed to new data that adds up to sobering news for many Americans -- especially the middle class comprising most of the population of those who already have health insurance .
Based on a sample of more than 17,000 respondents from 1997 to 2006 , a Treasury Department study found that 48 percent of Americans are uninsured at some point in a 10 - year span and that the number jumped to 57 percent when taking people under age 21 into account .
" If you 're under the age of 21 today , chances are more than half that you 'll find yourself uninsured at some point " over the next decade , Obama said .
" And more than one - third of Americans will go without coverage for longer than one year . "
As Congress gets closer to settling on a healthcare reform bill , you can be sure that the President -- and his detractors -- will become even more vocal on the issue .

Monkey Fishing
The basement of a nameless university had several large skips full of assorted monkey body parts , scavenged from various zoos over the years , preserved lovingly in alcohol / water mix .
Like olives , only more like fetid monkey soup with chunks .
Seemingly , these had been thrown in , without any thought for proper cataloguing .
How careless .
Enter me , with shoulder length rubber gloves , and , a gasmask , sorry " industrial respirator " .
We had to go in pairs , in case someone fell in and drowned .
Gave up on the respirators in the first five minutes because they were too bulky .
Fish around up to your shoulder in monkey soup , pull out a body part , and guess what it is - attach a tag with a staple gun , and stick it back in .
What 's this in the bucket ?
Oh , it 's a binbag .
Do you want to open the binbag , boys and girls ?
No ?
Well , I 'll do it then .
Oh look .
It 's a dismembered chimpanzee .
That or we 've found Jeff Dahmer 's secret stash .
Best of all , after about half an hour , the alcohol fumes get you drunk as a lord .
Great , until you remember you 're drunk on monkey fumes .
What is that , Dr von Strome ?
You need me in the lab - or - a - tory ?
Helga will be happy to oblige .
You 'll be glad to know there were no lasting after - effects .

Paid to take coke
Over here in the Netherlands , I took part in a medical study in a town called Groningen .
We had to stay at the clininc for 3 nights and take smallish amounts of very pure cocaine during the day .
I was paid about 300 quid and my train travel for doing so .
I was reluctant to leave .

Baggage handling ( for £ infinity p/h )
I spent three months , immediately following my graduation , being paid to * not* handle baggage at Gatwick .
It was when Servisair were bidding for the Heathrow Terminal Five baggage handling contract .
Somewhat speculatively , they recruited around 300 new staff to show how serious they were - this was back in the days when there was a still a suspicion that T5 might be finished before all the recruits reached retirement .
They trained us ( five days driving baggage trolleys in figure eights at RAF Swindon ) , signed three month contracts with us and told us to go home and wait to be summoned .
After a week 's waiting , I got bored and got a cash - in - hand job picking apples on a local fruit farm .
After a month I got really bored and moved to Cambridge where I answered the phone in a dog food factory by day and supervised second year undergraduate geology students in the evenings , all this time collecting my full wage from Servisair .
The first communication I rceived from Servisair was notification that my three month contract was up and that they were very sorry to have to let me go .
My favourite part ?
The effusive reference they gave me despite my never having done a single second 's work for the £ 3,500 they paid me .

Run round Soho drinking double shots of tequila !
This would be about 2001 shortly after I stoped working in IT .
I was then working as a guitar technician and I had just landed a contract with a quite well know group .
I got a call saying they wanted to meet me as I had been hired not by the group but by the agency .
I 'm guessing the wanted to see what toss pot the had been saddled with .
So , three hours later finds me in the intrepid Fox in Soho I had been chatting to the guys and gal for about an hour and was on my third bottle of Dog ( Newcastle Brown Ale [ I do n't know - Do n't ask ] ) .
This is the point where I am told that they have very little faith in the agency and would like to test me to see if I know my stuff .
I 'm expecting them to ask me questions , instead they give me a fifty quid note , and tell me to find a guitar shop , buy a certain set of strings and get there and back downing a double tequilla at every bar I pass on the way back .
Once I get back I then have to then restring and tune the guitar ( an electric in a noisy room .
Almost impossible as there is no amp ) .
On top of this I have 15 minutes to perform the whole feat !
Now I know that some of you are familiar with Soho but for those who are not soho is made up of mainly three things ; strip clubs , brothels and bars .
We 're talking a lot of tequilla .
A lot of double tequilla !
Fortunately I know Soho very well ( no the bars !
get your mind out of the gutter .
The bars and there are a lot of production compaies there [ again get your mind out of the gutter .
Music production ! ] ) .
I make straight for the nearest shop but this still took me past a good seven or eight bars .
You do the maths !
I arrive back with five minutes to so and the growing desire to eat something spicy containing synthetic meat preferable with killer chilli sauce with it .
I spend about the next three minutes restringing the guitar answering dubious question ranging from ' were they all doubles ? ' to ' I do n't believe you went to all the bars ! '.
Being freelance and a mercenary bastard I furnished them with recepts .
To be honest I would have liked to have sat down with a nice tandoori , and I did , unfortuately it was about eight hours later after a great deal more alcohol .
But they were nice enough to give me some smelling salts that were quite restorative .

the good times
i work in the film industry and i was sent to mexico while we filmed troy with brad pitt - face to agree a consumable contract ( i could do this on the phone ) .
anyway when i got there a storm had blown all the equipment and sets into the sea so i got an even better deal plus damages etc , then spent 2 months sunbathing while lying to my boss it was taking a long time :D i made around £ 10 k personally for that trip plus the suntan , the 5 * hotel , the drinks and fucking good laugh with the sparks .
i also went to ireland to work on a film and the truck was delayed for 2 weeks with the equipment so we spent our days getting hammered in dublin while getting paid and using our daily allowances to finance cock fighting !
when at school i got paid £ 500 to play monopoly for a week for market research .
i didnt play once and gave a speech on why i liked the free parkng rule .
i have also been paid to test drive a go - kart track in spain , to blow up stuff for a dutch tv show and brush my teeth every hour for a week to see if my gums wore away quicker !
all in all i have had some pretty tasty jobs but then again i have had some bad experience but those stories are for another week ...

Three pounds an hour , time and a half overtime .

Told a mate once
that his parents had been paying us to be his friends for the last two years , because they knew how social inadequate he was .
We then said they hadnt payed us that day , so we were gonna show him our true feelings .
Which of course meant ripping the piss outta him non-stop .
For three days .
Until they started paying again .
He believed it as well , and is now one of the most insecure people I know :)

Collecting poo
Years ago , I was working for a pharmaceutical company developing anti-parasitic drugs for veterinary purposes .
The drugs had to be tested on the appropriate parasites , which needed to be extracted from excrement .
Most of this came from sheep - this involved coaxing them into a narrow stall and doing a nappy change on them , then dissolving the stools in warm water and sieving the parasitic worms out - not really unpleasant for me or the sheep apart from being slightly undignified .
Unfortunately , there was a requirement for another worm to be tested which could only be readily obtained from cats .
You ca n't put a nappy on a cat ( and I would love to see someone try ) and the need for fresh and on demand shit meant extracting a cat from its luxurious living quarters and putting in a plastic dustbin , then turning a hose on it , to " persuade " it to dump .
This is horrible for the cat , and not fun for me , as I got thoroughly scratched and bitten .
But the best bit was that cat shit does not dissolve easily , so had to be blasted through a sieve with hot water to extract the worms .
The resulting miasma of cat intestinal bacteria was measurable in the air several corridors away , and stank like only hot cat shit can do .
18 years on , I still cannot resolve the conflict of cruelty to a few cats to try and relieve millions of other domesticated animals from suffering , but I can still smell the air in the lab complex .

When I was in Uni ( Insert long ago year here )
I participated in a paid study on the short - term effects of certain tobacco products .
I was picked for the cigarettes and recieved $ 5,000 .
for the two month study .
I got the cigarettes for free and smoked about a pack a day .
Pretty nice getting the money when I needed it , the only problem was I could n't quit .
That was 15 years ago and I still smoke a pack a day .
( What made them want non-smokers for a smoking study )
Funny thing was I went back to the study director and asked for help to quit and he said , " That was what part of the 5k was for , did n't you read the contract ? "

I was once paid to dress up in a chicken costume
and hand out tiny fake chocolate eggs to children .
It the hottest Easter I can remember , and the suit had been worn by upwards of twenty different people over the previous three weeks without being washed .
It stank , and was still moist with the sweat of the previous occupant - one of the more unpleasant experiences I 've had , it must be said .
After an hour or so I was choking on the fumes so badly I had to get some fresh air , so valiantly struggled to pull off the utterly steamed - up head and light up a fag .
Cue small child turning the corner to be greeted by a giant , stinking , soggy , headless chicken with smoke rising from its severed neck .
The screaming did n't stop for some time .
Does traumatising small children count as strange ?

Morrisons supermarket in Falkirk , Scotland :
" Come on in on Thursday and Sunday nights for a spot of shopping and allow yourself to be aurally presented with DJ NeillyB , playing the finest tracks at the audio bar . "
You see , after a certain amount of time all of the managers go home , leaving me and the rest of my colleagues to do whatever the fuck we want .
It 's these times when I browse the in - store CD charts , pick the most obscure CD's and play them at unacceptably high volumes right in the middle of the store through the seperate stereo system .
Favourite so far has to be " The Best Classical Album ... Ever " .
The look on peoples ' faces as the stirring tones of Orff strikes up suddenly , or indeed the Hallelujah Choir spreading its classical joy from Fresh Food to Frozen Food .
I love it .

I see dumb people
I was once employed by British Gas to open up two different databases on the same pc and to manually type the records from one into the other .
When I mentioned that they could do this automatically I was slapped down and told that " if it was possible they would have done it already " .
Well maybe it would have been done already if they were n't total fucking retards .
I excused myself to go for a cigarette and never returned .

You ain't seen me , right
When I was a nipper , I was on me skateboard flinging recklessly around my estate when my mate 's neighbour 's car sort of got in the way .
I was flung up .
over the bonnet and onto the road on the other side .
He was so guilty , and worried that we'd shop him that he gave us £ 20 to keep us quiet .
Bearing in mind I was 7 and this is in 1981 , this was a splendid amount of cash .
I spent it in caps for my toy gun .
About 5000 of them .
In one go .
Best week ever .

Solvent Abuse
As a 17 yearold ...
Summer job , Small unventilated room , cleaning 1 metre diameter Aluminuim disks ( freshly machined ) that were to be used for giant cotton - reels for the weaving industry ...
Ca n't remeber the pay , but basically I got these disk on a table , sloshed a can of Celulose Thinners onto it and wiped and wiped and wiped .
More thinners ... more wiping .
Eventually the cloth would remain uncoloured ....
Change Disk ...
More thinners .
etc .
It was summer ... and warm , and there were no windows .
I got through 15 liters of Celly a day , and it all evaporated into the air that I was breathing .
The guys laughed thier asses off at me when i came out for lunch breaks ...
Apparently I was completely off my tits and would talk total and utter bollox .
I can hardly remeber it .
I rekon it f*cked my memory .

Safety Deposit Boxes
A few years back , I was paid to act as an independent witness for a bank , opening thousands of long - unchecked safety deposit boxes .
Lots of old banknotes , gaudy jewellry , and mad handwritten rantings about how to save the world .
The odd rusty gun .
Quite sad in parts .
Oh yeah , and there were two or three very suspicious fungus - covered objects , which led the bank to call the police .
They turned out to be " organic matter " .
Not sure what that 's supposed to mean ...

I crushed whelks and measured their penises as a holiday job one summer at university .
Sounds good , huh ?
The anti-fouling paint on boats interferes with their " schlong - growth " , and makes the lady whelks grow them as well .
Somebody should tell the Daily Mail our beaches are being overrun by weird transexual shellfish !!!
We had to use the " whelk penis index " to describe the size .
Once you 've consigned a thousand little snails to their doom , just for a glimpse of flesh , it ceases to be funny ...

1285E8 ( from Kristoph Minchau )
I had a ticket come in from a Very Important User : a member of the Board of Directors .
The problem was that he could no longer access the Citrix server .
Looking at it , I determined that we simply needed to resynchronize his RSA security token .
After calling him up , I asked him to please tell me " what numbers are currently displayed on the front of the token ? "
" 1285E8 "
" What ? "
" 1285E8 "
" Ah ... can you tell me that again ? "
" 1...2...8...5...E - E as in Edward ... 8 "
" Are you sure that is an ' E ' ? "
" Yeah , it 's definitely an E "
" Um ... there are only supposed to be numbers on the token .
No letters . "
" Well I 'm reading it right her and it says : 1 ...2...8...5...E...8 "
Thinking that it might be a broken LCD on the token I tried 128588 and 128538 , both which did n't work .
I thought it might also be a one time problem with the token , so I said , " Ok .
We will wait till it changes , and I 'll have you read me back the next number . "
After 30 seconds , " Ok . It changed .
The new number is : 12h851 "
" What ? "
" 12h851 that is : 1 ...2...h - H as in House ...8...5... 1 "
" Um....ok ....? "
I was n't exactly sure what to do , short of physically replacing the token .
Fortunately he realized what was going on before I had to say anything else :
" Oh ! I got it now !...
I was holding it upside down !
The number is 128451 . "
" 128451 ...
That works a whole lot better . "
That 's about the point you start wondering about who is running your company .
A Highly Specialized Technician ( from Rodrigo Valenzuela )
As an IT tech for a newspaper printing company , I occasionally have to help the Highly Specialized Technicians that our equipment vendors send over for maintenance .
These techs handle the hardware and software support for all of our complicated , in - house printing equipment .
One day , a Highly Specialized Technician was dispatched to fix a problem , but came armed with a notebook computer that did n't have a serial port or a usb - to - serial adapter .
Because we needed the problem fixed immediately , I give him one of the spare PCs that I had in my office and told him that the username was " user " and the password " password " .
A few hours later , the Highly Specialized Technician called me up to ask if I knew the serial number for the diagnosis software that he was trying to install .
Of course , the software ( like the tech ) was Highly Specialized , so I had never heard of it before .
I suggested that he call his boss for the serial number instead .
A couple hours later ( his fifth hour onsite , if you 're keeping count ) , he called back asking for the spare computer 's password .
Fair enough , I know how hard is to remember a password like " password " .
I spelled it out to him , letter - by - letter , and reiterated that it was all lower case .
" Sorry , " he said , " it 's not working . "
I made sure he typed in " user " and then " password " - still , no luck .
" Well , " I said , " I better come down and look myself . "
When I got there , the Highly Specialized Technician was at the Windows XP login window with the following data on the screen .
Username : Password password : ****
Yes , that is a capital P .
He was a highly specialized technician , indeed .
CD Not Working ( from Fred Bar )
I 'm sure this was a common occurrence a decade ago , but it remains one of my favorite support calls of all time .
I was working phone support for an ISP and took a call from a customer that was having problems with our install CD .
The computer just was n't finding the CD .
I asked her to open " My Computer " and list the drives .
" I 've got A , B , and C " she replied .
" B? Ma'am what did the drive look like that you inserted the CD into ? "
" It 's long and skinny with a lever on the front . "
I cringed .
" That 's a floppy drive , not a CD - ROM drive .
How'd you get it in there ? "
At that point , I put the call on speaker phone for all the other techs to hear .
" It went in pretty easy , " she casually said , " but it wo n't come out now .
I have been going at it like an hour with a pair of tweezers . "
" Ma'am you have put a CD - ROM in a floppy drive , " I explained , " I 'm not sure how you did that , but you need to take your computer to a local computer shop and have them get that CD out of there . "
The phone went silent for a moment , and then she replied " oh I know , my kid has some gum . "
" Wait , nooooo !!!
I think that will just — "
She cut me off , " Sorry , let me call you back , I have to grab some gum . "
I did n't hear from her again .
For Grand Prix drivers the German Grand Prix each year is a very special event because the Nurburgring is certainly the most difficult , the most treacherous , and the most demanding of the tracks that the circus travels to each year .
Drivers are often asked what is their favorite circuit .
In the majority of cases , they say that the Nurburgring is perhaps the most satisfying .
This is said , in most cases , while sitting in armchairs in the comfort of their own homes with roaring fires in front of them !
But really I do n't believe that too many people would honestly admit that they enjoy driving on the Nurburgring in a Formula 1 car .
I know that whenever I drive there I get back to the pits and take a big , deep breath because , My God , I 'm pleased to be home !
In 1968 , that statement was truer than ever as the Nurburgring was engulfed in a miserable fog and a steady drizzle soaked everyone .
I arrived at the Nurburgring late on Thursday afternoon after having flown up from Geneva with Graham Hill in his Piper Aztec , accompanied by Betty Hill , Jo Siffert , and Jo Bonnier .
Just as we were unpacking the baggage from the plane the rain started , and from that point on we seldom got away from it .
When we arrived at the ' Ring , which is some 30 km from the airport , I did 3 laps in a Volkswagen , taking my mechanic , Ken Tyrrell , and the Dunlop people around and on these 3 laps the circuit was dry all the way round .
This was the only time I was going to see it that way during the entire weekend .
When official practice started on Friday morning I was starting my lightweight Matra o unscrubbed tyres and with new brake pads .
The fog was extremely bad , with visibility down to 200 yards , but I did 15 laps of the short loop , bedding the tyres and brakes .
By the time I had done this , the fog had got a little worse , and visibility had deteriorated round the back end of the circuit .
As there was a practice session later in the afternoon , and another one on Saturday , Ken Tyrrell did n't think that it was a sensible move to risk the car under such conditions .
At this time , certainly , flag marshals could n't see each other and really the track was in no condition for racing .
However , a few of the boys did go out , and had the advantage of a partly dry circuit although it was still very foggy .
During this time Jacky Ickx , Chris Amon , Graham Hill , John Surtees , and Jochen Rindt put in some reasonably quick times that proved to be the fastest of the entire practice period .
Vic Elford also put a quick lap in during that session .
By the time the afternoon session was due to start , conditions had worsened if anything .
The organizers quite rightly said that conditions were far too bad to allow us out on the circuit so I did n't get out at all on Friday .
This meant that we could only practice on Saturday , but then I did manage to put in a few laps in my car and recorded the fastest time of the day .
However , everyone complained that there was n't sufficient practice , and the officials decided that an early morning session on race day was a good idea .
During this session I practiced the car at long last with an aerofoil fitted , and found it to be slightly better .
I cannot really say that it was noticeable while driving , but the times seemed to intimate that there was a slight improvement .
But of course at the Nurburgring it is extremely difficult to recognize any small improvement in time .
With the aerofoil on , I did record a time of 9 minutes 54.2 seconds which enabled me to get on to the third row of the starting grid .
It is unusual at the Nurburgring to have a 3:2:3 grid ; the normal thing there is to have 4:3:4 , but in any case I would still have been on the third row of the grid .
When I did my fastest lap on the race morning , conditions really were very miserable .
It was raining heavily , the fog was pretty bad in parts , and even then I do n't believe the flag marshals could see each other .
The rivers that were running across the track were the biggest problem for , on account of the trees , one cannot see pools of water as one usually can on most circuits , and all of a sudden one would arrive over the crest of a hill and go into a river that felt several inches deep and was probably 2 or 3 feet wide .
The car would immediately aquaplane , and go out of control .
On one occasion I was in top gear going along a straight piece of road when this occurred .
The car went down the road sideways , flicked , and luckily came back pointing in the right direction .
This sort of maneuver really is n't pleasant , and I came back to the pits to say that I did n't think that we should practice any more under these conditions , fearing that I might put a foot wrong on the morning of a Grand Prix , which would of course be pretty difficult to rectify .
In fact , during this session , Jackie Oliver had such a moment , and was incredibly lucky to walk away from it because it was on an extremely slippery downhill section , entering a small bridge prior to the Adenauer Forest .
Jackie got into some difficulties , knocked two wheels off the Lotus , and the Lotus mechanics performed absolute miracles to have the car roadworthy for the race which was due to start some 2 ½ hours later .
The Grand Prix itself was started some 45 - 50 minutes later than scheduled .
The engines were started at least 5 minutes before flag - fall , which was a mistake .
Jo Siffert 's engine certainly suffered from overheating during this spell , and John Surtees 's motor certainly did n't improve itself , because John was alongside me on the grid and I could see that it was really boiling over .
I could also see Graham was having trouble with water coming out of his car 's overflow , and my temperature gauge was over 100 degrees Centigrade before we got fully under starter 's orders .
When the flag did drop , Jackie Ickx made rather a poor start with too much wheelspin and I drove almost up the pit lane trying to get past him .
I managed to do this but , in the process , got two wheels stuck in the gutter which drains the pitlane .
It was quite a problem to get the car out of this position , and it felt rather like being stuck in the tram rails , so to speak : I just hoped that they did n't go to the tram depot !
Somehow , I found myself going into the first corner lying third behind Graham and Chris .
The spray was absolutely unbelievable - I could n't see anything at all !
I could n't see my braking distance marks ; I could n't see the car in front ; it was just a great wall of spray .
I tried to get out of the spray and go up the inside , and by doing this I managed to see a little more clearly .
I hate to think what as going on behind me !
This situation continued for the majority of the lap , but I passed Chris Amon at the point almost where Jackie Oliver had his accident : that is to say , on the hill towards Adenauer .
I was happy to do this because until then I cannot remember having been more frightened in a racing car .
The spray from Graham and Chris was just absolutely impossible to see through ; on any other circuit these conditions are hellish , but on the Nurburgring you just cannot imagine how bad they are .
The track is narrow , the undulations so pronounced , the bends so numerous , that you can hardly remember where you are on the circuit even on a clear day , but in fog and ceaseless spray you just have no idea at all .
In addition you are continually worried by the fact that you are aquaplaning and almost always losing control , and you feel sure that the man in front is doing the same thing so that at any moment he is going to appear just in front of you pointing in the wrong direction .
After passing Chris it was then a case of finding the right spot on the circuit to overtake Graham .
This I dearly wanted to do before the start of the straight , so I managed to come out of the small Karussel at the end of the swallow - tail corner pretty well and I got an advantage on Graham at this point , over - taking him just entering the last corner before the straight .
This meant that I had the complete home straight to myself without any hindrance from spray .
With that alone I pulled out an advantage of over 8 seconds on Graham before reaching the pit .
I knew what Graham was going through because at the speed reached on the straight , which was getting on for 170 mph , the spray was staying at road level for a tremendously long time due to the hedges keeping it back and of course with no wind , and the mixture of fog and mist , you can imagine how impossible visibility was from behind .
After this it was only a matter of driving as fast as I possibly could because you simply can see nothing in your mirrors with so much spray around unless the next car is very close behind you .
After 2 laps I had an advantage of 34 seconds or so and I managed to build up steadily on this , trying as hard as I could to stay on the road since there were so many times when one was almost sliding off , or hitting some new puddle that was n't there on the previous lap .
With only 3 laps to go , it really started to pour down with rain all round the circuit , and the track became really treacherous .
At a point about half a mile from the Karussel I entered an ' S ' - bend in third gear and suddenly lost control in a deep river of water which was running across the road .
The car immediately started sliding , the engine stalled , and I was hurtling across the road towards a marshal who was standing beside his post completely unprotected .
He dived one way ; then decided to jump the other way ; then suddenly he just froze , and I knew I was going to hit him .
But just then the wheels got a little bit of grip and I managed to regain control .
Graham , in fact , who was some way behind , arrived at the same corner and spun off , but by this time the marshal had moved his position to somewhere a bit safer !
At last , I took the chequered flag just over 4 minutes ahead of Graham .
It was a tremendously satisfying race to win , but I was very pleased to get it over with .
I can remember thinking as I went down to the south turn after taking the chequered flag that this was perhaps my greatest ambition as far as winning on any circuit was concerned .
The Nurburgring is a track on which I had always wanted to win a Grand Prix because I think it certainly is the greatest challenge to a driver , and I must say winning it in the rain was very satisfying .
The car had gone like clockwork throughout and never missed a beat .
It was a wonderful compliment to Ken Tyrrell 's mechanics because the standard of workmanship that they had provided throughout the season was really splendid .
The only trouble with the car at all during the race , part from when it stalled , was that quite a lot of grit got into the throttle slides , and around half the distance the throttle was sticking open which really was n't very convenient .
Even after winning such a race I can honestly say that I never felt that the GP would run the full distance .
Each time I got back to the finish line I felt sure that the chequered flag was going to be shown , because really and truly the track was in no condition to be raced on .
In fact , I think all the drivers deserve tremendous praise since , throughout the entire race , not one of them went off the track seriously enough to be injured .

Just to clarify a bit what all the fuzz is about :
The API in question ( build_ext.get_ext_filename( ) ) was not changed at all .
The doc-string also does n't refer to * the* extension currently being built , but to just to some arbitrary extension : def get_ext_filename ( self , ext_name ) : r " " " Convert the name of an extension ( eg. " foo.bar " ) into the name Convert the name of an extension ( eg. " foo.bar " ) into the name of the file from which it will be loaded ( eg. " foo / bar.so " , or " foo\bar.pyd " ) . " " "
What did change is the way this method is used by other methods in build_ext : the method is no longer being called with the full dotted name , but only with the last component .
Now , setuptools and pywin32 both override the method , with the understanding that this method is the one and only way to convert the extensions ( full ) dotted name into a file name .
Up until the change ( which was needed to get inplace installations working ) , that assumption was true .
However , neither the doc-string nor the implementation of the method ever implied this .
distutils occasionally makes such assumptions necessary since there 's no clean OO - way to override the functionality .
That 's not ideal , but works most of the time .
However , authors of distutils add - ons cannot really expect such hacks to survive forever .
Rather than relying on these , it 's better to get distutils fixed to provide the necessary OO - hooks to properly implement the modified functionality .
FWIW , I 've had to change and tweak our mxSetup .py many many times to get it to work again with new distutils releases and I expect this to occur even more often now that distutils is finally being maintained again - and that 's good , since I 'll be able to get rid off the few remaining hacks !

Many migrant workers compete with Algerians for work in the building trade
About 100 local residents and Chinese migrant workers have clashed in the Algerian capital , some brandishing knives and rods , reports say .
Ten Chinese migrants were injured and two Chinese shops looted , Reuters reported , citing a Chinese diplomat .
Violence flared after a confrontation between a shop owner and a migrant in the city 's Bab Ezzouar district .
High unemployment among young Algerians has fuelled tensions over migrant workers who accept lower pay .
A shopkeeper told Reuters that the fight broke out after a disagreement with a Chinese migrant worker .
" I told him not to park his car in front of my shop , but he insulted me , " 31 - year - old Abdelkrim Salouda said .
" I punched him , I thought it was over , but after 30 minutes he came back with at least 50 Chinese to take revenge .
It is a miracle I am still alive . "
Firms in Africa 's third largest economy say that they depend on Chinese labour - often better qualified and willing to accept lower wages than Algerian workers - to staff the construction sector .
Official estimates put the number of Chinese migrant workers living in Algeria at 35,000 .
Some 8,000 work in the building sector in Algeria , according to Agence France Presse , and in the Bab Ezzouar district alone Chinese firms have built dozens of structures .
A diplomat at the Chinese embassy said he hoped Algerian authorities would look into the fighting but added that it would not affect relations between the two countries .
" Our friendship with Algeria is strong and this event is nothing in comparison with the links between our two countries , " Ling Jun said .

Dieser Erfolg ist sicherlich auch dem riesigen Protest , insbesondere durch die Onlinepetition beim Bundestag , geschuldet .

I am delighted to have this opportunity to tell you about an important initiative of the government of Ireland to further enhance Ireland ’s relationship with Irish America and the global Irish family .
Earlier this year , following a submission I presented to the government , it decided to host a Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin on 18 - 20 September .
The forum will bring together , for the first time , the most influential members of the Irish community worldwide with a record of high achievement in business and culture , as well as individuals with a strong business connection to Ireland .
The government has a long record of engagement with our global community and has worked very successfully with them in the past , particularly in relation to the peace process .
Over the past six years alone the Emigrant Support Program , run by my department , has provided some € 60 million in funding to Irish Diaspora organizations and projects .
Invitations to the forum were issued in April by way of a personal letter from the taoiseach ( prime minister ) to individuals identified by our network of embassies around the world .
The response to the taoiseach ’s letter has been hugely encouraging , with over 180 people indicating their intention to participate .
It is important to keep in mind that they will be traveling here at their own expense and giving freely of their time and expertise .
At this stage , it is expected that the attendance will include representatives from the U.S. , Britain , Australia , New Zealand , China , Argentina , Europe and the Middle East .
There will be a very strong U.S. - based contingent , including the American Ireland Fund ’s Loretta Brennan Glucksman , Bloomberg TV ’s Margaret Brennan , Kip Condron ( president and CEO of AXA Financial Inc. ) , Irial Finan ( executive vice president of Coca - Cola ) , Tara McCabe ( vice president of Morgan Stanley ) , Brendan McDonagh ( CEO of HSBC North America ) Tom Moran ( president , chairman and CEO of Mutual of America ) , Denis Swanson ( president of FOX Television Stations Inc. ) and Craig Barrett ( retired CEO and chairman of Intel ) .
They will be joined at Farmleigh by the taoiseach and members of the Cabinet .
The leaders of the opposition have also been invited , as have a number of leading Irish - based business figures .
A website for the event has also now been launched -- www.globalirishforum.ie.
This site will include detailed information for those participating at Farmleigh and about the event itself .
It ’s worth checking the website regularly as it will also carry links to streamed coverage of the keynote speech by the taoiseach and a debate on links with the diaspora , as well as reactions and interviews with participants .
The forum is first and foremost a national effort of outreach to and engagement with our diaspora .
Its primary purpose will be to explore how the Irish , at home and abroad , and those with a strong interest in Ireland , can work together and contribute to our overall efforts at economic recovery .
It also provides a unique opportunity for Ireland to establish a new global Irish network made up of those present , and others , to take forward some of the initiatives that may emerge from the forum .
Never before has Ireland brought together , in one place , such a truly global network of business talents .
A group of 70 million people spread throughout the world is by its nature diverse and complex .
The enormous range in culture , outlook and experience between and among our communities abroad is amply illustrated by the group that is coming together in Dublin .
In spite of this great dispersion , certain common threads are clearly evident .
Something undeniable in the Irish identity pushes us closer and creates a need to connect and come together .
A deep appreciation of the emigrant experience and an affinity with a sense of Irishness -- however that is interpreted -- are defining characteristics of the global Irish family .
This gathering is testament to this fact .
The Department of Foreign Affairs will prepare the official report of the forum which will incorporate the ideas that emerge over the course of the two days .
The report will be presented to the government for consideration and appropriate action .
Reaching out to the diaspora and seeking support for Ireland ’s economic development is an ongoing process .
The government already has a very strong record of delivery in this area .
Government and state agencies have sought to build on Irish connections in attracting investment here ; readers will know that the Emigrant Support Program has provided over € 60 million over the past six years to projects and groups around the world , building on the extraordinary work of our community .
Enterprise Ireland , with the assistance of our Embassies , currently supports over 60 Irish business networks worldwide , comprising some 30,000 members .
I am deeply heartened by the reservoir of goodwill that exists among our global community , particularly here in the United States .
The presence of these leading figures in Ireland will be a vibrant demonstration of the enduring spirit of the global Irish diaspora ; of our strong need to remain connected to each other ; and of a remarkable willingness of those abroad to remain engaged with this country .
A reader writes :
Today I sat in my company 's annual Benefit Open Enrollment Review where representatives from Human Resources explained the changes that would occur in 2010 .
It should n't come as a surprise to anyone but the employees will be paying more in premiums and deductibles .
Our deductibles have not increased in 10 years so this is a hard pill to swallow .
One slide set forth all the reasons that our health care costs were increasing .
Listed among the reasons for the rising costs was the impact caused by the uninsured and the under insured .
One employee raised his hand and said , " if I 'm doing the math right , the employee 's costs are increasing 20 % " .
Needless to say , the mood in the conference room was just short of hostile .
I looked to a coworker sitting next to me and said , if this can't convince people of the need for the public option I do n't know what will .
October is the month of Open Enrollment for many corporations across the country .
My company cannot be the only one that is passing through the rising costs to its employees next year .
I wonder what the impact of these meetings will be in the coming months .
Little Julia
Hall is just the latest in - the - tank questioner with Obama campaign / Democrat ties to turn up “ randomly ” at presidential health care forums .
Here ’s your illustrated guide to Obamacare human props .
In July , Obama hosted a White House citizen town hall that featured three face - to - face questions .
The lucky three ?
* Debby Smith .
You remember her .
She choked back tears as she talked of her battle with kidney cancer , her joblessness , and her lack of insurance .
Obama hugged the trembling woman and dubbed her “ Exhibit A ” for his massive entitlement program .
Debby Smith , however , is no ordinary patient .
While she may be “ unemployed , ” she has been rather busy working for the Obama campaign – as a volunteer for the DNC ’s Organizing for America .
Smith also identified herself as a worker for the Virginia Organizing Project , which has been coordinating lobbying trips and health care forums with HCAN .
Yes , that same HCAN .
In December , Smith moderated a “ a community discussion on health care issues ” in Appalachia , Virginia and told her local paper that the meeting “ would be reported back to former Sen .
Tom Daschle , who has been directed by President Elect Barack Obama to form a committee to report on health care issues . ”
* Jason Rosenbaum .
Rosenbaum works for the Washington , D.C. - based Health Care for America Now ( HCAN ) .
That ’s the K Street Astroturf outfit with a $ 40 million budget to lobby for government - run health care linked to left - wing billionaire George Soros .
And yes , the same HCAN directing its mob to “ drown out ” opponents at town hall meetings .
* SEIU member .
Yes , wonder of wonders , this randomly chosen questioner just happened to be a member of the Purple Shirt Army that poured $ 80 million in independent expenditures into Democrat coffers , made 4.4 million phone calls for Obama , sent out more than 2.5 million Obama mailings during the 2008 campaign , and dispatched thugs to drown out town hall protesters .
Here ’s how the tough exchange went down :
Q Hi , Mr. President .
I ’m a member of SEIU and I ’m down here in Fairfax County working on Change That Works .
What can I do , as a member of the union , to help you with your reform bill ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , I appreciate the question ..
Of course he did .
In March , the White House conducted a similar health reform town hall with more human Obamacare props ( full transcript here ) .
Five lucky questioners were chosen “ randomly ” to talk directly with the president in the East Room about their concerns , including :
* Linda Bock .
She ’s a registered nurse — and a card - carrying member of the SEIU in Prince George ’s County , Maryland .
* Carlos Del Toro. Via WaPo : “ In 2007 , Del Toro stood as a Democratic candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates , but did not win .
A supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic presidential primaries , he backed Obama against McCain in the general , endorsing him in an Oct. 24 , 2008 op - ed in the Fredericksburg Free Lance - Star . ”
* Tom Sawner .
I ’ll let him speak for himself :
Sir , I ’m Tom Sawner .
I ’m a service - disabled veteran , small - business owner in Arlington , Virginia .
My company , Educational Options , works with public schools .
We serve more than 200,000 at - risk kids within public schools , providing online content , partnering with teachers , and I was honored to serve on your education platform committee .
THE PRESIDENT : Wonderful .
* Bonnee Breese .
Public school teacher , prominent AFT union member , and member of the 11,626 - person Pennsylvania for Obama page on Facebook .
* Sergio Salmeron .
Democrat National Committee member and community blogger at Organizing for America .

Remember , people .
It ’s the Chicago way :
David Axelrod has long been known for his political magic .
Through his AKP&D Message & Media consultancy , the campaign veteran has advised a succession of Democratic candidates since 1985 , and he ’s now chief strategist for Senator Barack Obama ’s bid for President .
But on the down low , Axelrod moonlights in the private sector .
From the same address in Chicago ’s River North neighborhood , Axelrod operates a second business , ASK Public Strategies , that discreetly plots strategy and advertising campaigns for corporate clients to tilt public opinion their way .
He and his partners consider virtually everything about ASK to be top secret , from its client roster and revenue to even the number of its employees .
But customers and public records confirm that it has quarterbacked campaigns for the Chicago Children ’s Museum , ComEd , Cablevision , and AT&T .
ORDER IT NOW ASK ’s predilection for operating in the shadows shows up in its work .
On behalf of ComEd and Comcast , the firm helped set up front organizations that were listed as sponsors of public - issue ads .
Industry insiders call such practices “ Astroturfing , ” a reference to manufacturing grassroots support .
Alderman Brendan Reilly of the 42nd Ward , who has been battling the Children ’s Museum ’s relocation plans , describes ASK as “ the gold standard in Astroturf organizing .
This is an emerging industry , and ASK has made a name for itself in shaping public opinion and manufacturing public support . ”

A VIOLENT criminal who was deported to Scotland from Australia has moved his family to the Highlands because his home town of Paisley is " too rough " .
Scott Morrison , 44 , who has served time for attempted murder and kneecapping a rival gang member , said he did n't want his children growing up in the Renfrewshire town .
He added : " I 'm a Buddie at heart but I live in a council house in the Highlands now .
" I did n't want to bring my family up in Paisley because it 's a bit too rough . "
Morrison lived in Ferguslie Park , Paisley , until his family moved to Perth , Australia , when he was 12 .
He served eight years in a jail Down Under for attempting to stab a man to death .
He also ran up a record of attacks of police officers .
Morrison was deported to Scotland two years ago .
He claimed to be a reformed character .
But days after he arrived , the father - of - seven sparked a major police alert on Arran by claiming he had a gun and threatening suicide .
Then , in April last year , he brandished an air pistol in an Inverness hostel and threatened to burn down the building .
Morrison admitted breach of the peace and was freed after spending almost six weeks in jail on remand .
He now lives in Brora , Sutherland , where he married Marie Roberts last October .
Morrison is keen to play down his criminal past and claims his reputation is unfair .
He said : " All this nonsense about me being a crimelord was simply untrue . "
A lot of conflicting reports out this morning on where public option stands .
The White House meeting late yesterday between President Obama and Senate Democratic leaders has yielded its own flurry of accounts of what went down .
Let ’s try to sort it all out :
The biggest splash has been Mike Allen ’s Politico story which reports that the President said in the meeting that he is leaning toward a triggered public option along the lines of what Sen.
Olympia Snowe favors :
Obama told Democratic leadership at the White House Thursday evening that his preference is for the trigger championed by Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) – a plan that would allow a public plan to kick in if private insurers do n’t expand coverage fast enough , a top administration official told POLITICO .
It ’s also sign Obama is interested in maintaining a sense of bipartisanship around the health reform plan .
At that meeting , Obama did not sign on to a plan being floated by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to include a different variation of the public option in the Senate bill – a plan that would create a national public plan but allow states to “ opt- out . ”
Reid now believes he can get 60 votes to bring a bill with that plan to the floor by breaking an expected GOP filibuster – and then secure the 51 votes needed to pass it .
Contrast that with the New York Times overnight account , which says the President took no position either way :
Mr. Reid met with President Obama at the White House Thursday to inform him of his inclination to add the public option to the bill , but did not specifically ask the president to endorse that approach , a Democratic aide said .
Mr. Obama asked questions , but did not express a preference at the meeting , a White House official said .
Reacting to these reports , the White House is acknowledging to Greg Sargent this morning that Obama took no position either way , but emphasizing that no one should read too much into it :
But the senior White House official points out that the discussion was not about the public option in general .
Rather , Reid was specifically raising the possibility of a public option with an opt - out clause as one potential route .
On this specific policy option , the official says , “ the White House did not state a position either way . ”
Similarly , the White House is knocking down the Politico report in conversations with TPMDC :
Senators are “ still working through the substance and talking to their members about it , ” the source said .
“ They did n’t ask for the president ’s endorsement since no decision has been made . ”
Separately the Politico story lead with the apparent news that Speaker Nancy Pelosi discovered after a whip count yesterday that she does not have the votes for the most “ robust ” form of public option :
Speaker Nancy Pelosi counted votes Thursday night and determined she could not pass a “ robust public option ” — the most aggressive of the three forms of a public option House Democrats have been considering as part of a national overhaul of health care .
Pelosi ’s decision –coupled with a significant turn of events yesterday during a private White House meeting –points to an increasingly likely compromise for a “ trigger ” option for a government plan .
But House sources are telling TPMDC that report is premature and is nothing more than an effort from some quarters to pressure Pelosi to drop public option .
Appearing on MSNBC this morning , presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett said , “ I do n’t know whether Mike Allen can actually count votes or not . ”

She had wanted to get a photo booth for the reception , so that guests could take home photo - strip mementos of the occasion and she could have copies of the images for her own picture album .
But renting a digital booth -- like the ones used in arcades that have also become popular for special occasions -- for a day would have cost nearly $ 2,000 .
Instead , David cleverly used his Macbook laptop , a $ 99 printer , an old wardrobe frame and some Ikea shower curtains for a do - it - yourself photo booth .
On his blog , you can see a video of it in operation on the big day .
He programmed the computer ( using the free Automator program that comes with late - model Macs ) so that guests were prompted to enter their names on the laptop .
Three pictures were taken , which were printed on a strip to take home .
The pictures were also saved on the computer for his sister .
Judging by the video , guests sometimes took the opportunity to make goofy poses , just like in a real photo booth , and all seemed to be having a good time .
Maybe more so than just posing for a photographer .
Cline is distributing the program he used on his site for a donation of any size .
And by the way , his DIY photo booth is available for rent in his area .
He 's also a DJ and a freelance violinist who will play for special occasions .
This guy knows how to party .

TORONTO , Canada –
It ’s a bit of a sport in Canada to watch Americans at war with themselves .
There ’s nothing malicious about it :
We ’re a generally bored and inward - looking bunch , so when our neighbors unleash another full - blown clash over ideology , we ’re grateful for the distraction and the front row seat .
Pure entertainment value is part of the attraction — like the congressman who , during a town hall meeting on health care reform , said he refrained from pissing on a protester ’s leg for fear of wasting his urine , or Rush Limbaugh huffing and puffing about socialist hordes at the gates .
Laughs aside , the American tendency to treat policy debates as life and death struggles over “ the American way of life ” reminds many Canadians , rightly or wrongly , of how lucky they are to be living north of the border .
It ’s hard not to feel civically more evolved when , in some U.S. states , people can legally show up at presidential speeches sporting handguns or assault rifles .
U.S. culture wars , in other words , often reinforce Canada ’s national identity .
The latest to have that effect is U.S. President Barack Obama ’s attempt to extend health care coverage to the 47 million , mostly working Americans , who ca n’t afford private medical insurance .
The move has unleashed a ferocious defense of private insurance companies by Americans scandalized at the notion of the government providing its own health insurance as a competing alternative .
For Canadians , the debate highlights a key difference between the two countries :
In the U.S. , health care is a commodity to be bought and sold for profit ; in Canada , it ’s considered a human right .
Canada ’s publicly funded health insurance , known as Medicare , covers all residents .
In other words , except for the taxes Canadians pay , the health care they receive is free .
They ’re also free to choose their family doctor and to get second opinions .
Under the 1984 Canada Health
Act , the federal government transfers health funds to provinces — which have constitutional jurisdiction over health care — that meet certain conditions .
The conditions include the need for provincial health insurance plans to be administered on a non -profit basis , to cover services provided by hospitals and doctors , to set the rate charged for those services and to maintain coverage when the resident of one province uses the medical services of another .
The federal government enforces the law by withholding funds if the conditions are n’t met .
Still , the law leaves plenty of room for private enterprise , despite charges of “ socialist ” medicine by American opponents .
Canada ’s “ single - payer ” public insurance system covers medically necessary interventions — including visits to the doctor , laboratory tests , surgeries and hospital stays .
That accounts for 70 percent of all health expenditures .
The rest — including dental work , eye care , cosmetic surgeries , prescription drugs and home care — is covered by private insurance or out - of - pocket expenditures for most Canadians .
A mish - mash of provincial laws makes it difficult for the private medical sector to expand .
Some prevent doctors from billing more for services than the rate set by the government , others ban private insurance companies from covering the medically necessary services protected by the Canada Health Act .
But while hospitals are publicly funded , most are privately owned and run by a board of directors or religious institution .
The difference with the U.S. is that they ’re run on a not - for - profit basis .
Stories of insurance companies cutting off customers in the middle of treatment , ostensibly for undisclosed previous conditions , are unheard of in Canada .
As for outcomes , here are some comparative statistics :
The World Health Organization , in an assessment of the health care systems of 192 countries in 2000 , ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th .
In 2007 , Canada spent 10 percent of its GDP on health care ; the U.S. spent 16 percent , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
Per capita , Canada spent $ 3,895 compared to $ 7,290 for the U.S. ( Makes you wonder who the big spending socialists really are . )
Thirty - one percent of U.S. health expenditures go towards administrative costs .
In Canada , it ’s 16.7 percent , according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine .
In 2005 , the OECD used a different calculation and arrived at 7.3 percent in the U.S. and 2.6 percent in Canada .
In 2007 , 7 percent of Canadian adults with above average incomes and 18 percent with below average incomes , went without medical care due to costs , according to the OECD .
In the U.S. , medical costs prevented 25 percent of adults with above average incomes and 52 percent with below average incomes from getting care .
In 2006 , life expectancy was 80.7 years in Canada and 78.1 years in the U.S. Canadians are as likely as Americans to survive heart attacks , breast cancer and childhood leukemia .
Infant mortality rates in 2006 were five deaths per 1,000 live births in Canada and 6.7 deaths in the U.S .
Obesity rates among adults are 15 percent in Canada and 34.3 percent in the U.S .
Sixty - five percent of Canadians view their health care system positively while only 31 percent of Americans view their own system that way , according to a cross - border poll in July by the Angus Reid firm .
Canada ranked 4th this year as the best place to live in the United Nation ’s quality of life index for 182 rated countries .
The U.S. ranked 13th .
Canada and the U.S. , proportionately , have the same number of acute care hospital beds .
The U.S. , however , has more doctors per capita , more MRI units and more CT scanners .
The more serious concern in Canada is the length of time it takes to get medically necessary surgery .
Since 2000 , public anger forced governments to increase funding and make reducing wait times a priority .
In Ontario , average wait times for general surgery is 99 days , for breast cancer surgery 33 days , for angioplasty 18 days and for a knee replacement 181 days .
Still , pressure to widen the private sector ’s role in delivering medical services is increasing .
As a result , supporters of Medicare are keeping a close watch on Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
Critics say Harper has done little to defend Medicare in the face of gross misrepresentation of it south of the border .
Some even question his commitment to it .
In 2001 , while head of the National Citizens Coalition , a staunchly conservative lobby group , Harper advised the western province of Alberta , which wanted more private medical care , to break away from the national program and set up an autonomous system .
Polls indicate Harper is on the verge of a majority government if his shaky minority one were to fall soon .
If , as some fear , he opens the door to more private health care , American - style culture wars might be coming here .
In our last post about the unadulterated genius of Jim Henson and his two most well known and beloved Television shows , we had 10 amazing performances by musicians on The Muppet Show .
Sesame Street had its fair share of special guests as well .
Often the singer or performer would just appear in one segment and belt out a tune , or even have a cute little duet with one of the puppet cast members .
So , a bit unlike the Muppets list , this one has a few more recent spots ( namely the first two from the nineties ) , but the majority still come from the far more classic and original shows from back in the seventies and eighties .
Since I posted a bit of background from Wikipedia on the last one , I figured why not lay out a bit of trivia this time to stump your Muppet - loving friends at parties .
Rumor : ( From Wikipedia ) :” It has widely been suggested that Bert and Ernie are a gay couple , as they are apparently adult human males portrayed sharing a bedroom , though with separate beds .
A 1980 collection of humorous essays by Kurt Andersen , titled The Real Thing , made light of the growing rumor .
“ Bert and Ernie conduct themselves in the same loving , discreet way that millions of gay men , women and hand puppets do .
They do their jobs well and live a splendidly settled life together in an impeccably decorated cabinet . ”
Incidentally , they are not .
Rumor : ( From Wikipedia ) :” In 1990 , puppeteer Jim Henson ’s death spurred rumors that Ernie would be “ killed off ” in the show , much the way the character of Mr. Hooper was after actor Will Lee ’s passing some years earlier .
Rumor said that he would be either killed by a vehicle , AIDS , or cancer .
There was no legitimacy to this rumor , but because producers took their time recasting a puppeteer for Ernie , the delay allowed the claims to burgeon .
A spokesperson for the series was quoted as saying “ Ernie is not dying of AIDS , Ernie is not dying of leukemia .
Ernie is a puppet . ”
Truth : ( From Wikipedia ) :” In 2002 , Sesame Workshop announced that a character with HIV would be introduced to Takalani Sesame , the South African version of the show .
Many groups wrongly presumed that the American version would be getting a “ gay Muppet . ”
This concern came about presumably because of a perceived connection between homosexuality and HIV in the United States , but the character with HIV is only present on this international version of the show .
The character , Kami , contracted HIV from a blood transfusion as an infant . ”

This is an incredible opportunity for atheists .
There are currently more 18 - 25 - year - olds who are not affiliated with any religion than ever before .
The Secular Student Alliance has grown faster this year than at any time in our ten - year history .
You can see where the following curve is heading :
Our campus groups have made the front page of The New York Times and been featured in major magazine articles ; visited New Orleans to do community service work ; spearheaded consciousness - raising bus campaigns ; and brought Dan Barker , Richard Dawkins , and several other speakers to their universities .
Our staff has fostered this climate for growth , created a resources for educators and a fantastic brochure ( PDF ) for high school teachers who may have non-religious students in their classroom .
They organized a conference for over 100 secular students and a trip to the Creation Museum ( with special guest PZ Myers ) for 300 skeptics who left the museum armed with knowledge of its misinformation campaign , able to spread the message .
They are currently developing three separate student conferences for 2010 , all over the country .
I just read through our annual activity summary ( PDF ) and was amazed by how much our staff has done with relatively few resources and how much our affiliate groups have accomplished .
I ca n’t stress this enough : when I say “ our staff , ” I ’m only referring to two full - time staff members ( who are seriously underpaid ) and a handful of interns and volunteers .
We ’re reaching the breaking point where our level of growth is surpassing our ability to support the groups adequately .
We need at least one other staffer and the board would love to be able to pay all staffers closer to what they ’re really worth .
As it happens , we have a chance to remedy this .
An SSA member / donor named Todd Stiefel has presented us with a challenge :
Any amount we raise — up to $ 50,000 — by December 21st , he will match dollar - for - dollar .
In other words , your $ 20 contribution will bring the SSA $ 40 .
Todd ’s not kidding about that dollar - for - dollar thing , either .
( It ’s not like we can raise $ 3,000 and he ’ll give us the whole $ 50,000 amount anyway . )
This means we have a little over two months to raise an incredible amount of money — a larger amount than we ’ve ever had to raise before .
The SSA staff and board are going to be doing everything we can to make this happen — meeting donors , writing letters , etc .
We could use your help , though .
If you ’ve never given before , we could use your contribution now more than ever .
If you have given before , your continuing support would help us even more !
If you have n’t told your friends about the Secular Student Alliance , please tell them who we are and what we do .
We ’re the largest organization in the world starting , supporting , and maintaining campus atheist groups .
We have the ear of the White House .
We helped found the Secular Coalition for America and continue to be a proud member of that group .
We are also a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) non-profit and donations are tax - deductible .
If you have a blog or Twitter feed or Facebook , please spread the word about this challenge .
If you have any questions about the SSA , I would love to answer them in the comments below .
In the meantime , I ’ll be giving updates on how we ’re doing over the next several weeks .
It would be incredible if we could meet this goal .
I ’m putting a ChipIn widget below ( feel free to put it on your site ) , but you can give to us in a variety of ways .
Can you help us ?
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- With Quentin Tarantino 's recent disclosure that Brad Pitt " pulled out a brick of hash " for the pair to smoke during a meeting about Tarantino 's new film " Inglourious Basterds , " the two movie icons could today be mistaken for old roomies .
Brad Pitt and Quentin Tarantino have always wanted to work together but could n't find the right project before " Inglourious Basterds . " more photos »
However , in an interview with CNN , the charismatic director of " Pulp Fiction " and " Reservoir Dogs " insists that the well - anticipated union was a long time in the making .
" It was very much a case of us wanting to work together , but waiting for the right project to come along , " he told CNN .
It has been 16 years since a youthful Pitt featured -- rather fittingly , it seems -- as a stoned layabout in " True Romance , " the Tarantino - scripted tale of lovers on the run .
Since that time , Tarantino says , " everybody 's been wondering when this great love affair is gonna happen . "
And yet , when Tarantino first approached Brad 's representative about another project , the agent was apparently " too protective " of the future relationship between the director and his client .
" He told me the last thing he wanted was to put us in the same room and let us fall in love over a movie we would n't be able to do . "
A seasoned filmmaker by this time , Tarantino could relate to the points raised by the agent and decided to take a step back and let things happen naturally .
He first sensed Pitt could be a strong contender for the role of Aldo Raine , the " fast - talking , vengeance - driven hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee " who leads Tarantino 's critically - divisive " Inglourious Basterds , " when he was half way through writing the script .
From " Dogs " to " Basterds : " Tarantino 's career in pictures »
At this stage , however , Tarantino was still not entirely convinced Pitt would be the best choice .
" Then , I wrote a little bit more and thought Brad would be terrific .
By the time I got towards the end , I felt he would be perfect but became worried I would n't get him . "

He quickly made contact with the agent again and explained there was another project in the pipeline .
At this point , he was worried Pitt could already be committed for the next few years .
Fortunately for the army of Pitt and Tarantino fans around the world , this was not the case .
" His agent said Brad does n't do that because he wants to be available when good material is offered . "
The rest , as they say , is history .
" It was a lot of fun working with Brad , which was n't very surprising , " Tarantino told CNN .
" We had already been told we would get along like a house on fire , and that 's pretty much what happened . "
With Tarantino 's revelation Tuesday on the Howard Stern Show that he and Brad had got through six bottles of wine and a " slice of hash " in one night , Angelina may be one of the few people hoping that this is not the start a beautiful relationship .

With practically unlimited ways for users to access Twitter for sending and receiving tweets , we wondered how long it would take before it became an active participant in courtrooms .
We 've already seen journalists in the United States granted permission to tweet while in court , but Australia is breaking some interesting ground when it comes to Twitter and the legal system .
After a recent trial that involved journalists tweeting the proceedings , FOXNews is reporting that the Federal Court in Australia has decided that as with other media , individual judges will be able to decide on a case by case basis if they will allow live Twitter coverage from within their courtrooms .
Apparently earlier in the month two technology journalists , one from ZDNet Australia , used Twitter to report live regarding an iiNet copyright case around movie piracy .
The presiding judge , Dennis Cowdroy , soon became aware of their tweets , but saw no issue with their behaviors .
Cowdroy was even quoted as saying , " I believe that the public has a legitimate right to be fully informed of proceedings , particularly proceedings such as ( the iiNet case ) , which have attracted considerable public interest .
Twittering can serve to inform the public in a more speedy and comprehensive manner than may be possible through traditional media coverage . "
Given the circumstances , the Federal Court of Australia became aware of the situation .
Chief executive Warwick
Soden then went on the record to dictate that each judge will be able to make their own decision on whether or not to allow Twitter reporting .
Do you think allowing journalists to tweet from the courtroom is a good idea ?

NEW YORK -- I got swine flu .
Five days later , I was at death 's door -- because my evil insurance company would n't honor my doctor 's prescription .
Memo to future revolutionaries : if you require a firing squad for the executives of the Health Insurance Plan ( HIP ) of New York , I 'm handy with a rifle .
I was n't worried at first .
A little sneezing , slightly achy joints .
I figured it was my usual bout of fall allergies .
There 's usually nothing to do but suffer .
But I felt worse each day : achier , more congested , stiffer , headache , fevers .
The third night was bad .
I went to bed under a pile of comforters , chattering uncontrollably .
Then nightsweats .
I checked my temperature : 103.7 .
When your temperature looks like a classic rock station , it 's time to see the doctor .
I 've known my general practitioner for decades .
So I pay out - of - pocket to see him even though he 's not on HIP 's list of plan - approved doctors .
Hey , what do you expect for $ 749.01 a month ?
My ordeal with the insurance company began when I went to fill my prescription for Tamiflu , an antiviral medication that is widely considered the standard treatment for swine ( and other types of ) flu .
" Your insurance is n't going to cover this , " the pharmacist said .
" You would need a pre-approval from your doctor . "
" But that 's a prescription , " I said , motioning to the white slip of paper in her hand .
For younger readers , I come from a generation when a doctor 's prescription was all you needed to get a medication .
" It 's not going to work , " she said , slowing her speech for emphasis .
" This drug is for people who have the flu . "
" Um ... I have the flu . "
" You have the flu ? "
She looked shocked .
Because Tamiflu or another drug called Relenza can significantly reduce flu symptoms if taken less than 48 hours after the onset of symptoms , people have been hoarding and taking anti-viral drugs prophylactically -- especially in New York City .
Given what was about to happen to me , I admire the hoarders .
Smart .
I called my doctor .
No answer ; left a message .
Waited .
I called back .
Got his assistant , who patched me through .
I explained the situation .
" Put her on , " my doctor said .
I offered my cellphone to the pharmacist .
She recoiled in horror .
" You have the flu !
I 'm not using your phone ! "
She believed I had the flu enough to shriek like a wee girl .
So why did she need to confirm it with my doctor ?
I asked my doctor to call the pharmacy .
" Right away , " he promised .
Wait .
Wait .
Wait more .
I called back .
" Wait .
Are you already at the pharmacy ? " he asked .
" You want me to call where ? "
At this point I began to lose my mind .
An hour passed after my doctor and pharmacist exchanged the required bureaucratic pleasantries .
She returned to the counter .
" I 'm sorry , Mr. Rall , " she said , " but your doctor is going to have to call HIP to get their advance approval .
It will take him quite a bit of time ... it's complicated , especially for doctors . "
Especially for doctors ?
Remember , this is n't heroin .
It 's Tamiflu .
The street value of this stuff is n't that great , and it 's a really , really bum trip .
My brain may be baked from a week of triple - digit fevers , but I want to know :
Why the hell would an insurer make it more difficult to get the main drug prescribed to treat the number - one most - talked - about disease in America , one that 's a probable pandemic ?
Should n't HIP and other insurers be shoveling these yellow and white capsules out the door , trying to keep their own costs down by getting as many flu victims to recover as quickly as possible ?
What the hell is a " pre-approval " ?
If a doctor prescribes a drug , why is n't that good enough for the health insurance company ?
Oh , and why does n't the federal government make Tamiflu available free ?
Hey , President Obama :
What part of " pandemic " do you not understand ?
Another hour went by .
My pharmacist 's phone rang .
She winked at me .
" Everything should be fine now , " she said .
Everything was not fine .
I was getting sicker and sicker , just sitting there .
My head reeled ; an invisible C - clamp tightened behind each ear .
I could barely breathe .
It felt as though there were shards of glass stuck in my lungs .
Every breath hurt .
I barely had enough energy to stand up and take a step .
My fingers were bluish - gray ( an early sign that breakdown of the cardio - pulmonary system is imminent . )
I coughed and caught a ball of phlegm in a napkin .
It was soaked in blood .
Four hours and 12 phone calls after I arrived at the pharmacy , I went home empty - handed .
HIP 's approval still had n't appeared in the pharmacy 's computer system .
When swine flu appeared in the U.S. this spring , the government prompted hysteria , predicted the deaths of as many as 90,000 Americans .
Now they 're going to the opposite extreme , downplaying a genuine threat by trying to ignore it .
They 're no longer even tracking new cases .
And Obama Administration health officials are now selling an official line -- for most people , swine flu symptoms are no worse than those of any other random flu -- that is n't quite accurate .
For example , while it's true that children and the elderly are in high - risk categories for swine flu , " 40 - year - olds are the group most at risk of developing life - threatening complications from H1N1 , " according to Canadian researchers cited by the Montreal Gazette .
( Centralized data collection is a big advantage of a national healthcare system . )
Another difference is that swine flu is much more likely to cause viral pneumonia , the most common life - threatening complication of flu .
It is not just another flu .
Lord knows , it 's not like any other flu I 've had .
I spent that night coughing up blood and downing aspirins to try to keep the fever down .
By way of comparison , I 've been thrown down two flights of stairs -- and swine flu is worse .
I had pneumonia last year ; it sucked hard , but it was a joke next to this .
I went back to the pharmacy in the morning .
Still nothing .
I called HIP .
Unsurprisingly , their voice recognition voicemail tree had some trouble understanding my voice by this time .
God forbid they should hire someone in India to actually answer the phone .
Finally -- success .
Sort of .
" The pharmacy needs to enter the approval code , " the HIP lady explained .
She read me a long number .
I gave it to the pharmacist .
She typed it into her computer .
" No . Still nothing , " she said .
She did n't look surprised .
" Would you like me to call HIP ? " the pharmacist asked .
" I thought you 'd never ask , " I replied .
Half an hour , an overnight and about two pints of phlegmy blood later , I had my Tamiflu in hand .
" $ 87.12 , " demanded the pharmacist .
I asked her how much it would have been out - of - pocket , without insurance .
" $ 112 , " she said .
Losing that night has diminished the effectiveness of the drug .
It took three days more of feeling like death just to advance to the stage of feeling like crap .
Now I 'm settling into a nice , comfortable state of wretched .
I just read that a recent ABC News poll says that 32 percent of Americans think the current healthcare system is just peachy .
Let 's hope they do n't catch swine flu this winter .

Customers of Ireland 's biggest ISP can no longer access The Pirate Bay .
Earlier this year , Eircom settled out of court with Ireland 's music industry and agreed to block the world 's largest tracker and today , September 1st , the ban took effect .
The site 's domain names and IP addresses have all been blocked .
During August the music industry sent an email to several ISPs in Ireland , demanding that the companies block their users ’ access to The Pirate Bay or face legal action .
While UPC and BT Ireland denied the request , Eircom , Ireland ’s largest ISP , already agreed and said it would block customer access to the site starting September 1st – today .
TorrentFreak can confirm that Eircom customers can no longer access The Pirate Bay and instead , are faced with this message when trying to access the site ( body in plain text for clarity ) ;
On the 24 July 2009 , an Order was made by the High Court requiring eircom to block or otherwise disable access by its subscribers to the website The PirateBay.org , its related domain names , IP addresses and URLs .
The Court was satisfied that on the basis of the evidence presented by the record companies that the PirateBay website is a website that facilitates the exchange of copyrighted sound recordings without the consent of the copyright owners .
eircom recognises the legitimate rights of the owners of copyrighted material and believes that individuals who share or download copyrighted material without the authorisation or the permission of the copyright owner are acting illegally .
The Order further provides that should the PirateBay website content be legitimatised in the future then eircom has liberty to apply to the Court to have the Order vacated and access to the PirateBay website enabled .
eircom in compliance with the Order has agreed that access to the website the PirateBay.org , its related domain names , IP addresses and URLs from the eircom network will be blocked indefinitely from the 1st September 2009 .
eircom would like to reassure customers that : * eircom will not monitor customer ’s activities at any stage , nor will it place any monitoring equipment or software on its network in order to facilitate this block .
* eircom will not provide personal details or any information relating to customers to any third party , including the record companies .
The order to which Eircom refers relates to one awarded after an uncontested hearing before the courts – mirroring its earlier weakness over “ 3 strikes ” , Eircom had already agreed with IRMA , Ireland ’s version of the RIAA , that it would not put up any resistance .
According to Irish Times , Eircom has also revealed it has signed a memorandum of understanding with EMI , Sony , Universal and Warner to develop a new online music service , with an aim to have it released before Christmas this year .

BNP leader Nick Griffin is to complain to the BBC over his controversial appearance on Question Time , saying he had faced a " lynch mob " .
Mr Griffin argues the normal format of Thursday 's programme was changed and it should not have been held in London .
The fallout from the show - watched by eight million people - has intensified , with Mr Griffin 's fellow panellists saying he had been " shown up " .
But critics said the show had given the BNP huge publicity .
The BNP claims 3,000 people registered to join the party during and after the broadcast .
Meanwhile , an opinion poll carried out after Mr Griffin 's appearance suggests 22 % of voters would " seriously consider " voting BNP in a future local , general or European election .
QUESTION TIME
Watch the programme again
Question Time on iPlayer Two - thirds of the 1,314 people polled by YouGov for the Daily Telegraph dismissed voting for the party under any circumstances , with the rest unsure .
However , more than half of those polled said they agreed or thought the party had a point in speaking up for the interests of indigenous , white British people .
Welsh Secretary Peter Hain , who led a campaign to exclude Mr Griffin from Question Time , said : " This is exactly what I feared and warned about .
" The BBC has handed the BNP the gift of the century on a plate and now we see the consequences .
I 'm very angry about this . "
The BBC has defended Question Time , which was watched by four times its normal audience but also attracted a large number of complaints , saying it had a duty to be impartial and that audience members had selected the questions which set the programme 's agenda .
' Not a Nazi ' More than 240 complainants felt the show was biased against the BNP , while more than 100 of the complaints were about Mr Griffin being allowed to appear on Question Time .
In addition , more than 50 people contacted the BBC to show their appreciation for the programme .
I felt sorry for the guy , really
Bill , 64
What did voters make of Griffin ?
Your views on Nick Griffin Newspaper and blog reaction Political response to performance BNP on Question Time : Key debates Nick Robinson on BNP tactics Mr Griffin , who was one of two BNP candidates to be elected to the European Parliament earlier this year , faced robust questioning about his views on race , immigration and the Holocaust from a largely hostile audience .
He criticised Islam , defended a past head of the Ku Klux Klan but insisted that he was " not a Nazi " .
In a press conference on Friday , the BNP leader said he would be making an official complaint to the BBC about the programme , saying its normal format had been " twisted " so that it focused solely on his views .
" That was not a genuine Question Time , that was a lynch mob , " he said .
He challenged the BBC to ask him on the show again and to allow a wider range of subjects to be discussed .
He also claimed the audience was not representative of the UK as a whole as levels of immigration in London meant it was " no longer a British city " .
Mr Griffin 's fellow guests on the show said his performance had exposed his real views and the true attitudes of the BNP .
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said Mr Griffin had been " taken aback " by the hostility of the audience which showed most people in the UK wanted " nothing " to do with his views .
Justice Secretary Jack Straw , also on the panel , said Mr Griffin had been subjected to proper scrutiny and his performance had been " catastrophic " .
Topical questions
The BNP leader was booed at the start of the hour - long recording and accused of trying to " poison politics " .
He insisted his views had been widely misrepresented in the media and denied a string of statements attributed to him .
The show covered topics including whether it was fair for the BNP to " hijack " images of Winston Churchill , whether immigration policy had fuelled the BNP 's popularity and whether Mr Griffin 's appearance was an early Christmas present for the party .
The only question not to relate directly to the BNP concerned a contentious newspaper article written about the death of Boyzone singer Stephen Gately .
The BBC said the questions had come , as usual , from the audience and were a response to issues in the news over recent days .
" The programme is topical , " a BBC spokesman said .
" People would accept that the BNP and Question Time have been prominent topics this week . "
Members of the audience reflected a cross-section of political views and different backgrounds , the BBC stressed .
The BBC said the audience figures - which peaked at 8.2 million - showed the level of public interest in the scrutiny of elected officials .
" The BBC is firm in its belief it was appropriate for Mr Griffin to appear as a member of the panel , " said deputy director general Mark Byford .
Six protesters were arrested and three police officers injured during demonstrations outside BBC Television Centre ahead of the broadcast .

The White House ’s communications director says that Fox News is little more than a wing of the Republican Party .
“ The reality of it is that Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party , ” Anita Dunn told CNN ’s Howard Kurtz on Sunday .
“ And it ’s not ideological .
I mean , obviously there are many commentators who are conservative , liberal , centrist , and everybody understands that .
What I think is fair to say about Fox is — and certainly the way we view it — is that it really is more of a wing of the Republican Party . ”

Dunn was responding to Kurtz ’s question about her appearance in a Time magazine article , published Thursday , in which she described Fox News as “ opinion journalism masquerading as news . ”
“ They are boosting their audience , ” Time quoted her as saying .
“ But that does n’t mean we are going to sit back . ”
Time described Dunn as “ the general ” in the White House ’s war against Fox News :
The take - no - prisoners turn has come as a surprise to some in the press , considering the largely favorable coverage that candidate Obama received last fall and given the President ’s vows to lower the rhetorical temperature in Washington and not pay attention to cable hyperbole .
Instead , the White House blog now issues regular denunciations of the Administration ’s critics , including a recent post that announced “ Fox lies ” and suggested that the cable network was unpatriotic for criticizing Obama ’s 2016 Olympics effort .
“ They ’re widely viewed as , you know , a part of the Republican Party , ” Dunn said on Kurtz ’s Reliable Sources .
“ They take their talking points , put them on the air , take their opposition research , put them on the air , and that ’s fine .
But let ’s not pretend they ’re a news network they way CNN is . ”

For years , whenever anyone asked Raj Rajaratnam about the success of his hedge fund , the Galleon Group , he chalked it up to being hungrier than everyone else .
“ It is pride , and I want to win , ” Mr. Rajaratnam said in “ The New Investment Superstars , ” a book by Lois Peltz published in 2001 .
“ After awhile , money is not the motivation .
I want to win every time .
Taking calculated risks gets my adrenaline pumping . ”
Now prosecutors are claiming that Mr. Rajaratnam , 52 , crossed the line into criminal activity .
At dawn on Friday , Mr. Rajaratnam was arrested at his expensive Manhattan home , charged with running the biggest insider trading scheme involving a hedge fund .
He and five others are accused by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission of relying on a vast network of company insiders and consultants to make more than $ 20 million in profit from 2006 to 2009 .
Mr. Rajaratnam ’s lawyer has said his client is innocent .
He is free on $ 100 million bail and is expected to be in the office Monday to address Galleon employees .
Oktoberfest is a sixteen - day festival held each year in Munich , Germany during late September ( and running to early October ) .
It is one of the most famous events in Germany and the world ’s largest fair , with some six million people attending every year , and is an important part of Bavarian culture .
Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations , modeled after the Munich event .
The Munich Oktoberfest , traditionally , takes place during the sixteen days up to and including the first Sunday in October .
In 1994 , the schedule was modified in response to German reunification so that if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or 2nd , then the festival will go on until October 3 ( German Unity Day ) .
Thus , the festival is now 17 days when the 1st Sunday is October 2 and 18 days when it is October 1 .
The festival is held on an area named the Theresienwiese ( field , or meadow , of Therese ) , often called d’ Wiesn for short .
Visitors also eat huge amounts of food , most of it traditional hearty fare such as Hendl ( chicken ) , Schweinsbraten ( roast pork ) , Haxn ( knuckle of pork ) , Steckerlfisch ( grilled fish on a stick ) , Würstel ( sausages ) along with Brez ’n ( Pretzel ) , Knödeln ( potato or bread dumplings ) , Käsespätzle ( cheese noodles ) , Reiberdatschi ( potato pancakes ) , Sauerkraut or Rotkraut ( red cabbage ) along with such Bavarian delicacies as Obatzda ( a fatty , spiced cheese - butter concoction ) and Weisswurst ( a white sausage )
To keep the Oktoberfest , and especially the beer tents , friendly for older people and families , the concept of the “ quiet Oktoberfest ” was developed in 2005 .
Until 6:00 PM , the tents only play quiet music , for example traditional wind music .
Only after that will Schlager and pop music be played , which has led to more violence in earlier years .
The music played in the afternoon is limited to 85 decibels .
With these measures , the organizers of the Oktoberfest hope to curb the over - the - top party mentality and preserve the traditional beer tent atmosphere .
Size
The Oktoberfest is known as the Largest Volksfest ( People ’s Fair ) in the World .
In 1999 there were six and a half million visitors to the 42 hectare Theresienwiese .
72 % of the people are from Bavaria .
15 % of visitors come from foreign countries like the surrounding EU - countries and other non-European countries including the United States , Canada , India , Japan , Brazil and Australia .
Besides the Oktoberfest , there are other public festivals that take place at the same location , in April / May : The Munich Frühlingsfest ( Spring Festival ) and Winter Tollwood in December with 650,000 visitors .
Starting in 2008 , a new Bavarian law banning smoking in all enclosed spaces that are open to the public will be in place at the Oktoberfest .
This will mean a complete smoking ban inside the tents .
However , after heavy losses in the 2008 local elections , the state ’s ruling party wants to grant special exemptions to beer tents and small pubs .
In 2008 , the organisers used a special exemption in 2008 for temporary structures so smoking was permitted in the tents although the sale of tobacco was not .
This policy was extended to the 2009 event .
As expected , 2D BOY have published details of their World Of Goo First Birthday experiment .
Offering the game for whatever price people wanted to pay ( previously it was $ 20 ) , this meant people could get a copy for as little as $ 0.01 or as much as fifty million squillion space dollars .
( I believe that ’s the upper limit . )
Originally this was intended to last for a week , but has now been extended to 25th October .
And being a rather open sort they ’ve announced how many copies they ’ve sold so far , and indeed how much people have been paying , along with much more .
It ’s an unprecedented amount of detailed sales information .
Its significance should n’t be underplayed .
In the last week there have been approximately 57,000 sales of the game .
Which is a pretty stunning number .
So let ’s look at what people paid :
Now it ’s immediately important to very much hold onto your horses .
When Radiohead experimented with this pricing model with In Rainbows it was ludicrously declared a failure by the press because most people paid nothing , despite Radiohead making a whacking great ton of cash for it .
It ’s that whacking great ton of cash that ’s interesting here , rather than how many people nabbed it for free .
So clearly , as was always expected , the largest number of people paid 1c for the game – the lowest amount they could .
But this is already more complex than only people taking it for the lowest price possible .
There ’s people who were getting a second copy .
Many bought it on Wii or PC or Mac or Linux and wanted another version .
Having already paid full price for it , this was their opportunity to get a version working on another platform without paying all over again .
Of course , this is n’t going to account for many of the 16,852 who got it for almost - free .
Huge numbers certainly are people taking advantage of getting a free game legitimately .
So the question is , how many of these people would have bought it for the full price were this offer not available ?
I ’m going to stick my head out and suggest a fairly small number .
Why ?
Because the game already was available at full price for a year previously , and they did n’t get it .
As the Steam sales show ( below ) there ’s the possibility that some of them may well have paid full price if the same volume of advertising had occurred without a price drop , simply because they were reminded of its existence .
But I doubt that accounts for many .
The question that remains , and it ’s one that I do n’t think can be answered from the data gathered on this occasion , is how many of the one - centers would have bought it were it reduced to , say , $ 10 , or $ 5 .
All we can say for sure is that these were 17,000 ( minus those duplicating / replacing copies ) who were unlikely to ever pay the $ 20 .
I think it ’s fascinating that then more than twice as many people chose to pay between one and two dollars than chose to pay between one cent and one dollar .
In fact , almost as many people chose to pay in this third bracket as chose to get it for free .
Clearly getting World of Goo for under two bucks is an insane bargain , but it ’s still important to note that people are choosing to pay when they do n’t have to .
Not a significant amount at first glance .
Until you multiply 15,797 by 2 , and put a dollar sign in front of it , for a year old game .
( Clearly minus a significant Paypal commission . )
Other interesting spikes appear at $ 5 and $ 10 .
It ’s kind of cute that people default to recognisable round numbers .
That twenty - three times more people paid $ 10 than $ 9 is , well , possibly useful knowledge for those picking pricing .
People seem to prefer to pay a round number .
This same pattern repeats at $ 15 and $ 20 , with again thirty times more people paying $ 20 than $ 19 .
I think another really significant number is that $ 20 point .
That ’s how much the game cost a year ago , and indeed a week ago .
306 people chose to pay that .
That ’s $ 6120 minus the Paypal cut , when it could have been absolutely zero .
Although let ’s not forget that 16,000 people paying between one and two bucks ( minus cut ) is a hell of a lot more money .
( And 7347 at $ 5 is $ 36,735 of course – keep doing this maths and you can begin to see why 2D BOY describe it as a “ huge success ” . )
The other enormously interesting finding that 2D BOY have revealed is the effect the sale had elsewhere .
It ’s absolutely fascinating that the developers making their game available for all - but - free on their own site saw a 40 % increase in Steam sales .
They explain that it ’s not unusual for a rise or fall in sales on Steam , week by week , of around 25 % , but 40 % is a significant anomaly , and is unlikely to be coincidental .
The sheer volume of promotion their sale received presumably drove people who preferred a Steam - integrated copy to finally get around to buying it .
And it ’s important to note that 40 % increase was following the previous week that had already shown a 25 % increase .
( Of course we do n’t know what that ’s an increase from .
They may well have sold four copies , then five , then seven .
Although perhaps that ’s a little unlikely . )
The effect even extended to the Wii where sales showed an above - normal increase of 9 %
There ’s tons more data to pore over , and you can even download all the responses people gave when asked to explain why they paid what they paid .
Although as 2D BOY point out , this is skewed information , with the majority of those responding to questions being those who paid in the $ 5 bracket .
Of those people , the most frequent explanation for price was that it was all the person could afford at that time .
I do not think a more resounding piece of information can be garnered from all this than that statement .
Oh , and 10 % of those responding were people who had pirated it and now wanted to pay .
Shout that out loud in the street .
You can access all the data here .
But I think the punchline to all this is : 2D BOY made around $ 100,000 in a week .
That ’s $ 50,000 each for writing a blog post about a game they finished a year ago .
By letting people pay whatever they wanted .
That ’s damned important information .
Increasing migration and fertility rates will push Australia 's population to 35 million by 2049 - around 7 million more than previous estimates released just two years ago , Treasurer Wayne Swan says .
The Government says its third intergenerational report will show the country 's population is expected to grow by 65 per cent by the year 2049 .
Speaking today in Sydney Mr Swan said the rising population was one of the biggest economic challenges facing the nation .
He said the number of young people and people of working age was expected to increase by 45 per cent over the next 40 years , but the number of people over 65 was set to double .
For every person now over 65 there are five Australians of working age but in 40 years time that will drop to 2.7 Australians .
" These are some of the facts that illustrate just how big a challenge population is when it comes to the Australian economy , " he said .
" It is arguably one of two of our greatest economic challenges along with climate change . "
The Treasury Department has made the dramatic upward revision in its third intergenerational report which will be released in full before the next Federal Budget .
The previous report was released only two years ago .
Mr Swan says Australia 's fertility rate is now at 1.9 births per woman - a level which has not been seen since the 1980s .
This , combined with increasing numbers of migrants , who also tend to be younger , will contribute to the larger - than - expected increase .
" The larger projected population poses a whole raft of policy challenges and opportunities , quite apart from the age structure , " he said .
" Careful environmental and infrastructure planning will be required to support this population . "
It is forecast that by 2049 people over 65 will make up 22 per cent of the population , compared to around 13 per cent today .
" What Australia has to do is face this challenge fairly and squarley and that 's why we 're putting forward an intergenerational report , " Mr swan said .
Mr Swan has also used his speech to launch the new Australian Institute for Population Ageing Research , which will examine the impacts of the ageing population on the economy , society and environment .
" There 's never been a more pressing need to bring together academia , Government and industry to consider the impacts of population ageing , " he said .
A new longevity index , which will measure the cost of retirement , has also been launched and will be published quarterly .
Australia 's population is now at just under 22 million according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics .
In this year 's Budget the Government gave pensioners a $ 33 rise but also flagged that it would increase the pension age to 67 by 2023 .
Social researcher Mark McCrindle says new cities need to be created to accommodate the booming population .
" We 've doubled since 1963 and the cities have doubled in size as well , " he said .
" Now we 're going to almost double again by mid-century , but the cities can't double because there 's just not the ability to concentrate that mass in .
" So the only way to continue to build our population is if we create new cities or grow some of those smaller regions , so there really does need to be a new plan . "
Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson says the projected forecast will have a " catastrophic " effect on the environment and has called for immigration levels to be cut .
" It 's now time for population reform .
We are sleepwalking into an environmental disaster , " he said .
" Australia is blessed in the quality of life that we have and I believe that we have an obligation to pass onto our children an environment and a country in as good a condition as the one our parents left to us . "
So this is what he did .
The cliffs were jagged but dependable .
He climbed to the top in under an hour and rested at the summit .
Looking back at the boat — he was easily two hundred feet up — he heard sounds coming from the island ’s interior : crunching and crashing , whooping and howling , the crackle of a gigantic fire .
Only in his depleted and desperate state would Max have considered that his best option would be to run , stumble , and crawl through the densest and wildest kind of jungle toward the sounds of what seemed to be some kind of riot .
But this is what he did .
He walked for hours in the moonlight .
He slashed his way through the undergrowth , ducking under grasping , luminescent ferns and slithering between barbed and crosshatched vines .
He waded through narrow creeks and climbed over boulders covered with a red and delicate moss that clung to the stone like embroidery .
The landscape was familiar — there were trees , there was dirt , there were rocks — but then very odd : the earth seemed to be striped in brown and yellow , like peanut butter and cinnamon at the first twirl of a mixing spoon .
After some time , his fur , at least above his shins , was dry , and he was warmer , but he was so tired he was dreaming on his feet .
Again and again , he would shudder awake and find that he ’d been walking while asleep , always making his way toward the chaos in the center of the island .
Finally , when he reached the top of a long high hill , he saw the fire , huge and snapping at the black sky .
Most of it was obscured by a giant boulder in his line of vision , but the fire ’s size was clear : it licked the surrounding trees orange and blotted out the stars above .
It was intentional .
It had a center and a purpose .
Then , movement .
First , there was just a blur — some kind of creature shooting through the trees , a rushing shape silhouetted by the red fire beyond .
It could have been a horse , he thought , but the animal seemed to be running upright , on two feet .
Max dropped to his knees , holding his breath .
Another shape darted between the trees .
This one was the same size , but Max could have sworn he ’d seen a beak .
It seemed to Max ’s tired eyes that a giant rooster , twelve feet tall , had just run across his field of vision .
Max had half a mind to turn and flee — for what good could come of engaging beasts of that size near a fire of that strength ? — but he could n’t leave just yet .
The heat from the blaze had awakened him , and he had to know what was happening down there .
So he skulked forward .
He wanted the warmth the fire promised , and he wanted whatever food might have been roasted on it , and he wanted more than anything else to find out just what was going on .
A hundred yards more and he knew .
Sort of .
That is , he saw what he saw but could n’t believe any of it .
He saw animals .
Animals ?
Creatures of some kind .
Huge and fast .
He thought they might be oversized sorts of humans covered in fur , but they were bigger than that , hairier than that .
They were ten or twelve feet tall , each four hundred pounds or more .
Max knew his animal kingdom , but he had no name for these beasts .
From behind , they resembled bears , but they were larger than bears , their heads far bigger .
Even so , their movements were nimble , deft — they had the quickness of deer or small monkeys .
And they all looked different , as humans do : one had a long broken horn on its nose ; another had a wide flat face , stringy hair , and pleading eyes ; another seemed like a cross between a boy and a goat .
And another —
It had been a giant rooster .
This was the weirdest one by far .
Max slapped himself , making sure he was awake .
He was awake , and there was a giant rooster before him , no more than twenty yards away in the full glow of the raging fire .
It was at once comical — it looked like a giant man in a rooster suit — and powerful and menacing .
The rooster seemed frustrated , staring at another creature , of similar height and heft but with a different shape .
This one had a mop of reddish hair and a leonine face , with a large horn , like a rhino ’s , extending from its nose .
It looked female , if that was possible for such an ugly thing .
She was in the middle of beating a large nest , resting on the ground , with a log .
And this seemed to be greatly upsetting the rooster .
Soon , Max could see a pattern to what the beasts were doing .
It looked as if they ’d come upon some kind of settlement , full of great round nests — each made of huge sticks and logs , and bigger than a car — and had decided to destroy them .
They were systematically wrecking them all , like kids destroying sandcastles .
Max was about to turn and run the other way when he heard ( could it be ? ) a word .
There was , he was almost sure , a word : “ Go ! ”
And just as he was repeating the sound in his mind , turning it over , analyzing it , the creature closest to him spoke a full sentence : “ Is it twisted ? ”
Two of the creatures appeared to have fallen through the wall of a nest , and one was asking the other for help , assessing possible injuries to its spine .
“ Yeah , it ’s kind of twisted , ” the other said .
Then the two gathered themselves up and ran off .
Max squatted down again , determined now to watch a bit longer , to try to figure out what was happening and why .
One creature seemed to be leading the melee .
He had a big round face , sharp horns like a Viking ’s , and dark bags under his eyes .
He was getting ready to run toward one of the nests when the rooster approached him and put his hand — it was n’t a wing ; he seemed to have hands and claws — on his shoulder .
“ Carol , can I speak to you for a second ? ”
“ Not now , Douglas , ” the big one , Carol , said , and moved the rooster aside .
Then Carol got a running start and barrelled into the nest , knocking it flat .
Max was astounded .
Had that sentence just been uttered ?
These were n’t grunting monsters .
They spoke just like people .
Gradually , Max realized that they were a kind of family .
Douglas , the rooster , seemed logical and even - tempered , and did n’t appreciate the way that Carol was trying to amuse himself .
Carol was the main instigator and the heartiest of the destroyers .
He was the biggest , the strongest , the loudest .
He had horizontal stripes on his torso like a kind of sweater , and his claws were huge and cleaver - sharp .
The creature with the horn and the red mop of hair was called Judith , and she had a sharp , poky voice and a harsh cackle for a laugh .
Ira had a bulbous nose , and he seemed to be always close to Judith .
Max guessed they might even be a couple .
Ira had a sad sort of aura and poor posture .
There was the goat - shaped one , Alexander , with a snarl for a face and pin-thin legs .
He was just a little bigger than Max .
And then there was a bull , whose name seemed to be the Bull .
He was gigantic , maybe thirteen feet high , and seemed built entirely of muscle and stone .
He had n’t said a word yet .
The beasts jumped from trees into the nests , they tossed each other into piles , they rolled boulders into the remains of the structures .
It was just about the best mayhem Max had ever seen .
But soon there was a lull in the action .
One by one , the beasts sat down , scratching themselves and nursing small wounds .
“ I ’m bored , ” one said .
“ Hurry up with your investigation — he ’s lying on the remote . ” Facebook
Twitter
Email
Shopping
“ Me , too , ” said another .
“ C’mon ! ” Carol roared .
“ Let ’s finish this ! ”
There was no answer from the rest of them .
Ira sat down .
Carol jogged over to him — they really were agile things , these creatures , Max thought .
“ Ira , ” Carol said , “ we ’re not done yet .
The job is n’t complete . ”
“ But I ’m so tired ! ” Ira said .
“ And uninspired . ”
“ Hey , do n’t think you can rhyme your way out of this .
Uninspired ?
How ’s that possible ? ”
Carol turned to address the rest of the creatures .
“ C’mon , is n’t this fun ?
Who ’s gonna really go crazy with me ? ”
No one responded .
Carol jumped from beast to beast , trying to create some excitement .
When he approached the rooster , Douglas said , “ Carol , why are we doing this in the first place ? ”
A quick cloud came over Carol ’s face .
His teeth — what must have been a hundred of them , each as big as Max ’s hand — were bared in something between a smile and a show of force .
He ignored Douglas .
“ All I need to know now is if there ’s anyone on this island who ’s brave and creative and wild enough to help finish this job .
Is there anyone up to it ? ”
No one responded .
“ Anyone ? ”
Something clicked in Max .
His thoughts lined up , his plan was orderly and clear : he needed to be that someone .
Max dashed down the hill and between the legs of Douglas and Ira , his face a knot of determination .
The creatures towered over him , and outweighed him by thousands of pounds .
“ Whoa , what ’s that ? ” Ira said , alarmed .
“ Look at his little legs ! ” Judith squealed .
“ What ’s he doing ? ” Douglas asked .
Max intended to show them .
He took the largest stick he could swing and he began to hit everything he saw .
He knocked over the remains of whatever nests still stood , he broke low - hanging branches from the trees , he screamed and howled .
The beasts cheered .
“ See , that thing knows how to wreck stuff ! ” Carol said , his eyes aglow .
“ Let ’s do one together , little thing . ”
Together , Carol and Max picked up a long log and ran at a nest that had survived intact , laying waste to it .
Max had never destroyed so much so well and so quickly .
He followed Carol to one of the last nests , and he and Carol both lifted their sticks over their heads , preparing to crush it with simultaneous blows .
“ Hey , new guy ! ” Judith snapped .
“ Do n’t touch that one . ”
NEW YORK -- Scientists acknowledged that an HIV vaccine recently tested in Thailand may be less effective than they originally suggested , but said it still provided valuable leads for further research .
When first publicly disclosing the outcome of the vaccine trial in September , researchers said the vaccine had lowered the risk of infection by about 31 % .
That result was modest but statistically significant .
Coming after two decades of failed HIV - vaccine trials , the announcement was welcomed by researchers around the world .
But two other analyses of the trial data undercut the significance of that result .
The additional analyses were published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine , and were also discussed by researchers attending an AIDS meeting in Paris .
Details of the secondary analyses were disclosed in The Wall Street Journal on Oct. 12 .
The two additional analyses offer a more nuanced picture , suggesting the vaccine 's apparent modest effectiveness against HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , could have been the result of statistical chance .
Still , many scientists say the Thai experiment was useful because it was the first large - scale HIV - vaccine trial to yield a positive result .
" The results are qualitatively similar along all three analyses , " said Seth Berkley , president and chief executive of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative , who was at the Paris meeting .
" Most of the skeptics would say that there 's a signal there " that indicates an immune response .

If nothing else , the new data on housing is forcing the skeptics to try harder to punch holes in the numbers .
Here 's the latest , this time on new home sales :
Bloomberg : Purchases of new homes in the U.S. jumped more than forecast in July , adding to signs that the economy is rebounding from the worst recession since the 1930s .
Sales increased 9.6 percent , the most since February 2005 , to a 433,000 annual pace , figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington .
The number of houses on the market dropped to the lowest level in 16 years .
One factor is the new homebuyer tax credit , which is capped at $ 8,000 , meaning it has the most impact on the lower - end , " everything - must - go " new homes .
It 's why the homebuilders are pushing so hard for it to be extended , and why they 're racing to do as much business as they are now .
Like cash - for - clunkers , we 're at least clearing out a lot of inventory , even if it means a big draw - forward from future demand .
His Middle East policy is collapsing .
The Israelis have taunted him by ignoring his demand for an end to settlement - building and by continuing to build their colonies on Arab land .
His special envoy is bluntly told by the Israelis that an Arab - Israel peace will take " many years " .
Now he wants the Palestinians to talk peace to Israel without conditions .
He put pressure on the Palestinian leader to throw away the opportunity of international scrutiny of UN Judge Goldstone 's damning indictment of Israeli war crimes in Gaza while his Assistant Secretary of State said that the Goldstone report was " seriously flawed " .
After breaking his pre-election promise to call the 1915 Armenian massacres by Ottoman Turkey a genocide , he has urged the Armenians to sign a treaty with Turkey , again " without pre-conditions " .
His army is still facing an insurgency in Iraq .
He can not decide how to win " his " war in Afghanistan .
I shall not mention Iran .
And now President Barack Obama has just won the Nobel Peace Prize .
After only eight months in office .
Not bad .
No wonder he said he was " humbled " when told the news .
He should have felt humiliated .
But perhaps weakness becomes a Nobel Peace Prize winner .
Shimon Peres won it , too , and he never won an Israeli election .
Yasser Arafat won it .
And look what happened to him .
For the first time in history , the Norwegian Nobel committee awarded its peace prize to a man who has achieved nothing – in the faint hope that he will do something good in the future .
That 's how bad things are .
That 's how explosive the Middle East has become .
Is n't there anyone in the White House to remind Mr Obama that the Israelis have never obliged a US president who asked for an end to the building of colonies for Jews – and Jews only – on Arab land ?
Bill Clinton demanded this – it was written into the Oslo accords – and the Israelis ignored him .
George W Bush demanded an end to the fighting in Jenin nine years ago .
The Israelis ignored him .
Mr Obama demands a total end to all settlement construction .
" They just do n't get it , do they ? " an Israeli minister – apparently Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – was reported to have said when the US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , reiterated her president 's words .
That 's what Avigdor Lieberman , Israel 's crackpot foreign minister – he's not as much a crackpot as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but he 's getting close – said again on Thursday .
" Whoever says it 's possible to reach in the coming years a comprehensive agreement , " he announced before meeting Mr Obama 's benighted and elderly envoy George Mitchell , " ... simply does n't understand the reality . "

Across Arabia , needless to say , the Arab potentates continue to shake with fear in their golden minarets .
That great Lebanese journalist Samir Kassir – murdered in 2005 , quite possibly by Mr Obama 's new - found Syrian chums – put it well in one of his last essays .
" Undeterred by Egypt since Sadat 's peace , " he wrote , " convinced of America 's unfailing support , guaranteed moral impunity by Europe 's bad conscience , and backed by a nuclear arsenal that was acquired with the help of Western powers , and that keeps growing without exciting any comment from the international community , Israel can literally do anything it wants , or is prompted to do by its leaders ' fantasies of domination . "
So Israel is getting away with it as usual , abusing the distinguished ( and Jewish ) head of the UN inquiry into Gaza war crimes – which also blamed Hamas – while joining the Americans in further disgracing the craven Palestinian Authority " President " Mahmoud Abbas , who is more interested in maintaining his relations with Washington than with his own Palestinian people .
He 's even gone back on his word to refuse peace talks until Israel 's colonial expansion comes to an end .
In a single devastating sentence , that usually mild Jordanian commentator Rami Khouri noted last week that Mr Abbas is " a tragic shell of a man , hollow , politically impotent , backed and respected by nobody " .
I put " President " Abbas into quotation marks since he now has Mr Ahmadinejad 's status in the eyes of his people .
Hamas is delighted .
Thanks to President Obama .
Oddly , Mr Obama is also humiliating the Armenian president , Serg Sarkisian , by insisting that he talks to his Turkish adversaries without conditions .
In the West Bank , you have to forget the Jewish colonies .
In Armenia , you have to forget the Turkish murder of one and a half million Armenians in 1915 .
Mr Obama refused to honour his pre-election promise to recognise the 20th century 's first holocaust as a genocide .
But if he can't handle the First World War , how can he handle World War Three ?
Mr Obama advertised the Afghanistan conflict as the war America had to fight – not that anarchic land of Mesopotamia which Mr Bush rashly invaded .
He 'd forgotten that Afghanistan was another Bush war ; and he even announced that Pakistan was now America 's war , too .
The White House produced its " Afpak " soundbite .
And the drones came in droves over the old Durand Line , to kill the Taliban and a host of innocent civilians .
Should Mr Obama concentrate on al - Qa'ida ?
Or yield to General Stanley McChrystal 's Vietnam - style demand for 40,000 more troops ?
The White House shows the two of them sitting opposite each other , Mr Obama in the smoothie suite , McChrystal in his battledress .
The rabbit and the hare .
No way are they going to win .
The neocons say that " the graveyard of empire " is a cliché .
It is .
But it 's also true .
The Afghan government is totally corrupted ; its paid warlords – paid by Karzai and the Americans – ramp up the drugs trade and the fear of Afghan civilians .
But it 's much bigger than this .
The Indian embassy was bombed again last week .
Has Mr Obama any idea why ?
Does he realise that Washington 's decision to support India against Pakistan over Kashmir – symbolised by his appointment of Richard Holbrooke as envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan but with no remit to discuss divided Kashmir – enraged Pakistan .
He may want India to balance the power of China ( some hope ! ) but Pakistan 's military intelligence realises that the only way of persuading Mr Obama to act fairly over Kashmir – recognising Pakistan 's claims as well as India 's – is to increase their support for the Taliban .
No justice in Kashmir , no security for US troops – or the Indian embassy – in Afghanistan .
Then , after stroking the Iranian pussycat at the Geneva nuclear talks , the US president discovered that the feline was showing its claws again at the end of last week .
A Revolutionary Guard commander , an adviser to Supreme Leader Khamenei , warned that Iran would " blow up the heart " of Israel if Israel or the US attacked the Islamic Republic .
I doubt it .
Blow up Israel and you blow up " Palestine " .
Iranians – who understand the West much better than we understand them – have another policy in the case of the apocalypse .
If the Israelis attack , they may leave Israel alone .
They have a plan , I 'm told , to target instead only US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , and their bases in the Gulf and their warships cruising through Hormuz .
They would leave Israel alone .
Americans would then learn the price of kneeling before their Israeli masters .
For the Iranians know that the US has no stomach for a third war in the Middle East .
Which is why Mr Obama has been sending his generals thick and fast to the defence ministry in Tel Aviv to tell the Israelis not to strike at Iran .
And why Israel 's leaders – including Mr Netanyahu – were blowing the peace pipe all week about the need for international negotiations with Iran .
But it raises an interesting question .
Is Mr Obama more frightened of Iran 's retaliation ?
Or of its nuclear capabilities ?
Or more terrified of Israel 's possible aggression against Iran ?
But , please , no attacks on 10 December .
That 's when Barack Obama turns up in Oslo to pocket his peace prize – for achievements he has not yet achieved and for dreams that will turn into nightmares .
Prior to discovering I had androgen insensitivity syndrome at the age of 10 , I was a happy , outgoing , confident child , with a lust for life .
I enjoyed speaking to people , I was daunted by no one .
Nor did I have any particular inkling that I was in any way different to my peers , apart from the fact that I was slightly taller than average .
When I was 10 , my parents sat me down and told me ( some aspects of ) the truth .
I had a condition called " androgen insensitivity syndrome " , which had been detected at the age of three when I went into hospital with a suspected hernia .
I had no womb or ovaries , a vagina of dubious depth , I would never have children , or a period .
I can still recall to this day the effect this announcement had on me , especially physically .
I felt winded , as if I had been punched in the stomach really hard .
A sick , nauseous feeling then swept over me , accompanied by burning tears of intense , frantic all - consuming anguish .
These tears were joined by those of my mother , who also seemed to be taking the impact badly .
My father seemed far more positive about the future and suggested that I get in touch with the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group ( AISSG - UK ) so that I could contact people with my condition .
At the time , I was too distressed and full of pity and hatred to even consider this .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
My memory of the rest of that day is hazy , except that I lay in bed at night , crying and wondering " why me ? " , full of sickness at the injustice of it .
And thus , the transformation was complete .
Almost overnight I became deeply introverted and outrageously bitter towards everybody and everything .
My tallness , which had never bothered me , became a source of constant irritation .
I hated everything about my appearance , from my height , to my round face , to my big feet , to the puppy fat of my early adolescence .
My parents had not , in fact , given me the whole story , but rather held certain details back for a later date .
I do n't necessarily blame them for this , since I believe they did what they thought best .
Nevertheless , further revelations at various intervals did nothing but upset me and further increase my self - loathing .
There was the announcement that I would be on hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) for life ; the announcement that it was not certain whether my vaginal opening would be satisfactory for intercourse ; then finally , and worst of all , at the age of around 14 , I was told that my hospital visit at the age of three , with a suspected hernia , had revealed that I had , in place of ovaries , two internal , undeveloped testes , which surgeons subsequently removed .
Various childhood hospital visits have given me a lifelong , morbid fear of anaesthetic .
My teenage years brought further turmoil .
My parents ' marriage , which had always been rocky , disintegrated completely , and my mother and I had to move into a one - bedroomed flat in the dirtiest , most scum - ridden area of town , surrounded by drug dealers .
To make matters even worse , I was slightly overweight at the time , and this , combined with my height and a short haircut , provided perfect scope for various school bullies who gleefully informed me that I was a man on a daily basis .
The impact of this , combined with the knowledge that I 'd had two testicles removed from my body made my self - esteem plummet .
Medical care for my condition was also woefully sparse , and this was the very point in my life where a bit of counselling or advice would have benefited me most .
I simply did not receive the care and attention I should have .
I have found the attitude of medical professionals to be deeply unsatisfactory .
At best , I have been treated with nonchalance , at worst , spoken about as if I am some sort of circus sideshow .
The most galling thing is the lack of information and support that so - called consultants have offered me .
Even at the age of 23 , I am still completely in the dark about all matters regarding the possibility of me having a sex life .
I was handed some dilators by one consultant and told I needed to use them in order to have a satisfactory vaginal opening , yet another consultant told me there was already a satisfactory vaginal opening .
And I was supposed to have had a vaginoplasty when I was a child , which apparently has n't even been of any use .
To make matters worse , I have reason to suspect that the external appearance of my genitalia is unusual , that is to say different to the average .
But , lo and behold , I have been unable to get a straight answer out of any of the medical professionals about this and have even been told by a surgeon that it was not possible for me to have a clitoral recession [ reduction of the clitoris ] and that there would be " scarring " .
I became angrier and more bitter with every day that passed , horribly depressed .
I somehow managed to do consistently well in exams , achieving good grades and excelling in English .
At 16 , I began a part - time weekend job in a supermarket whilst remaining on at school .
By this point , I had no friends at school , having fallen out with everyone I had ever been friendly with .
I did , however , make several friends at work , and began going out with a man named Andy , my first boyfriend .
Apparently , someone found me attractive .
The most I did with Andy was kiss .
Once , on Christmas Day , he visited me at home and we lay on my bed , kissing .
Anticipating what would inevitably follow , I bolted up and left the room , making a flimsy excuse about needing the toilet , leaving Andy looking confused and offended .
We broke up after about three months and I remained a virgin .
The reason for this was that I hated my genital appearance , particularly what I guessed to be a longer than average clitoris .
I also envisioned my vagina being too short for intercourse , and a potential partner assuming I was some kind of transsexual .
I went through the rest of school with no friends , but got the grades to go to university , to study journalism .
Initially , I made friends at university .
But then the people I befriended left , and I was on my own again , making no new friends .
To this day , I feel so lacking in confidence that I have trouble making friends .
I did moderately well at university , had a couple of friends in my hometown , and at 20 , some four years after my first boyfriend , I began seeing a man called Derek .
I slept in a bed with Derek , which led to heavy petting and him touching me intimately .
He wondered what my overly large clitoris was , first speculating that it was a cancerous lump , and then hinting that he thought I was transsexual .
Needless to say , this killed dead any chance of us having sex , which was probably just as well , as he turned out to be a compulsive liar , a cheat and an alcoholic .
I have never been out with a man since , and that was three years ago .
I have been unemployed for a couple of years .
My mother and I have yet again had to move into a small , one - bedroomed flat due to lack of money , and I see very little chance of me ever having a relationship with a man again , unless I were able to have a clitoral recession to make me feel better about myself .
Although I long ago accepted my inability to have children , my sexual inexperience plagues me , making me bitter and unhappy .
I am hostile to men because of this , and find it difficult to make female friends due to my difficulty in trusting people and my self - esteem issues : feeling " different " .
I have love to give , but am unable to give it to someone and suspect that I may never be able to .
The idea of trusting someone enough to make them aware of my background almost seems farcical .
I have good days and bad days .
On a bad day , I idly think to myself that I would not particularly mind dying , and envision myself one day committing suicide , when my mother , the only person who ever cared about me , is no longer alive .
On a good day , however , I feel confident in my goal of one day being a singer - songwriter , and I feel proud of my lyrics , resolute in my goal of bringing them to the world and singing on stage .
This would probably save me .
I even sometimes hope that I can one day love someone , and be loved back , more like the vivacious , smiling - faced child I once was .

Explainer : Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome
The controversy surrounding the gender of the world 800 - metres champion , Caster Semenya , while humiliating for her , has focused much - needed attention on the plight of those born of indeterminate sex .
The International Association of Athletic Federations confirmed yesterday that " gender verification test results " on Semenya will be examined by medical experts .
Reports in the Australian press suggested that though she has the external appearance of a woman , Semenya has no womb or ovaries .
As many as 4 per cent of people are born with neither a clear male nor clear female identity , according to the Gender Trust .
Most may be unaware that they are classified as " intersex " and suffer no discomfort or distress as a result .
But for others , such as Janet , whose story appears on this page , the implications can be profound .
A diagnosis of intersex is made when a person is genetically , biologically or physically different from the accepted norms .
True hermaphrodites , with both sets of genitals , exist only in mythology , and the term is loathed by sufferers , who consider it medically inaccurate and demeaning .
However , some babies are born with ambiguous genitals which leave their sex unclear .
They may resemble those of a female with a large clitoris and the labia fused together , or they may look like those of a male with a small penis and an empty scrotum .
Surgery may be carried out so the baby can be assigned as either male or female .
Others are born with genetic abnormalities .
The sex of a baby is established in the womb according to whether they have an XX chromosome pair ( female ) or XY ( male ) .
The commonest gender disorders are chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner 's syndrome ( X0 , where the second X chromosome is missing ) , which affects one in 10,000 girls , and Klinefelter 's syndrome ( XXY or XXXY ) affecting one in 1,000 boys .
Girls with Turner 's syndrome mostly have normal genitals but the ovaries do not develop and they remain infertile .
Boys with Klinefelter 's syndrome may have small testes or produce low amounts of testosterone and can develop breasts .
They may also have signs of a womb and ovaries .
People with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome , or AIS ( one in 20,000 births ) – as described by Janet – are genetically male ( with the XY chromosome ) but due to a failure to respond to testosterone do not develop male genitals and at birth appear female .
They are thus usually raised as girls .
They can develop breasts at puberty , but the vagina is small or absent , and they do not menstruate .
Some AIS women have had modelling careers because their lack of male hormones means they are unlikely to develop body hair and are less prone to skin conditions like acne .
But society is often unkind to people with such disorders .

Looking at nature from different perspectives can create stunning compositions for your photographs .
This could n’t be more true than when we look at our planet from outer space and appreciate the reality of its beauty from such an incredible and rarely seen perspective .
The images in this compilation are from the Landsat 7 satellite and were created to introduce the general public to the Landsat Program .
Various combinations of the eight Landsat 7 spectral bands were selected to create the vivid RGB composites that we have featured .
Here are 60 absolutely stunning images of the Earth as seen from outer space .
Click on the images for large resolution versions which you can use as wallpapers .
Bogda Mountains – The Turpan Depression , nestled at the foot of China ’s Bogda Mountains , is a strange mix of salt lakes and sand dunes , and is one of the few places in the world that lies below sea level .
Delta Region , Netherlands – Along the southern coast of the Netherlands , sediment - laden rivers have created a massive delta of islands and waterways in the gaps between coastal dunes .
After unusually severe spring tides devastated this region in 1953 , the Dutch built an elaborate system of dikes , canals , dams , bridges , and locks to hold back the North sea .
Akpatok Island – Akpatok Island lies in Ungava Bay in northern Quebec , Canada .
Accessible only by air , Akpatok Island rises out of the water as sheer cliffs that soar 500 to 800 feet ( 150 to 243 m ) above the sea surface .
The island is an important sanctuary for cliff - nesting seabirds .
Numerous ice floes around the island attract walrus and whales , making Akpatok a traditional hunting ground for native Inuit people .
Alluvial Fan , China – A vast alluvial fan blossoms across the desolate landscape between the Kunlun and Altun mountain ranges that form the southern border of the Taklimakan Desert in China ’s XinJiang Province .
Atlas Mountains –
These are the Anti-Atlas Mountains , part of the Atlas Mountain range in southern Morocco , Africa .
The region contains some of the world ’s largest and most diverse mineral resources , most of which are still untouched .
Bolivian Deforestation –
Once a vast carpet of healthy vegetation and virgin forest , the Amazon rain forest is changing rapidly .
This image of Bolivia shows dramatic deforestation in the Amazon Basin .
Loggers have cut long paths into the forest , while ranchers have cleared large blocks for their herds .
Fanning out from these clear - cut areas are settlements built in radial arrangements of fields and farms .
Healthy vegetation appears bright red in this image .
Brandberg Massif – Rising unexpectedly from the heart of the Namib Desert in northern Namibia , the Brandberg Massif is an exhumed granite intrusion .
Unique plant and animal communities thrive in its high - altitude environment , and prehistoric cave paintings decorate walls hidden in its steep cliffs .
Cabo San Antonio – Several hundred kilometers southeast of Buenos Aires , Cabo San Antonio juts out into the Atlantic Ocean along the Argentinean Coast .
Cancun – Known for its beaches and resort hotels , Cancun lies at the tip of Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula .
Inland from this tourist mecca , however , lies a sparsely populated tropical scrub forest that shelters the ruins of ancient Mayan cities .
Campeche – Named after the ancient Mayan Province of Kimpech , the state of Campeche comprises much of the western half of Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula .
Rivers in southern Campeche drain into the immense Terminos Lagoon , the entrance to which is protected by a long barrier island , Isla Del Carmen .
Coahuila , Mexico –
This desolate landscape is part of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range , on the border between the Coahuila and Nuevo Leon provinces of Mexico .
Colima Volcano – Snow - capped Colima Volcano , the most active volcano in Mexico , rises abruptly from the surrounding landscape in the state of Jalisco .
Colima is actually a melding of two volcanoes , the older Nevado de Colima to the north and the younger , historically more active Volcan de Colima to the south .
Legend has it that gods sit atop the volcano on thrones of fire and ice .
Dasht-e Kevir – The Dasht-e Kevir , or valley of desert , is the largest desert in Iran .
It is a primarily uninhabited wasteland , composed of mud and salt marshes covered with crusts of salt that protect the meager moisture from completely evaporating .
Demini River – A marsh - like area borders the Demini River in northwestern Brazil .
The Demini eventually joins the Amazon River .
Desolation Canyon – Utah ’s Green River flows south across the Tavaputs Plateau ( top ) before entering Desolation Canyon ( center ) .
The Canyon slices through the Roan and book Cliffs – two long , staircase - like escarpments .
Nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon , Desolation Canyon is one of the largest unprotected wilderness areas in the American West .
Edrengiyn Nuruu – The Edrengiyn Nuruu forms a transition zone between the Mongolian steppes to the north and the arid deserts of northern China to the south .
Ganges River Delta – The Ganges River forms an extensive delta where it empties into the Bay of Bengal .
The delta is largely covered with a swamp forest known as the Sunderbans , which is home to the Royal Bengal Tiger .
Garden City , Kansas – Center pivot irrigation systems create red circles of healthy vegetation in this image of croplands near Garden City , Kansas .
Ghadamis River –
This scar on an arid landscape is the dry riverbed of the Ghadamis River in the Tinrhert Hamada Mountains near Ghadamis , Libya .
Gosses Bluff – 142 million years ago , an asteroid or comet slammed into what is now the Missionary Plains in Australia ’s Northern Territory , forming a crater 24 kilometers in diameter and 5 kilometers deep .
Today , like a bull ’s eye , the circular ring of hills that defines Gosses Bluff stands as a stark reminder of the event .
Great Salt Desert – Like swirls of paint on an enormous canvas , shallow lakes , mudflats , and salt marshes share the sinuous valleys on Iran ’s largely uninhabited Dasht-e Kavir , or Great Salt Desert .
Great Sandy Desert –
The western region of Australia ’s Great Sandy Desert is in an area almost devoid of sand , but characterized by complex geology .
Great Sandy Scars –
In a small corner of the vast Great Sandy Desert in Western Australia , large sand dunes – the only sand in this desert of scrub and rock — appear as lines stretching from left to right .
The light - colored fan shapes are scars from wildfires .
Greenland Coast – Along Greenland ’s western coast , a small field of glaciers surrounds Baffin Bay .
Guinea - Bissau – Guinea - Bissau is a small country in West Africa .
Complex patterns can be seen in the shallow waters along its coastline , where silt carried by the Geba and other rivers washes out into the Atlantic Ocean .
Harrat Al Birk – Dark - colored volcanic cones sprout from an ancient lava field known as Harrat Al Birk along Saudi Arabia ’s Red Sea coastline .
Many such lava fields dot the Arabian Peninsula and range in age from 2 million to 30 million years old .
The Himalayas – Soaring , snow - capped peaks and ridges of the eastern Himalayas Mountains create an irregular white - on - red patchwork between major rivers in southwestern China .
The Himalayas are made up of three parallel mountain ranges that together extend more than 2900 kilometers .
Iraqi Emplacement –
In an area north of the city of Al - Basrah , Iraq , which borders Iran , a former wetland has been drained and walled off .
Now littered with minefields and gun emplacements , it is a staging area for military exercises .
Jau Park – Fed by multiple waterways , Brazil ’s Negro River is the Amazon River ’s largest tributary .
The mosaic of partially - submerged islands visible in the channel disappears when rainy season downpours raise the water level .
Jordan – Meandering wadis combine to form dense , branching networks across the stark , arid landscape of southeastern Jordan .
The Arabic word “ wadi ” means a gully or streambed that typically remains dry except after drenching , seasonal rains .
Kamchatka Peninsula –
The eastern side of Russia ’s Kamchatka Peninsula juts into the Pacific Ocean west of Alaska .
In this winter image , a volcanic terrain is hidden under snow - covered peaks and valley glaciers feed blue ice into coastal waters .
Von Karman Vortices –
As air flows over and around objects in its path , spiraling eddies , known as Von Karman vortices , may form .
The vortices in this image were created when prevailing winds sweeping east across the northern Pacific Ocean encountered Alaska ’s Aleutian Islands .
Kilimanjaro , Tanzania – Portions of Kenya and Tanzania , Africa , can be seen in this image .
The peak of Kilimanjaro is on the right ; the mountain is flanked by the plains of Amboseli National Park to the north and the rugged Arusha National Park to the south and west .
Konari , Iran – The Mand River and the small town of Konari nestle in the Zagros Mountains in western Iran .
Lake Amadeus – Like frantic brushstrokes , fire scars cover the arid landscape near Lake Amadeus ( upper right ) in Australia ’s Northern Territory .
Lake Amadeus is rich in salts that have been leached out of underlying sediments .
When dry , its lake bed is transformed into a glistening sheet of white salt crystals .
Lake Carnegie – Ephemeral Lake Carnegie , in Western Australia , fills with water only during periods of significant rainfall .
In dry years , it is reduced to a muddy marsh .
Lake Disappointment – Surrounded by sand dunes , Lake Disappointment is an ephemeral salt lake in one of the most remote areas of Western Australia .
An early explorer supposedly named the lake in 1897 after following a number of creeks that he thought would lead to a large lake ; they did , but the lake ’s extremely salty water was not drinkable .
Lena Delta – The Lena River , some 2,800 miles ( 4,400 km ) long , is one of the largest rivers in the world .
The Lena Delta Reserve is the most extensive protected wilderness area in Russia .
It is an important refuge and breeding grounds for many species of Siberian wildlife .
Malaspina Glacier –
The tongue of the Malaspina Glacier , the largest glacier in Alaska , fills most of this image .
The Malaspina lies west of Yakutat Bay and covers 1,500 sq. MI ( 3,880 sq. km ) .
Mississippi River Delta – Turbid waters spill out into the Gulf of Mexico where their suspended sediment is deposited to form the Mississippi River Delta .
Like the webbing on a duck ’s foot , marshes and mudflats prevail between the shipping channels that have been cut into the delta .
Mt. Etna – Located on the Italian island of Sicily , Mt. Etna is one of the world ’s most active volcanoes .
In this image of the volcano in 2001 , a plume of steam and smoke rising from the crater drifts over some of the many dark lava flows that cover its slopes .
Namib Desert , Namibia – Namib - Naukluft National Park is an ecological preserve in Namibia ’s vast Namib Desert .
Coastal winds create the tallest sand dunes in the world here , with some dunes reaching 980 feet ( 300 meters ) in height .
Niger River , Massina Mali – Coursing through parched , landlocked Mali in Western Africa , the Niger River skirts the edge of the dune - striped Sahara before turning sharply south to join the Bani River .
At the confluence of the two rivers is an inland delta complete with narrow , twisting waterways , lagoons , and tiny islands .
Northern Norway – Like dark fingers , cold ocean waters reach deeply into the mountainous coastline of northern Norway , defining the fjords for which the country is famous .
Flanked by snow - capped peaks , some of these ice - sculpted fjords are hundreds of meters deep .
Ocean Sand , Bahamas –
Though the above image may resemble a new age painting straight out of an art gallery in Venice Beach , California , it is in fact a satellite image of the sands and seaweed in the Bahamas .
The image was taken by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus ( ETM + ) instrument aboard the Landsat 7 satellite .
Tides and ocean currents in the Bahamas sculpted the sand and seaweed beds into these multicolored , fluted patterns in much the same way that winds sculpted the vast sand dunes in the Sahara Desert .
The Optimist , Kalahari Desert , Namibia –
On the edge of the Kalahari Desert in Namibia , sand dunes are encroaching onto once - fertile lands in the north .
Healthy vegetation appears red in this image ; in the center , notice the lone red dot .
It is the result of a center - pivot irrigation system , evidence that at least one optimistic farmer continues to work the fields despite the approaching sand .
Parana River Delta – The Parana River delta is a huge forested marshland about 20 miles northeast of Buenos Aires , Argentina .
The area is a very popular tour destination .
Guided boat tours can be taken into this vast labyrinth of marsh and trees .
The Parana River delta is one of the world ’s greatest bird - watching destinations .
This image highlights the striking contrast between dense forest and wetland marshes , and the deep blue ribbon of the Parana River .
Pinacate Volcano Field –
The pockmarked terrain of Pinacate National Park in Mexico ’s Sonora Province is evidence of a violent past .
Among hundreds of volcanic vents and cinder cones are rare maar craters , formed when rising magma met underground water to create pockets of steam that blew nearly circular holes in the overlying crust .
Richat Structure –
The so - called Richat Structure is a geological formation in the Maur Adrar Desert in the African country of Mauritania .
Although it resembles an impact crater , the Richat Structure formed when a volcanic dome hardened and gradually eroded , exposing the onion - like layers of rock .
Shoemaker Crater – Resembling splotches of yellow and green paint , salt - encrusted seasonal lakes dot the floor of Western Australia ’s Shoemaker impact structure .
The structure was formed about 1.7 billion years ago and is currently the oldest known impact site in Australia .
Sulaiman Mountains – The Sulaiman Mountains are a major geological feature of Pakistan and one of the bordering ranges of the Indian subcontinent .
Syrian Desert – Between the fertile Euphrates River valley and the cultivated lands of the eastern Mediterranean coast , the Syrian Desert covers parts of modern Syria , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and Iraq .
Terkezi Oasis – A series of rocky outcroppings are a prominent feature of this Sahara Desert landscape near the Terkezi Oasis in the country of Chad .
Ugab River – Elusive , but ecologically vital , Namibia ’s Ugab River only flows above ground for a few days each year .
The subterranean waters underlying this ephemeral river , however , are shallow enough in places to fill hollows and sustain a wildlife population that includes the rare desert elephant .
Vatnajökull Glacier Ice Cap – Valley glaciers appear as fingers of blue ice reaching out from the Vatnajökull Glacier in Iceland ’s Skaftafell National Park .
The park lies on the southern edge of Vatnajökull , Europe ’s largest icecap .
Volcanoes – Steep - sided volcanic cones along the Chilean - Argentinean border add texture to this “ study in blue . ”
Of approximately 1800 volcanoes scattered across this region , 28 are active .
Volga River Delta – Where the Volga River flows into the Caspian Sea , it creates an extensive delta .
The Volga Delta is comprised of more than 500 channels , and sustains the most productive fishing grounds in Eurasia .
West Fjords – The West Fjords are a series of peninsulas in northwestern Iceland .
They represent less than one - eighth the country ’s land area , but their jagged perimeter accounts for more than half of Iceland ’s total coastline .
The Yukon Delta – An intricate maze of small lakes and waterways define the Yukon Delta at the confluence of Alaska ’s Ukon and Kuskokwim Rivers with the frigid Bering Sea .
Wildlife abounds on the delta and offshore where sheets of sea ice form during the coldest months of the year .

The tiny Pacific nation of Palau is creating the world 's first shark sanctuary , a biological hotspot to protect great hammerheads , leopard sharks , oceanic whitetip sharks , and more than 130 other species fighting extinction in the Pacific Ocean .
But with only one boat to patrol 240,000 square miles of Palau 's newly protected waters — including its exclusive economic zone , or EEZ , that extends 200 miles from its coastline — enforcement of the new measure could be almost like swimming against the tide .
Palau 's president , who is set to announce the news to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday , acknowledges the difficulty of patrolling ocean waters nearly the size of Texas or France with a single boat .
But he hopes others will respect Palauan territorial waters — and that the shark haven inspires more such conservation efforts globally .
" Palau will declare its territorial waters and extended economic zone to be the first officially recognized sanctuary for sharks , " Palauan President Johnson Toribiong told the Associated Press in an interview Thursday .
Shark fishing has grown rapidly since the mid-1980s , driven by a rising demand — mainly in China — for shark fin soup , a highly prized symbol of wealth .
Because of their long life spans and low fertility rates , sharks are vulnerable to overfishing .
Within its EEZ , a nation may regulate fisheries and scientific research and develop other economic efforts .
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization estimates more than half of highly migratory sharks are overexploited or depleted .
Toribiong said a recent flyover by Australian aircraft showed more than 70 vessels fishing Palau 's waters , many of them illegally .
" We 'll do the very best we can , given our resources , " he said .
" The purpose of this is to call attention to the world to the killing of sharks for commercial purposes , including to get the fins to make shark fin soups , and then they throw the bodies in the water . "
Tourists go to Palau for its spectacular diving in the tropical waters , dramatic coral and rich marine life .
The remote Pacific nation recently made global headlines when it agreed to President Barack Obama 's request to take a group of Uighurs — Turkic Muslims from China 's far western Xinjiang region — as part of plans to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center .
Palau is one of the world 's smallest countries , with some 20,000 people scattered over 190 - square mile archipelago of lush tropical landscapes in the Western Pacific .
Its shark sanctuary will shelter more than 135 Western Pacific species of sharks and rays considered endangered or vulnerable , or for which there is not enough data to determine how the species is faring .
" Palau has basically raised the bar for the rest of the world for shark conservation , " says Matt Rand , director for global shark conservation for Washington - based Pew Environment Group , an advocacy organization .
Elsewhere , Europe is trying to crack down on shark fishing in its waters .
In February , the European Commission proposed its first - ever shark conservation rules for European waters .
EU countries account for a third of shark meat exports globally , and shark steaks are increasingly served in restaurants , replacing pricier swordfish steaks , and shark products are also finding their way into lotions and leather sports shoes .
Toribiong said he also will call for a global moratorium on " shark finning " — the practice of hacking off shark fins and throwing the body back into the sea — and an end to unregulated and destructive bottom trawling on the high seas .
Palau is among 20 seafaring nations that already have voluntary agreed to end bottom trawling , which involves fishing boats that drag giant nets along the sea floor .
Enormously effective at catching fish , the nets from bottom trawling also wipe out almost everything in their path , smash coral and stir clouds of sediment that smother sea life , marine experts say .
The UN has called bottom trawling a danger to unique and unexplored ecological systems and said slightly more than half the underwater mountain and coral ecosystems in the world can be found beyond the protection of national boundaries .

Any aspiring journalists looking for a great gig ?
Well New Times parent company , Village Voice Media , is seeking an energetic young writer for what may be the greatest job in journalism -- marijuana critic .
You may have to move to the Mile High City but when you 're already high , what 's a few more feet , right ?
Colorado has a medicinal marijuana law on the books and Westword , our Denver sister paper , is looking for someone to review medicinal marijuana parlors and products for a new column called " Mile Highs and Lows . "
As you could probably imagine , there is no shortage of applicants .
The paper has already received more than 120 applications for the gig , many of whom have offered their pot-puffing services for free .
Westword editor Patti Calhoun says she is shocked by the amount of attention the whole thing has received and that the BBC has even contacted the paper wanting to know about the innovative column .
Calhoun says she wants the column to focus on both the marijuana parlor and the weed itself .
" We want to look at the ambiance of the place -- is it comfortable , is it sketchy , we also want to know about the quality and price of the stuff too , " she says .
Considering Colorado does n't tend to prosecute for minor possession charges , Calhoun says the paper has n't ruled out rating some weed you would buy from some guy in a park and not just the legally legit parlor weed .
Do n't pack your bags ( or your bowls ) just yet -- there are some prerequisites .
Columnists must have a medical condition that allows them to purchase and smoke marijuana and must know how to write -- well .
Sorry to dash the hopes of any of you semi-literate hippies out there , but this probably can't be done from the couch either .
Industry watchers say whoever gets the gig would be the first of his or her kind .
Whoever gets the gig may not be winning that Pulitzer he dreamed about in J - school but he'd get to be one of the first professional pot smokers in America , so who cares .
Ever signed up for one of TheStreet.com 's investor services ?
Then you 've probably also received an occasional email like the one below .
It 's a personal note from " Jim Cramer . "
And it uses the oldest sleazy investment marketing tactic in the book .
What 's that ?
Cherry - picking .
In an attempt to get you drooling about how much money you 'll make if you pony up and buy a subscription , the letter describes a few amazing calls Jim has made in recent months .
Goldman Sachs !
Nike !
GE !
What the letter does n't do , of course , is describe all of Jim 's terrible calls .
This is what many newsletters ( and investment managers ) do :
Tout their good calls and ignore their bad ones .
And they do it because it works .
But for anyone who takes their advice and clients seriously -- as Cramer purports to -- it 's misleading and sleazy .
If you make 100 calls over the next month , about 50 of them will be good .
If we wrote up the top 3 of them , we could make you sound like a market - wizard , too .
And then you would be ready to start selling newsletters !
This , by the way , is what critics of the now - bankrupt - The Street.com - investment pro Lenny Dykstra said he used to do when marketing his own newsletter .
He would close and exit the profitable trades and calculate his " returns " based on those .
Meanwhile , he would just let the losers run .
( Maybe that 's what Cramer meant when he described Dykstra as " one of the great ones " in the business .
Maybe he was referring to the newsletter - marketing business ) .
As we 've said before , we think Cramer is a brilliant entertainer .
We also have a lot of respect for his work ethic and breadth of experience and expertise .
But the pitch below is n't entertainment .
It 's marketing .
And it 's sleazy marketing at that .
Cramer always says his first priority is to help you make money .
If he wants us to believe that , he can start by being more honest when he 's selling you something .
Apple ’s official project to port ZFS to Mac OS X has been canned :
The ZFS project has been discontinued .
The mailing list and repository will also be removed shortly .
The writing ’s been on the wall for this ever since 10.6 shipped with less support for ZFS than 10.5 .
There was unofficial “ kinda sorta works ” support for ZFS in 10.5 , but none in 10.6 .
Word on the street in Cupertino is that dropping ZFS was n’t an engineering decision , but a legal one , and it might have had something to do with Oracle ’s acquisition of Sun .
I do n’t know if it was a problem with the terms of the CDDL license , general distrust / dislike for Oracle , or what — only that the word came down from legal that ZFS was a no - go .
Update : Perhaps it was the NetApp patent lawsuit against ZFS .
The flip side is that I ’ve heard that Apple ’s file systems team is full steam ahead on their own next - generation file system .
And , perhaps not coincidentally , they ’re hiring .

Destructoid's " Indie Nation " series ( semi ) regularly highlights interesting , independently - developed games .
Immortal Defense is a tower defense game for people who abhor tower defense games .
Or people who like them .
Or people who think they 're okay .
I 'm basically trying to say that Immortal Defense is really good , and that you might enjoy playing it .
You can get a demo here , or purchase the full game here .
I first tried ID a long time ago , but gave up after a few minutes of playing because I was evidently an idiot back then and could n't wrap my head around the absurdly intuitive and simple interface .
Maybe the abstract graphics confused me , or something .
I dunno .
I 'm not proud of myself .
A couple weeks ago , I got an email from a reader suggesting I check it out -- not necessarily for the gameplay , he said , but because of what he felt was a fantastic story .
So I downloaded the demo .
Beat it .
Bought the full game .
Beat it .
It 's a damn good game .
The story is delivered through text - based dialogue at the beginning of each level ( one might be tempted to compare it to Braid , but given that the story acts as a reward for successful level completion the narrative bits feel more like the full - motion cut scenes from the Command and Conquer games ) , and basically explains that you , the protagonist , have given up your body so that your spirit can fight on the ethereal plane and defend your planet against an alien invasion .
The story is unobtrusive , well - written , and pleasantly minimalist .
That said , I do n't know ID 's narrative would be any worse in the form of a short story .
The game tells a pretty solid tale during its first half when the player and protagonist 's ideals line up perfectly , but it begins to unravel slightly near the end when the player starts getting wise to the overall plot , at which point the hero 's goals ( protect his family and home planet at all costs ) conflict with the player 's ( complete the game , have fun , see the rest of the story ) .
Immortal Defense is definitely one of the better narratively linear games I 've played , but I can't help but feel like it overreaches in the final few acts .
But that 's all window dressing .
Immortal Defense 's gameplay is what really makes it worth the $ 15 asking price .
Yes , I know -- fifteen dollars , practically a goddamn king 's ransom where indie games are concerned ( despite the fact that sixty dollars retail games Assassin 's Creed blah blah blah ) .
For your money , though , you 'll get access to one hundred levels of progressively difficult and complex levels , culminating in one of the most epic , wonderfully protracted final battles I 've ever seen in a strategy game .
The basic premise is as follows : each level consists of some sort of line drawing in space .
Enemies start at one point on the line , and trace every countour of it until reaching the design 's endpoint , where they presumably enter your home planet and begin killing people .
As the immaterial defender of your planet , your job is to set up little attack towers along the line path and take the baddies out before they can traverse the course .
It 's pretty basic tower defense stuff , except the minimalist level design does a spectacular job of informing the player and focusing his or her attention on what to do .
You do n't have to worry about the bad guys changing course , or moving somewhere you might not expect : they will travel across the line , and only on the line .
You know exactly where they are going , and thus have more power to strategize and plan ahead than you might in , say , PixelJunk Monsters .
It 's a little too easy to get through most of the game just by placing every single tower you have right next to the enemy spawn point , but there 's still enough of a gradual difficulty increase that I never got bored , even when playing for hours at a time .
I typically hate the tower defense genre ( Plants vs Zombies and Lock 's Quest notwithstanding ) , and was thus truly surprised to see myself power through all one hundred levels of Immortal Defense .
Granted , I began to suck near the last act of the game and may have lowered the difficulty a bit ( and by " a bit " , I may mean " all the way " ) in order to see the rest of the story , but I still had some serious fun with Immortal Defense .
Perhaps you will , too .
probabilities must agree with logic on certainly - true and certainly - false statements , which means that the probability of logical truths has to be 1 , and logical falsehoods have to be 0 .
There are no rational agents .
So , all the analysis of prediction markets that assume rationality of traders is incomplete .
There are rational agents .
The market does not converge to 0 or 1 because the P=?NP problem is undecidable .
There are rational agents but the return from the risk - free rate until reaching the time to settlement exceeds the return from the market .
So , the market gives information on how long it will take for the problem to be officially solved .
If your laptop cannot find the solution , neither can the market .
OK , back to more serious work .
I got the idea for this post after reading the post of Dick Lipton on betting on the P=NP problem .
The discussion in the comments was extensive , mainly touching the issues of risk aversion , the inability of humans to estimate properly small probabilities , and so on .
( Wolfers and Snowberg argue that it is due to the inability of human to understand very small probabilities . )
The discussion continued in the Overcoming Bias blog and there one of the comments , being tongue - in - cheek , caught my eye : So , if P=NP is a decidable problem , it is either true or false .
So , aagent , participating in the market , shouldwhether P=NP .
It is not a matter of probabilities !
All the information to make the decision is available .
So , if the market has one or more rational players , the market should converge to a price of 0 or 1 immediately , depending on the state of the problem .
Right ?
So , which of the following is true ?
Raid proof that Bush administration ’s ‘ cowboy diplomacy ’ a failure , House Rep. says
An October , 2008 , US military raid inside Syria that killed seven civilians may not have eliminated a senior al Qaeda operative as anonymous Pentagon sources claimed at the time , says a new investigative report .
On October 26 of last year , a squadron of US military helicopters raided a farm five miles from the Iraqi border , inside Syria .
Although the US government has never officially admitted the Abu Kamal raid , anonymous Pentagon sources at the time leaked the claim that Abu Ghadiya , a “ senior al Qaeda terrorist , ” was killed in the attack .
The US had earlier named Ghadiya as a major al Qaeda operative who ran the smuggling operation that brought al Qaeda arms , fighters and money into Iraq to fight the US .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even as US audiences — mesmerized by the presidential election at home — mostly did n’t notice the incident , the raid caused an uproar in the Middle East at the time , with most Arab countries viewing it as an act of war .
The Syrian government described the US ’s actions as “ terrorism . ”
“ An al Qaeda coordinator in Syria who was wanted for sending operatives , weapons and cash into Iraq was captured during a US strike , but it was not clear whether or not he survived , ” Fox News reported at the time , citing an anonymous source in the Pentagon .
But an investigative report in Vanity Fair states there is no evidence to suggest Ghadiya was captured or killed during that raid , nor is there evidence that he was anywhere near that farmhouse .
After interviewing eyewitnesses and officials , authors Reese Erlich and Peter Coyote conclude that , in all likelihood , this was a botched raid based on faulty intelligence .
The only tangible result of the raid was the death of seven civilians , including a six - year - old boy and three other children .
The authors point out some unusual things about the Pentagon ’s behavior with respect to the raid :
The military has never officially admitted the raid , and it has never provided evidence of Ghadiya ’s death , as it had done earlier with other targeted assassinations of al Qaeda leaders .
ADVERTISEMENT
The anonymous claims that Ghadiya was killed in the operation are “ total bullshit , ” former CIA Middle East expert Bob Baer told Vanity Fair .
Baer , whose book See No Evil was made into the film Syriana , asked : “ Where ’s the body ?
Where are the documents or the cell phone ?
If they brought back an al Qaeda body , why do n’t they have something ?
There ’s no conceivable way they would have killed him and not shown it . ”
US House Rep. Nick Rahall ( D - WV ) told the magazine that the Bush administration mishandled the raid .
Syrian civilians “ lost their lives in an unfortunate attempt by the previous administration to once again mislead , bully , and isolate a regime . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Rahall added that raids like this are having a “ disastrous effect on American foreign policy .
They alienate civilians .
The cowboy diplomacy of the past led America to some of its lowest [ public - opinion ] ratings around the world . ”

A GP may be struck off after experts heard he repeatedly failed to spot cancer victim Nikki Sams ' symptoms .
The advertising saleswoman , who died at 26 , had complained eight times in four years to Dr Navin Shankar , 59 , of irregular bleeding and abdominal pain .
Yet cervical cancer was diagnosed only when she was moved to another doctor .
Nikki's dad Michael , 54 , who gave up his job to care for her , said a " catalogue of unforgivable errors " cost his daughter her life .
He said : " Nikki died unnecessarily .
It 's unbelievable a girl can go to her doctor so often and be sent away told not to worry .
" God only knows the pain she went through .
I brought her up as a single parent .
We were so close .
I 've a younger daughter and Nikki was her role model .
She fell to the ground when I told her sister was dying .
It 's torn us apart . "
Michael , of Luton , Beds , was speaking after Dr Shankar , who saw Nikki in Luton between 1999 and 2005 , last week appeared before a General Medical Council panel to assess his fitness to practise .
It found Nikki had told him of her symptoms on eight occasions .
The panel also ruled she made a number of other unrecorded complaints about menstrual bleeding but the doctor failed to keep adequate records .
Nikki even made a request for a referral .
At no stage did Dr Shankar perform an abdominal or internal examination or send her to hospital .
Her new GP ordered a smear test , which revealed abnormal cells , and hospital tests found a tumour on her cervix .
She had a hysterectomy the following week but cancer had spread to her lungs , spine and neck .
Despite radiotherapy and chemotherapy , she died in 2007 .
Dr Shankar 's case was adjourned while a performance assessment is carried out .
If found unfit to practise , he could receive a warning , have conditions placed on his registration , be suspended or struck off .
TREATMENT
Options for cervical cancer include surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
If the cancer has n't spread outside the cervix and not penetrated very far , a minor op might be all that 's needed .
The genome is folded into a complex but highly organised ball Scientists have worked out the 3D structure of the human genome .
Their findings , published in Science magazine , reveal how long strands of DNA code are folded and tightly packed into the nucleus of a human cell .
Unfolded , the cell 's genome - those strands of DNA code - would be approximately 2 m in length .
The team showed how this is organised into a tight ball to fit inside a nucleus , which is about one hundredth of a millimetre in diameter .
The US - based research team developed improved DNA sequencing and computational methods to build a model of the genome .
This is the first glimpse we 're getting of a whole genome in 3D
Job Dekker
University of Massachusetts Job Dekker , from the University of Massachusetts Medical School , led the research .
He explained to BBC News that , with its new approach , his team had discovered important patterns in the shape of the genome .
" For a given part of the genome , we can determine its neighbours , " he said .
" And if you can do that for every gene - if you know which other genes surround it - you can work your way back computationally to calculate the structure .
" This is the first glimpse we 're getting of a whole genome in 3D . "

Advertisement DNA is bundled into chromosomes .
The combination of DNA and protein that makes up these chromosomes is called chromatin .
Dr Dekker explained how a 3D view showed how chromatin's complicated folding pattern was important in the regulation of genes .
" We now see that things that are far apart along the linear sequence of the genome are actually next to each other in the folded structure , " he said .
" They 're close together in the structure , and they 're talking to each other . "
This constant communication is the basis of the regulation that keeps a cell healthy and functional .
This means that a detailed view of the genome 's structure could provide a new window into diseases such as cancer , which is caused by errors in the genetic code .
" Maybe we will be able to predict these [ disease - causing ] changes better now , " said Dr Dekker .
The team also discovered that the human genome is organised into two separate compartments , keeping active genes accessible while keeping inactive DNA in a sort of storage compartment .
The chromosomes snake in and out of the two compartments - separating their active and inactive sections .

Apteryx was the first high altitude balloon that the three of us -- Greg Klein , Alex Martin , and Tim Wheeler -- launched in the summer of 2009 .
It was designed to be as simple as possible : basically , we wanted to get our foot in the door .
The balloon carried a very simple 4 pound payload -- it contained a camera , radio , and a few sensors .
Telemetry served only one purpose for us -- we needed to know where the balloon was ( more specifically , where it landed ) .
For tracking , we used a Byonics Micro - Trak AIO APRS radio .
The AIO is an one - way radio ; it periodically transmits GPS coordinates every two minutes .
When it got to above 60,000 ft , the GPS stopped working until it dropped back below 60,000 ft .
It came with a rubber - duck antenna which we replaced with a J - Pole tied to the load line .
None of us had a cellular plan with internet access , so we needed to find some way to relay the APRS coordinates back to us .
We had two implementations of this .
Alex was able to rig up a Debian desktop computer running soundmodem to decode the packets coming through on his radio .
Unfortunately , we were n't able to power the computer for more than 15 minutes -- we thought that the UPS would last longer than it actually did .
Greg wrote a Perl script using the Ham :: APRS :: LastPacket CPAN module that would a text message to one of us every 10 minutes with the latest GPS coordinates , time , and altitute .
For whatever reason , it was n't reporting accurate , recent coordinates the day of the launch --. it kept reporting that we were still in Cupertino .
Ultimately , we had to periodically call somone with an internet connection and ask for coordinates .
The balloon we used was a Kaymont 1500 gram sounding balloon .
With a 4 pound payload , the balloon was actually probably too large for our needs ; in the future we will be able to purchase a smaller ( and cheaper ) balloon .
The balloon was launched on September 9th , 2009 from Tres Pinos , CA .
We made two huge mistakes on the day of : we underfilled the balloon and misjudged the winds .
As this was the first time any of us had filled such a balloon , none of us knew how much helium to put in it .
All of the literature I 'd read indicated that a reasonable flight time for such a project would be about 3 hours : two hours ascending and one hour descending .
We hit about 5 hours ; 4 and a half ascending and half an hour descending .
Even though we designed the experiments to only last 3 hours , the camera functioned for the entirety of the flight , and the science payload came close .
We had planned on recovering the balloon in the Central Valley , to the East of our launch site .
The land is flat in the Valley , so it would have been quite easy to recover .
The wind , however , pushed the balloon North of our lanch site , and the balloon landed in Henry Coe State Park -- a very difficult place to find a balloon .
We had intended on recovering the balloon on the same day as the launch , but we had very poor GPS data of the landing location -- the last coordinate we got indicated the payload was 3,000 ft. above the ground .
Fortunately , on Saturday , an APRS digipeter picked up a few readings from our payload : we knew exactly were to look .
The payload was recovered on Sunday .
We 're not entirely sure how high the balloon actually went .
The GPS cut out at 60,000 ft , so we can't rely on that .
The lowest barometric pressure sample we recorded with our science payload was 1.86 kPa -- this correlates to about 90,000 ft .
The datasheet for the pressure sensor , however , indicates that the readings are only accurate above 30 kPa .
Looking at the information prior to the 60,000 ft GPS blackout , it appears as though the balloon was rising at a rate of 450 feet / minute .
Extrapolating from the 4 hour 30 minute time from launch to burst , we get something around 120,000 feet .
We retrieved over 600 sensor readings of external temperature , internal temperature , pressure , humidity , and acceleration .
These results are hosted on sensor.network.com .
If you want , you can grab a CSV file of our sensor readings here .
Alex stitched together a bunch of pictures from the apex of the flight to form a high - res panorama .
It 's quite nice ; definitely worth taking a look .
Apparently it took 8 hours to stich on an 8 core Mac Pro .
We have several thousand pictures -- if you 're interested , they can all be found here .
Be warned , there are a lot of them , and after you see a few , you 'll likely get bored .
I 've gone through the pictures and here are a few of the best .
Click on any one of them to get a larger version .
Right before Alex cut the line .
Shortly after launch .
Looking at Pacheco Pass and the San Luis Reservoir .
Look closely and you can see an airplane .

Muslim Khan was articulate and skilled in handling the media
One of the highest ranking Taliban officials in Pakistan has been arrested with four other senior militants in the country 's north - west , officials say .
Muslim Khan was a key spokesman for the Taliban in the Swat valley as well as one of the most senior militant commanders in the region .
The army recently staged an offensive in Swat , which it declared a success .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says this is a milestone for the army 's operation there .
One of the chief criticisms of the operation had been that it had failed to net the top Taliban leadership , our correspondent says .
These are the first significant arrests .
" Five Taliban commanders , including Muslim Khan , were arrested in a raid , " Pakistan army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas told the BBC .
He gave no details of the raid but strongly denied local media reports that the men had been lured under the guise of talks by the army and then taken into custody .
" This is absolutely incorrect , " he said .
See a map of the region Despite the latest arrests , the whereabouts and fate of the Taliban leader in Swat , Maulana Fazlullah , are unknown .
After reports that he had been wounded and was close to death earlier this year , it was Muslim Khan that contacted the BBC to say the Taliban chief was " alive and healthy " .
Muslim Khan is one of the most recognised faces of the Taliban in the Swat valley .
He frequently spoke to journalists on behalf of Maulana Fazlullah .
He was articulate and skilled in handling the media , our correspondent says , giving interviews in both English and Arabic .
He spent two years as a seaman with a British shipping company in the 1970s and lived in the US in the late 1990s , where he worked as a house painter .
SWAT OFFENSIVE Launched in April after militants took area 100 km from Islamabad Army says some 1,700 militants killed , but none of their leaders
One of biggest human migrations of recent times , with 2 m displaced Army says operation largely over in July , and residents begin return
Caught in the middle in Swat Darkest hour for Pakistan 's Taliban ?
The military earlier said Mr Khan was apprehended after a " successful operation " .
He was held along with fellow militant Mahmood Khan , also reported to be one of the most senior Taliban commanders in Swat .
It is not clear when the operation took place .
The militants had rewards of 10 million rupees ( $ 121,000 ) on their heads .
Mahmood Khan has been described as the commander of Kuza Banda in northern Swat , the Associated Press news agency reports .
Tribal militias
The latest fighting in the Swat valley began in April when Pakistani Taliban forces expanded their operations into districts only 96 km ( 60 miles ) from the capital .
Under the terms of a peace deal , militants were expected to disarm in exchange for the implementation of Sharia law throughout the Malakand division , which includes Swat valley .
There is disquiet in Swat over the corpses of suspected militants
The army accused the Taliban of reneging on the deal .
As the fighting intensified some two million people were displaced .
Although many have returned , there is still unrest and bloodshed in the troubled district .
Fighting is still reportedly continuing in isolated pockets .
And in recent weeks , more than 200 corpses have been found across the valley .
The killings have been carried out execution - style and the bodies are believed to be of suspected Taliban .
Security forces have strenuously denied carrying out extrajudicial killings as part of their offensive .
They claim local residents are behind the attacks .
While this remains unconfirmed , local residents have formed tribal militias to take on militants in what correspondents say is a new development for the region .
In early September , members of a local tribal militia killed three suspected insurgents .
The army has been encouraging the voluntary tribal fighting forces , which exist in other parts of north - west Pakistan .

Does Picking Up Sticks Deserve the Death Penalty ?
In his book , Losing Faith in Faith , denominational - preacher - turned - atheist , Dan Barker , wrote a chapter titled “ Is the Bible a Good Moral Guide ? ”
In that chapter , he argued that the Bible is not an acceptable guide for human behavior .
In fact , he claimed that the God of the Bible is “ an immoral person . ”
As proof of God ’s “ immorality , ” Barker referred to a brief incident found in Numbers 15 .
In that chapter , a man was found gathering sticks on the Sabbath .
Those who found the man took him to Moses and Aaron , who put him under guard until they could ascertain from God how this man should be punished .
According to Numbers 15:35 , the “ Lord said to Moses , ‘ The man must surely be put to death ; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp . ’ ” Writing about this episode , Barker quipped :
If there were something dangerous about picking up sticks on Saturday or Sunday , then humanity should know it by now .
Since we all agree that such an act in itself is harmless , then whoever executes a person for committing such a “ crime ” is an immoral person .
Even if there were something wrong about picking up sticks , it is not so terribly wrong that it deserves capital punishment ( 1992 , p. 329 ) .
Is it true that God was wrong in ordering this man to be stoned ?
Barker claims that “ we all agree ” that picking up sticks on Saturday or Sunday is harmless .
However , Barker does not take into account that the man was in direct violation of a specific command issued by God to the Israelites .
One of the Ten Commandments specifically stated : “ Remember the Sabbath day , to keep it holy .
Six days you shall labor and do all your work , but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God .
In it you shall do no work ” ( Exodus 20:8 - 10 ) .
We do not all agree that disobedience to a direct command from God is harmless .
Implied in Barker ’s assessment of God ’s punishment in this incident is the idea that Barker ( and many skeptics like him ) seems to think that he knows disobeying a “ petty ” command from God could not cause harm .
In truth , there is no way that Barker could know what would have happened if this man ’s disobedience was not punished as it was .
Often , disobedience to the commands of one who is in a position to know more about a particular situation could result in harm or death for multiplied thousands .
For instance , why does the United States military insist on obedience to officers even in the minutest details ?
After all , “ we all agree ” that wearing a pair of boots that is not shined properly is a “ harmless ” activity , and folding a shirt incorrectly is no great crime .
Why , then , does the military insist upon obedience even in the most minuscule ordinances ?
The simple truth is that laxity in obedience to small regulations breeds laxity in obedience to other ordinances .
And if that laxity is not punished quickly and decisively , it has the potential to be contagious , and spread throughout the entire group or organization .
And while inadvertent missteps in dress might not receive extremely harsh punishment , openly rebellious behavior to those of higher rank certainly would carry a significant punishment .
Let us examine how that might work .
Suppose that the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military declared that only black boots are to be worn by the troops .
Then suppose that one of the troops rebelliously decides he does not want to wear black boots , and thus dons a pair of bright - red boots .
He marches with his fellow troops , and his commanding officers do nothing to punish him .
His fellow troops see that his blatant indiscretion goes unpunished , so they decide to rebel and wear red boots .
Soon , half the army is wearing red boots , a scenario that does not seem that “ harmful . ”
When they are called to battle , however , the importance of the Commander ’s regulations becomes evident .
The enemy is dressed exactly like the U.S. military , except the enemy army wears red boots .
The only way to distinguish between friend and foe happened to be the boot color , and due to the rebellious disobedience of the one man who was doing something “ harmless , ” thousands of U.S. troops are killed by friendly fire .
A direct command from the Commander in Chief almost always houses an important purpose , about which many of those who are supposed to follow the command know little or nothing .
Many times , only the Commander in Chief knows how harmful disobedience to the command can be .
In the same way , God issued a direct command .
That command was blatantly disobeyed .
How harmful could that one man ’s disobedience have been ?
What if Joshua had seen this man ’s disobedience go unpunished , and when God told him to march around Jericho thirteen times , Joshua decided that one time would be enough ?
Or what if the Israelites saw this man go unpunished , and thus decided that eating uncooked pork was not that big of a deal either ?
Or suppose that the Israelites had seen this man ’s disobedience , decided they would break the other nine commandments , and therefore began to murder and commit adultery .
The truth is , God is in a position to know much more about the situation than humans .
He knew exactly what would have happened if this man ’s disobedience was not punished .
Foreseeing the validity of this reasoning , Dan Barker conceded that punishment might be necessary , but claimed that the death penalty was too harsh .
Says who ?
Suppose this man ’s disobedience , if not punished with death , would have resulted in the moral collapse of the entire Israelite nation ?
Is there anyway Dan Barker could know that such would not be the case .
Or suppose that this man ’s disobedience to a direct command from God , if not punished by the death penalty , would have caused the Israelites to neglect sanitation laws instituted by God , bringing in a plague that killed thousands .
What penalty would be appropriate for a man who was responsible for the death of thousands ?
In truth , only God could know what would have happened if this man ’s disobedience had gone unpunished , and only God could have known what would have happened if that punishment was not the death penalty .
When Dan Barker and other skeptics demand that God ’s punishment in this ( or other ) cases is too harsh , they do so without reference to any objective , moral standard .
Their sole defense is a wave of the hand and a “ we all feel ” statement that is designed to draw in their readers emotionally .
The Bible says that God knows “ all things ” ( 1 John 3:20 ) .
Since that is the case , only God can truly determine what is harmful and what is not harmful , and only God has the prerogative of determining the proper punishment for disobedience .
Today , we no longer are under Old Testament laws concerning the Sabbath , but we are under the New Testament laws established by Jesus .
In comparing disobedience to the two laws , the writer of Hebrews concluded :
Anyone who has rejected Moses ’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
Of how much worse punishment , do you suppose , will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot , counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing , and insulted the Spirit of grace ( 10:28 - 29 ) ?
Disobedience to God is a serious offense .
It often is the case that those who are the most disobedient to His commandments are the ones who attempt to minimize the importance of obedience .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Six Australians playing for Welsh rugby league club Celtic Crusaders will be deported from Britain after they breached visa regulations , the UK Border Agency said on Tuesday .
Captain Jace van Dijk , top try - scorer Tony Duggan , Damien Quinn , Darren Mapp , Mark Dalle Cort and Josh Hannay had all been playing for the Bridgend - based club in the Super League .
“ As the result of an intelligence - led investigation into possible immigration offences among players at Celtic Crusaders , we can confirm that six Australian nationals have been served with papers confirming that they are illegally present in the UK , ” a UK Border Agency statement read .
“ We now expect these individuals to leave the country .
If they refuse to do so voluntarily , we will enforce their removal .
The players are prohibited from working in the UK with immediate effect . ”
Crusaders chief executive Mike Turner said they would abide by the ruling .
“ We are sorry to be losing players who have made a big contribution in making Celtic Crusaders a Super League club , ” he said on the club ’s website ( www.crusadersrfl.com).
“ Celtic Crusaders have cooperated fully with the UK Border Agency ’s investigation and we will abide by their findings . ”

On August 25 , 2009 , a demonstration was held in Jakarta , Indonesia , organised by the Parliament of the Streets Alliance at the inauguration of newly elected members of parliament .
The protesters demanded free education for all citizens , free health programs , employment and housing programs for poor people .
Henri Anggoro , a leader of the Poor People ’s Union ( Serikat Rakyat Miskin Indonesia , SRMI ) , which organises in the sprawling shanty towns , said that experience has shown that parliament ignores the interests of the people .
" They only represent the interests of a handful of people , rather than representing the people who elected them " , he said .
Anggoro challenged the new legislators to advance the political agenda of democracy instead of giving priority to the interests of a handful of elite and foreign parties .
He demanded popular participation , particularly in policy making and the national budget .
The Parliament of Streets Alliance has begun organising local councils , which could become the embryo of a parliament of the people , Henri said .

Indonesia :
The people vs neoliberalism
The anti-neoliberal street protests above took place in Indonesia throughout Indonesia 's presidential election campaign in June - July 2009 .
While the IMF 's favourite candidate Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono won , a widespread discussion about neoliberalism took place around the country .
The photos were above taken by comrades from the Peoples Democratic Party of Indonesia , whose cadre were key organisers of these protests .
Now if the name BETSY MCCAUGHEY rings a bell , it 's because she helped created the lies about Hillary Clinton 's health care plan .
Google her and James Fallows .
She 's now back creating lies about the Obama plan .
See this article .
The distortions she put forward in this column have filtered down to the Palins and Becks of the world .
NOW why does OBAMA need to get on this ?
Because the evil doctor Beck is calling out ?
It 's Rahm Emanuel 's brother , Ezekial .
Here 's the article he wrote in a bioethics journal .
They are going to do the same thing to Dr. Emanuel that they did to Sonya Sotomayor .
The first thing you are going to hear about them is a lie and a distortion of their true philosophy and who is going to bother to read the original sources .
I am way smarter than Beck and Palin , but the bioethics article is hard for me to understand , it 's intended for a specialty audience .
But just as the main point of Sotomayor 's speech , that a judge needs to actively check themselves against unconscious bias , was distorted , they are doing the same to this article .
These article seems to me to be the beginning of a discussion , not hard and fast rules .
HOWEVER , THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO get what Dr. Emanuel truly believes out to the news media because otherwise the lie will take hold .
Did the White House learn from Sotomayor battle about monitoring wingnut media ?
They may want to have a debate on Ezekial Emanuel , but they are not going to have that luxury .
By Googling the url of the article , I found this bit of wingnut filth .
The Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria have maintained close relations during the last 30 years .
Some see their relationship as an alliance .
Throughout the years , each side has carried a different weight in this relationship .
At the initial stages of their relations in the 1980s , Syria 's position in the region was more senior .
This was due to several reasons : first and foremost , Iran was stuck in a bloody war against Iraq .
This sapped Iran of its resources , leaving them reliant on Syria - Iran 's only backer in the Middle East .
Damascus also hosted an Iraqi pipeline which it later shut down as part of a deal with Tehran .
And last but not least , Syria was the gateway to Lebanon , where Iran desperately wanted to spread its influence amongst the country 's Shiites .
Once the war against Iraq was finished in the late 80s , the balance in their bilateral relationship slowly started to tip in Iran 's favor .
Hezbollah 's increasing influence was an important factor .
In comparison to the Amal movement , which had a closer relationship with Damascus , Hezbollah managed to attract larger support amongst Shiites in Lebanon and Lebanese Shiites living in Diaspora - in places such as West Africa and Latin America .
Hezbollah 's position was further boosted by Israel 's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 .
Meanwhile , the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and later Iraq elevated Iran 's position still further , as they removed Iran 's arch enemies in both countries .
Once each respective invasion was over , Tehran was more successful than Damascus at increasing its influence in Iraq and Afghanistan -- both of which remain strategically important to the U.S .
Meanwhile , Syria 's weight was reduced after the assassination of Rafiq Hariri and the ensuing UN investigation .
Dwindling oil resources also left Syria in a weaker regional position .
In 2000 , Damascus exported 500,000 barrels of oil a day .
This has now fallen to 150,000 barrels a day .
However , it seems that after the recent demonstrations in Iran , Syria may be about to adjust the balance in its favor .
The loss of legitimacy suffered by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei 's government in the region is one factor .
The other is its apparent refusal to discuss the nuclear program with the U.S.
This will not only isolate Iran internationally , it will also lead to further sanctions , which will damage its economy .
Syria , on the other hand , is elevating its position regionally .
Damascus has worked diligently to improve its image of late , indicated by more recent efforts to improve relations with Saudi Arabia and Turkey .
Syria also seems to be gaining more favor in Washington , as shown by recent visits to the country from senior State Department officials .
Damascus also appears to be complimenting its regional impact by increasing its influence over levels of violence .
This is especially true when it comes to Iraq .
Judging by recent reports from Iraq , Damascus has been providing support to militants who staged attacks in Baghdad and other areas .
Although this support for militants has damaged Syria - Iraq relations , it likewise has increased Syria 's bargaining power in the region .
This now means that when it comes to formulating regional strategies for creating stability in Iraq , more importance has to be attached to Syria 's demands and position .
The weakening of Iran 's position internally and externally provided Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad with an important opportunity which he seems to be putting to good use .
This does not mean that Syria is about to break relations with Tehran .
This is unlikely to happen , even if the Golan Heights are returned to Syrian hands by Israel .
What it does mean however , is that Damascus could demand a higher price from Tehran for its friendship .
In the 1980s this came in the form of free oil .
Nowadays , this could manifest itself in the form of more Iranian investment inside Syria , or a bigger say over Hezbollah and Hamas ' decision making process .
Al - Assad recently delayed his visit to Iran to congratulate Ahmadinejad by three days .
This angered some Iranian analysts such as Dr. Hamid Ahmadi , who is an associate professor of Political Science at the University of Tehran .
According to his recent article in the Iran Diplomacy publication , Bashar Al - Assad stood Ahmadinejad up because he wanted to use that opportunity to present himself as a intermediary on behalf of French President Nicolas Sarkozy to free a French lecturer who has was arrested in Iran .
If true , then Syria may now be more friend than ally to the Islamic Republic .
As long as there have been muzzleloading firearms , their shooters have been burdened by reliability , consistency and safety concerns .
The new Federal Premium FireStick solves those issues .
A picture obtained on June 21 , 2009 shows Iranian riot police on a street of Tehran on June 20 , 2009 .
An Iranian student protester in Tehran made a passionate plea for help from the world community this morning in a phone call to CNN ’s “ American Morning . ”
For safety reasons , CNN can only identify the student by his first name , Mohammad .
He 's been a part of the protests and a target of the violence there .
Below is an edited transcript of the interview .
John Roberts :
What is the scene like on the streets ?
Are there more demonstrators out there on the streets ?
Or is it much quieter than it has been in recent days ?
Mohammad : Hello .
Actually I participated in Saturday 's demonstrations in parts of Tehran .
What I saw , I saw thousands of security officers that tried to break up the crowd .
They used canisters and batons and water cannons against us .
They attacked us .
And we also in response attacked them .
We attacked them by throwing stones .
And we built trenches in the streets and actually defended too .
Roberts :
So there was quite a large confrontation going on there over the weekend .
But can you tell us what the scene is like on the streets today ?
Mohammad : Today was a long day in Tehran .
And yesterday there were n't any organized rallies in Tehran .
Because we take orders from our leader Mr. Karroubi and Mr. Mir Hossein Moussavi .
The connections , the communication is very difficult , more than even you can imagine in Tehran .
But I myself have n't received any orders from our leaders yet .
But as soon as I get any order , I will participate in any demonstration that they tell us .
Kiran Chetry :
When you say receiving orders , tell us how the protests are organized .
How are you guys called to go and where ?
Mohammad : Actually , I 'm a regular person .
I 'm not behind the scenes .
I cannot tell you exactly how these demonstrations are organized .
But as I know , as people said , there is a council , a group of Iranian reformists who organize these demonstrations and they tell us in any way that they could and we just follow .
Chetry :
Do you get it on your cell phone , text messages , are you able to use the internet ?
Mohammad : Actually , they reduce the internet speed .
We have severe problems with the messenger software and every software like messengers .
This is arranged by making calls , messages , calls to his friends or her friends and try to gather as much to tell as he or she can .
Roberts : Mohammad , we have been talking this morning about what the students are fighting for and whether the students are fighting for something different than the older more established political candidates like Moussavi .
Are the students seeking regime change ?
Are they looking to bring down the Ayatollah and completely change the form of government there in Iran ?
Or are you looking for – as has been suggested – more civil rights , more freedoms within the context of the existing regime ?
Mohammad : Yes .
Let me tell you something .
For about three decades our nation has been humiliated and insulted by this regime .
Now Iranians are united again one more time after 1979 Revolution .
We are a peaceful nation .
We do n't hate anybody .
We want to be an active member of the international community .
We do n't want to be isolated .
Is this much of a demand for a country with more than 2,500 years of civilization ?
We do n't deny the Holocaust .
We do accept Israel 's rights .
And actually , we want - we want severe reform on this structure .
This structure is not going to be tolerated by the majority of Iranians .
We need severe reform , as much as possible .
Roberts : Interesting perspective this morning from Mohammad , a student demonstrator there in Tehran .
Mohammad : Excuse me , sir .
I have a message for the international community .
Would you please let me tell it ?
Roberts :
Yes , go ahead .
Mohammad : Americans , European Union , international community , this government is not definitely - is definitely not elected by the majority of Iranians .
So it 's illegal .
Do not recognize it .
Stop trading with them .
Impose much more sanctions against them .
My message …to the international community , especially I ’m addressing President Obama directly – how can a government that does n't recognize its people 's rights and represses them brutally and mercilessly have nuclear activities ?
This government is a huge threat to global peace .
Will a wise man give a sharp dagger to an insane person ?
We need your help international community .
Do n't leave us alone .
Chetry : Mohammad , what do you think the international community should do besides sanctions ?
Mohammad : Actually , this regime is really dependent on importing gasoline .
More than 85 % of Iran ’s gasoline is imported from foreign countries .
I think international communities must sanction exporting gasoline to Iran and that might shut down the government .

Warning :
The following 2,400 words attempt to take very complex 3D rendering problems and reduce them to simple language so that you can peer into the polygon - based sausage factory that is the videogame industry .
I ’m not sure if I pulled it off .
Yesterday I promised a writeup on “ BSP technology ” .
Except , I was using BSP the sloppy way to mean “ general level - optimizing type stuff ” , which is not really correct .
BSP is a technique of level optimization .
What I should have said is “ how BSP technology is being marginalized in favor of other optimization techniques ” .
BSP stands for “ Binary Space Partitioning ” , which is obtuse programmer talk for “ dividing space in two ” .
We love doing that because it lets us pretend our dull technical skills are a potent form of arcane magic .
It ’s the same reason we “ launch applications ” instead of just “ running programs ” like you simple folk .
The idea of BSP was first conceived in 1969 , but to my knowledge it was n’t until John Carmack authored the Doom engine in 1991 that we saw someone put the idea to commercial use .
It was the backbone of first - person games for over ten years , which is a long , long time for a technology to hang around in the fast - moving world of computer graphics .
It ’s still in use today but in a lot of places it ’s at last being phased out or evolving into systems that would n’t have made any sense to programmers in the early 90’s .
UnrealEd ( released in 1999 ) was used to make the following illustrative images .
I ’m doing this simply because it ’s quick and easy to make clear , uncluttered images with it .
First , we make a simple box room .
In the editor , you draw a box , and boom !
You ’ve got a hollow box to run around in .
Lucky you .
If this was as complicated as it got with computer games , we would n’t need any fancy technology .
But sadly , gamers like to play in spaces that are “ interesting ” .
They want details and multiple rooms and other fancy stuff that makes our job harder .
The selfish jerks .
So , we ’ll throw them a bone and put a pillar in the middle of the room .
Also , let ’s throw in a single light source , because I ’m all about the eye - candy .
Woo !
Game of the year , here we come !
Remember I said that a BSP is all about dividing space in two .
Here is our mind - blowing pillar room in BSP view .
You can actually see the order in which the cuts were made .
The first would have been the line that divided the far side of the room from the near one .
The far side was then a simple rectangle .
The near side still had the pillar in it .
Then it made the cut that divided the left from the right .
The left was then a rectangle , but the right side had the pillar in one corner .
Finally , it made the cut between the pillar and the right wall , making the last two areas rectangular .
Hey !
The room seems to have been “ cut up ” .
The seams you see are from the editor compiling the level .
The goal of the BSP is to divide and sub - divide the gameworld until it ’s made entirely of convex spaces .
It needs to cut the world into three dimensional volumes , which I ’ll be calling “ zones ” from this point on .
Above , it has cut the world into four zones .
Making them convex just means that all of the interior angles are 180 degrees or less .
Another way to think of this is to imagine the boundaries of the zone as being walls .
( Which is pretty easy when they ’re nice clean rectangles like this . )
It ’s convex if no wall blocks your ability to move to any other wall .
A circle is convex .
A boomerang shape is not .
A rectangle is convex .
An “ L ” shape is not .
A trapezoid is convex , a plus sign is not .
It does this by finding a non-convex space and cutting it in half .
It will then consider each half .
Is either half non-convex ?
Yes ?
Then cut that half in half again , and consider each half , and so on , until the level is made entirely of convex zones .
Image courtesy of Wikipedia .
Note that in step 4 , G and F and now fully convex and require no further divison .
The upshot is that when you ’re done you ’ll have these zones – groups of polygons – that you know can be drawn in any order because they can’t possibly interfere with each other .
The program will generate these lists of which zones can be seen from which other zones .
In the above image , it ’s likely that zone E will be occluded for anyone standing in zone G .
If the player is in G , everything inside of zone E can be ignored when rendering .
Walls , projectiles , characters , particle effects , everything .
The game will have this handy list for each and every zone in the level that will tell it what areas need to be drawn when the user is in that location .
This system was devised when the “ fill rate ” ( or lack of it ) was your nemesis as a programmer .
The more pixels you had to draw , the slower your program would run .
It was actually worth cutting the floor into four pieces instead of having it as one huge polygon , because then there would be a chance that we could skip drawing part of it .
But graphics technology turned a corner at some point during the early part of this decade .
Graphics cards got so fast that it was no longer worthwhile to obsess over each and every square inch of polygon fill .
If you drew a few bits of wall that ended up getting drawn over ( because they were really hidden behind another wall which was closer to the camera ) it was n’t any big deal .
The graphics card could shrug off the overdraw and keep going without breaking a sweat .
At the same time , designers were wanting to put all of that extra horsepower to use .
They were tired of levels that looked like they were made of Duplo blocks .
They wanted a few curves , some detail work , and some sloped surfaces .
Let ’s take our cheap , square pillar and replace it with a slightly less cheap 8 - sided pillar .
Well , that really sliced up the room quite a bit , did n’t it ?
Keep in mind , each of these pie-slice zones has its very own visibility list of what areas you would see if your eyes ended up in that zone .
But really , 8 - sided pillars are kind of crappy .
That ’s 1997 level graphics , there .
If you want something to look “ round ” , you ought to have at least 12 sides .
And who has a single pillar in the middle of the room ?
Let ’s have a few .
And a ramp on one side .
Well , this is kind of starting to look a bit like something not completely hideous .
Let ’s see what the BSP thinks of it …
A little photoshopping applied to emphasize the edges .
Note that the engine is picking random shades of blue for each zone , but sometimes you end up with two zones that have nearly the same color .
It looks like there is a big , non-convex zone right in the middle of the floor , but it ’s really just a case of adjacent zones being the same color .
Ahhh !
It looks like someone chucked a brick through a stained glass window .
This room is divided up into 248 zones .
( Which are actually called “ nodes ” in Unreal .
All these games use similar technology , but it ’s pretty common for each one to have unique nomenclature for similar concepts .
This is a common result of having many people working separately on similar technology .
One exception is that John Carmack came up with some needlessly confusing terms .
Instead of calling 3D primitive solids either “ primitives ” or “ solids ” he named them “ brushes ” .
Wha ?
The faces of the brushes – which I might be tempted to call a “ face ” or a “ polygon ” were named “ leaf ” , the plural of which is inexplicably “ leafs ” .
Some of this this unfortunate terminology was passed on to the various Quake titles , Doom3 , and all of the Half - Life games . )
Note that this whole visibility list business is now kind of pointless .
Sure , there might be some spot behind one of these pillars where you wo n’t be able to see some tiny slice of the level behind a pillar on the opposite side of the room , but for the most part your CPU is going to be thrashing through these huge lists of zones only to end up sending the entire room to the graphics card anyway .
The zone lists eat up a ton of memory and CPU power , and they are n’t really saving us anything .
Meanwhile , the graphics card is spending most of its time waiting .
All that vast power is going to waste .
By the time we get done adding some doors to other rooms and some details on the ceiling this room will be even worse than it is now .
A short - term solution was to make it possible to have geometry in the world which would not be considered when making a BSP .
If we tell the BSP that the pillars are basically worthless for occlusion and should not create divisions , then the result is a lot less crazy .
Note that this means the pillars cannot ever block your view of anything else for the purposes of rendering .
That is , if you mash your face against the pillar so that it fills your view , the game will still [ attempt to ] draw everything behind the pillar , despite the fact that you ca n’t actually see it .
You wo n’t actually see through the pillar , but all that stuff will end up being drawn and then painted over , which is a waste .
But big deal .
Most of the time it would end up drawing all of that anyway .
Only now the CPU is n’t going to waste everyone ’s time churning through a list of 248 stupid little zones to reach that foregone conclusion .
But as games continued to get more complex , it became increasingly common for the really detailed stuff to be made in a separate 3D program and imported into the editor .
Perhaps the room needs a cryogenic stasis tank covered in control panels and tubes and cables and display screens .
Believe me , it would be no fun trying to make that using UnrealEd or Hammer .
Those programs are specifically designed for building environments , and it would be torture to try and use them to make detail objects .
And there would be no reason to add those features to your level editor when you could buy high - quality , time - tested software to do it instead .
This is the tech level that Hammer is using .
Pretty soon it becomes clear that you ’re dealing with two types of geometry : Environment ( walls , floors , ceilings , etc ) and details .
( Furniture , windows , doors , vehicles , machines , etc. )
Environmental geometry is generally big , simple , and blocky .
Even if you ’re in a really organic looking location where the walls are made from complex shapes , the room is rounded , and the floor is uneven , the space is generally created by making old - school box rooms and then adding modular bits to the walls and floor .
Those modular bits are , as far as the engine is concerned , simply “ furniture ” .
The world is divided into rooms , and you do n’t ever want to worry about cutting up a room in case the fireplace might possibly , at some angle , obscure your view of the coffee table .
Just draw the room and everything in it , because in 99.9 % of all cases , the stuff inside of a room is not going to usefully block your view of other parts of the same room .
Unreal Tournament 2003 explicitly embraced this distinction , and was built around this idea .
The old BSP system was no longer used for occlusion , and instead they added a system of portals .
( Not to be confused with anything you see in the game Portal .
These “ portals ” are just simple 2D doors . )
Doom3 was also built around this idea .
I ’m actually curious how that happened .
Carmack was done with the core of the Doom3 engine long before UT2003 come out , so it ’s not like either team borrowed from the other .
Either both developers drew from a common source of knowledge , or they both looked at the problem and came to the same conclusions .
The idea is that you stick a portal in a doorway .
( Actually , every doorway / window / hole that might allow line of sight . )
The game makes note of that portal .
If the portal ever ends up in view , then everything on the other side of the portal is drawn .
( The next room . )
If any of that room ’s portals end up in frame ( even if they are actually behind a bit of furniture or whatever ) then that room is drawn , and so on .
This basically puts the job of optimization in the hands of the artist .
It ’s up to them to figure out where portals should go .
This greatly diminishes the number of cuts from thousands of arbitrary cuts to just a few human - selected ones .
This is actually something that ’s easy for a human to intuit , and murderously hard for a program .
Placing a portal is easy and it solves most occlusion situations .
( Although it does impose a few limits on how you design your level , which are n’t worth getting into here . )
Getting back to Hammer and its technology :
They ’ve embraced the idea of “ BSP is for level data , detail meshes are for furniture ” idea that Doom and Unreal are using , but the old - school design of Hammer means that level designers have to spend a lot of time fussing with which shapes should cut and which ones should n’t in order to avoid the “ too many cuts ” problem while still limiting overdraw .
It ’s another problem that ’s a subtle annoyance at first , and quickly grows into an unwieldy headache as the level grows to gigantic proportions .
If the tool was built with this concept in mind , the artist would just have to busy themselves placing portals ( Valve would no doubt call them something else ) and would n’t have to decide “ this shape should cut , this one should n’t ” on a per-primitive basis .
This is just a bit more non-creative gruntwork loaded onto the artist in a system that ’s already overburdened with limited tools and productivity - killing iteration friction .
To Valve artists :
My hat is off to you guys .
You ’ve got one arm tied behind your back and you ’re kicking everyone else ’s ass anyway .
I recommend Franks Gerkin McKenna to anyone .

The strategic direction of NASA is set to be announced in the first week of October , when new administrator Charlie Bolden and Human Space Flight Review panel chairman Norm Augustine conduct a NASA Executive Summit for all Senior Executive Service employees .
The news came as center and space industry directors continue to tell their staff to keep their focus during “ this period of uncertainty . ”
NASA ’s Forward Path ( Mr Coats ) :
Continued uncertainty surrounds the direction NASA will be steered over the coming years and decades , ranging from an extension to the shuttle program , to an affordable and potentially ambitious exploration plan – with the ultimate decision to be taken by the Obama administration .
With a shuttle mission currently on orbit , Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) director Mike Coats made an address to his workforce , asking them to remain focused on the near term .
Interestingly , he also gave his strong backing to a Constellation Program that is in real danger of being cancelled – which has led to an increase of lobbying in support of continuing with the Ares program recently .
“ During this period of uncertainty regarding the future of Human Space Flight , I wanted to keep you informed of what we know and what we do n’t know , ” noted Mr Coats on an internal address acquired by L2 .
“ First of all I want to congratulate the Constellation team and everyone who supported the Orion Preliminary Design Review ( PDR ) .
I can fully appreciate the tremendous amount of hard work that goes into achieving a major milestone like the PDR , and I extend my thanks to all of you involved in making it so successful .
“ Like any program at this stage there are a handful of technical issues yet to be resolved , but none are serious and it is obvious the entire Constellation Team is working extremely well together .
I am looking forward to the ( second attempt of the ) DM - 1 motor firing in Utah , the Ares I - X launch next month at KSC , and the first Pad Abort test early next year .
The progress across the board on the Constellation Program is impressive . ”
Interesting , Mr Coats followed his comments about being “ impressed ” with the Constellation program , by noting he is “ quite proud ” of the program that is successfully launching humans and hardware into space right now , by noting his backing for the recent slips to the last few launch dates in order to ensure safe flight .
“ I ’m also quite proud of the effort that went into launching our two Shuttle missions this summer .
Bill Gerstenmaier / Associate Administrator , Space Operations Mission Directorate , and John Shannon / Shuttle Program Manager , emphasize repeatedly that we will launch our missions only when it ’s safe to do so .
“ That ’s exactly the right attitude , and I ’m confident we will fly out the remainder of the Shuttle manifest safely and complete assembly of the International Space Station ( ISS ) . ”
After praising the achievements of the ongoing STS - 128 mission , Mr Coats then moved on to the subject of the Augustine Review , outlining the well - know options of extending shuttle and the ISS , but also noted what appears to be a key date for the Agency in October – before stressing the workforce needs to continue to be focused on the current plan , until they are told different .

“ All of us have been waiting for the results of the Review by the Human Space Flight Plans Committee , otherwise known as the Augustine Panel .
The Panel has begun to provide preliminary briefings to summarize their findings , but a final written report will probably not be published until later this month , ” added Mr Coats ’ address .
“ NASA senior management is studying the Augustine Panel briefings and is meeting several days a week to develop a NASA recommended strategy to present to the Administration .
NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden and Panel Chairman Norm Augustine are currently scheduled to testify to Congress on September 15 and 16 , although that may slip until the Augustine report is published .
“ Mr. Bolden has scheduled a NASA Executive Summit for all Senior Executive Service employees in Washington on Oct 6 and 7 to discuss strategic direction for the Agency .
We will keep you informed of events as they unfold .
“ NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden has stated clearly that we should proceed with our current program , which has been authorized and funded by Congress , until and unless the Administration and Congress direct otherwise .
“ Our most powerful message to the American public is continued mission success in our profession of space exploration .
Keep up the terrific work ! ”
MSFC ’s Forward Path ( Mr Lightfoot ) :
Newly appointed Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) director Robert Lightfoot made his first All Hands address to his workforce last week , saying they will deal with any changes to the forward path “ as a team ” .
Marshall has the most to lose if the Ares program is cancelled , especially if the favored option results in a commercial launch vehicle , such as an EELV ( Atlas V - Heavy , Delta IV - Heavy ) .
“ We ’ve got the skills , the tools and the capabilities , and if you do n’t have those , you do n’t have a mission , ” noted Mr Lightfoot in the Marshall Star .
“ There ’s a lot to be done .
No matter how it comes out , this team is going to be involved . ”
Although previous MSFC comments relating to the Augustine Review have stated that the Marshall Center will be involved in any plans to launch humans into space , Mr Lightfoot told his workforce that they will soon know what the future will hold for the center , and to continue to focus on developing Ares .
“ Just keep doing what you ’re doing , ” he added .
“ We ’ll have an answer soon , and we ’ll deal with it as a team .
As Marshall . ”
United Space Alliance ’s Forward Path ( Mr Covey ) :
USA head Dick Covey – one of the key supporters for extending the shuttle program beyond 2010 – also sent out an address to his workforce in relation to the upcoming delivery of the Augustine Review findings .
Mr Covey is in charge of a workforce that will suffer the brunt of the job losses , based on the current plan to retire shuttle and then endure a six year – or more – gap to the first operational flight of Ares I and Orion .
“ For the past few months , the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Committee , led by Chairman Norm Augustine , has been conducting a thorough assessment of numerous options for the future of our Nation ’s space program . ” noted Mr Covey in an address acquired by L2 .
“ This review has been enlightening and educational as presenters from industry , academia and the general public have openly discussed a wide variety of options for our Nation ’s future human space flight program .
Since we anticipate extensive media coverage surrounding the committee ’s final report , I think it is important to discuss what the committee ’s work will mean to United Space Alliance . ”
As expected , Mr Covey focused on the extension of the shuttle to 2011 , which would be based on a manifest stretch of the remaining flights on the current schedule .
Plans to extend past that point are available for an additional year of operations – to 2012 , and the more costly 2015 option .
“ The committee was chartered to ‘ identify and characterize a range of options that spans the possibilities for continuation of U.S. human space flight activities beyond retirement of the Space Shuttle . ’
We know from the committee ’s public discussions that there is consensus among committee members that the Shuttle should , at an ‘ absolute minimum ’ fly out the current manifest even if it means flying into FY 2011 .
“ There is also agreement that the ISS should be extended to 2020 if the budget can accommodate this extension .
The committee has expressed concerns about the budget and schedule for the Ares I and Orion programs , and considered alternative approaches as well as alternative budget profiles . ”
Mr Covey also stressed the Augustine Commission are only presenting options , and no decisions or changing of course would occur until the Obama administration makes the decision on NASA ’s forward path .
“ As stated in its charter , the committee ’s report will present options – not recommendations – and the national debate will continue – not end – with the completion of the panel ’s work .
“ A wide variety of options are being considered , and multiple factors , the most significant of which will be the NASA budget , will be debated and taken into consideration as the President outlines his vision for human space flight .
We can anticipate that the debate in Washington , D.C. , and in the news media will continue until a decision is made . ”
The references to the media are likely based on ensuring his workforce keep focused on the missions , rather than the unavoidable play - by - play on the fate of both the shuttle program – and the program that will succeed it – in the media .
To which ends , Mr Covey also stressed his workforce needs to concentrate on what they are doing right now , even though his address ironically was sent out whilst most of his workforce were doing just that .
“ At USA , we will continue to support and engage in the evaluation of the various options .
As this process moves forward , we will continue to provide information and context to you .
Regardless of how the issues are resolved , our primary goal must continue to be flying each and every mission as safely and successfully as possible .
“ We can not allow ourselves to become distracted or lose our focus on the job immediately ahead of us .
We must increase our efforts to make safety the top priority and never hesitate to call a ‘ time - out ’ when needed .
Our contribution to the future of human space , now and in the future , will be to remain committed to excellence in all that we do . ”
SD HLLV :
With the Constellation Program continuing their development of the Ares and Orion vehicles , the options relating to a change of path for NASA are also refining their plans .
An impressive EELV - based exploration architecture is understood to be making huge strides behind the scenes , in preparation for being one of the frontrunners in the conclusions of the Augustine Review report .
While the SD - HLLV ( Shuttle Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle – or HLV for short ) is still being worked on within the Space Shuttle Program ( SSP ) .
The latest updates point to a focus on the Lunar Reference Mission via the utilization of the HLV , while costings are refined through their preparations for being the Augustine Panel ’s option of choice .
“ Preliminary data is showing that with an LOR approach and two HLV launches , we can get a 33 - 34 metric ton lander , ” added the latest notes from the Shuttle Standup / Integration reports on L2 .
“ The team reviewed the re-costing analysis for the HLV .
It is pretty much the same was what they had provided early .
Continue to make progress . ”
In fact , all of the recent notes that have referenced the HLV work have been positive , with the architecture soon to be reviewed by NASA managers as high as NASA Associate Administrator for Space Operations , Mr Bill Gerstenmaier .
“ Pulled together a brief overview for John Shannon , and ready to brief him on a Lunar Reference Mission , ” added a note on the Standup at the end of last week .
“ Hope to take the Lunar Reference Mission brief to Bill Gerstenmaier soon .
“ Have consummated a plan for the avionics and flight software , similar to the Shuttle .
It makes maximum use of the Shuttle capability and hardware .
It supports a human rating requirement , if needed . ”
This vehicle – along with the Direct heavy - lifters known as the Jupiter family – have already been classed as the most favorable options to work alongside an extension of the shuttle program by the Augustine Review panel .
However , all of the recent work on “ extension ” has focused solely on continuing operations to 2011 .
Shuttle Extension :
The latest studies have been conducted from a departmental standpoint , showing costings and issues with extensions of six months and 12 months on top of the current manifested end date for the shuttle near the end of 2010 .
Interestingly , several presentations – acquired by L2 – work on the basis of a set list of assumptions , which request a focus on the potential impacts to the Constellation Program .
“ Assessed 6 month and 12 month Shuttle extension options .
Evenly spaced flights .
Retention of current Constellation budget !
No schedule relief of Constellation milestones .
Flex utilization of workforce to support both programs – critical skill protected by the integrated team ! , ” opened the “ key assumptions ” note on one departmental presentation .
That presentation continues by pointing out that extending shuttle , based on the current roadmap for Constellation , holds several major risks that need to be addressed via assurances a small extension to shuttle would be fully funded , as opposed to hand outs and job sharing with the Constellation Program – which the presentation notes will be where the priority funding is currently targeted for from 2011 .
“ Greater demand for skill sharing .
SSP highest priority today – beyond SSP mission prep & OPS , Cx will be priority in 2011 .
Tougher trade in meeting Cx milestones with Shuttle requirements .
Reduced capacity responding to Shuttle anomalies / issues .
Increased need to track and assess vehicle anomalies ( prelaunch ) , ” noted “ risks ” on one of the presentations .
“ Budget covers only modest issue tracking .
Vehicle aging and processing attention - to - detail may impact systems health .
Workforce morale may degrade vehicle preparation integrity .
Critical skills attrition : Potential for most experienced / senior people to transition to leadership roles with Cx. Economy improves and return to around 15 percent attrition .
“ No resource margin in FY11 – large management challenge .
Must have FY11 Cx budget to protect critical skill levels !!! ”
These concerns appear to be the mirrored in all recent extension documentation , which note the capacity is there to extend the shuttle manifest , but only with the required workforce and funding support – due to the shoftfall that has already been noted for the Constellation Program based on the current budget projections .
More will follow on NASA ’s options via the Augustine Review in the coming week .

French 007 tells of great escape from Dubai wearing a wetsuit under a burka
A former spy convicted of fraud in the United Arab Emirates has told how he made a bid for freedom by donning a wetsuit disguised under a burka before diving into the ocean .
Frenchman Herve Jaugbert , an ex-naval officer , alleges the Dubai secret police had threatened to insert needles up his nose and that he was about to be thrown in jail for a crime he did n't commit .
Disguise : Former spy Herve Jaubert donned a wetsuit under a burka in order to escape from Dubai .
Read more on Jaubert 's website : www.escapefromdubai.com
The 53 - year - old explained how on the night of his escape last summer he stepped into a full - length diving suit , complete with breathing equipment , before adding padding to cover the shape of the kit .
Jaubert , who designs and builds leisure submarines , then disguised himself in a burka and walked down to the water 's edge .
From there , he swam underwater to the nearby coastguard station , on a remote outpost , where he cut the fuel lines on a police patrol boat .
He knew it was the only one in the area , and the coast would now be clear .
He then swam back to the beach , got into a Zodiac dinghy and headed back out to sea .
Six hours later he was 25 miles off - shore and outside Dubai 's territorial waters .
Another former French agent met him in a yacht , he claims .
Kitted up : Jaubert had breathing equipment with him so he could swim underwater to a police patrol boat and disable its engines
The pair then sailed to Mumbai , India , which took a week .
Jaugbert told the French consul that he had lost his passport and was given a new one .
Jaubert had been working as a contractor for ship - builder Dubai World in 2007 when he was called in for questioning by police , he told The Sunday Times .
An executive at the firm had reported finding bullets in Jaugbert 's office and police thought he was a mercenary or hitman .
At the same time , the company accused Jaubert of billing for goods that did not arrive .
According to Jaubert , his employers had run out of money and wanted to find a way of sacking him without paying benefits that would have been due under a five - year contract .
Covered up : Jaugbert used padding under the burka to disguise the shape of his breathing equipment
' The police had interrogated me for hours and threatened me with torture , ' he said from his home in Florida , where he now lives with his wife and two children .
' I lived with a ball of fear in my stomach . '
He said that if he had n't left , he'd be ' stuck in the same nightmare as the others ' , referring to the dozens of expatriate businessmen who are languishing in Dubai jails for alleged ' economic crimes ' .
As the economic slump deepens , foreigners are being jailed for misdeeds not generally considered as crimes , such as the bouncing of a cheque .
To the Emirati authorities , however , Jaugbert - who is writing a book about his experiences - is a liar and convicted fraudster .
He was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison after his escape in the dinghy .
A spokesman for Dubai World said Jaubert had been dismissed because 'he was found stealing from the company ' , adding that his five - year sentence was ' entirely appropriate ' .
Out to sea : Jaugbert travelled 25 miles in a rubber dinghy to escape from the Dubai police who he alleges threatened him with torture .
A friend picked him up in his yacht and they sailed on to Mumbai

The search for an HIV vaccine has proved frustrating A review of a trial of an HIV vaccine in Thailand has concluded that it does show real signs of a protective effect .
Scientists announced last month that a combination of vaccines gave a 31 % level of protection in trials among 16,000 heterosexuals aged 18 - 30 .
Doubts had been raised about whether the finding was significant .
But new data published at a conference in Paris indicates that , while small scale , the findings are robust and statistically significant .
We now , after 26 years of trying , believe that we can go down that road with confidence that we will be able to develop a vaccine that is globally effective
Col Nelson Michael
US military HIV research programme
However , the scientists say they do not understand what is causing the effect , and it seems to offer less protection to those most at risk .
Despite these drawbacks , Col Nelson Michael from the US military HIV research programme said it was still a small step in the right direction .
He said : " It 's important that people understand that this is a scientific advance , a scientific breakthrough .
" It is not a public health breakthrough ; there is not a vaccine that is around the corner .
" We now , after 26 years of trying , believe that we can go down that road with confidence that we will be able to develop a vaccine that is globally effective . "
Doubts raised Despite their initial joy when the first results from the Thai trial were announced , many scientists were concerned that the protective effect was very small .
Among the 8,000 or so who received the vaccine , 51 became infected with the virus .
Among those who had a placebo , 74 got the infection .
However , the trial 's sponsors , the US military and the Thai government , said the 31.2 % protective effect was statistically significant and real .
As more data slowly emerged some scientists began to have doubts about how robust this effect really was .
When those who had not taken all their vaccines were excluded from the trial the numbers lost their statistical power .
Many experts were concerned that the data had not been subject to a rigorous examination by other scientists .
Many questions
Now that review has taken place .
And it indicates that the original findings still stand - but there are more questions than answers .
These results are an incredible opportunity for scientists to discover new clues about HIV and learn how an HIV vaccine could work in practice
Deborah Jack
National Aids Trust
The scientists based their conclusions on an analysis of the entire population in the study , excluding just seven people who were found to be infected on the first day of the trial .
The researchers say this is the most robust way of looking at the study .
They also published details of two other analyses of the trial , which excluded people who had not taken all their medication .
Both of these showed effects that were not statistically significant .
Among the scientists at this meeting there was a real sense of excitement about the findings .
Dr Nicola Frahm , associate laboratory director for the HIV Vaccines trials network in Seattle , Washington , said : " There is hope .
There is a vaccine that prevented acquisition , the signal is very weak but this is the first time to show any effect on acquisition at all , so for the HIV community it 's an amazing day .
" The real question is to how biologically significant is this ?
" The significance that has been established in this trial is that there is a 5 % chance that this is a fluke .
" So we are 95 % certain that what we are seeing is real and not down to pure chance .
And that 's great . "
No use in Africa
The researchers point out that this vaccine would not work in Africa where the rates of HIV infection are the highest .
They say that a commercial product is still many years away and caution that prevention and education are the best protection against the infection in the medium term .
Col Jerome Kim is HIV vaccines product manager for the US Army .
He said : " We had something that protected a third of the people exposed to the virus in Thailand .
" It is not a globally effective vaccine ; it can not be used outside of Thailand .
" Until we answer those other scientific questions the idea of using this vaccine in other parts of the world or testing it , is science rather than public health . "
Deborah Jack , chief executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " The Thai trial is a milestone in the search for a vaccine against HIV .
" These results are an incredible opportunity for scientists to discover new clues about HIV and learn how a HIV vaccine could work in practice . "

The Internet has taken a lot of the paperwork out of banking , but there is no avoiding paper when someone gives you a check .
Now one bank wants to let customers deposit checks immediately  through their phones .
USAA , a privately held bank and insurance company , plans to update its iPhone application this week to introduce the check deposit feature , which requires a customer to photograph both sides of the check with the phone ’s camera .
“ We ’re essentially taking an image of the check , and once you hit the send button , that image is going into our deposit - taking system as any other check would , ” said Wayne Peacock , a USAA executive vice president .
Customers will not have to mail the check to the bank later ; the deposit will be handled entirely electronically , and the bank suggests voiding the check and filing or discarding it .
But to reduce the potential for fraud , only customers who are eligible for credit and have some type of insurance through USAA will be permitted to use the deposit feature .
Mr. Peacock said that about 60 percent of the bank ’s customers qualify .

" The future will be a total disaster , with a collapse of our capitalistic system as we know it today , wars , massive government debt defaults and the impoverishment of large segments of Western society , " Marc Faber writes in the September issue of The Gloom , Boom & Doom Report .
A statement like that pretty much speaks for itself , but it 's a bit more complicated than appears on first blush .
Faber has been bullish -- especially on commodities and emerging market stocks -- for some time now and believes the current global recovery trade will last another two - to - three years , as discussed in more detail in a forthcoming clip .
But he has major long - term concerns about the dollar 's long - term viability given rising U.S. deficits , massive unfunded mandates and the fact " we have a money - printer at the Fed . "
This combination will eventually lead to runaway inflation , wholesale debasement of the dollar , and a major lowering of living standards for most Americans and many Europeans as well , says Faber , who is " highly confident " in this grim prediction .

We caught up with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings at the movie rental company ’s event where it awarded a $ 1 million prize after a contest aimed at improving the accuracy of movie recommendations .
He spoke about his hopes of working with Apple on the iPhone , the possibility that YouTube will beef up its movie service , and the future of the DVD .
Reuters :
What will Netflix subscribers gain from the improvements in the recommendation system ?
Hastings :
It ’s doubling the quality of our movie recommendation and that helps our subscribers get more enjoyment from movies .
Because more often they love the movie they watch .
More often the movies recommended will will turn out to be movies that you love .
If you watch a couple of movies and do n’t like many , you start to watch ( sports and other programming ) .
If every movie is incredible , you start to watch more .
Reuters : Netflix video streams on Microsoft ’s Xbox Live system .
What about the PS3 and Wii ?
Hastings : Eventually we want to be on all the game consoles , all the Blu-ray players , all the Internet TVs .
So we are working in parallel with all of those efforts .
Currently our Xbox deal is exclusive and we have n’t characterized it more than that .
Reuters :
Any plans to work in partnership with Apple and the iPhone ?
Hastings : it ’s something that ’s likely to come over time .
But nothing in the short term .
( With ) movie watching , we are not focused on mobile yet , but ( instead ) on the TV , on Blu-ray and on the video game consoles .
We will get to mobile eventually , including the iPhone .
Reuters :
What of Youtube ’s potential movie service ?
Hastings : I think there will be a lot of competition in this market : Hulu , Apple , Amazon , Youtube , Blockbuster .
Internet video is a huge opportunity .
And there will be a lot of people engaged , and that is going to be great for the consumer .
All of us are going to innovate and compete with each other and provide more and more value to the consumer .
Reuters :
How far along are we on the transition to all digital video watching ?
Hastings :
There will be people doing DVD - by - mail in 15 or 20 years , so I think DVD will last a long time .
Our best guess is that DVD will peak for us in 5 or so years .
But it is continuing to grow .
And the streaming is exploding .
So we are getting nice growth in the DVD side and huge growth on the streaming side .
Reuters :
What do you make of Blockbuster ’s store closing plan ?
Hastings : Blockbuster and Redbox really compete on doing the inexpensive new releases , and we are much more the streaming and the catalog .
Their closings do n’t really benefit us .
It will benefit Redbox more than it does us .
Reuters :
Have you been approached about an acquisition or partnership ?
Hastings :
We do n’t comment and any acquisition prospects .

East German , Polish and Soviet CPUs and Support Chips
First off , this page is not to be seen as a complete listing of Soviet and Soviet influenced chip designs .
It does contain the most notable CPUs made ( or cloned ) in Soviet and WARSAW Pact countries .
While the boom of the CPU really hit the US in 1970 it wasnt until the 1980s that the Soviets could get things going .
They lagged American technology by 10 - 12 years by the best estimates .
For example , the Bulgarian cloan of the Apple II was popular introduces in the early 1990s .
Most of the Eastern chips are clones of Western designs .
Often reprints of the original die mask , or simply ( easier said then done ) reverse engineered .
THis is not to say that the Soviets did not do any of their own design .
There are several chips which have no western equivalents .
The 1804 is a PDP - 11 on a chip , which is really a pretty neat chip .
Soviet Packaging , possibly some of the best looking packages around .
The Soviets used a lot of gold ( they have huge reserves of it so it is no wonder ) and white ceramic in their packages .
They used such materials all the way through the 1980s .
This makes collecting Soviet chips even more exciting .
The process technology is also much larger ( 6 Micron +) on most of these chips so you can easily see the die features .

Soviet Factories :
In the past and to large degree at present , scientific projects and industrial enterprises depend on manufacturers of simple microprocessors located in the republics of the former USSR namely Russia , Belorussia and Lithuania .
These components do not correspond to the up to date level .
Many more even do not correspond to the current level of microprocessor components produced by Ukraine enterprises .
Among the main enterprises in Ukraine are " Kvazar " in Kyiv , " Gamma " in Zaporizja and " Rodon " in Ivano - Frankivsk , " Kvantor " in Kiev .
As well as the " Elektropribor " - Central Scientific and Research Institute ( CSRI ) in St. Petersburg .

The crisis the world went through is just an appetizer for a future one because the weaknesses that created it have not been addressed , Marc Faber , author and publisher of the Gloom , Doom and Boom Report , told CNBC Friday .
" It 's a total and complete disaster and the crisis we had is just the appetizer to the big total breakdown of financial markets and of governments in five or 10 years time when the whole system goes bust , " Faber told " Worldwide Exchange . "
The G20 meeting is not likely to find a solution that would prevent a future meltdown , as the people who are supposed to implement the new measures are the same people who were unable to foresee this crisis , he said .
The issues of excessive leverage and the " uncontrolled , unbound credit growth , " as well as the bulging deficits and interest rates at zero are not being addressed , he added .
[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
When we lie , our brains work hard to make sure we get the story right and come off as truthful .
Law enforcement officials try to tap into that effort , for example with polygraphs , to find out if a suspect is telling the truth .
But such stress tests are beatable and not admissible in court .
Now comes a report that handwriting tests could be a competitor to the familiar , but unreliable lie detector .
The study appears in the Journal of Applied Cognitive Psychology .
Researchers at Israel ’s Haifa University worked with 34 volunteers , who wrote truthful and false paragraphs on paper using a wireless electronic pen and a pressure sensitive tip .
A computerized system measured pressure and stroke duration , both on the paper and in the air .
Spatial measures , such as stroke length , height and width were also tracked .
And the scientists found significant differences in pressure and spatial measures in deceptive statements compared with the truth .
The investigators say they need to validate this initial result and compare the technique with polygraphs and other lie detection tools .
But perhaps in the future even a written claim of innocence could turn out to be a de facto confession .

“ We all understand our politicians have a job to do and that this job is not easy at times .
However , this can be said for most of the working population , and most of the working population has to exist on far less in terms of wages and expenses .
In corporate life and military life , it seems that our expenses systems are far more rigorous and stringent than those of our serving MPs .
As a young Libertarian attending Auburn University in the late 80’s and early 90’s , I came up with a new theory which I called The Kindergarten Theory of Government .
Memories from my kindergarten class at Forestdale Baptist Church led to the name of this theory .
When in kindergarten , my friend Michael B. and I were pretty good architects .
Using the building blocks in our kindergarten classroom we routinely built buildings much taller than we were .
From time to time when we built a very tall building , there was another kid , an idiot , who would pick up a large block , run towards our building , and hit our building with the large block , causing our building to crash down .
Being young and gullible , we would look to the teacher expecting her to right the wrong , to punish the idiot kid who knocked down our building .
Guess what the teacher did on more occasions than not ?
She made everyone in the entire classroom stop all their play activities because of the actions of one bad kid .
The Kindergarten Theory of Government is one of the main operating theories that the United States government uses as a principle for day - to - day operation .
It 's fundamental characteristic is this :
It punishes the responsible citizens , the majority , for the actions of the irresponsible citizens , the minority .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
Let 's look at some concrete examples .
A small minority of criminals use guns to commit crimes .
It follows that these individuals should be punished .
Yet every time we have shooting , you have legions of politicians calling for bans on all private firearms .
Why ?
This makes no sense .
There are millions , possibly billions of firearms in the hands of private U.S. citizens .
If this posed such a great danger , the United States would look like Europe during World War 2 .
I trust my fellow citizens with guns far more than I will ever trust my government with guns .
Let 's look at another example of this theory in practice : Social Security .
Unless a person has a mental defect , they have to realize that if they do not die , they will reach a point in which the deterioration of their body will not allow them to do productive work .
As such , it is prudent to start saving money for when the period of productive work is over .
However , one day a few politicians come along and say something like this : " We believe you are all ignorant sheep who will not save for your future .
As such we are going to use the coercive power of the government to force you to save as you are too dumb to do it for your self . "
So the majority of the responsible citizens who would save money for old age are forced into a savings plan that is a loser financially simply because the minority of the irresponsible citizens will not save .
COMMENT : Even if the social security money were really there , the poor return makes it a BIG LOSER in pure financial terms .
One could get a better return by putting their money in a low - risk mutual fund .
Weapons of Mass Instru ... Gatto , John Taylor Best Price : $ 5.58 Buy New $ 16.95 ( as of 03:50 EST - Details )
( I want to say for clarity that I do think social security money is O.K. to give to people with severe mental or physical handicaps , severe mental or physical defects , people with advanced senile dementia , orphans , etc .
I do n't think these people are entitled to this money by " right , " I just think it is just the decent , humane , and practical thing to do . )
Drug - taking behavior is another area where the majority of good people are punished for the actions of the bad .
Let me explain .
I conservatively estimate that for every one whacked - out drug abuser / mis - user you see on the t.v. shows such as Cops , there are 5 individuals working in cubicles in office buildings who take drugs like amphetamines , narcotic analgesics , and benzodiazepine tranquilizers , purchased on the street , on a daily or near daily basis , to help them get through life and meet their responsibilities .
If these type users work jobs and take care of their families , why should they be arrested and treated in the same way as whacked - out drug users you see on Cops ?
Again , the responsible majority is punished for the acts of the irresponsible minority .
How about the most egregious example of all : NOT DEFINING WHEN ADULTHOOD BEGINS !
This is the absolute worst punishment that can be put on a young person , and it's done to the good youths ( the majority ) for the actions of the bad youths ( the minority ) .
In the United States , at age 18 , you can be convicted of murder and executed .
However at age 18 , you cannot walk into a bar and buy a beer ( But you can vote for president !
Ha !
Ha !
How much did you know at 18 ? )
You have to be 21 for beer but only 18 for executing !
Unless , you ’re in the military , in which you can drink or buy alcohol if you ’re under age 21 , but only while on base
Think of that .
A young man or woman has volunteered to serve their country , to die if necessary , but they cannot walk into a bar in Las Vegas and drink alcohol
Then there is tobacco : you have to be 19 to buy that .
I think the legal definition of adulthood should be age 19 .
Why 19 ?
Because by the time most people get to age 19 they have graduated high school and at least had a very small taste of the real world .
SO WHY DOES THE KINDERGARTEN THEORY OF GOVERNMENT CONTINUE TO BE IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME ?
MORE TO THE POINT , WHY DON'T THE PEOPLE JUST BUCK THIS SYSTEM OF KINDERGARTEN TECHNIQUES OF GOVERNMENT ?
Four words : Government - Mandated Public Education .
Translation : A lot , a lot of people in our United States do n't know how to think due to the " education " they receive in public schools .
They cannot see that their " government " is really a kindergarten class .
You will NEVER , EVER , have a society of independent , self - reliant people as long as government - mandated public education exists .
Government - run public schools do not teach students how to think .
They teach students how to conform and fit in with the group .
Thanks to John Dewey and his ilk , the public schools were hijacked from institutions of education and made into institutions of socialization .
Dumbing Us Down : The H... Gatto , John Taylor Best Price : $ 1.48 Buy New $ 15.59 ( as of 03:50 EST - Details )
In order to end the kindergarten technique of government , schools , home and private for now , and with a strong push for change , public schools in the future , should do the following :
Teach mathematical and logical reasoning .
Teach the children how to think .
It 's very difficult to pull the wool over the eyes of a society of people trained in mathematics and logic .
Teach real economics , such as the Austrian School of Economics .
Explain the dangers of fiat money and private central banks like the Federal Reserve .
Teach history , including the ancient western classics of history and have the students learn the fundamental principles that the history teaches instead of having them regurgitate names and dates .
Encourage technical creativity in the pure and applied sciences , engineering , and technical vocations .
Teach about the United States form of government , a constitutional republic , not a democracy .
Focus on the Bill of Rights , especially the first , second , ninth , and tenth amendments .
Focus on the fact that the federal government serves the states , and that the states DO NOT serve the federal government .
Teach entrepreneurship .
Teach self - reliance and set it as the highest virtue .

The Best of Kevin Swindle
" [ F ] or Republicans to say that you should trust us on Medicare is like Colonel Sanders guarding the chicken coop ... "
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen ( D - MD ) told The Washington Post 's Ezra Klein in an interview earlier this week .
" I do n't think people will buy it , since the guys peddling this stuff are the very people who have been trying to undermine and weaken Medicare for years and years . "
Whether Democratic reforms would indeed " cut " Medicare is a tricky question : according to sources with knowledge of Senate Finance Committee negotiations , the plan is to cut $ 500 billion over the next ten years , but Democrats have said they wo n't cut any benefits -- rather , they 'd eliminate overpayments in Medicare Advantage subsidies and limit the growth of Medicare payment rates .
The AARP says nothing it has seen ( which may or may not include Finance Committee plans that are n't yet public ) would cut Medicare benefits ; Republicans suggest that , as some payments to hospitals and doctors increase less , fewer services will be rendered .
On Monday , the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee launched radio ads against three House Democrats criticizing , among other things , Democratic reforms ' purported impact on Medicare .
" And how do they pay for the Pelosi health plan ?
By cutting Medicare .
Cutting Medicare by $ 500 billion according to President Obama 's own projections .
That 's right : the Democratic health care plan will be paid for on the backs of America 's senior citizens , " the narrator says .
Hear audio here .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee responded by noting that , along with the other Republicans , NRCC Chairman Pete Sessions voted on April 2 for the budget plan that included remaking Medicare into a private - insurance voucher system .
DCCC spokesman Ryan Rudominer emails this comment in response to the NRCC ads :
Representative Pete Sessions 's vote to " end Medicare as it's presently known " just five months ago proves that Republicans ' desperate attempt to portray their party as defenders of Medicare is nothing short of laughable hypocrisy and another shameless effort to exploit the fears of America 's seniors .
Does Representative Sessions agree with National Republicans ' phony arguments on Medicare , a government program they 've tried to dismantle since its inception , or does Sessions stand by his own recent vote to end it ?
The American people deserve to know the truth .
Republicans have continued to hammer those $ 500 billion in spending cuts over the next decade , alleging they will curtail Medicare benefits .
Democrats not only dispute that fact -- a matter probably more complex than it 's being presented by either side -- but to them , the GOP 's pro-Medicare campaign sounds a lot like hypocrisy .

Looks like an “ I told you so ” is in order .
When I looked at Typhoon Lupit before midnight EDT on October 22 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center had indicated that dry air had gotten into the circulation and so they downgraded Lupit to a Tropical Storm .
The forecast still called for the storm to linger just north of Luzon , Philippines for a few days until a trof developed in a weakness in the ridge to the north and then it would pick up the storm and take it north .
I had noted last night that I had observed on the Total Precipitable Water loop that it appeared that Lupit had already begun moving north , though it was so few frames worth , I could not be certain that it was n’t just a wobble .
Well , it was n’t just a wobble .
It has indeed been drifting north and now north - northeast , or away from the Philippines .
The trof will continue to pick up the storm and it will slowly increase forward speed to the north - northeast and then northeast .
So much so that I doubt this guy ends up being any problems for anything beside shipping interest .
The storm simply took too much time to get to the Philippines .
It stuck around long enough for the steering environment to change and now it would appear that the Philippines , and everyone else is in good shape .
Or , you may say that prayers were answered .
Either way , it seems very unlikely that Lupit will be adversely affecting any major land masses , though coastal regions of Japan will probably monitor the storm closely until it has moved sufficiently north to northeast to eliminate any landfall potential there .
It started off as a joke , then it became a cult blog and , just a year later , it 's a bestselling book . . .
The amazing rise of Stuff White People Like
We all have a fantasy of something incredible happening to us by accident .
It 's impossible not to be captivated by the story of Lana Turner , sitting on a stool at a drugstore one moment , acting in Hollywood movies the next .
Well , you could say that I am Lana Turner . . . of the internet ( the latter tag is important for clarifying any misconceptions about my physical attractiveness ) .
I am the author of the accidental New York Times bestseller and popular blog Stuff White People Like , and this is my story .
On 18 January 2008 , my friend Myles and I were having an instant messenger conversation about The Wire .
Myles , who is Filipino , said he did n't trust any white person who did n't watch the show .
I agreed with him , so we started talking about what white people might be doing instead of watching The Wire .
Going to therapy , watching plays , doing yoga and getting divorced were the first things that popped into our heads .
For some reason , the idea that a white person was too busy getting divorced to watch television was particularly hilarious to me , so I started a blog about it .
Originally , my plan was to take this instant messenger conversation and turn it into something that would make Myles and two other friends laugh .
There was no expectation that it was going to be anything bigger – I was n't even sure it would make them laugh .
I just went to Wordpress.com , gave it the title " Stuff White People Like " , and started writing .
The first few entries were short and almost completely directed at people Myles and I knew from our high school .
The first entry , on coffee , was about the male students who would proudly attach a refillable mug to their backpacks as a gesture of their maturity .
Man , we hated those guys .
But the more I started writing , the more I realised that I was n't writing about other people , I was writing about myself .
And I was full of far more self - loathing than I had expected .
Within a week the site was up to 25 entries .
I thought it was entertaining enough to send to my ( 20 ) friends as a mass email , asking them to read it .
But then an amazing thing happened .
The readership started growing .
It 's not hard to get your friends to forward on your web project , largely out of guilt or obligation .
But when their friends , the ones who do n't know you , start forwarding it to their friends , you have something special .
I watched as the site traffic grew from a few hundred hits a day ( mostly misguided searches for organic fair trade coffee ) to more than a thousand .
Then , somehow , it wound up on the blog for Good Magazine ( published by Al Gore 's son ) and Comedy Central 's Insider ( the official blog for the US cable channel ) .
Traffic jumped to 30,000 hits a day .
From there it spread exponentially ; soon it was crossing a 100,000 , then 300,000 and 400,000 .
Every day I would just stare at my computer and say , " It ca n't get any bigger than this . "
I began receiving emails from literary agents in New York City and Los Angeles .
They wanted to turn the site into a book .
I was floored .
I knew that people spent their entire lives trying to get the attention of a literary agent , yet they were coming to me to turn my silly little blog into a book .
By early March – less than two months after the blog started – I had chosen an agent .
By the end of the month , I had a book deal in place .
On 31 March , I quit my job .
Over the next year , the book would go on to be a New York Times bestseller , while I appeared on Conan O'Brien 's talkshow and gave lectures at Google , Harvard , Brown – and now the London School of Economics .
So in case it 's something you 'd like to happen to you too , here are a few thoughts on the matter :
• Be lucky I can't stress this enough .
I would say it is responsible for approximately 41 % of my success .
• Be true to yourself
When you try to create something that you think will please everyone , it ends up pleasing no one .
People can see through attempts to do something with the sole intention of getting famous .
When you start your blog , do something that entertains you – and live with the expectation that your only reward will be writing the blog .
• Be Canadian People seem to like us .
• Be perceived as racist by idiots
This will lead to more traffic than you could ever imagine .
I would , however , strongly recommend not being perceived as racist by smart people .
That will end poorly .
• Have an email address on your site
This is how every agent and media outlet reached me .
It is also how every piece of hate mail reached me .
For the majority of blogs , the ratio will likely be one agent email for every 200 pieces of hate mail .
Successful blogs can expect that ratio to be 1:400 .
Super successful blogs can expect some of the hate mail to come from agents .
• Be nice to everyone
It may surprise you that being famous on the internet does not last for ever .
Apparently , people have short attention spans nowadays .
However , one thing that people will remember is if someone marginally famous was a jerk to them .
I still remember and hate the baseball player who refused to sign an autograph for me when I was 15 .
Also , it will be less humiliating to ask them for help in finding a job once your internet fame is over .

There is a dead well - dressed man in a meadow clearing in the hills above a small Vermont town .
Captain Albert Wiles , who stumbles across the body and finds by the man 's identification that his name is Harry Worp , believes he accidentally shot Harry dead while he was hunting rabbits .
Captain Wiles wants to hide the body as he feels it is an easier way to deal with the situation than tell the authorities .
While Captain Wiles is in the adjacent forest , he sees other people stumble across Harry , most of whom do n't seem to know him or care or notice that he 's dead .
One person who does see Captain Wiles there is spinster Ivy Gravely , who vows to keep the Captain 's secret about Harry .
Captain Wiles also secretly sees a young single mother , Jennifer Rogers , who is the one person who does seem to know Harry and seems happy that he 's dead .
Later , another person who stumbles across both Harry and Captain Wiles is struggling artist Sam Marlowe , to who Captain Wiles tells the entire story of what ... Written by Huggo
Developing an HIV vaccine has proved difficult
An experimental HIV vaccine has for the first time cut the risk of infection , researchers say .
The vaccine - a combination of two earlier experimental vaccines - was given to 16,000 people in Thailand , in the largest ever such vaccine trial .
Researchers found that it reduced by nearly a third the risk of contracting HIV , the virus that leads to Aids .
It has been hailed as a significant , scientific breakthrough , but a global vaccine is still some way off .
The study was carried out by the US army and the Thai government over seven years on volunteers - all HIV - negative men and women aged between 18 and 30 - in parts of Thailand .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The vaccine was a combination of two older vaccines that on their own had not cut infection rates .
Half of the volunteers were given the vaccine , while the other half were given a placebo - and all were given counselling on HIV / Aids prevention .
Participants were tested for HIV infection every six months for three years .
The results found that the chances of catching HIV were 31.2 % less for those who had taken the vaccine - with 74 people who did not get the vaccine infected and 51 of the vaccinated group infected .
The vaccine is based on B and E strains of HIV that most commonly circulate in Thailand not the C strain which predominates in Africa .
' Encouraging '
" This result is tantalisingly encouraging .
The numbers are small and the difference may have been due to chance , but this finding is the first positive news in the Aids vaccine field for a decade , " said Dr Richard Horton , editor of the Lancet medical journal .
" We should be cautious , but hopeful .
The discovery needs urgent replication and investigation . "
Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said : " For the first time , an investigational HIV vaccine has demonstrated some ability to prevent HIV infection among vaccinated individuals .
" Additional research is needed to better understand how this vaccine regimen reduced the risk of HIV infection , but this is certainly an encouraging advance for the HIV vaccine field . "
The findings were hailed by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / Aids ( UN / Aids ) .
They said while the results were " characterised as modestly protective ... [ they ] have instilled new hope in the HIV vaccine research field " .
Some 33 million people around the world have HIV .

We are so unaccustomed to thinking local , that it is hard to even contemplate the idea .
What can be made with strictly local inputs , besides simple things like baskets and bricks ?
It is hard to even contemplate the idea , if one has to put all of the necessary steps in place , like transporting the raw materials to an area where they can be worked on , then working on the raw materials , and distributing the finished products to new locations .
If we want to plan for truly long term sustainability , it seems to me that we need to plan from a base of zero in terms of fossil fuel usage , rather than from present day usage .
This is very much a change from most thinking -- how we can make tweaks to our current system to use less oil or gas .
Over the long term , we know our current system wo n't work , so at some point we need to be thinking where we want to head , while we still have resources in hand that we can use to make changes .
When planning , we need to consider the actual state of our resources .
At this point , our mines are generally fairly depleted , making it in general difficult to extract ores , especially if all one has to work with is local materials .
The one thing we have to offset this is a huge amount of infrastructure that may be of little use if we have to go to almost strictly local economies .
If any of the infrastructure can be recycled to make things we will need ( like horse shoes and hand tools and nails ) , this may be helpful .
There might be the possibility of some fossil fuel use , if residents in a particular area can gather it ( or extract it ) using tools made from local materials .
But the amount would likely be tiny compared to today 's usage .
There might even be some electricity , it residents can get all of the pieces together to create a generating unit of some type .
Some things we might want to consider :
Where People Will Live
We know where people live now , but over the long term , it seems like people will need to live where there is adequate food can be grown and there is sufficient water , so many will have to move .
If there is a great surplus of food , and there is transportation for food , it might theoretically be possible to have cities as well , but this can not be counted on .
If people live in cities , the nutrients they eat will not get back to the soil , unless some approach is set up to handle this issue as well .
Because of the difficulties in trying to transport both food and nutrients , the most likely sustainable outcome is that most people will live in villages , in areas with adequate food and water .
Some people will do better in some parts of the world than others .
I am a fair - skinned blue - eyed blonde .
I would get sun-burned very quickly near the equator .
People may need to consider moving back to the climate their ancestors were from .
Water Supply
Most water is pumped by mechanical means out of wells or from lakes , and treated with chemicals .
Long - term , it is hard to see how this will continue , unless the pumping equipment and chemicals can all be made locally .
Somehow , each community will need to come up with its own supply of water .
This may require wells that are really sustainable with local tools and equipment , or cisterns for holding rainwater .
If irrigation water is used , it will need to be obtained by an approach that can be maintained with tools that are made locally .
If small windmills can be made locally ( perhaps from no longer needed infrastructure ) , they may be helpful for pumping water .
Food Supply
Somehow , we will need seeds for a wide range of foods for the various parts of the world .
It would be helpful if the seeds are not too uniform , so that regardless of weather conditions , some crop is produced each year .
The seeds need to be ones that farmers can collect and use the next year .
Plans need to be made for soil fertility .
Part of this will involve recycling nutrients , and part will involve rotating crops , so as to keep fertility at adequate levels .
Nutrients eaten by animals and humans will need to get back in to the soil .
Some soils will naturally be more fertile - - heavy rains seem to wash nutrients to levels deep in the soil , making the nutrients difficult to reach by other than deep - rooted trees .
Approaches will be needed for dealing with plant diseases and plant pests without chemicals as pesticides .
One approach might be to plant a wider variety of seed types , so some will be spared , regardless of what diseases or pests are encountered .
Approaches will also needed to keep wild animals from eating the crops .
If animals are raised for food , they will need also need protection from predators .
This protection could involve fences ( perhaps made from recycled materials ) .
Shepherds with dogs might be another approach .
Methods will be needed for preserving food -- probably not canning it , unless all of the necessary parts ( glass jars , lids ) are manufactured locally .
Drying or salting food may be methods of choice .
Some method of cooking food will be needed , since nutrients in food are often more accessible if cooked .
Cooking methods will vary in different parts of the world , but will often involve burning wood , charcoal , or animal dung .
Deforestation may be a problem .
Tools for planting and cultivating crops will be needed .
Perhaps these can be made from scrap metal from old cars or trucks .
Some areas may choose to use draft animals to help with cultivation of crops .
If so , it would be helpful to start raising these animals in advance -- perhaps now .
People will also need to learn to train these animals to do the work that is needed .
Transportation
One of the first questions is how roads will be paved .
Traditional methods include stones or bricks .
Or perhaps methods can be developed to re-use current asphalt and concrete .
What kinds of vehicles will travel on the roads we are able to maintain ?
Will it be horse drawn carts , or bicycles ( assuming all of the parts can be created locally ) or something else ?
Will any type of rail transportation be possible , perhaps using existing rail lines , if they can be kept in adequate repair ?
What kind of fuel would be used ?
If sailing ships and canoes are the boats of the future , perhaps we should be making some of them now , and training people to operate them .
Paper and books
We are used to books , newspapers , magazines , and paper money .
Can mills be set up to produce paper locally , using local materials ( so they can be repaired locally as well ) .
How about printing presses ?
Clothing and shoes
Local solutions will be needed - - animal skins , wool , and cotton were traditional solutions .
It will take some work to adapt them to local conditions , or perhaps new solutions can be found .
Home heating
It seems like this will be a real problem , quickly leading to a loss of forests .
If peat or coal that can be gathered using low - tech methods , it seems like residents will do this .
Home lighting
Perhaps bees wax candles ?
Or whale oil ?
Or will it be possible to extract and transport enough petroleum products for lighting ?
Money supply
Local currency will be much more of a challenge if paper is inadequate supply and if gold and silver are in very limited supply .
Local governments will need to figure out something to use in lieu of barter -- this may be a challenge .
Perhaps melted down copper from wires ?
Conclusion
I have n't more than scratched the surface , but one can see that we would have real challenges in a lot of areas .
This is a very different way of thinking about things .
Do you think it is in any way helpful ?
What might we be able to do now , to enable society long - term to transition to a truly sustainable approach ?
How might starting now be better than waiting until there is no alternative ?
In the recession , the nation ’s poverty rate climbed to 13.2 percent last year , up from 12.5 percent in 2007 , according to an annual report released Thursday by the Census Bureau .
The report also documented a decline in employer - provided health insurance and in coverage for adults .
The rise in the poverty rate , to the highest level since 1997 , portends even larger increases this year , which has registered far higher unemployment than in 2008 , economists said .
The bureau said 39.8 million residents last year lived below the poverty line , defined as an income of $ 22,025 for a family of four .
In another sign of both the recession and the long - term stagnation of middle - class wages , median family incomes in 2008 fell to $ 50,300 , compared with $ 52,200 the year before .
This wiped out the income gains of the previous three years , the report said .

Seal electrical outlets in the exterior walls of your house .
Foam insulating gaskets ( less than $ 1 each ) " act as a barrier so conditioned air stays in , rather than leaking out , " says Jonathan Passe of the Environmental Protection Agency .
Just unscrew the outlet cover , install the gasket , and replace the cover .

Go with the flow
Install a high - performance showerhead .
This uses 1 ½ gallons of water per minute ( gpm ) rather than 2 ½ gallons , the federal upper limit for new showerheads .
By switching from a 2 ½ - gpm to a 1 ½ - gpm model ( $ 20 and up ) , a family of four ( each person taking daily 10 - minute showers ) could save about $ 88 a year on water and energy costs with gas water heating and $ 135 a year with electric , according to figures from the Department of Energy Federal Energy Management Program .

Swap out bulbs
Replace incandescent bulbs with CFLs ( compact fluorescent lightbulbs ) .
A $ 10 CFL uses about a quarter of the wattage of an incandescent bulb , which amounts to more than $ 30 in savings per replaced bulb over the lifetime of the CFL ( which averages 10,000 hours or 416 days ) .
" If every household in the United States replaced one incandescent bulb with a CFL , " says Pablo Päster , a sustainability engineer based in San Francisco , California , " the energy savings would be the equivalent of shutting down one coal - fired power plant . "
Be cool
Wash clothes in cold water .
You may already know that this saves energy , but do you know how much ?
" Up to 90 percent of the cost of washing clothes comes from heating the water , so use hot water only for very dirty clothes , " says Adam Gottlieb of the California Energy Commission .
Another tip : " Match the water level to the amount of clothes , or wait to wash full loads , " suggests Clement .
" The water savings can be enormous . "

How to save on green goods
Close ( or open ) your blinds
Leave blinds down on south - and west - facing windows on hot summer days to keep your space cool .
" This prevents the sun from warming your home and making your cooling system work harder , " says Clement .
" In winter , leave blinds up to allow the sun to help heat your home . "
Upgrade your heating ( and cooling ) system
Install ( and properly program ) a programmable thermostat .
The average household spends $ 2,200 annually on energy bills , and about half of that is for heating and cooling , says Vargas .
A programmable thermostat costs $ 50 to $ 80 , is easy to install , and can save about $ 180 a year .
You can shave 2 percent off your heating ( or cooling ) bill for each degree you lower ( or raise ) the thermostat for at least eight hours a day while you 're away from home or asleep , says Amanda Korane of the American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy .

when quack marketing crosses the line
Quack extraordinaire Mike Adams has crossed a line from typical snake oil salesmanship to predatory fear - mongering .
Sometimes I ’m convinced that there ’s a mystical place in which there ’s a fountain of witlessness and not only are there people who drink from it , but some come back for seconds and thirds .
One such person is a rather ghoulish alt - med promoter named Mike Adams , who ’s primary occupation is convincing people that cancers can be cured by a vegan diet and lamenting how celebrities are being systematically poisoned by evil doctors and pharmaceutical companies engaged in a conspiracy to suppress “ alternative medicine ” in the name of profit .
Worse yet , he races to type out his infuriating lamentations before the bodies of those in question had a chance to cool .
So obviously , as soon as Patrick Swayze succumbed to pancreatic cancer , Mike wasted no time in spitting out his typical hackneyed tripe …
Beloved actor Patrick Swayze died yesterday evening after a 20 - month battle with pancreatic cancer .
Having put his faith in conventional chemotherapy , he largely dismissed ideas that nutrition , superfoods or “ alternative medicine ” might save him , instead betting his life on the chemotherapy approach which seeks to poison the body into a state of remission instead of nourishing it into a state of health . [ … ]
Could Patrick
Swayze have saved his own life with natural medicine ?
Absolutely .
Without question .
Even late - stage pancreatic cancer can be reversed ( yes , reversed ) with full - on naturopathic treatments involving Chinese herbal medicine , deep body detoxification that includes sweat saunas and colon cleansing , radical changes in diet from “ dead ” foods to “ live ” foods , a healthy dose of vitamin D and the daily consumption of raw anti-cancer living juices made from fresh , organic produce like cabbage , broccoli and garlic .
Obviously Mike has never actually seen or dealt with a pancreatic cancer patient or talked to an actual doctor with a real medical degree .
Pancreatic cancer is an extremely aggressive disease that ’s very difficult to detect early enough to treat with any chance of success and the prognosis for those diagnosed is usually very poor .
While the brightest minds in oncology work on cutting edge research in targeting and suppressing tumors to save lives , this bozo is actually talking about sweating and eating veggies as the ultimate cure for any cancer , and accusing drug companies of “ keeping natural cures a big secret ” so they can make more money ?
This is inexcusable idiocy that should carry with it legal responsibility and it ’s inane on every level , from the science to the business .
Nothing about his statements makes any logical sense when put in relevant context .
Imagine for a moment that just eating vegetables cures any Stage IV cancer .
Do you have any idea how fast a pharmaceutical company would be packaging and selling whatever enzymes suppress tumor activity ?
You ’d hear a sonic boom as the scientists rush to their labs with lettuce , carrots and broccoli and executives would be giving speeches on how they can not only supply a cure for cancer , but they do n’t need to spend billions of dollars on developing a new drug , just cover the costs of production .
Big Pharma is and always has been into making easy money and vegetable extracts as cancer cures is about as easy as it gets .
For them to keep this a secret so they could plow tens of billions of dollars into oncology research that may or may not pan out and probably wo n’t be able to cover the development costs , makes absolutely no sense .
Either Big Pharma execs and the vast army of researchers they employ are clueless , or Adams simply does n’t know what he ’s talking about .
Call me crazy but I ’m willing to bet on the latter .
From a scientific standpoint , Mike ’s claims are basically just a string of meaningless alt med buzzwords that are of absolutely no use to any doctor with a grip on what actually causes diseases .
What toxins should we be getting rid of ?
What are they ?
How did we get them ?
How do we live with them in between diseases ?
What ’s the toxin accumulation threshold ?
Nobody in the alt med world knows .
They just invoke this stuff to sound like they actually studied something that passes the smell test of scientific jargon .
Likewise , what are all of these potent anti-cancer juices ?
How do they work ?
How have they been tested ?
What ’s the active ingredient ?
And if this stuff works as well as Adams vows it does , where are all the people who were cured by his therapy ?
How come we do n’t see them on National Geographic or featured in the news ?
Big Pharma conspiracy ?
Uh-uh .
In the real world , you ’re going to have to do better than that .
Appeals to conspiracy are the adult version of saying that the dog ate your homework .
Even if it did , you should be able to re-write it .
By the way , has Mike ever heard of Steve Jobs who tried to treat his pancreatic cancer with alternative and folk medicine only to realize that his only chance to survive was a surgery by real doctors ?
Of course he has !
He even tried to give public health advice to Jobs on his blog , admitting he did n’t have access to the relevant medical data but without letting such little things as zero medical training or knowing the patient ’s history get in the way of going in with both barrels loaded with pure insipidity .
So even in the face of evidence that alternative medicine is useless against a serious disease which requires attention from actual doctors with a legitimate medical education , he ’s still trying to push his pseudo - cures .
Here ’s the bottom line .
Mike Adams is a good , old - fashioned snake oil salesman .
It does n’t matter whether he really believes what he writes .
What matters is that his advice to eschew medicine that actually produces real results in favor of pseudoscience that comes with no explanations and is sold on the basis of vague rhetoric about “ toxins ” and “ poisons ” designed to scare patients into trusting their lives to a bunch of quacks , is an inexcusable public health hazard .
Has anybody told Mike that selling false hope to people who are seriously ill to line your pockets is just evil and when you ask them not to help themselves to make a buck , it makes you a lesser human being ?
I wonder what Mike will do if he needs real medical attention .
Something tells me that he wo n’t just be munching on broccoli and giving himself enemas in a sauna …
San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis claims to be a friend of medical marijuana , but one would be hard - pressed to find anyone in the local medical marijuana community who would agree with her .
This " friend " coordinated mass raids against medical marijuana dispensaries there in 2006 , again in February of this year , and yet again just last week .
courthouse demonstration ( courtesy William West , myspace.com/williamwwest )
It is part and parcel of a pattern of bitter , recalcitrant refusal on the part of San Diego county officials to abide by the will of the voters and accept the state 's medical marijuana law .
The conservative county Board of Commissioners is notorious for its opposition to medical marijuana , going so far as pursuing a quixotic and costly legal challenge to state laws , which it lost in every court that heard it .
On Tuesday , the Board unanimously extended for 10 months a moratorium on new dispensaries in unincorporated areas of the county .
After its court challenge to the state law was defeated , the Board is now grudgingly allowing staff to develop regulations for dispensaries , but in the meantime , DA Dumanis is picking them off in batches .
The city of San Diego has been a bit more friendly .
Last week , just one day before Dumanis ' raiders struck , the City Council voted to implement a task force to create recommendations for regulating collectives and co-ops in accordance with guidelines issued earlier this year by the state attorney general .
But if the City Council is working with the medical marijuana community , the San Diego Police Department is not .
Instead , it has joined forces with Dumanis and her conservative cronies to attack the dispensaries .
Last week 's raids shuttered 14 dispensaries in San Diego , the North County , and South Bay , and resulted in 33 arrests -- 31 under state charges and two under federal charges -- including wheelchair - bound patients hauled away by armed and uniformed law enforcement agents .
Dumanis assembled squads of San Diego Police , San Diego County Sheriff 's officers , DEA agents , and IRS agents to swoop down on the dispensaries , make arrests , seize cash and medicine , and disrupt the local medical marijuana distribution system .
While the DEA was present , last week 's raids were Dumanis 's baby .
Only two of those arrested face federal charges .
" It was a joint investigation with the sheriff 's department and the police department , " said San Diego DEA spokeswoman Amy Roderick .
" We were asked for our assistance .
We were not at every location . "
Roderick declined to spell out how DEA San Diego is interpreting the current Justice Department position on not pursuing medical marijuana providers in states where it is legal unless they are in violation of state law .
" I ca n't comment on policy , " she said .
" It 's not made by the DEA . "
" Like most San Diegans , I support the use of legitimate and legal medical marijuana use , " Dumanis said at a press conference touting the busts .
" However , it appears these so - called ' marijuana dispensaries ' are nothing more than for - profit storefront drug dealing operations run by drug dealers hiding behind the state 's medical marijuana law . "
Donna Lambert ( courtesy William West , myspace.com/williamwwest )
" We 're not surprised at all , but very disappointed , " said Margaret Dooley - Sammuli , deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance .
" What Dumanis is doing is simply unacceptable .
If she has legitimate concerns about how dispensaries are operating , whether they 're operating as collectives , she could use civil actions , she could use letters and accountants .
There is no call for bringing in the DEA , arresting people in wheelchairs , scaring the hell out of patients , and shutting off medical marijuana access for very sick people .
It 's her tactics that we 're really concerned with , " she said .
" But also her misrepresentations to the public of what she 's doing and her unproductive strategy of pointing out what she says is illegal , but not saying what is legal , " Dooley - Sammuli continued .
" Collective operators are doing their best to comply with the law , but she does n't have answers for them .
People have gone out of their way to follow the guidelines , but got raided anyway . "
I do n't think Bonnie Dumanis has ever seen a legal dispensary in 13 years , " said Dion Markgraff , San Diego coordinator for Americans for Safe Access " She can't follow the plain language of the law , but instead she holds some impossible standard that no one else knows about , " he said .
" We 're on the front lines of the most terrorist county in the whole state , " Markgraff continued .
" The DA is sending in cops who lied to doctors to get valid recommendations , and then busting dispensaries that are operating according to the law .
At worst , maybe somebody did n't file this or that piece of paper or had a zoning issue , but there was certainly nothing criminal . "
Markgraff himself has had a taste of the DA 's bitter medicine .
" I was raided two months ago for 32 immature plants , " he related .
" My girlfriend and I both have medical marijuana recommendations , and I had a state caregiver card .
The cops laughed at my card , then stole it .
They took everything , they arrested me and my girlfriend , they took my kid , they gave us both $ 130,000 bail .
Now we 're fighting this Kafkaesque , Orwellian system where the prosecutors and the judges do n't give a shit about legality . "
There was nothing unique about police seizing his daughter , Markgraff said .
" They do it all the time .
The first thing they say is 'we 're going to take your kids if you do n't plead . '
When they 're using your kids as leverage , that 's really ugly , " he said .
" We have not , and will not prosecute people who are legitimately and legally using medical marijuana , " Dumanis said at the press conference .
" It 's a shame that a few illegal drug dealers are trampling on the compassion shown by voters in passing California 's medical marijuana law . "
Medical marijuana patient and now criminal defendant Donna Lambert begs to differ .
She joined a 10 - person medical marijuana collective after the 2006 raids that disrupted supplies .
" I provided medical marijuana to a valid qualified patient who was an undercover cop who lied to a doctor to get a doctor 's recommendation , " said Lambert , who was one of 14 people arrested in the Operation Green RX raids conducted in February .
" There was no dispute about my patient status or his patient status . "
In Operation Green RX , as many as ten detectives spent six months becoming qualified medical marijuana patients on fraudulent grounds and then joining medical marijuana collectives .
Undercover San Diego Police Detective Scott Henderson lied to a doctor to obtain a valid medical marijuana recommendation and then reached out to Ms. Lambert for help .
When , believing she was lawfully helping another patient , she supplied him with medical marijuana , Lambert became yet another of Dumanis ' victims .
San Diego demonstration against ' Operation Green RX ' ( courtesy William West , myspace.com/williamwwest )
Lambert , a 47 - year - old San Diego resident , began relying on marijuana to cope with chemotherapy .
She struggles with a number of serious illnesses , including hepatitis C , cirrhosis , cancer and Sjoegrens Disease .
She was bound over for December trial during a preliminary hearing last week , despite the judge in that hearing noting that she was clearly not in it for profit .
" My attorney says they 've never dismissed a medical marijuana sales case in San Diego , " she said .
" They are a little more conservative down there than the other coastal cities , " said San Francisco - based Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Bruce Mirken when asked what was the matter with San Diego .
" It seems like the county is more a problem than the city , and some of their officials , including the DA , are particularly bad . "
California 's confused medical marijuana law is part of the problem , said Mirken .
" It does n't specify with absolute clarity what is legal and what is n't when it comes to medical marijuana distribution .
Everyone is operating on the attorney general 's guidelines , which have n't been tested in court , and that leaves room for interpretation , so you have fertile ground for officials who choose to be jerks to wreak a great deal of havoc .
That 's what 's happening in San Diego County . "
" People got up in arms at the DEA , but in this case , they were playing a supporting role , " said Mirken .
" The real problem is local officials who think medical marijuana is okay as long as you do n't actually get it from anyone .
The law says patients can have marijuana , so it makes sense to have an aboveground , organized distribution system .
We have working models for that in places like San Francisco and Oakland .
It 's not that hard to do if you have the political will to do it , " Mirken said .
" It 's just been an ongoing battle for lo these many years , " said Dale Gieringer , head of California NORML in San Francisco .
" The city of San Diego is n't so bad , but the county is more conservative .
The county board of commissioners is the one that filed the lawsuit trying to overturn the state medical marijuana law .
And the DA is just bad .
We initially approved of her election ; she is gay , and was viewed as progressive , but she 's been really tough on medical cannabis .
Still , I see a glimmer of hope here .
In half of her statements , Dumanis seems to be saying that there might be some legal dispensaries around , but nobody 's clear on who they are . "
San Diego medical marijuana patients and activists are n't seeing glimmers of hope ; they 're seeing red .
" We need to replace the DA , most of the county board , and the county sheriff , " said Lambert .
" They are all working together to subvert the state law .
It does n't matter to them if people are following the law or not , she just lies through her teeth about it .
I am the perfect example of her lies . "
" Dumanis has made a political calculation that this will appeal to her conservative base , " said Markgraff .
" There is no one currently running against her , but we are trying to get someone to do that .
There are plenty of people upset with her , and now just in the medical marijuana community .
She 's ripe for being thrown out , " he said .
" We are mobilizing in San Diego , " said Dooley - Sammuli .
" Patients and medical marijuana supporters are working to put pressure on her to stop these tactics , and we 're working with the newly created city task force to craft regulations , but this is really all about Bonnie Dumanis and the upcoming election .
She is hoping this will work for her politically , and we 're working to see that it does n't . "
San Diego activists told the Chronicle of many more horror stories about medical marijuana persecution under DA Dumanis .
While they are working to get rid of Dumanis and bring a measure of real justice to the DA 's office , the Chronicle will be digging a little deeper into the alleged abuses .
The conservation charity WWF and an ad agency have admitted that a press campaign comparing the loss of life in the New York 9/11 attacks and the Asian tsunami " should never have been made " .
The Brazilian press ad , created by local advertising agency DDB Brasil , is called " Tsunami " and uses images of dozens of planes about to crash into New York City skyscrapers to illustrate the scale of the lives lost in the 2004 Asian tsunami .
WWF 's ad , which also shows the World Trade Center towers destroyed in the terrorist attacks of 2001 , was created and approved at the end of last year and appeared briefly in the Brazilian press .
In a joint statement yesterday from WWF Brazil and DDB Brasil , posted on the ad agency 's website , they admitted that the press ad was " created and approved " for use .
" It was created and approved in late 2008 , mistakenly , and was solely the result of lack of experience on the part of a few professionals from both parties involved , " the joint statement said .
" In no way was it done in bad faith or with disrespect to American suffering .
WWF Brazil and DDB Brasil acknowledge that such an ad should never have been made , approved or published . "
This followed an earlier statement from WWF Brazil admitting that the 9/11 press ad concept had been presented as a campaign idea by DDB Brasil in December – but denying that it had been approved to run anywhere .
Earlier yesterday , WWF had also put out a statement from its US office initially claiming it was being " inaccurately " linked to the press ad , before the admission of responsibility from the organisation 's Brazilian arm .
The press ad was also submitted to an awards show in the US .
What purports to be a video version of the ad has subsequently appeared online , featuring a recreation of the New York skyline , including the World Trade Center .
However , both the WWF and DDB Brasil deny any involvement in the creation of the video .

Survival of the Dead
Written and Directed by : George A. Romero
Starring : Kenneth Welsh , Alan Van Sprang , Richard Fitzpatrick , Athena Karkanis , Devon Bostick , Philippa Domville , Kathleen Munroe
By its very nature , it seems like horror should be a young man ’s game ; a genre that requires the brashness of youth in order to keep things fresh and continually push the envelope .
And yet , there are all kinds of aging filmmakers out there refusing to abandon their genre roots in order to pursue a more “ dignified ” career path .
There ’s something inspiring about knowing that George A. Romero is almost 70 years old , and still cranking out low budget zombie flicks like nobody ’s business .
The thing is , when you ’re a living legend , you ’ve always gotta be looking over your shoulder , because there ’s a good chance that at some point the students will surpass the master , so to speak .
What ’s more , if you ’re constantly riding on your past successes , you run the risk of simply repeating yourself ad nauseam and becoming completely redundant .
Romero ’s last film , Diary of the Dead , attempted to bring the zombie movie to the digital age , and failed pretty spectacularly .
Would Survival of the Dead be a return to form , or would it merely continue down the path to irrelevancy ?
Survival of the Dead is a spin - off / sequel to Diary of the Dead , in that it follows a different group of characters within the same approximate timeline .
Col . “ Nicotine ” Crocket ( Alan Van Sprang ) , who had a brief appearance in Diary , takes center stage as he leads a group of well - armed mercenaries across the zombie - infested U.S. of A .
When they discover a video on the internet tipping them off about an island off the coast of Delaware that is supposedly free from infection , they decide to make it their next destination .
Along the way they meet up with Patrick O’Flynn , a former resident of Plum Island who was banished by the current inhabitants .
Before they know it , they find themselves caught in the middle of a feud between two rival Irish families , fighting to survive not only against the zombies , but also each other .
Initially , Survival of the Dead shows quite a bit of promise , by mixing in a strong western element .
There are some fun , campy characters , from the gruff military types to the Irish clansmen , and it feels like Romero is rediscovering the tone that made his comeback film , Land of the Dead , work .
There are also some interesting new ideas , such as the moral disagreement over whether or not the zombies have a right to “ live ” , and whether they should simply be rounded up like cattle or outright killed .
The Hatfield and McCoy - esque family feud angle also brings something fresh to the horror genre , and with enjoyable performances from Kenneth Welsh and Richard Fitzpatrick as the two family patriarchs to help support it .
It does n’t take long for the movie to start to fall apart , however .
The stiff dialogue and endless one - liners get progressively worse to the point where they become almost unbearable , and the plot never really takes shape .
Important story elements are discarded on a whim with no real justification , and there is a “ twin sister ” twist that is surely one of the worst eye - rolling moments in recent film history .
Yes , there are some gruesome encounters with zombies along the way , but even these lack any sort of weight .
All of the scuffles feel like moments conceived purely for the sake of showcasing special effects , most of which come off as cartoony rather than horrific .
I mean , really … shoving a fire extinguisher in a zombie ’s mouth and filling it with foam until his head explodes ?
Is this what Romero ’s Dead series has become ?
There is far more reliance on digital effects here than I think most horror fans would like .
The low budget aesthetic of 2009 is not nearly as eerie ( nor as charming ) as the low budget aesthetic of the ’70s .
In a certain sense , Romero has painted himself into a corner with Survival of the Dead .
He is trying to do something different and avoid repetition , but by putting so much emphasis on the family rivalry subplot , the zombies are pushed to the background and are no longer a threat .
Also , by trying to set up a mythology and a continuing storyline with his movies , he is leaving out some of the most interesting elements of a zombie film , such as the introduction of the virus and seeing how average people cope with the crisis .
While there was plenty of debate over the merit of Romero ’s last two films , I think the man may have finally worn out his welcome this time around — even among the hardcore zombie fiends .
The question is not whether or not Survival of the Dead is a good film ( it ’s not ) , but rather , does it at least outshine Diary of the Dead ?
My initial thought was yes it does , because it does n’t take itself quite so seriously and delivers some campy fun within the framework of a western .
However , upon after further reflection ( and the realization that I actually gave Diary of the Dead two stars back when I first reviewed it ) , I think Diary of the Dead did at least work as a horror movie at points , which is precisely where Survival of the Dead falls flat .
At any rate , the bottom line here is that it ’s probably time for George A. Romero to give up on zombies once and for all .
He has accomplished all that he can in this particular niche , and at this point it ’s clear that he is simply treading water , if not tarnishing his name .
He should step aside for the new up - and - comers , and consider collaborating with other filmmakers and / or directing someone else ’s script .
Of all people , the godfather of zombies should know that there ’s strength in numbers .

Intro
People have long complained that one of the tricky things about perl is the deployment phase , much because of the intricacies of mod_perl and its unfriendliness towards shared environments .
In fact , I would highly recommend FastCGI over mod_perl since it is quite easy to understand and configure .
This post is going to focus on smaller shared hosting environments , and how easy it can be to quickly deploy a Catalyst web app .
Getting Started
Assumptions
There are some basic assumptions here .
First we need a Linux webserver that has Apache installed and is loading up
fcgid .
I believe you can also use the favored mod_fastcgi which I just pointed to above , but I have yet to test this on a shared host .
These are binary compatible modules so in theory both work .
But again I ’ve only used mod_fastcgi for large non-shared hosted deployments .
You ’ll also need mod_rewrite which is now fairly common .
Installing Your Modules
The best way to install the modules your application depends on is using local : : lib .
I ’ve talked about this before so there is n’t a lot of need to go over the process in detail again , but in a nutshell you can do
$ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AP/APEIRON/local-lib-1.004006.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf local - lib- 1.004006.tar.gz $ cd local - lib - 1.004006 $ perl Makefile .
PL -- bootstrap $ make test && make install $ echo 'eval $ ( perl - I$ HOME / perl5/lib/ perl5 - Mlocal : : lib ) ' >>~/.bashrc $ source ~/.bashrc
Now you have an environment that you can install your modules into .
By default this is localized to ~/ perl5 .
The next step is to install your modules that the application requires .
It is good practice to put these into your Makefile .
PL so that you can easily install them in one shot .
A very basic one would follow this template
use inc:: Module :: Install ; name ' MyApp ' ; all_from ' lib/MyApp.pm ' ; requires ' Catalyst :: Runtime ' = > ' 5.80011 ' ; requires ' Config : : General ' ; # require other modules here install_script glob ( ' script/*.pl ' ) ; auto_install ; WriteAll ;
Now its easy to do
$ export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT
= 1 $ perl Makefile .
PL $ make installdeps
The PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT will configure things such that you do n’t have to press enter at every question about a dependency .
The make installdeps will install any missing modules , which in this case is going to be everything .
You can upgrade the version numbers in the Makefile .
PL “ requires ” lines if you want installdeps to grab the newer distributions as they are released to CPAN .
Configuring Your App
First thing we have to do is a minor edit to our fastcgi script , which is to tell it to use our local : : lib .
Since its not part of the environment we setup earlier in . bashrc we have to tell the fastcgi perl script where to find things .
Below the “ use warnings ; ” line add this
use lib " /home/myuser/perl5/lib/perl5 " ; use local : : lib ;
Make sure to change the path to the correct location of your perl5 modules directory .
The last thing is to make sure your app is located in the public directory root for your host .
In my case I created a symbolic link from the public_html folder to my app .
$ cd && mv public_html public_html.old # get rid of current root folder $ ln -s ~/ myapp ~/public_html
Then create a .htaccess file in that folder , which should reside beside all of your code
Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
Order allow , deny Allow from all AddHandler fcgid - script .pl RewriteEngine On RewriteCond % { REQUEST_URI } !^/? script/myapp_fastcgi.pl RewriteRule ^ ( .* ) $ script/myapp_fastcgi.pl/$ 1 [ PT ,L ] RewriteRule ^static / ( .* ) $ static / $ 1 [ PT,L ]
We ’re just telling apache to turn CGI on , and make sure to execute our fastcgi perl script .
Be sure to change the rewrite lines to point to your script ( hint : change myapp to your app name ) .
Now , you should be able to hit your domain .
Simple !
Conclusion
So we ’ve seen that deploying perl can actually be fairly easy .
There are of course some assumptions here , for example , to get the rewrite rules working you ’ll need mod_rewrite .
so , but this is fairly standard these days .
Now you can deploy a perl app with the same ease as languages such as PHP , where it is pretty much plug and play .
This should enable people to more easily compete with all the badly written blog , forum , and other generically useful software in the open source world .
James Surowiecki explains how the government contributed to the problem with the ratings agencies .
[ O ]ver the years the government has made the agencies an increasingly important part of the financial system .
Rating agencies have been around for a century , and their ratings have been used by regulators since the thirties .
But in the seventies the S.E.C. dubbed the three biggest agencies — S. & P. , Moody ’s , and Fitch — Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations , effectively making them official arbiters of financial soundness .
The decision had a certain logic : it was supposed to make it easier for investors to know that the money in their pension or money - market funds was going into safe and secure investments .
But the new regulations also turned the agencies from opinion - givers into indispensable gatekeepers .
If you want to sell a corporate bond , or package a bunch of mortgages together into a security , you pretty much need a rating from one of the agencies .
And though the agencies are private companies , their opinions can effectively have the force of law .
The ratings often dictate what institutions like banks , insurance companies , and money - market funds can and ca n’t do : money - market funds ca n’t have more than five per cent of their assets in low - rated commercial paper , there are limits on the percentage of non-investment - grade assets that banks can own , and so on .
The conventional explanation of what ’s wrong with the rating agencies focusses on the fact that most of them are paid by the very people whose financial products they rate .
That problem needs to be fixed , and last week the S.E.C. proposed new rules to address conflicts of interest .
But there ’s a much bigger problem , which is that , even though nearly everyone knows that the agencies are compromised and exert too much influence , the system makes it impossible not to rely on them .
Once Again , The Will of the Voters Is Denied

Yesterday afternoon , Justice Edward Lehner of the State Supreme Court rubberstamped Referee Louis Crespo ’s recommendation that the decision to establish a local commission to investigate the events of September 11th not be put before the voters on November 3rd .
After showing interest in weighing both sides ’ arguments in the hearing , the Judge ’s short decision gives no indication of having considered the arguments put forth in the Petitioners ’ memorandum of law , nor any acknowledgement of the need for a new investigation , which the City of New York callously dismissed as “ irrelevant ” .
On a dark day for democracy , the patriotic call for answers by hundreds of 9/11 families , first responders and survivors has been stifled , and the will of the people of New York City once again denied .
Judge Lehner ruled that modifying the petition to make it “ legally permissible ” would result in it being “ inconsistent with the law sought by the signatories of the Petition ” despite the fact that all 80,000 signatories agreed by signing the Petition that “ If any provision of this law is held to be unconstitutional or invalid for any reason , the remaining provisions shall be in no manner affected thereby but shall remain in full force and effect . ”
The deadline for inclusion on the ballot falls just before the election , making it possible to appeal Judge Lehner ’s decision .
NYC CAN is weighing all options and will make an announcement early next week on this issue , as well as on how it will be moving forward on other fronts .
Regardless of the outcome in court , the quest for answers continues full throttle .
This fight is only the beginning .
Thinkers think and talkers talk .

This past weekend , the New York Times Magazine had a cover story by Dexter Filkins , " Stanley McChrystal 's Long War , " which ended with Afghan War commander McChrystal 's pledge to an Afghan governor that the U.S. military would stay in the country " until our Afghan partners are completely secure . "
" Even , " he continued , " if that means years . "
Similarly , Filkins quoted McChrystal 's deputy , Michael Flynn , this way : " I believe that it 's probably going to take us three years to really turn the insurgency to the point where it 's waning instead of waxing ...
And then I think ... we are looking at another two years when the government of Afghanistan and the security forces of Afghanistan begin to take a lot more personal responsibility . "
And keep in mind -- nowhere in that quote is there the slightest indication that Flynn expects U.S. troops to be departing Afghanistan at the end of that five - year stretch when Afghan forces will just " begin " to be taking more " personal responsibility . "
" Long War " , or long haul , indeed !
Here 's the odd thing , though : our military leadership in Afghanistan acts , to judge by Filkins piece , as if winning were a hard but typical thing to do , if only things were done right this time .
( By the way , if Filkins had written a piece similar in tone about LeBron James , it would be considered embarrassingly fawning .
Why is it that our objective reporters for major newspapers regularly fall in love with their military subjects and cast them as stars ?
And why is such work never considered embarrassing ? )
In any case , back to the issue of the American military winning .
It 's a premise that TomDispatch associate editor and Vietnam War expert Nick Turse considers remarkably far - fetched based on the last half - century of American war - fighting ; in fact , it 's a point he 's raised for years at this website .
The real question is : Can an American general win much of anything , no matter how many years , and how much money , Americans are willing to spend , or how much good press he gets ?
Tom
When the Nobel Committee awarded its annual peace prize to President Barack Obama , it afforded him a golden opportunity seldom offered to American war presidents : the possibility of success .
Should he decide to go the peace - maker route , Obama stands a chance of really accomplishing something significant .
On the other hand , history suggests that the path of war is a surefire loser .
As president after president has discovered , especially since World War II , the U.S. military simply can't seal the deal on winning a war .
While the armed forces can do many things , the one thing that has generally escaped them is that ultimate endpoint : lasting victory .
This might have been driven home recently -- had anyone noticed -- when , in the midst of the Washington debate over the Afghan War , a forgotten front in President Bush 's Global War on Terror , the Philippines , popped back into the news .
On September 25th , New York Times correspondent Norimitsu Onishi wrote :
" Early this decade , American soldiers landed on the island of Basilan , here in the southern Philippines , to help root out the militant Islamic separatist group Abu Sayyaf .
Now , Basilan 's biggest towns , once overrun by Abu Sayyaf and criminal groups , have become safe enough that a local Avon lady trolls unworriedly for customers .
Still , despite seven years of joint military missions and American development projects , much of the island outside main towns like Lamitan remains unsafe . "
In attempting to explain the uneven progress of U.S. counterinsurgency operations against Muslim guerillas in the region after the better part of a decade , Onishi also noted , " Basilan , like many other Muslim and Christian areas in the southern Philippines , has a long history of political violence , clan warfare and corruption . "
While he remained silent about events prior to the 1990s , his newspaper had offered this reasonably rosy assessment of U.S. counterinsurgency efforts against Muslim guerrillas on the same island -- 100 years earlier :
" Detachments of the Twenty - third and Twenty - fifth Infantry , with constabulary and armed launches assisting , are engaged in disarming the Moros on Basilan Island .
The troops are distributed around the coast and are co-operating in a series of closing - in movements . "
Days after Onishi's report appeared , two American soldiers were killed on nearby Jolo Island .
As a Reuters story noted , it " was the first deadly strike against U.S. forces deployed in the southern Philippines since a soldier in a restaurant was killed in 2002 ... "
As in Basilan , however , the U.S. counterinsurgency story in Jolo actually goes back a long way .
In early January 1905 , to cite just one example , two members of the U.S. military -- the 14th Cavalry to be exact -- were killed during pacification operations on that same island .
That U.S. forces are attempting to defeat Muslim guerrillas on the same two tiny islands a century later should perhaps give President Obama pause as he weighs his options in Afghanistan and considers his recent award .
It might also be worth his time to assess the military 's record of success in conflicts since World War II , starting with the stalemate war in Korea that began in June 1950 and has yet to end in peace , let alone victory .
That quiescent but unsettled conflict provides a ready - made opportunity for the president to achieve a triumph that has long escaped the U.S. military .
He could help make a lasting peace on a de-nuclearized Korean peninsula and so begin earning his recent award .
Vietnam and Beyond
At the moment , Obama and his fellow Washington power - players are reportedly immersed in the literature of the Vietnam War in an attempt to use history as a divining rod for discovering a path forward in Afghanistan .
At the Pentagon , many evidently still cling to the notion that the conflict was lost thanks to the weakness of public support in the U.S. , pessimistic reporting by the media , and politicians without backbones .
Obama would do well to ignore their revisionist reading list for a simple reason : bluntly put , the U.S. - funded French military effort to defeat Vietnamese nationalism in the early 1950s failed dismally ; then , a U.S. - funded effort to set up and arm a viable government in South Vietnam failed dismally ; and finally , the U.S. military 's full - scale , years ' long effort to destroy the Vietnamese forces arrayed against it failed even more dismally -- and not in the cities and towns of the United States , nor even in the halls of power in Washington , but in the hamlets of South Vietnam .
U.S. efforts in neighboring Cambodia and Laos similarly crashed and burned .
Victory aside , the U.S. military proved capable during the Vietnam War of accomplishing much .
Its true achievement lay in the merciless pummeling it gave the people of Southeast Asia , leaving the region blood - soaked , heavily cratered , significantly poisoned , and littered with explosives , which kill and maim villagers to this day .
In the wake of out - and - out defeat in Indochina , Americans diagnosed themselves as suffering from a " Vietnam Syndrome " ( resulting in a less muscular foreign policy -- embarrassing for a global superpower ) and in need of a victory cure .
In the 1980s and 1990s , this led to " triumphs " over such powers as the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada and Panama , a country whose " defense forces , " in total , numbered just 12,000 ( about half the size of the U.S. ground troops in the invading force ) -- and cut -and - run flops in Lebanon and Somalia .
The " lessons " of Vietnam were declared officially buried forever in the scorching deserts of the Middle East in March 1991 .
" By God , we 've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all ! " President George H.W. Bush triumphantly exclaimed at the end of the First Gulf War -- and yet Saddam Hussein , the enemy autocrat , remained firmly ensconced in power in Baghdad and the conflict continued at a less than triumphant simmer for over a decade until his son , George W. Bush , again took the country to war against the same Iraqi leader his father had fought and again declared the mission accomplished .
Following a lightning - fast march on Baghdad in 2003 , much like the speedy pseudo - victory in Kuwait in Gulf War I , U.S. forces again proved unable to seal the deal .
Bush administration efforts to dominate the country politically by writing Iraq 's constitution , while circumventing real elections , were quickly laid low by Iraq 's most powerful religious leader , the Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani .
Then , the U.S. military was sent reeling for years by a Sunni insurgency .
Though violence is currently tamped down to what is often called " an acceptable level , " Iraq remains a war zone and Barack Obama is the fourth president to preside over a seemingly never - ending , irresolvable set of conflicts in that country .
( The U.S. - allied Iraqi government has already proclaimed the U.S. a loser , announcing a " great victory " over the U.S. occupation in June 2009 and comparing the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from the country 's cities to a historic 1920 Iraqi revolt against British forces .
American officials have not disagreed . )
During the 1980s , U.S. proxies in Afghanistan , Muslim mujahideen guerrillas , fought the Soviet occupation .
Today , U.S. troops are the occupiers , fighting some of those same mujahidin and in the ninth year of this latest war in Afghanistan , victory still appears to be nowhere on the mountainous horizon , while failure , according to Afghan War commander General Stanley McChrystal , is once again a possibility .
Late last year , at the 26th Army Science Conference , I listened to one of the top- ranking enlisted men in the Army , a highly decorated veteran of the Global War on Terror , and a draftee during America 's losing war in Vietnam , candidly admit that U.S. troops in Afghanistan simply could not keep up with enemy forces .
The lightly - armed , body - armor - less guerrillas were too mobile and too agile , he said , for up - armored , heavily weighed - down American troops .
When I asked him about the comment later , a colleague of the same rank and fellow Global War on Terror veteran quickly jumped to his defense , declaring , " Yeah , I ca n't run the mountain with them , but I 'll still get them -- eventually . "
Almost a year later , the better part of a decade into the fight , the unanswered question remains , " When ? "
Peace President
The U.S. military is unquestionably powerful and has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to mete out tremendous amounts of destruction and death .
From Korea , Vietnam , and Cambodia to Iraq and Afghanistan , enemy fighters and unfortunate civilians , military base camps and people 's homes have been laid waste by U.S. forces in decade after decade of conflict .
Yet sealing the deal has been another matter entirely .
Victory has repeatedly slipped through the fingers of American presidents , no matter how much technology and ordnance has been unleashed on the poor , sometimes pre-industrial populations of America 's war zones .
Now , the Nobel Committee has made a remarkable gamble .
It has seen fit to offer Barack Obama , who entered the Oval Office as a war president and soon doubled down the U.S. bet on the expanding conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan , an opportunity for a lasting legacy and real achievement of a sort that has long escaped American presidents .
Their prize gives him an opportunity to step back and consider the history of American war - making and what the U.S. military is really capable of doing thousands of miles from home .
It 's an unparalleled opportunity to face up honestly to the repeatedly demonstrated limits of American military power .
It 's also the president 's chance to transform himself from war - maker by inheritance to his own kind of peace - maker , and so display a skill possessed by few previous presidents .
He could achieve a more lasting victory , while limiting the blood , American and foreign , on his -- and all Americans ' -- hands .
More than 100 years after their early counterinsurgency efforts on two tiny islands in the Philippines , U.S. troops are still dying there at the hands of Muslim guerillas .
More than 50 years later , the U.S. still garrisons the southern part of the Korean peninsula as a result of a stalemate war and a peace as yet unmade .
More recently , the American experience has included outright defeat in Vietnam , failures in Laos and Cambodia ; debacles in Lebanon and Somalia ; a never - ending four - president - long war in Iraq ; and almost a decade of wheel - spinning in Afghanistan without any sign of success , no less victory .
What could make the limits of American power any clearer ?
The record should be as sobering as it is dismal , while the costs to the peoples in those countries are as appalling as they are unfathomable to Americans .
The blood and futility of this American past ought to be apparent to Nobel Peace Prize - winner Obama , even if his predecessors have been incredibly resistant to clear - eyed assessments of American power or the real consequences of U.S. wars .
Two paths stretch out before this first - year president .
Two destinations beckon : peace or failure .

Picking a car of the year is not a scientific business .
It 's about priorities .
If you 're a single guy with an unlimited amount of dough , you should get an Audi R8 .
If you hate fun as much as you love patchouli , buy a hybrid .
( Or for a green car that actually kicks ass , see the BMW 335d . )
And if you 're a subscriber of Mexican Drug Lord Quarterly , your car of the year would definitely be the Knight XV , a $ 295,000 armored SUV that looks like something you 'd buy if DMX were mad at you .
Here at Esquire , we have our own set of priorities .
First and foremost , we believe the car of the year should be able to stir the ol ' loins — you need to feel a little tingle of excitement every time you grab those keys .
Yet , unlike the $ 115,000 R8 , it should also be attainable for most men .
Our car should be sharp enough to impress a date and restrained enough to park next to your boss .
It 's a vehicle that is thrilling but not profligate , handsome but not faddish .
We wanted to select a car that fulfills the mundane , practical needs of year - round transportation but also packs enough beans under the hood to give you a queasy feeling when you realize the guy in the Porsche is instigating a race — and you 're about to take him up on it .
After much driving and much debate , there was only one conclusion : The Esquire Car of the Year is the 2010 Ford Taurus SHO .
We were as surprised as you are .
This new SHO — which stands for Super High Output — comes from a company that 's in a far different place than the firm that designed the Taurus of your rental - car memory .
Ford used to build Jaguars , Aston Martins , Land Rovers , and Volvos .
With all the premium brands except Volvo sold off ( and Volvo most definitely on the auction block ) , the company is rapidly heading to a place in which its most advanced technological efforts are n't directed toward Aston V - 8 Vantages or Range Rovers but actual Fords .
Imagine that .
A few years back , Ford might 've thought twice about putting massage seats in a Taurus when such an option was n't available for Jaguars .
Or it might 've detuned the top - spec motor to keep a respectful distance between the lowly Taurus and the Volvo S80 .
But now this is it .
This is the flagship .
So Ford came at it with both barrels .
The SHO offers massage seats that improve on Mercedes 's system by including the whole seat , not just the back .
( They 're heated and cooled , too . )
It has a blind - spot warning system on the outside rearview mirrors .
Adaptive cruise control flashes a heads - up warning on the windshield when you run up on slower traffic , and another radar system scans for cross traffic when you 're backing out of a parking space .
That 's all quite nice , but you do n't buy a car strictly because it has massage seats .
( Okay , maybe you do . )
The reason we care about the new Taurus can be boiled down to four words : Looks good , goes fast .
Here we have an affordable American sedan that benchmarks not the Chevy Impala or Hyundai Sonata but the Audi A6 and BMW 535 xi .
The BMW , for instance , offers all - wheel drive and a twin - turbocharged , direct - injected 300 hp six - cylinder for about $ 54,000 .
The SHO also uses all - wheel drive and a twin - turbo , direct - injection six - cylinder , but it puts out more power — 365 hp — and costs $ 16,000 less than the 535 xi .
The fact that a Taurus is cheaper than a 5 - Series is n't news .
But the fact that it plays on the same field technologically is crazy .
And this is also the best - looking Taurus since the 1980s original , which was so radical that it promptly showed up in RoboCop .
The SHO recalls the crisp , badass Ford Interceptor concept car of a few years back .
It looks strong and well proportioned , a shape that implies power .
And this time around , the power is definitely there .
Ford considered putting a V - 8 in the SHO ( likely the Yamaha - built number found in the Volvo XC90 ) but ultimately decided to go with its own 3.5 - liter turbo V - 6 , dubbed EcoBoost .
The rationale was simple : With turbos on a direct - injected V - 6 , you get V - 8 power with V - 6 fuel economy .
Floor the gas on the SHO and you 're smoothly squeezed back in the seat as the motor builds power , the turbos whistling faintly in the background .
The all - wheel - drive system and six - speed automatic put the power down with no wheelspin .
It 's all very refined .
This is deceptive speed , the kind where you look down at the speedometer and realize that ten seconds with your foot to the floor will amount to jail time if you ever get caught .
The SHO is a sleeper — a vehicle you can live with every day that happens to have a secret under the hood .
Divested of its luxury brands ,
Ford is all - in on the business of building Fords , and the SHO is one of the first results of that newfound focus — a $ 38,000 American sedan that stacks up against the big- money German autobahn slayers .
It 's almost too bad , in a way : The Taurus SHO would 've made a pretty good Jaguar .

Justice Bilal Nazki on Tuesday asked the government if it wanted to make the poor suffer and provide facilities to the rich .
The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the Bombay Environmental Action Group ( BEAG ) seeking the implementation of a traffic restraint system ( TRS ) in the city .
The government has opposed the system , calling it unfeasible .
After the court was told that 450 private cars are added to the city roads every day , the judges observed that only 10 % of the city ’s population uses cars and the rest use public transport .
Arguing for the BEAG , advocate Shiraz Rustomji said public vehicles cannot move fast because of private vehicles congesting the roads .
He termed TRS a pragmatic solution .
The government should first try it before saying the system is unviable , he said .
BEST buses have changed , Rustomji said , and even taxi drivers had converted their cabs to CNG at their own expense .
“ Is it not time the private transport - persons driving their cars - make a difference ?
” “ We ( car owners ) too have to make some sacrifice , ” Nazki said .
“ It is like making the poor suffer because they cannot afford a car . ”
Government counsel SK
Nair said implementing TRS would make it difficult to force cars to turn back if they entered city limits on wrong days .
But Nazki said , “ If you cannot implement a law , it does not mean it should be scrapped .
This is no logic . ”
He said some people did not wear helmets or put on seat belts , but that did not mean the law was faulty .
It is impossible for any city in the world to improve infrastructure to keep pace with the rise in vehicular population .
But some measures had to be taken , Nazki said .
“ This is like birth control .
We ca n’t provide for the population so we say birth control is necessary .
” In an affidavit filed by deputy commissioner of police ( traffic ) Shahaji Solunkhe , the state government suggested a couple of measures , including the implementation of a ‘ high occupancy lane ’ or a ‘ fast lane ’ on major arterial roads .
The court , however , asked the government counsel how long it would take for the government to implement its proposed measures for traffic decongestion .
The estimated time was six months , said Nair , but the Centre had to make the changes before the state could implement them .
“ Why do n’t you ( the state government ) say that you want to maintain status quo ? ” Nazki said .
A few of the sections of tonight 's Comment , below .
But first I did wish to make brief responses to two topics that have been much discussed here and elsewhere .
Primarily , there is no " deal " between MSNBC and Fox over what we can and cannot cover .
This is part of a continuing strategy of blackmail by Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes , that reaches back to 2004 , and has as its goal the cancellation of " Countdown . "
This stuff has ebbed and flowed for five years , it 's part of my daily job to push it back with whichever strategy I think will best work at a given moment .
For the last two months I 've been employing " News Jujitsu . "
If you watch tonight and catch the references to Fox and its rogues gallery you will know that the most recent tack has worked , but the fight is endless and there will be reversals in the future , I 'm sure .
Ailes himself is tonight quoted as saying he tried to ' broker peace ' by restraining his hosts .
This is the same Ailes who insisted he would never interfere with what Bill O'Reilly said on the air .
Even naked hypocrisy is not too much if Fox can make itself seem victimized , or can muzzle dissent .
But there is no " deal . "
I would never consent , and , fortunately , MSNBC and NBC News would never ask me to .
As to Richard Wolffe I can offer far less insight .
I honor Mr. Greenwald 's insight into the coverage of GE / NewsCorp talks , and his reporting on Richard 's other jobs .
I must confess I was caught flat - footed .
I do not know what the truth is ; my executive producer and I have spent the last two months dealing with other things ( see above ) but what appears to be the truth here is certainly not what Richard told us about his non-news job .
I am confident his commentary to this point has not been compromised - he has been an insightful analyst and a great friend to this show - but until we can clarify what else he is doing , he will not be appearing with us .
I apologize for not being able to prevent this unhappy set of circumstances from developing .
Now , to the Comment :
PBS pointed out that the health and insurance industries are spending more than a million , 400 thousand dollars a day , just to destroy the " public option " - the truly non-profit , wieldy , round - up and not round - down , government , from helping you pay your medical bills with about a billionth of the recklessness with which it is still paying Halliburton and its spinoffs to kill your kids .
And much of this money is going to , and through , Republicans .
But that 's the real point tonight .
Not all of it is going through Republicans ...
I will go into detail about the contributions from these industries to the familiar villains like Senator McConnell and Senator Thune and Congressman Barton .
And , the Democrats :
Congressman Mike Ross of Arkansas .
Leader of the Blue Dogs in the House .
You 're the guy demanding a guarantee that Reform wo n't add to the deficit .
I 'm guessing you forgot to demand that about , say , Iraq .
You 're a Democrat , you say , Congressman ?
You saw what Sandy Barham said ?
Sandy Barham is 62 years old , she 's got a bad heart , and she 's hoping her valves will hold together for three more years until Medicaid kicks in , because she can't afford insurance .
Not just for herself , mind you .
For her employees .
She needs the public option .
So do those six people who work at that restaurant of hers , Congressman Ross .
And why should you give a crap ?
Because Sandy Barham 's restaurant is the Broadway Railroad Café , and it is at 123 West First Street North in Prescott , Arkansas .
Prescott , Arkansas , Congressman Ross .
Your home town .
You are Sandy Barham 's congressman .
Hers , Sir. Not Blue Cross 's and Blue Shield 's , even if they do insure 75 percent of the state and they own you .
Mr. Baucus gets his , and Mr. Tanner , and Mr. Gordon .
And then they all get a reminder of who they are supposed to be working for .
Researchers studying how to improve graduation rates at public colleges and universities have come up with a surprising and counter - intuitive finding :
Many students may fail to complete a bachelor 's degree not because the work is too hard — but because they 're not challenged enough .
It 's well known that colleges with the most selective admissions criteria tend to have the highest graduation rates .
But even when researchers compared groups of students who had similar academic qualifications , they consistently found that those attending schools with the more demanding academic requirements were more likely to graduate .
BEST VALUE COLLEGES : Top 100 for 2009
BEYOND RANKINGS : Signs of student engagement
HIGHER ED : More on grad rates at public universities
" There is a net effect related to selectivity that is powerful , " says Princeton University president emeritus William Bowen , lead author of Crossing the Finish Line : Completing College at America 's Public Universities , out today .
While everybody does better at stronger schools , " the difference in outcomes … is greater for minorities than for other people , " he says .
The book is based on detailed data for 21 flagship public universities and four statewide higher education systems ; it explores how the USA might close gaps in college completion rates — a goal embraced by President Obama as a way to increase the nation 's economic competitiveness .
The research focuses on public higher education , where more than 75 % of students enroll , because part of the mission of public institutions is to serve as an engine of opportunity .
The findings underscore age - old advice : Students should enroll in the most selective college that will admit them .
But the problem is not that qualified students are being rejected from academically demanding schools .
" They never apply in the first place , " Bowen says .
And the research found that those aiming too low were most likely to be minorities , low - income students and those whose parents never finished college .
The researchers recommend more effective counseling of high school students as they consider their college options .
Also , " We need to understand better why students at more selective places graduate in larger numbers , " Bowen adds .
" We think we know some reasons .
One is peer effects .
A second is expectations .
If you go to a place where the assumption is that everybody is going to graduate … you do n't want to be the person who falls behind . "
Molly Corbett Broad , president of the American Council on Education , a non-profit group for college presidents , says the research " tells us that there is potential to improve educational attainment ( rates ) if we step up to the issues that are standing in the way . "
A papermaker dedicated to preserving traditional Western and Japanese techniques ; a scientist developing theories of global climate change ; and a journalist who helps uncover details of unsolved murders from the civil rights era are among the 24 recipients of the $ 500,000 “ genius awards , ” to be announced on Tuesday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation .
While many of the fellows are known mostly among their peers , others  especially those in the arts  have won renown .
They include Edwidge Danticat , a 40 - year - old writer who has won critical acclaim with her depictions of Haitian immigrants in works like the novel “ The Farming of Bones ” and the memoir “ Brother , I ’m Dying . ”
“ It felt incredibly , wonderfully surreal , ” Ms. Danticat said in a telephone interview from Miami .
“ What artists crave and need most is time .
It will definitely buy some time .
It ’s wonderful to have a sense of security , especially in these economic times . ”
This year ’s MacArthur fellows range in age from 32 to 69 and are evenly divided between men and women .
As in years past , most live on the East or West Coasts , but a photojournalist is based in Turkey and an infectious - disease physician in Sudan .
All will receive $ 100,000 a year for five years , no strings attached .
Since the inception of the program in 1981 and including this year ’s fellows , 805 people ranging in age from 18 to 82 at the time of their selections have been named .
An online poll enquiring as to the possible existence of God has somewhat backfired on Christian outfit The Alpha Course , with 98 per cent of the popular vote currently saying he does n't :
According to the Sun , The Alpha Course kicked off a multi-million pound advertising campaign back in September to promote its particular road to enlightenment , described as " an opportunity for anyone to explore the Christian faith in a relaxed setting " .
The poster and ad drive was a response to a Humanist Society campaign last year suggesting there was " probably no God " - a view shared by the vast majority of the 154,500 online votes at time of publication .
The Humanist Society insists the poll has " backfired " , while The Alpha Course reckons it 's the victim of an online sting .
Spokesman Mark Elsdon - Dew added : " I do n't think this is indicative of people 's faith in this country . "
The Alpha Course is endorsed by daredevil TV bloke Bear Grylls ( seen in the screen grab ) .
Grylls is no stranger to exploring in a relaxed setting , having been rumbled for bunking down in hotels during the filming for his Channel 4 show when he was supposed to be kipping in the gutted carcass of a polar bear he'd killed with his bare teeth . ®

The confident womanizer has become a common favorite character in many TV shows , especially in the comedy circuit .
Despite treating women like sex objects and generally being degrading , these characters have become the antiheroes of comedy pulling laughs out of unprotected sex , broken hearts , clinically depressed women , threesomes and broken homes .
Here ’s the top 10 …
1 ) Fonzie ( Happy Days )
Hands down , the number one TV womanizer of all time has to be none other than The Fonz from Happy Days .
The proof of all of Fonzie ’s powers can be seen in this clip where he single - handedly saves the day and gets the babe in just a couple minutes .
Apparently the key to getting all the girls is being a gang - related , leather jacket - wearing , high school drop - out .
Surprisingly , actor Henry Winkler was nothing like the stud he played on camera .
According to him , “ The Fonz was everybody I was n’t .
He was everybody I wanted to be . ”
2 ) Charlie Harper ( Two and a Half Men )
Of all the womanizers on our list , none are as undeservingly irresistible as Charlie Harper .
All types of women , even those that he ’s offended in the past , are eventually captivated by his charm - almost as if by magic .
Harper may be a magnet for short relationships and booty calls in Two and a Half Men , but actor Charlie Sheen ’s womanizing does n’t end when the camera ’s stop rolling .
When asked about the most number of women he had had sex with , Sheen replied , “ … five girls at once …all six people in that room came out of it pretty satisfied . ”

It ’s no secret that Al Bundy from Married With Children gets away with a lot of misogynistic comments and trash talking towards women - especially fat ones .
Here we have a compilation of the many insults he ’s gotten away with .
NO MA’AM
Another reason Al Bundy is placed high on our list is for founding his misogynistic club “ National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood ” ( or NO MA’AM for short ) .
As seen in this clip , somehow bashing the opposite sex does n’t interfere with supermodel - type women obeying his every command .
Bundy , you dog .

4 ) Sonny Corinthos ( General Hospital )
As bi-polar Mob boss Sonny Corinthos is , he sure knows how to get chicks .
Since his character was written in in 1993 , he ’s had 3 wives and 11 ex-lovers - 4 of which have died due to his dangerous lifestyle .
You ’d have to be crazy to put up with Sonny .
Fortunately for him , most women he runs into turn out to be .
Take , for example , this scene with his ex-fiancee ’s cousin Olivia Falconeri ; their heated argument turns into a make - out session .
Actor Maurice Benard , who really is bi-polar in real life , stated the following an interview with Oprah :
“ When I let it be known I was bipolar , [ the writers ] wrote it into the character . ”

5 ) Dr. Christian Troy ( Nip / Tuck )
Former patients , sex addicts , therapists , strippers , babysitters , and even mother and a daughter duos have all had past sexual relations with Dr. Christian Troy .
Ordinarily , any guy who is caught cheating on his girlfriend in his bedroom suffers severe punishment .
Christian , on the other hand , turns the predicament into a threesome in the above clip from Nip / Tuck .
In an interview with USA Today Julian McMahon commented on his character boasting , “ Without a doubt I ’ve had the most sex scenes in any television show , ever . ”
He ’s even had a sex scene with Rosie O’ Donnell ; a clip you ’ll just have to look up on your own time .
6 ) Barney Stinson ( How I Met Your Mother )
Creator and screenwriter Craig Thomas describes Barney as “ a pretty fragile character who ’s really afraid of being alone . ”
Though , you would n’t know it from most of his sexist scenes on How I Met Your Mother .
Neil Patrick Harris could n’t be more of a jerk to the women that come to his apartment .
Neil , who is actually gay in real life , has had over 200 one - night stands in the course of the show , yet remains as one of the most likable characters .
His code of manhood dubbed “ The Bro Code ” includes rules like the following :
“ XVII .
When out with the guys , never accept a call from your girlfriend — unless she ’s dying or trapped under a burning fuel truck , and if that ’s the case , make it quick . ”

7 ) Archie Bunker ( All In The Family )
All In The Family aired just years after the Women ’s Liberation movement took place in the late 1960 ’s and reflected the times by having TV’s “ most lovable bigot ” Archie Bunker as one of the main characters .
In this classic scene Archie is shocked by the idea of equal pay .
You would n’t know it from watching a single episode , but Carroll O’Connor ( who played Archie ) was in fact a liberal and an English teacher .
Concerning the character he played , he commented in an interview :
“ I never heard Archie ’s kind of talk in my own family .
My father was a lawyer … in partnership with two Jews …
There were black families in our circle of friends .
My father disliked talk like Archie ’s – he called it lowbrow . ”
8 ) The Entire Cast Of Mad Men
Just one character out of this show would n’t be enough of an example to show how obviously sexist Mad Men is .
Stories and history lessons about inequality in the workplace can’t compare to seeing it on screen .
Nearly every male character , no matter how big or small , is a womanizer in each episode .
The Gynecologist
The ’60s was certainly a strange time to be in the medical field .
Birth control pills were taboo for unmarried women and it was n’t uncommon for a doctor to smoke .
When Peggy visits the gynecologist for her first ( and last ) time during the show , the help that she gets might as well be sexual harassment .
Pete
All throughout the first season , Pete certainly has a shitty way of showing Peggy how he likes her .
Here ’s the classic moment when they first met - who knew they ’d be hooking up later that night ?

9 ) Joey ( Friends )
Joey is perhaps the most likable skirt chaser on TV due to his dimwitted charm and humor .
Sure he ’s a womanizer , but he ’s too dumb to know it .
In this compilation of his famous catchphrase “ How You Doin ’ ? ” it ’s easy to see that Joey ’s libido has no off button .
In real life Friends actor Mat LeBlanc certainly has a way with women as well .
According to a NBC interview about he revealed that he once seduced two stewardesses and convinced them to take him in as a roommate when he first moved to New York City .

10 ) Chuck Bass ( Gossip Girl )
Chuck Bass is the ultimate parent - less wild child .
After both of his parents died leaving him in charge of a billion - dollar company he devotes most of his time to being a jerk , throwing lavish parties , and hitting on girls - all usually at the same time .
If the secret to getting babes is throwing insults at girls , then then Chuck Bass is probably the most attractive guy in Gossip Girl .
Sure , he can be a giant jerk most times , but he eventually grows a heart large enough to profess his love for his girlfriend Blair .
For this reason Chuck is at the bottom of our list .

Living together helps cut your resource consumption ( Image : Jeffrey Hamilton / Getty )
Looking for a romantic way to do your bit for the planet ?
Then move in with your lover , take baths together and snuggle up on the sofa to watch TV together .
An awful lot of energy could be saved if only people shared things more , especially their homes .
The evidence comes from the opposite end of the love spectrum .
According to a recent study , if all the couples who divorced in the US had stayed together , in 2005 alone they would have used 2373 billion litres less water and 73 billion kilowatt - hours less electricity .
Each divorced person spent 46 per cent more on electricity and 56 per cent more on water .
 In 2005 alone , divorced people in the US used an extra 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity 
Divorce , along with the demise of the extended family , is helping to drive the growth in the number of households , which is accelerating faster than the global population .
The good news is that remarriage reduces consumption to pre-divorce levels .
Of course , you do n’t have to pop the question – living together or sharing with friends works too .
After your home , perhaps the next most important thing to share is your car .
Lift - sharing schemes can help you find someone who does the same journey as you .
And if you do n’t need to drive every day , you could swap your car for membership of a car - sharing scheme , a form of car rental .
Studies indicate that if you hire a car only when you need it , rather than owning one , you ’ll drive a lot …
( CNN ) -- Federal authorities are moving to rein in the man dubbed " America 's Toughest Sheriff " after complaints that immigration raids by his deputies amounted to unconstitutional roundups of Latinos .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio supervises an inmate relocation in Phoenix , Arizona .
Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the Maricopa County , Arizona , sheriff 's department have had an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security since 2007 that allows his department to enforce federal immigration laws .
But Arpaio says the federal agency is moving to revise the agreement to limit that power to checking the immigration status of inmates already in his Phoenix jail .
Arpaio has cultivated his image as " America 's Toughest Sheriff , " a nickname earned by his treatment of Maricopa County inmates .
Many of his prisoners are housed in tents and forced to wear pink underwear , and he once boasted of feeding them on less than a dollar a day .
' Latino in America ' The Latino population is set to nearly triple by 2050 .

Now he faces a Justice Department investigation into allegations of civil rights abuses , and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona is suing the sheriff over immigration raids conducted by his department .
The class - action lawsuit alleges that Arpaio has abused the power delegated to him under his agreement with Homeland Security , known as the 287 ( g ) program .
" He 's unconstitutionally acted to racially profile many persons in the community , persons who appear or are Latino , " ACLU lawyer Dan Pochoda told CNN .
Pochoda said the five - term sheriff has launched a series of high - profile raids to appeal to " his anti-immigration base . "
Arpaio told CNN's " American Morning " the allegations were " garbage " and said he would continue to use state laws to crack down on undocumented immigrants in his county .
" We do not go on street corners and grab people that look like they 're from another country , " he said .
" Pursuant to our duties , when we come across illegals , we take action . "
Watch what Arpaio has to say »
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who was Arizona 's governor before taking her Cabinet post , told CNN that Arpaio is reacting prematurely to decisions that have not yet been finalized .
But Arpaio says he's now become the poster boy of the emotionally charged immigration debate and is losing authority for political reasons .
" They do n't want to aggravate the Hispanic community , aggravate the businesspeople who hire the illegals , and they want amnesty , " he said .
Arpaio said he planned to continue his operations " with no changes . "
" We do enforce traffic violations .
All law enforcement does that , and comes across some serious criminals , which we do in our crime suppression , " he said .
" We go into workplaces under the state law , and we arrest people in the workplace there illegally with identity theft situations and human smuggling . "
But according to a 2008 policy report on effective law enforcement by the Goldwater Institute , a libertarian - leaning watchdog group based in Phoenix , Arpaio 's department " falls seriously short of fulfilling its mission . "
The report found that Maricopa County has " diverted resources away from basic law - enforcement functions to highly publicized immigration sweeps , which are ineffective in policing illegal immigration . "
CNN Correspondent Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report .

And it was good : The Book of Genesis Illustrated by R. Crumb includes the biblical stories of Noah 's ark and Adam and Eve in its depiction of all 50 chapters .
Behold !
Robert Crumb has found God , or at least a hint of what he looks like .
" It was hard to draw God , " the reclusive cartoonist says about his latest project , which begins at the Beginning , with Creation itself .
" Should God just be a bright light ?
Should I use word balloons ?
Should God be a woman ? "
Crumb says the answer came to him in a dream .
" I ended up with the old stereotypical Charlton Heston kind of God , long beard , very masculine .
I used a lot of white - out , a lot of corrections when I tried to draw God . "
With a mixture of anticipation and anxiety , the art world has been awaiting Crumb 's long - rumored illuminated manuscript , a four - year , monastic - like effort to adapt every word of the first book of the Bible in distinctive pen and ink .
FAITH AND REASON : Crumb 's doubts are downright biblical
The result , The Book of Genesis Illustrated by R. Crumb ( $ 24.95 , W.W. Norton ) , out today , is a beautifully drawn and relentlessly faithful rendition of the first 50 chapters of the Bible by an apostle of the 1960s and sometimes profane progenitor of underground comics .
Crumb has produced what could be the ultimate graphic novel — using the Bible 's sacred text to retell the stories of Creation and Noah 's flood along with Sodom and Gomorrah , the family saga of Abraham and the collaboration of Joseph and Pharaoh .
Its 224 pages are sensual and violent , unblinking when it comes to incest and lust , and at times , like the Bible itself , mystifying .
" Nothing left out ! " shouts a cover blurb .
But those hoping for a spiritual journey of redemption — hippie artist finds salvation transcribing the Bible — will be disappointed .
" To take this as a sacred text , or the word of God or something to live by , is kind of crazy , " Crumb , 66 , says in a rare telephone interview from his home in southern France .
" So much of it makes no sense .
To think of all the fighting and killing that 's gone on over this book , it just became to me a colossal absurdity .
That 's probably the most profound moment I 've had — the absurdity of it all . "
Those are hardly the words of a modern - day St. Augustine or any of the Talmudic scholars , Christian commentators , historians or ordinary faithful who view the Bible as the Word of God and who accept its mysteries as the beginning , not the end , of enlightenment .
" If people of faith say what I 've done is blasphemous or profane , I 'd shrug my shoulders and say , ' I just illustrated what is there , ' " Crumb says .
" I 'm not ridiculing it , just illustrating the exact words that are there .
I restrained myself .
I really did n't want to make visual jokes about it .
I hope people see it for what it is . "
Many are surprised that Crumb , who in the 1960s infused comics with sex - and drug - addled characters like Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat , and catchphrases such as " Keep on truckin ' , " would this time play it so straight .
But the long - lapsed American Catholic depicts the shared roots of Judaism , Christianity and Islam without comment or his usual ironic judgment .
Each Crumb panel is a detailed biblical tableau , down to the endless " begats " that fill the pages with tiny portraits of tribal sons and desert chieftains .
" I 'm pleasantly surprised , and relieved , " says Rabbi Simcha Weinstein , a professor at Pratt Institute in New York City and author of Up , Up and Oy Vey , a history of the influence Jews had on the creation of superheroes .
" Crumb is a phenomenal talent , one of my sages , " he says .
" But he 's not always the sage I would like him to be .
There 's a little bit of danger in what Crumb does and I 'm glad he toned it down a bit .
I get nervous when it comes to Holy Scripture . "
Asked about Crumb 's dismissal of some of the early Bible tales as nonsensical , Weinstein laughs .
" I 'd love to have Bob to Sabbath dinner any time to begin explaining it to him .
The Bible is a complicated work and something the greatest minds of all time have cracked their heads against . "
A recluse in France Crumb , born in Philadelphia , began his career drawing playful greeting cards .
But his subversive , turn - of - the - century linework , untamed libido and obsessive social commentary made him in many ways as important a figure in the LSD - laced hippie era as Bob Dylan , Jerry Garcia or John Lennon .
His artist brother , Charles , committed suicide during the filming of Crumb , a 1994 documentary .
Crumb 's work with comic book writer Harvey Pekar laid the groundwork for the 2003 film American Splendor .
He has lived in France with his wife , cartoonist Aline Kominsky , and daughter since the 1990s .
" I 've lived here 18 years and still can't speak the language , " he says after his wife , whose voice on their answering machine is in perfect French , helped set up the interview .
Famously shy and reluctant to license his characters or encounter fans , Crumb asked that the name of the French village be withheld to deter pilgrimages .
" Unless there are pretty girls , " he says with a laugh .
A brief , five - stop U.S. tour is planned .
But no book signings : " Those are a nightmare . "
Biblical sources
As source material for Genesis , Crumb used the text of the King James Bible and a 2004 translation called The Five Books of Moses by scholar Robert Alter , who has praised Crumb 's effort as " bold . "
Alter 's translation of ancient Hebrew is sometimes surprising — Jacob 's ladder becomes Jacob 's ramp , for example — but rarely strays far from the traditional story lines of the Torah , the first five books of the Bible .
" Alter 's version is just very clear , " Crumb says .
" But I still retained some of the language of the King James version , things like , ' And behold ! '
If you take that stuff out , you lose some of the poetry . "
The project began as a satire on Adam and Eve , but Crumb got a " really good offer " to do a much larger take on the Bible .
He switched to research mode , delving into ancient Sumerian myths , North African cultures and obscure Hebrew translations .
Crumb is suspicious of the centuries of rewrites that have changed what " seems indeed to be an inspired work . "
The pivotal role of Abraham 's wife , Sarah , he believes , was downgraded by the priests of ancient times .
" Over the centuries , the stories of the matriarchal society of the Sumerians got all twisted around . "
But he says he " had to resist the urge to load it up with a lot of footnotes . "
Crumb calls the book " a straight illustration job " and says he relied on friends , experts , even Hollywood movies to come up with the look of the peoples , the clothing and the backgrounds .
" Isaac , " he says .
" is based on an old guy who lives near here who 's a Jew from Algeria . "
The Rev. James Martin , a Jesuit priest who writes about pop culture and who has seen excerpts of the book , says Crumb is only the latest artist to bring the Bible to a new generation .
" I just think it 's fantastic that a protean mind like R. Crumb is translating the Bible into a new language , a new idiom , " Martin says .
" Just as was done with the Vulgate ( a popularized translation in the fifth century ) or the Latin .
" Yes , there 's some stuff there that 's a little lascivious , but that 's R. Crumb .
The Bible is the world 's oldest soap opera , filled with sex , violence and rape , particularly the Old Testament . "
Like Rabbi Weinstein , Martin dismisses Crumb 's notion that the Bible makes no sense .
" Whenever you engage in God 's spirit , it 's a workout , " Martin says .
" Some of these stories are so familiar they 're like old coins that have been worn down .
There are no edges anymore .
So to see this in a new way is very important . "
Was the hand of God animating Crumb ?
" I do n't believe it 's the Word of God .
I believe it's the words of men , " Crumb says .
" I 'm just another human interpreting the story . "
And yet , could his choice to do the project in the first place reflect some kind of spiritual need ?
" That 's a good question , " he says .
" I 'm a spiritual guy .
I 'm not an atheist , more an agnostic .
I do n't doubt the existence of God , I just do n't quite know what God is .
It 's a question that will challenge me until the day I die . "
He laughs .
" I got totally sick of it by the end of it .
I 've come out exhausted , " Crumb says .
" I may never draw again . "

" ¡Se fue la luz ! " es una expresión que se escucha cada vez con mayor frecuencia en la ciudad de México .
¿ La causa ?
Los recurrentes apagones en el suministro de energía eléctrica , por la ineficacia y obsolescencia de una compañía del Estado , responsable de prestar el servicio en el centro del país .
Bien , pues esta frase , y un severo conflicto sindical interno , motivaron finalmente al Presidente de México , Felipe Calderón a emitir un duro y decisivo decreto para emprender la liquidación de la Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro , la noche del sábado 10 de octubre , mientras la mayoría de los mexicanos estaban ocupados en los festejos por la clasificación definitiva de la selección nacional de fútbol al mundial Sudáfrica 2010 , tras una contundente victoria contra El Salvador .
Más información El Gobierno de México liquida una eléctrica pública
El decreto de liquidación de la Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro es una decisión muy fuerte , que enfrentará por varios días al Gobierno del Presidente Calderón con el Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas ( SME ) , uno de los sindicatos más beligerantes del viejo régimen , y probablemente con varios actores de la izquierda y el movimiento sindical del país .
La Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro era la empresa estatal responsable de abastecer de energía eléctrica al centro del país .
Su cobertura corresponde al 1.04 % del territorio nacional , que sin embargo concentra un poco más el 30 % del PIB .
Corresponde a todo el Distrito Federal , a 82 municipios del vecino Estado de México , a 45 Municipios de Hidalgo , dos de municipio de Morelos y tres del Estado de Puebla .
La decisión se toma con el consenso social de que la empresa del Estado era obsoleta e ineficaz , en buena medida porque se encontraba prácticamente capturada por un sindicato muy fuerte , que había ganado constantemente poder , prerrogativas y privilegios absurdos , hasta llevar a la quiebra de la empresa que , hasta hoy , vivió prácticamente del subsidio del gobierno .
Los habitantes de la ciudad de México , un área metropolitana de más de 20 millones de personas , padecemos un pésimo servicio de energía eléctrica : apagones constantes , casi por cualquier causa , irregularidad en el voltaje que , por supuesto , lastiman frecuentemente aparatos eléctricos , cobros indebidos en los recibos de luz , postes viejos con riesgo de caerse , postes y materiales de reparación abandonados en calles y camellones , lentitud en el servicio de quejas y reparaciones , y burocracia y malos tratos en las oficinas de servicios y atención al cliente de la compañía de luz de la ciudad .
La ciudad está llena de " diablitos " .
Así llamamos a los cables e instalaciones ilegales , que se utilizan para robarse la luz .
Hay estimaciones oficiales que hablan de que más o menos el 30 % de la luz de la ciudad se pierde por robo o por ineficiencias en el suministro , cuando la media en el resto del país es inferior al 10 % , cifra que por demás , resulta muy alta en comparación con los parámetros de países desarrollados .
Según declaraciones del último director de la Compañía de Luz de la ciudad , más de 750.000 viviendas en el Distrito Federal se roban continuamente la luz .
Lo más curioso es que , en muchas ocasiones , quienes instalan los famosos " diablitos " son los propios trabajadores de la Compañía de Luz , mediante el pago de propinas y sobornos .
No podemos abandonar este apretado diagnóstico sin apuntar el tema del paisaje urbano de la ciudad , que está plagado de enredadas redes aéreas de cables , instalaciones y transformadores , que en algunas zonas se cruzan como verdaderas telas de araña , creando esculturas involuntarias , que sin duda harían la delicia de Calder , Giacometti , Miró o Jackson Pollock .
La empresa le costó al gobierno mexicano en 2003 , 21.000 millones de pesos ( unos 1.050 millones de euros ) , dicha cifra se duplicó en 2008 al costarle 42.316 millones de pesos ( unos 2.100 millones de euros ) .
De seguir esa tendencia , el gobierno se vería en la necesidad de aportar , en 2012 , unos 66.000 millones de pesos ( algo así como 3.300 millones de euros ) .
La situación era económicamente insostenible .
La Compañía de Luz y Fuerza del Centro , que sólo prestaba el servicio en el centro del país , contaba hasta hoy con cerca de 45.000 trabajadores en activo , cuando hay expertos que sostienen que puede funcionar con unos 15.000 trabajadores .
Además de que la empresa soporta , con gasto corriente , una nómina de 22.000 pensionados y jubilados , para los que no existen , ni se hicieron nunca , las reservas técnicas en un adecuado sistema de pensiones .
Era una empresa plagada de absurdos de improductividad , falta de competitividad y abuso .
Ecos del México autoritario y populista , que la democracia no atina y no termina por desterrar .
Daremos algunos ejemplos , en el entendido de que lo que a continuación describiremos es parte de la realidad , aunque usted no lo crea ...
Los trabajadores de la empresa tenían hasta el 10 de octubre , un contrato colectivo de trabajo con una rígida cláusula que prohibía la multifuncionalidad ¿ Qué es eso ?
Que no podían realizar dos funciones distintas .
Si un trabajador es chofer , no podía detener una escalera .
Eso generaba que mientras un camión de reparaciones en el resto del país llevaba en promedio dos personas , uno en la ciudad de México debía llevar de siete a nueve personas .
Además , de que claro , si no llega el chofer , el camión con todos los demás trabajadores no podía salir a trabajar .
Otro ejemplo , el sindicato había conquistado una especie de autarquía .
Hasta su liquidación , en la empresa laboraban algo así como 10.000 trabajadores que no trabajaban propiamente en funciones de luz , sino que se dedican a tareas diferentes como , elaborar su propia ropa , los bordados de sus uniformes , incluso algunos muebles , que la empresa se veía obligada a comprar al sindicato .
Dos más , los trabajadores y sus familias no pagan la luz que consumen porque es una de sus prestaciones , y los trabajadores tenían la posibilidad de obtener un permiso anual , con goce de sueldo , de hasta diez meses .
Sí leyó usted bien , de hasta diez meses .
Esta realidad creó una mafia sindical con mucho dinero y poder , que hasta la fecha apoyó y patrocinó los más variados grupos y movimientos .
El SME se caracterizó por ser un sindicato de abusos y dispendios .
Para no ir mas lejos , la semana pasada , en plena crisis , el líder del sindicato inauguró un gimnasio con tres niveles de estacionamiento , con una cancha de básquetbol con duela importada de China y certificada por la NBA de EU , que costó 103 millones de pesos ( unos 5.125.000 euros )
Era realmente una empresa kafkiana , que evoca las peores épocas de las industrias soviéticas o las viejas empresas de Europa del Este .
Es como si la viéramos en una televisión en blanco y negro .
Bien , pues este amasijo de improductividad entró en crisis hace unos días .
Un conflicto electoral interno , por una cerrada votación entre dos planillas , una encabezada por el actual líder Martín Esparza y la otra por su Tesorero Alejandro Muñoz , ocasionó que el Secretario del Trabajo , Javier Lozano Alarcón , le negara al sindicato el registro y la personalidad jurídica , y con ello se detonara un conflicto que recién inició movilizaciones el viernes de la semana pasada .
El punto central por supuesto no era el conflicto laboral interno del sindicato .
El tema de fondo era la improductividad y lo costoso de la empresa .
El Presidente Calderón , a unas semanas de iniciar la segunda mitad de su administración , y debilitado después de una gran derrota electoral en la elecciones del pasado 2 de julio , enfrentaba la necesidad de tomar decisiones muy delicadas .
La crisis económica y presupuestal en México obligan al gobierno a emprender recortes y ajustes que impiden sostener el ritmo de subsidios y la improductividad de la empresa estatal que suministra la energía eléctrica en el centro del país .
La opinión estaba dividida .
Había quienes creían que estaban dadas las condiciones y que este es el mejor momento para tomar la decisión de liquidar la empresa , liquidar a los trabajadores y empezar con una empresa nueva , saneada y con un nuevo sindicato y con nuevas reglas de productividad .
Y por otro lado , había quienes consideraban que se trataba de un mal momento y que sería irresponsable emprender una decisión de este tipo , que seguramente generaría movilizaciones y conflictos sociales , en un entorno marcado por el incremento de la pobreza en el país y por los altos índices de desempleo , que han creado un clima de desencanto y de enojo social .
Finalmente el Presidente Calderón optó por tomar la decisión .
Era una decisión analizada , esperada y muy anunciada .
Absolutamente congruente con el discurso que , con motivo del tercer informe de gobierno , pronunció el Ejecutivo 2 de septiembre pasado , cuando dijo : " Ante la disyuntiva de administrar lo logrado y de seguir con el impulso propio de la inercia , o asumir cambios profundos en las instituciones de la vida nacional , claramente me inclino por un cambio sustancial de las mismas , con todos los riesgos y con todos los costos que implica . "
La decisión tomada es clave para el gobierno de Calderón , para la democracia y para el Estado .
El nudo de la transición mexicana está centrado en la crítica de que los gobiernos de la democracia no se atreven a enfrentar y desmantelar los enclaves autoritarios del viejo régimen , que se defienden y resisten a desaparecer , y que los gobiernos de la alternancia se limitan simplemente a tolerarlos y administrarlos .
Calderón da un giro muy importante con esta decisión .
Se enfrenta finalmente a los intereses duros del pasado .
La decisión de Calderón se antoja compleja .
Seguramente vendrán días de enfrentamientos , presiones y movilizaciones .
La mañana del domingo 11 amanecieron tomadas por efectivos de la policía federal , 113 instalaciones de la compañía de luz y en la asamblea del SME celebrada en el centro de la ciudad el último líder del SME anunció las primeras acciones de resistencia .
Es un momento de prueba para Calderón y para la democracia .
Lo cierto es que , una vez tomada la decisión , el Presidente , no puede darse el lujo de titubear , negociar y de dar marcha atrás , porque en ese momento se acaba políticamente su gobierno , con un gran daño a la autoridad y a la legitimidad de la democracia .
Margaret
Thatcher recuerda un momento similar en sus memorias Los años de Downing Street , en las que recordando el 10 de octubre de 1980 señala :
" El paro superaba los dos millones y seguía aumentando ; teníamos por delante una recesión de creciente profundidad ; la inflación era mucho más alta que la heredada , aunque estaba comenzando a bajar ; y estábamos terminando un verano de filtraciones y desavenencias .
El gobierno estaba preocupado y yo también .
Nuestra estrategia era la adecuada pero el precio de aplicarla estaba siendo demasiado alto , y la comprensión de lo que estábamos llevando a cabo era tan limitada que teníamos grandes dificultades electorales .
Pero estaba profundamente convencida de una cosa : no existía la posibilidad de lograr ese fundamental cambio de la actitud imprescindible para sacar a Gran Bretaña de su deterioro , si la gente estaba dispuesta a cambiar el curso de los acontecimientos mediante presiones .
Para aclarar ese aspecto apelé a unas líneas de Ronnie Millar : Para quienes esperan sin aliento la expresión " viraje en U " , tan sobada por la prensa , sólo me cabe decirles una cosa : " Viren ustedes si les apetece .
La Dama no es partidaria de los virajes . "
Para Felipe Calderón tampoco existe viraje en U. El Presidente se juega su sexenio .
Hoy enfrenta una gran oportunidad y por supuesto un grave riesgo .
Seguramente otros enclaves autoritarios se sentirán amenazados y habrá resistencias , pero es tiempo de que la democracia y las leyes , sustituyan al autoritarismo y a los arreglos informales .
Calderón tomó una decisión difícil , que además era indispensable , porque , al terminar de escribir este artículo , se lo ruego , créame : ¡ Se fue la luz !
We must put pressure on Perry to release all information dealing with the Willingham execution .
Rick Perry is continuing to hide information and cover up whether Texas executed an innocent person .
The same information that Perry is now refusing to release has been released before .
In 2003 , there was an article by Alan Berlow in The Atlantic ( " Texas Clemency Memos " ) that discussed and contained copies of execution day memos sent to Governor George W Bush from his staff , including many written by his legal counsel Alberto Gonzales .
According to Berlow :
Gonzales never intended his summaries to be made public .
Almost all are marked CONFIDENTIAL and state , " The privileges claimed include , but are not limited to , claims of Attorney - Client Privilege , Attorney Work - Product Privilege , and the Internal Memorandum exception to the Texas Public Information Act . "
I obtained the summaries and related documents , which have never been published , after the Texas attorney general ruled that they were not exempt from the disclosure requirements of the Public Information Act .
Call Perry 's office at 512 463 1782 and demand that he release all information .
Sent him an email through his website here .
Sign the petition to Governor Rick Perry and the State of Texas to acknowledge that the fire in the Cameron Todd Willingham case was not arson , therefore no crime was committed and on February 17 , 2004 , Texas executed an innocent man .
Excerpt from the Chronicle :
In a letter sent Feb. 14 , three days before Willingham was scheduled to die , Perry had been asked to postpone the execution .
The condemned man 's attorney argued that the newly obtained expert evidence showed Willingham had not set the house fire that killed his daughters , 2 - year - old Amber and 1 - year - old twins Karmon and Kameron , two days before Christmas in 1991 .
On Feb. 17 , the day of the execution , Perry 's office got the five - page faxed report at 4:52 p.m. , according to documents the Houston Chronicle obtained in response to a public records request .
But it 's unclear from the records whether he read it that day .
Perry 's office has declined to release any of his or his staff 's comments or analysis of the reprieve request .
A statement from Perry spokesman Chris Cutrone , sent to the Chronicle late Friday , said that “ given the brevity of ( the ) report and the general counsel 's familiarity with all the other facts in the case , there was ample time for the general counsel to read and analyze the report and to brief the governor on its content . ”
A few minutes after 5 p.m. , defense lawyer Walter M. Reaves Jr. said he received word that the governor would not intervene .
At 6:20 p.m. Willingham was executed after declaring : “ I am an innocent man , convicted of a crime I did not commit . ”
Summaries of gubernatorial reviews of execution cases previously were released as public records in Texas , most recently under former Gov. George W. Bush .
Yet Perry 's office has taken the position that any documents showing his own review and staff discussion of the Willingham case are not public — a claim the Chronicle disputes .
Plan to attend the 10th Annual March to Abolish the Death Penalty on October 24 in Austin at the Texas Capitol .
We plan to deliver the petition that day .
Members of Todd Willingham 's family are expected to attend the march and rally .
Todd Willingham was executed for arson / murder on February 17 , 2004 .
He professed his innocence from his arrest until he was strapped down on the execution gurney .
Now , we know for certain that he was telling the truth .
On August 25 , 2009 , Dr Craig Beyler , the investigator hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission to review the Willingham case , released his report in which he found that “ a finding of arson could not be sustained ” by a scientific analysis ( Read the report here ) .
He concluded that the fire in the Willingham case was accidental and not arson .
In fact , there was no arson , so there was no crime .
Texas executed an innocent person .
The proven execution of an innocent person should mean the end of the death penalty in the United States .

[ Edit2 : the first virals begin to pop as well , here ’s the first good one , thanks Allison for the heads up , and to the dancing kid we just want to say : do not worry , the world loves you and poobear , and I now know what moves I will be breaking at the next wedding party , so stay pretty and cool ]
However , the most interesting results of our whole Gnarls research are by far their dress up photos .
Because let ’s face it , dressing up as your favorite movie characters , what could be more fun ?

Capping a remarkable year for slain San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill to create a state day of recognition for Milk , making him only the second Californian , after naturalist John Muir , to receive the honor .
The governor signed the measure late Sunday along with new laws to help gay and lesbian people in the state , including a measure giving same - sex couples legally married in other states all the rights of marriage in California .
While the governor vetoed the bill honoring Milk last year , President Obama 's awarding Milk the Presidential Medal of Freedom and an Academy Award - winning film about Milk 's life moved Schwarzenegger to sign the bill , spokesman Aaron McLear said .
" The bill is symbolic of the importance of the gay community to California , which is why he signed it , " McLear said , adding that Schwarzenegger wanted to " honor that community . "
It is the only such day of recognition for a gay or lesbian person in the United States .
The measure was among 478 bills signed by Schwarzenegger on Sunday , the deadline for him to act on legislation passed by the Legislature before its session ended Sept. 11 .
The governor vetoed 229 bills .
Milk , one of the first openly gay people elected in the United States , and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were shot and killed by Dan White , a former supervisor , at City Hall on Nov. 29 , 1978 .
The measure mandates that the governor proclaim each May 22 as Harvey Milk Day in the state , to coincide with Milk 's birthday .
It will not be a state holiday .
The bill signed by Schwarzenegger encourages public schools in the state to conduct lessons " remembering the life of Harvey Milk , recognizing his accomplishments and familiarizing pupils with the contributions he made to this state . "
Formal recognition of Milk and the action on out - of - state same - sex marriage add to Schwarzenegger 's legacy of having approved more legislation expanding gay rights than any other governor in state or national history , despite his vetoes of bills to extend marriage rights to same - sex couples .
In August , Schwarzenegger accepted the nomination of Milk to the California Hall of Fame , to which he will be inducted in December .
Sen . Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , who authored the legislation declaring a day honoring Milk , praised the governor for his action , saying it was an idea " whose time had come . "
" This will go a long way to better inform Californians as to the nature of the civil rights struggle in the LGBT community , " Leno said .
The measure was backed by Equality California , the largest gay - rights organization in the state .
Geoff Kors , executive director of the group , said it would develop curriculum for schools and teachers to use on Milk 's birthday .
Schwarzenegger 's staff said the office heard from tens of thousands of people , for and against the bill .
The Campaign for Children and Families , which opposed the law , called it " the strongest impetus yet for loving parents to remove their children from anti-family public schools . "
In addition to the Milk bill , Schwarzenegger signed another Leno bill affecting same - sex couples legally married outside of California .
The measure ensures that couples who wed before the passage of Proposition 8 in November retain their status as " married , " while those who wed after the measure passed will retain all rights of marriage save the name .
That means married couples who move to California will not have to register as domestic partners to have their relationships recognized by the state .
The governor also signed a bill that will expand funding for domestic violence programs targeting the gay and lesbian communities .
He vetoed a measure to direct the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to consider sexual orientation and gender identity in the housing of inmates , which the governor said occurs already .
Schwarzenegger vetoed a measure allowing transgender people who have left the state to request a new birth certificate reflecting their change in gender .
He said a recent court ruling made that legal , making a law unnecessary .
Police forces across Canada , including the RCMP , OPP , are immediately changing their Taser use policy after the manufacturer issued a directive that officers should not aim the weapon at a suspect 's chest .
Taser International said in a bulletin that it's no longer advisable to aim the conducted energy weapon , which sends out a jolt of electricity , at a target 's chest area to avoid impact to the heart .
" [ W]e have lowered the recommended point of aim from centre of mass to lower centre of mass for front shots , " the company said in a new training bulletin .
Rather than the chest area , which could lead to electricity affecting the heart , the company said police officers should target the back , legs or abdomen .
The new directive comes as the two - year anniversary approaches of the death of Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski , who died Oct. 14 , 2007 at Vancouver International Airport .
Taser International is giving its closing submissions this week at the public inquiry headed by retired B.C. judge Thomas Braidwood , who is looking into the circumstances of Dziekanski's death .
Dziekanski , who was approached by four RCMP officers , died within minutes after he was jolted by an RCMP Taser .
A spokesman for the RCMP headquarters in Ottawa Friday said a directive has been sent out to officers to immediately avoid targeting a suspect 's chest and head .
Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Joe Bosie said Sunday that officers received a memo about the new policies last week .
" It makes sense , " said Bosie .
" Those probes or needles are very sharp and if you were to discharge a Taser in or above the heart area like the neck or eyes it could cause serious injury . "
While the latest Tasers are wireless , most others include barbed darts attached to wires that strike the victim , before delivering an electric jolt .
Toronto police said on Monday they adopted the new policy more than two weeks ago , when the manufacturer issued its bulletin .
Spokespersons for York , Peel and Durham regional police were unavailable to discuss the matter .
Vancouver police spokesman Const .
Lindsey Houghton said Sunday the municipal force has also received the new directive from Taser International .
" We immediately began advising and training officers to change where they aim from upper back or upper chest to lower centre of mass per the bulletin , " he said .
The Calgary and Winnipeg police forces have also advised their officers to lower their aim when using the Taser .
Taser International has strenuously denied at the public inquiry that the weapon was the direct cause of Dziekanski's death .
The 40 - year - old Dziekanski was on his first - ever flight from Poland to join his mother in Kamloops , B.C. when he was left lost and wandering at the airport for nearly 10 hours .

Police were summoned after a 911 call of reports that a distraught man was throwing furniture around the arrivals lounge .
Within 30 seconds of the RCMP surrounding Dziekanski , the weapon was deployed and fired five times , leaving Dziekanski writhing in agony on the ground .
In its training bulletin , the company said that by avoiding the chest area , it lessens the controversy about whether the jolts do or do not affect the heart .
The risk of a cardiac arrest after the weapon was deployed was " extremely low , " according to the company .
While Taser International noted sudden cardiac arrests can occur on " golf courses , in airports " or anywhere , the involvement of a Taser discharge at around the same time would place police officers and the company in a " difficult situation to ascertain what role , if any , " the Taser played , according to the bulletin .
B.C. Civil Liberties executive director David Eby said Sunday the weapon should be banned and that changing the targeted area on where to aim is not enough .
" We are disappointed that police have to wait for the company to issue a directive before making these changes , " said Eby .
" Admittedly that is a step towards limiting the use , but it's hard to imagine in what situation it makes sense to aim at a suspect 's back . "
In 2004 , Robert Wayne Bagnell , 44 , died after Vancouver police used a Taser on him , sending two electrical shocks to his chest .
His death was later cited as restraint - associated cardiac arrest due to acute cocaine intoxication .
Bagnell 's sister , Patti Gillman of Belleville , Ont. , has since become an advocate against the use of Tasers by police .
" Finally this is an acknowledgment from Taser that the weapon is n't as safe as they 've been claiming , " she said Sunday .
" Hopefully this will make police even more skeptical about using Tasers . "
Amnesty International says 330 people died in the United States after being jolted by stun guns between June 2001 and late 2008 .
In Canada , the human rights watchdog says at least 26 such deaths occurred from 2003 to 2008 .

We got a number of distressed emails about a recent piece in Details .
Possibly because the description read , " Getting tricked into fatherhood by a woman hell - bent on getting pregnant is much more common than you think . "
Good to know !

Deceptive , baby - hungry women have always been a staple of male - mythology ; punching a hole in a condom is the sort of thing we like to do between maxing out guys ' credit cards on shoes and sleeping with their best friends .
So it 's not shocking that this particular urban horror story should make the lad - mag rounds just in time for Halloween .
What is shocking and depressing is the number of women who the author brings in to bolster the story , making it seem as though it 's totally common practice and that deception is part of women 's acknowledged code of conduct .
" It 's not about trapping the guy , " Jody says .
" That 's kind of old - fashioned .
Yeah , you want him to be into it , but there are other ways to get a guy to commit .
If you 're smart and in a good relationship , it 's just about the fact that you want a kid . "
Even in her circle of young , urban , and gainfully employed friends , Jody says , this particular brand of subterfuge is n't exactly condemned the way one might expect .
In fact , it 's sort of , well , normal .
" I see and hear people talk about it , and I understand .
I get it , " she says , " and I do n't even think it 's that manipulative .
It 's more like , ' Hey , the timing is right for me .
I got pregnant - oops !
Well , it 's here , let 's have it . '
I think that 's more the way it is now than it was back in the day when you had to marry someone before you got pregnant .
Marriage does n't matter now . "

Then there 's alleged feminine " logic " like this :
" A lot of us feel like it 's not even really fair that men should get to vote , considering they could be 72 and , with a little Viagra , have another baby , " says Vicki Iovine , author of The Girlfriends ' Guide to Pregnancy .
" For us women , it 's really a limited window .
We know that boys who grow up to become men do n't necessarily want to be men .
They like to be boys .
And so women say , ' You know what ?
He 's gonna just have to snap out of it - and my pregnancy will be the thing to do it . ' "
The end , says Iovine , sometimes justifies the means .
" Any guy with a heart and soul , and preferably with a job , once he sees the baby on the sonogram or hears the heartbeat , will melt , " she says .

Wait - what ?
Do n't rope me in with these women who want to disenfranchise men because they 're ... fertile for longer ?
For every Cosmo- wielding nutter this guy dredged up ( and I 'd really like to see the email he sent out requesting quotes from " friends " ) he could have found ten thousand who found the idea not merely abhorrent , but insulting and frankly incomprehensible .
Of course , to the author it makes total sense :
The average cost of in vitro fertilization in the United States is $ 100,000 per baby - and insurance generally wo n't pay a cent .
Combine that with the shifting social mores about single motherhood and having kids outside of marriage , and you 've got a pretty good explanation for why some women , particularly ones in stable relationships , do n't see this as trickery at all - it 's more like a nudge .
Advertisement
What these " shifting social mores " are , he neglects to say .
Nor can he get a real read on the number of wily tricksters are out there , stealing men's sperm and then gouging them for money , because of the women who get preggers while on birth control , " there 's no way of knowing how much of that disparity can be explained away by " intentional " oversight , but that 's a big gap to chalk up to carelessness . "
Okay , first of all , there 's a reason the Ring has taken off , and it's not because a plastic disc in one 's vagina is so incredibly erotic .
The pill is an enormous pain in the ass , an expensive , distorting , side - effect - inducing millstone with no regard for travel schedules , the availability of doctor 's appointments , sleep , jet lag , pharmaceutical and insurance vagaries .
That 's 365 chances a year to screw things up .
And while , yes , theoretically , it works , the reality is never , ever that straightforward .
So save your insinuations , please .
Are there women who do this ?
I guess there are .
If you believe Glee , the world is full of deceitful women .
There are a lot of dishonest , desperate , screwed - up people out there who do all kinds of things .
But this is not , I repeat not , common or acceptable amongst women .
If anything , I think we 'd judge it more , not merely because it 's awful , but because we 've fought hard for birth control and reproductive rights and that was n't to entrap men into marriage .
Advertisement
I can understand that it must be hard for a man to surrender all control of this issue - believe us , it 's not so fun assuming the total responsibility , the chemical consequences , or the expense .
But there are such things as condoms .
A guy who claims he was tricked into impregnating his girlfriend ( he has no contact with the child , but does pay child support ) has sued his ex .
The case has been taken up by the National Center for Men , which calls it " Roe vs. Wade . . . for Men . "
No , see , that would be if men were legally denied the right to wear condoms .
But while I am , in fact , willing to believe this occasionally happens ( apparently , judging from the psychos quoted above ) it 's also , as the judge ruled , simply impossible to prove - and more to the point , a very slippery slope indeed in a world where many men are all too ready to duck their responsibilities .
And it 's irresponsible stories like this that perpetuate dangerous , offensive stereotypes and misconceptions .
For the vast , vast majority of us , having a baby is quite a big enough deal without adding deception and ruses to the mix .
Guys , wanna avoid this ?
Do n't sleep with someone crazy , because literally no one rational is pulling this .
Your DNA is not that appealing .
Oh , and wear a condom .
The needle thing is too obvious for most of us crazy baby - grubbers , anyway .

That Was No " Accident " [ Details ]
The figurine was dug up at the ancient site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey , which is thought to have been home for some of the world 's first farmers
A reclining man with a bushy beard and big nose is the latest to join a haul of stone figurines unearthed at the ancient site of Çatalhöyük in Turkey .
The sculpture , which measures around six inches high , was uncovered at the neolithic site last week .
Çatalhöyük was the final resting place of some of the world 's first farmers .
Other figurines representing farmyard animals and people in sitting and standing positions have already been excavated at the site , which dates back to the dawn of farming some 9,000 years ago .
Archaeologists working on the site have discovered primitive houses with rooms decorated with vulture skulls , wild boar tusks and teeth from weasels and foxes .
Some of the buildings are believed to have humans buried beneath them .
The discovery of female figurines at Çatalhöyük has led anthropologists to speculate that the community worshipped " mother goddesses " .
Death and violence feature prominently in the sculptures , with some missing heads and others with exposed ribs , hip bones and pelvises .
Address to Mut zur Ethik Conference , " Sovereignty or Imperialism , " Feldkirch , Austria , September 5 , 2009
There is a widespread supposition that Obama , being black and a member of an oppressed race , will imbue US foreign policy with a higher morality than the world experienced from Bush and Clinton .
This is a delusion .
Obama represents the same ideology of American " exceptionalism " as other recent presidents .
This ideology designates the United States as The Virtuous Nation and supplies the basis for the belief that America has the right , indeed the responsibility , to impose its hegemony upon the world by bribery or by force .
The claim of American exceptionalism produces a form of patriotism that blinds the US population to the immorality of America ’s wars of aggression .
Nothing is any different under Obama .
Obama has escalated war in Afghanistan ; started a new war in Pakistan ; tolerated or supported a military coup that overthrew the elected president of Honduras ; is constructing 7 new US military bases in Colombia , South America ; is going forward with various military projects designed to secure US global military hegemony , such as the Prompt Global Strike initiative that intends to provide the US with the capability to strike anywhere on earth within 60 minutes ; is working to destabilize the government in Iran , with military attack still on the table as an option ; supports America ’s new military African Command ; intends to encircle Russia with US bases in former constituent parts of the Soviet Union ; has suborned NATO troops as mercenaries in US wars of aggression .
How should Europe react ?
Europe should disassociate from the United States and go into active opposition to US foreign policy .
Europeans should demand that their governments withdraw from NATO as it serves no European interest .
The two aggressive militarist powers , the US and Israel , should be sanctioned by the UN and embargoed .
Instead , Europe is complicit in US and Israeli war crimes .
Because of the cold war , Europe is accustomed to following US leadership .
The financial convenience of the shelter provided by US military power negated independent European foreign policies .
In effect , Western European countries became US puppet states .
How does Europe escape from a subservient relationship of many decades ?
Not easily .
The US is accustomed to calling the shots and reacts harshly when it meets opposition .
For example , French opposition to Bush ’s invasion of Iraq brought about instant demonization of France by the US media and members of Congress .
The US government uses financial sanctions and threatened leaks of sensitive personal information gathered by its worldwide spy networks to discipline any independent - minded European leader .
Europe is essentially captive and forced to put US interests ahead of its own .
Consequently , unless Europeans find their courage and discard their servile status , Europe will be badgered into more wars and eventually led into a devastating war with Russia .
One European country can do little , but concerted action would be effective .
For example , why do not Europeans protest that the war criminal Tony Blair was given a post in the EU ?
The Obama administration ’s attitude towards self - determination and the sovereignty of the people is that these grand - sounding concepts are useful platitudes with which to mask the hegemonic interests of the US government .
US money and propaganda foment " velvet " or " color " revolutions that turn more countries into American puppet states .
The platitudes are useful also to disguise the overthrow of US civil liberties , such as habeas corpus , due process , and prohibitions against torture and preemptive arrest .
During the cold war era , one of the mainstays of US propaganda against the Soviet Union was the inability of Soviet citizens to travel within their country without the government ’s permission .
This indignity has now been inflicted upon US citizens .
As of September , 2009 , US citizens can no longer travel within their country by air without the permission of the Transport Security Administration .
The Obama administration has adopted the Bush administration ’s search procedures .
Under these rules travelers ’ computers , cell phones , and other devices can be seized for searches that can take up to 30 days .
If you are on your way to a meeting and your presentation is on your computer and your contacts ’ numbers are on your cell phone , you are out of luck .
" Terrorist threat " is the excuse for these Gestapo practices .
However , there have been no domestic acts of terrorism in 8 years .
The few " plots " that led to arrests were all instigated by FBI agents in order to keep the nonexistent threat alive in the public ’s mind .
Yet , despite the lack of any real terrorist threat the police state continues to gain ground .
Considering the extent of America ’s oppression of peoples abroad , one would expect much more blowback than has occurred , assuming that 9/11 was not itself an inside job designed to provide an excuse for America ’s wars of aggression in Afghanistan , Iraq , and Pakistan .
Europe must look beyond the empty American political rhetoric about " freedom and democracy " and recognize the emerging Brownshirt American State .
Democracy is slipping away from America .
Its place is being taken by an oligarchy of powerful interest groups , such as the financial sector , the military / security complex about which President Eisenhower warned , and AIPAC .
Political campaign contributions from interest groups determine the content of US domestic and foreign policy .
A country in which political elites are above the law and can violate with impunity both laws against torture and constitutional protections of civil liberties is not a free country .
American political leaders and the American people need Europe ’s help in order to avoid the degeneration of the American political entity .
American freedom , as well as sovereign independence elsewhere in the world , require criticisms of US foreign and domestic policies .
The US media , which was concentrated into a few hands during the Clinton administration , functions as a Ministry of Propaganda for the government .
It was the New York Times that gave credibility to the neoconservative propaganda and forged documents that were used to sell the invasion of Iraq to the public .
It was the New York Times that sat for one year on the evidence that the Bush administration was committing felonies by violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
It was not until after Bush was re-elected that the reporter was able to force his story through editorial opposition .
Americans need criticism from Europe to compensate for the absence of an independent American media .
Americans need outside help in order to reach an understanding of the immorality of their government ’s policies , because they receive no such help from their own media .
Without Europe ’s help , Americans cannot regain the spirit of liberty and tolerance bequeathed to them by their Founding Fathers .
America herself is a victim of the neoconservative and liberal internationalist pursuit of US hegemony .
We in America need to hear many voices telling us that it is self - defeating to become like an enemy in order to defeat an enemy .
As Germans learned under Hitler and Russians learned under Stalin , it is the internal enemy — the unaccountable elite that controls a country ’s government — that is the worst and most dangerous enemy .
If America has enemies who are against " freedom and democracy , " then America herself must make certain not to sacrifice her own civil liberties , and the sovereignty of other peoples , to a " war on terror . "
Acts of terror are a small cost compared to the cost of the erosion of civil liberties that took centuries to achieve .
Far more people died to achieve liberty than have died in terrorist attacks .

It ’s important to know the price before you agree to the procedure .
Often patients sit down for a routine cleaning and checkup , only to find they have a problem .
The dentist offers to take care of the situation on the spot , and the patient agrees  but then is socked with a surprising bill at the end of the visit .
That happened to Monica Gagnier of Beacon , N.Y. , on a recent visit to her Manhattan dentist for a twice - yearly cleaning .
Looking to save money , Ms. Gagnier was careful to tell the office when she made the appointment that she was n’t due to get X - rays and did n’t need to see the dentist for a checkup .
Without those two items , she figured she would save more than $ 100 on her bill .
During the cleaning , however , the hygienist told her that her gums were infected and she needed antibiotic shots .
Her total bill was $ 400 .
“ The antibiotics may well have been necessary , ” Ms. Gagnier said .
“ But what I hate is being hit by surprise costs and treatments when I ’m lying on my back , my mouth is wide open , and I ca n’t talk about it . ”
You should always be given an opportunity to discuss any treatment , sitting up , without equipment in your mouth , says Dr. Messina .
In addition , whenever you are facing an invasive dental procedure that is not an emergency , it makes sense to refuse treatment on the spot and get a second opinion , says Elizabeth Rogers , a spokeswoman for Oral Health America , a nonprofit advocacy and education group based in Chicago .
The range of prices on treatments like root canals , for instance , can easily differ by $ 1,000 or more .
SPREADING THE COST
Patients can often space out treatments or negotiate payment plans with the dentist for extensive work .
Working with the dentist on payments , says Dr. Mark Wolff , associate dean at the New York University College of Dentistry , is much better than putting the bill on your credit card and paying high interest .

When StarCraft II is released , it will have been over a decade since a game bearing its brand hit retail shelves , and if Diablo III does n't ship in 2010 -- which is likely -- it will share that distinction .
Developer Blizzard Entertainment is known for its relentlessly iterative process , which is what leads to the infamous " when it 's done " release mentality , and Diablo III is no exception .
Thought to have gone through several complete reboots since the closure of original series developer Blizzard North in 2005 , the game has already seen significantly redesigned elements since its formal unveiling last June .
To get a sense of how that design process works -- and when the team knows it 's actually done -- Gamasutra sat down with two Diablo development leads : lead technical artist Julian Love , a Blizzard North veteran , and lead content designer Kevin Martens , who spent nearly a decade at BioWare before coming to Blizzard .
The pair discussed Blizzard design and art philosophy , the evolution of the Blizzard North style , the action RPG genre , and Blizzard 's flat development structure .
Diablo III was announced last year ; it 's been playable twice at Blizzcon now .
Mike Morhaime suggested it probably wo n't be out until 2011 .
Does it feel like the development time has been extended to a surprising degree ?
Do you ever think , " Oh God , this really will be a while longer now ? "
Kevin Martens :
Here 's the secret to Blizzard games , and this is a secret that wo n't help any of our competitors : endless iteration .
We 'll take something , we 'll put it in the game .
Maybe we 'll like it when we put it in , maybe we wo n't .
We 'll leave it in there for a while , we 'll let it percolate .
We 'll play it and play it and play it , and then we 'll come back .
We might throw it all out , or we 'll throw half of that out and redo it .
It can be a long time , but it is fun to work on as well .
That 's the thing that keeps you going .
Multiplayer always works , and the builds are always playable .
We 've played them constantly , and it 's fun .
You actually look forward to the weekly play session even though the game is still in progress .
That 's what keeps us going , and that 's also why it takes so long .
We 'll do it over and over again until it 's just right .
With Diablo , and StarCraft moreso , it will have been a decade since there 's been a game in the series out .
Blizzard North as an entity no longer exists .
How do you determine what needs to be retained from something a decade old , and what needs to be modernized ?
Julian Love : Well , as an ex-Blizzard North employee , I never got the sense that we were a standalone entity .
We were always in contact with Blizzard South folks .
They were always coming up .
I think I saw it as we were one big company .
That said , [ as far as ] the real question in terms of how much we 're going to take forward , we want to bring back all of the stuff that was great , that was fun .
We certainly want to tap into what was great in the first two games and make sure all of that stuff is coming back , and pile in all the cool stuff we can to bring it over the top and make it the definitive version of the series .
On the topic of Blizzard North and Blizzard Entertainment though , I do feel there was a difference in style between the Blizzard North and South games .
The Diablo titles had a more baroque , intricate look , more tilework and stonework " along the grid . "
Diablo III is more of a blend of that style with the current Blizzard South style .
How long did it take you to settle on the look for Diablo III ?
Julian Love :
Well , it took a while for us to settle on the actual style , but I do n't think it was due any kind of difference between Blizzard North and Blizzard South philosophy .
It had more to do with the fact that we were moving the game from a two - dimensional technology platform to a three - dimensional technology platform .
Issues like lighting and separation between the characters and the backgrounds are handled in entirely different ways -- ironing out how to get what we felt was a Diablo vibe while still managing to get the characters to pop .
Looking at D2 , for instance , those characters are super bright , super colorful .
They pop out of the backgrounds .
So , we had to try to bring that forward , but at the same time we do n't want to just rest on that art style and do the exact same game .
We want to elevate that .
We 've got to look at the other games that Blizzard does , learn from the things that they 've done that make those games better , and really progress .
I think what you 're seeing in the art style is our idea of the actual progression of the Diablo universe .

A group of government - appointed drug experts will call for a nationwide network of " shooting galleries " to provide injectable heroin for hardened drug addicts across the country .
A pioneering trial programme prescribing heroin to long - term addicts has shown " major benefits " in cutting crime and reducing street sales of drugs .
Results of the programme are to be presented at a conference in London tomorrow .
An expert group set up by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse to assess the programme has concluded that the approach should be adopted nationwide .
The prescription of heroin to hardened addicts is one of the most controversial in medicine .
Giving addicts drugs such as heroin on a maintenance basis , rather than weaning them off them , turns existing policy on its head and presents a challenge to ministers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Critics say giving addicts the drugs they were previously scoring on the street is not " treatment " , and the cost at £ 15,000 a year per head cannot be justified when NHS patients are being denied the latest cancer drugs .
But addiction experts say this is about " harm reduction " , not cure .
Long - term heroin users are among the hardest addicts to treat and impose huge costs on the medical and penal systems .
Ten per cent of drug addicts commit three - quarters of all acquisitive crime in the UK , official figures show .
The existing government drugs strategy includes a commitment to roll out the clinics , subject to the findings of the trial programme .
The trial started three years ago and yielded benefits within months .
Early results showed crimes committed by the addicts dropped from about 40 to six a month , after six months of treatment .
A third of the addicts stopped using street heroin and the number of occasions when the rest " scored " dropped from every day to four to five times a month .
The programme was modelled on one in Switzerland where introduction of injecting - clinics " medicalised " heroin use , removing its glamour and transforming it from an act of rebellion to an illness requiring treatment .
Last year , Swiss voters backed the scheme in a referendum , proving it could be a vote - winner .
Similar clinics have also been established in France , Germany and Canada .
The first British injecting clinic , run by the Maudsley Hospital , opened on a south London high street in 2005 .
Heroin addicts who had failed on all other treatments and served repeated prison sentences for shoplifting and other crimes attended twice a day and received a dose of diamorphine ( pharmaceutical grade heroin ) which they injected themselves , under supervision .
Two further clinics were opened , in Darlington in 2006 and in Brighton in 2007 .
For the trial , 150 addicts received drugs at the clinics , one third of them heroin .
Their experience was compared with two other groups who received either oral or injectable methadone under the same conditions .
The strict rules allow no " take - away " from the clinics , to avoid the users selling their drugs on the streets .
All injections are witnessed at the clinic .
The approach introduces routine and drudgery by forcing the users to attend for their twice - daily fix .
There are an estimated 280,000 drug users in the UK , most taking heroin and crack cocaine , and about 2,500 deaths a year .
The scheme , targeted at the 3,000 to 6,000 long - term , hardcore addicts , operates seven days a week , 365 days a year .
Professor John Strang , head of the National Addiction Centre at the Maudsley , who led the study , said the findings had sent a ripple of excitement through the addiction treatment community , which is unused to seeing progress with hardcore heroin addicts .
He would not comment yesterday on the panel 's recommendations , but before , speaking about the early successes of the trials he said : " This is genuinely exciting news .
These are people with a juggernaut - sized heroin problem and I did n't know whether we could turn it around .
We have succeeded in people who looked as if their problem was unturnable , and we have done it in six months .
" It is ' intensive care ' for drug addicts , more expensive than standard treatment but a third of the cost of sending them to prison at £ 44,000 a year .
And they become re-addicted on release .
We are dealing with a profound drug hunger and trying to medicalise it to break the link with street heroin use and crime . "
War on drugs :
The liberal experiments
* BRITAIN
Doctors have been allowed to prescribe heroin since the 1920s but very few do so .
Most prefer to prescribe methadone , a heroin substitute , which is taken orally once a day .
Its effects are longer - lasting but duller .
Many addicts continue to buy heroin .
There are currently three " shooting galleries " operating across the country which may now be extended .
*SWITZERLAND
Throughout the mid-1990s the Swiss were at the forefront of trialling prescription heroin schemes and the country has seen a major reduction in crime and better rehabilitation success rates .
For years the main " shooting gallery " was in Zurich but last year Swiss voters approved a nationwide rollout of prescription heroin in a referendum .
* PORTUGAL
Portugal has the most liberal drugs policy in Europe .
In 2001 , it took the radical step of abolishing criminal penalties for drugs .
Anyone caught with drugs was referred through the civil , rather than criminal , courts and either fined or put into treatment .
Critics predicted that narcotics use would spiral out of control but addiction rates fell .
Yesterday the LXDE community received an announcement on their blog , in which developer Mario Behling told the world about the availability of the first Lubuntu test images , based on Ubuntu 9.10 ( Karmic Koala ) .
The upcoming operating system already proves to be a serious contender to Xubuntu , the ISO weighing in at a meager 342 MB .
The image is based on the work of David Sugar , with added patches by the community .
Highlights of Lubuntu 9.10 Beta 14 :
· Linux kernel 2.6.31 RC8 · Openbox 3.4.7.2 · Firefox 3.5.2 · Pidgin 2.5.8 · Aqualung R-1061 · xfBurn 0.4.2
The final version is planned to be synchronized with the Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala , and is scheduled for the 29th of October , 2009 .
About Lubuntu
The Lubuntu project started in March 2009 , with the purpose of creating a lighter and less resource demanding alternative to the Xubuntu operating system , using the LXDE desktop environment .
The ultimate goal of this project is to join the ranks of Kubuntu and Xubuntu and become an officially supported derivative of Ubuntu .
The developers claim that , while Xubuntu is often represented as a lightweight distro , it actually fails to run on older hardware , so they are targeting their Linux distribution at older legacy computers and devices with less than 256 MB of RAM .
While this project has n't received too much attention until now , the LXDE project received an invitation to become a self - maintained component of Ubuntu back in February 2009 , straight from the Ubuntu founder , Mark Shuttleworth .
Under the management of Mario Behling , the project received a project logo and an official Ubuntu wiki page that includes a list of desired applications , packages and components .
About LXDE
LXDE is a very lightweight and minimal desktop environment using the openbox window manager , the PcManFM file manager , and a very select list of default applications .
It is compatible with basic freedesktop standards and all needed parts are already packaged in Ubuntu today .
Download Lubuntu Beta 14 right now from Softpedia .
Remember that this is a beta release and it should NOT be installed on production machines .
It is intended to be used for testing purposes only .
It did n’t take very long for the conservative Republicans in the SouthEast , who have been yelling a lot lately about how Government is never the answer , to change their tune and beg for government assistance in the wake of widespread flooding .
But I resisted posting a story about that , since I hate to hit people when they are down ( even ignorant people ) .
But that was before I found a couple of stories about how the very same people who are opposing government health insurance , are for the exact same thing , but only if it applies to property and not to people ’s health .
So if your property floods , and you did n’t bother to purchase flood insurance , then they are all for the government bailing you out .
But if you get sick and do n’t have health insurance , you can die for all they care .
For example , when Hurricane Katrina hit the home of then Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi , and he had n’t purchased flood insurance , he introduced a bill to provide retroactive insurance to flood victims such as himself .
Retroactive benefits were also supported by Mississippi ’s other Senator , Thad Cochran , and by governor Haley Barbour .
But all three of these Republican have fought health care reform .
Not only does the government pay for disaster relief , the government also subsidizes flood insurance .
So the next time someone screams about not wanting to use taxpayer money to finance health insurance , ask them why taxpayer money is spent on flood insurance .
Several states , including Florida , Louisiana , and Texas , are lobbying the government to further subsidize flood insurance programs to the tune of an additional $ 80 billion .
Recall that Texas and Louisiana loudly rejected some of the money from the recent stimulus bill , but that is n’t stopping them from asking for an even bigger handout from the federal government .
And while insurance companies will reject you for preexisting conditions , for property the situation is just the opposite — if you live in an area that floods often , such as a hurricane zone , your flood insurance is even cheaper because it is subsidized :
Subsidizing flood insurance for those who live in hurricane zones makes it cheaper for people to live in those zones .
This attracts more people to these areas then would naturally choose to live there .
When a hurricane inevitably destroys these areas again , the government will have to pay billions of dollars in insurance claims .
Then they will spend more money redeveloping the area .
Then they will again offer subsidized flood insurance to the residents of the area , lowering the cost of living , and thereby encouraging more people to move there .
Then another hurricane will hit the area …
This has happened so many times before .
It will likely happen again and again in the future .
So , why is it acceptable to have a public option for property insurance , but not for health insurance ?
This graphic from New Scientist shows when certain natural resources will run out in the world if we continue at the current consumption rate .
However , reader beware , this graphic feels more like eye candy than real data .
I ’m no ecologist , but something about these numbers does n’t seem quite right .
Completely out of gold in the entire world in 45 years ?
No more indium ( for LCDs ) in 13 years ?
I do n’t quite get the comparison between world consumption rate vs half of the US consumption rate .
Why half ?
Again , I ’m no ecologist , so maybe this is totally normal .
I dunno .
Maybe someone who knows better than me can chime in here .
Data assumptions aside , the design is interesting .
A little scattered – but interesting .
Can you think of some ways to make this graphic more informative ?
Amazon has revealed that it will actually charge users of the international version of its popular Kindle ebook reader " significantly " more than originally thought compared to what their US customers pay for electronic books .
An Amazon spokesperson told the Guardian on Friday that non-US customers will be expected to pay $ 13.99 per book rather than $ 9.99 for each book , a 40 percent increase for the same title .
Amazon argued that higher operational costs outside the US forced the company to raise the price of books for foreign users .
For example , said the spokesman , VAT on Ebooks are higher in the EU than on printed books .
They currently stand at five percent compared to 17.5 percent for audiobooks and other electronic books .
The rise is in direct contradiction with Amazon 's prior stand on the matter .
On the 7th of October , it claimed that " Wireless delivery is included in the price of the book for international customers so there are no additional charges . "
However , it is only logical for Amazon to charge extra or else it would have been facing some steep losses for each downloaded book .
Its network partner , AT&T Global network , charges around one penny per KB ( that 's £ 10.24 per MB of data ) or roughly £ 14.39 per book on average according to the Guardian .
Our Comments
A few things to keep the record straight .
The extra charges that Amazon are charging are apparently almost entirely used up by value added taxes and data downloading charges .
As for ripping of non US customers , well , Adobe , Microsoft and many , many others have done it in the past .

X -rays showing contents of the witch bottle found at Greenwich ( Image : Alan Massey / R. J. Bostock )
A 17th - century stoneware bottle similar to the Greenwich find ( Image : Alan Massey ) CT scan of the Greenwich bottle , showing human urine , pins and nails , with cork just visible ( Image : Alan Massey )
Iron nails – the longest is 9 centimetres – and hair discovered inside the bottle ( Image : Alan Massey ) Advertisement Eight bent brass pins from the bottle , the longest 3.2 centimetres ( Image : Alan Massey ) 10 manicured nail parings found inside the bottle ( Image : Alan Massey )
A rare insight into the folk beliefs of 17th - century Britons has been gleaned from the analysis of a sealed “ witch bottle ” unearthed in Greenwich , London , in 2004 .
Witch bottles were commonly buried to ward off spells during the late 16th and 17th centuries , but it is very rare to find one still sealed .
“ So many have been dug up and their contents washed away down the sink , ” says Alan Massey , a retired chemist formerly at the University of Loughborough , UK , who has examined so - called “ magical ” artifacts and was asked to analyse the contents of the bottle .
“ This is the first one that has been opened scientifically . ”
During the 17th century , British people often blamed witches for any ill health or misfortune they suffered , says Massey .
“ The idea of the witch bottle was to throw the spell back on the witch , ” he says .
“ The urine and the bulb of the bottle represented the waterworks of the witch , and the theory was that the nails and the bent pins would aggravate the witch when she passed water and torment her so badly that she would take the spell back off you . ”
The salt - glazed jar was discovered 1.5 metres below ground by archaeologists from The Maritime Trust , a Greenwich - based charity that preserves historic sailing vessels .
When it was shaken , the bottle splashed and rattled , and an X - ray showed pins and nails stuck in the neck , suggesting that it had been buried upside down .
Further computed tomography scans showed it to be half - filled with liquid , which later analysis showed to be human urine .
The bottle also contained bent nails and pins , a nail - pierced leather “ heart ” , fingernail clippings , navel fluff and hair .
The presence of iron sulphide in the mixture also suggests that sulphur or brimstone had been added .
“ Prior to this point , all we really knew about what was in witch bottles was what we read from documents from the 17th century , ” says Brian Hoggard , an independent expert on British witchcraft who helped analyse the bottle .
These texts suggest “ recipes ” for filling a witch bottle , but do n’t tell us what actually went into them .
Sulphur is not mentioned in any recipe Massey has seen , although a previously discovered bottle seemed to contain the remains of some matches , he says .
“ If you think about where sulphur came from in those days , it spewed out of volcanic fumaroles from the underworld .
It would have been the ideal thing to [ kill ] your witch , if you wished to . ”
Further analysis of the urine showed that it also contained cotinine , a metabolite of nicotine , suggesting that it came from a smoker , while the nail clippings appear quite manicured , suggesting that a person of some social standing created the bottle .
“ It ’s confirming what 17th - century documents tell us about these bottles , how they were used and how you make them , ” says Owen Davies , a witchcraft expert at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield , UK .
“ The whole rationale for these bottles was sympathetic magic – so you put something intimate to the bewitched person in the bottle and then you put in bent pins and other unpleasant objects which are going to poison and cause great pain to the witch . ”

( Adds location of possible proceedings , US attorney ’s office declining to comment )
Sept 11 ( Reuters ) - U.S. prosecutors are preparing to impanel a grand jury to consider indicting the former head of American International Group Inc's AIG.N AIG Financial Products unit for securities fraud , the Wall Street Journal reported .
The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating whether Joseph Cassano overstated the value of mortgage - related contracts and failed to disclose material facts about them to AIG ’s outside auditor , the paper said , citing people familiar with the matter .
The grand jury would sit in Brooklyn , New York , and could also weigh charges against other employees of AIG , the newspaper said .
Cassano has denied any wrongdoing .
A U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment , as did a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell .
Cassano ’s lawyer and SEC representatives could not immediately be reached .
The possible case , which follows an 18 - month investigation , could rely partly on tape recordings of phone calls in 2007 involving employees of AIG Financial Products who discussed the value of credit - default swaps , the people told the Journal .
Cassano ’s lawyer told the paper that AIG was fully aware of his client ’s activities and that he has been cooperating with the inquiry .

Using eight cheap webcams , a GPS receiver and open - source software , West Point graduate Roy D. Ragsdale built a rig that can do what Google ’s Street - View cars do : take images of the world around it and stitch them together into panoramas .
The difference ?
This version can be carried on your head and cost just $ 300 to make .
The hacked - together software suite can even throw out files that can be viewed in Google Earth .
Ragsdale :
Construction was straightforward .
On a flat octagonal heavy - cardboard base , I glued small posts for the cameras ’ clips to latch onto .
I aligned each unit and then placed the USB hubs and the GPS receiver in the middle .
I secured the cables with Velcro and sandwiched everything with another piece of cardboard .
The whole thing ’s the size of a small pizza box , weighing less than 1 kilogram .
Excluding the notebook ( a 2 - gigahertz machine with 512 megabytes of RAM running Ubuntu Linux ) , the hardware cost about $ 300 .
Ragsdale tested out the camera , which he calls PhotoTrail , by walking around Boston , holding it above his head .
Then , to stress the system , which grabs sets of 1280 - by - 1024 jpeg files in eight second bursts , he put it on top of a jeep and drove it around his home base , West Point NY .
The result ?
Success .
The camera grabbed pictures every 20 seconds at speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour ( 62mph ) .
Ragsdale is hoping that a tool like this could be useful to soldiers – for instance , making a visual record when patrolling dangerous routes .
But it could be useful in a wide variety of civilian situations , too .
Ragsdale plans on shrinking the kit even further : the webcams can shed their bulky plastic cases , and replacing the laptop which controls the cameras with a custom - made circuit board could make it “ small enough to be integrated into a headband or hat . ”
You hear that , Google ?
Hire this guy to make you a camera and send it to me .
I ’ll shoot the tiny streets of my city that you left out of your Street View and send them to you .
You ’re welcome .

Now that the program is over , the data shows that there may be a single unexpected lesson .
If you do the math , the saving in oil spending over the lifetime of the new vehicles could be great enough to justify the US$ 3 billion of taxpayer money spent .
However , critics point out that the taxpayer is out of pocket for donating this one off efficiency saving to fortunate clunker owners without any benefit in return .
The US cash for clunkers program was designed to stimulate economic growth through the auto industry by encouraging individuals to trade in old vehicles for more fuel efficient models .
The US$ 3 billion program ran from July 24 through August 24 , 2009 .
The program resulted in an additional 690,114 cars being traded in .
The average fuel efficiency of trade ins was 15.8 mpg and the average for the replacements was 24.9 mpg .
Those receiving the clunker subsidy are supposed to be taxed on that benefit so the entire US $ 3 billion is not lost .
The month after the clunker program ended , consumers continued to purchase more cars and small vehicles rather than larger light trucks and SUVs .
Perhaps vehicle dealers realized that efficiency is the new best selling point - particularly as US consumers are in an increased saving mode following the severe recession ?
Maybe it took the surge in efficient vehicle sales during the clunkers program for this realization to become widespread ?
This efficiency trend , if it persists , will help the US economy better survive future oil price spikes .
Let 's take it to the charts .
Chart 1 shows the brief recovery in US auto sales during the short lived clunkers program .
( click to enlarge chart )
Chart 2 below shows the numbers of cars sold in the US as a percentage of total .
The clunkers program achieved what US $ 147 per barrel could not : 57 % of vehicles sold during August 2009 were cars rather than SUVs / Light trucks .
This exceeded the 55 % number of May08 - July08 as oil prices hit record highs .
What is most interesting is that the share of car sales has not collapsed to pre-clunker program levels : in September 2009 car sales accounted for 54 % of total US sales .
( click to enlarge chart )
Another criticism of the clunkers program was that it encouraged the purchase of imported vehicles rather than domestic .
Chart 3 clearly shows that the trend toward sales of imported vehicles has been in place for a long time and that the clunkers program barely made a difference to the trend .
( click to enlarge chart )
Conclusion :
While the benefit to taxpayers may not be immediately significant , the cash for clunkers program appears to have had a halo effect on efficient vehicle sales in the US .
This efficiency will strengthen the US economy against future oil price shocks and if the trend continues it is a welcome unintended benefit of the clunkers program .
Preposterous Universe
Was Einstein wrong ?
Gravity is the most obvious of the four forces of nature ( gravity , electromagnetism , and the strong and weak nuclear forces ) .
It 's also the first for which we had a sensible physical theory : Newton 's law of universal gravitation .
Now we have sensible theories for all four of the forces , and Newton 's theory has been superseded by an even better theory , Einstein 's general relativity ( GR ) .
GR has passed a series of experimental challenges with flying colors : the precession of Mercury , deflection of light , gravitational redshift and time delay , gravitational radiation from the binary pulsar , and the expansion rate of the early universe during the nucleosynthesis era .
But it does n't quite fit in with the rest of physics , since the other three forces seem to be compatible with quantum mechanics in a way is n't so obvious for gravity .
So very few people really believe that general relativity is the final answer ; at some point we 'll have to invent a better model ( string theory being the leading candidate ) that is intrinsically quantum - mechanical yet reduces to GR in the appropriate regimes .
Usually in field theory , if a model works well in a certain regime , you might expect it to break down at shorter distances or higher energies , but continue to be successful at long distances and lower energies .
Nevertheless , people have begun to ask whether general relativity might be okay in the solar system but break down on much larger scales ( galaxy - or universe - sized distances ) .
The primary motivation for such suggestions is the fact we need to hypothesize dark matter and dark energy to make sense of our universe if GR is correct .
It is very likely that GR is correct , and dark matter and dark energy are both for real , but since we can't be sure we consider the possibility that our understanding of gravity is to blame .
Of course , it 's easy to say " let 's modify gravity , " much harder to come up with a good model .
Indeed , it 's not even obvious what issue you 'd like your model to address -- the need for dark matter in galaxies , clusters , and large - scale structure ; or the perplexingly small value of the cosmological constant ; or the acceleration of the universe conventionally attributed to dark energy .
Modifying gravity with the goal of replacing dark matter is a long - standing project that has met with mixed success , most famously pursued by
Unfortunately , there are problems with the MOND paradigm itself .
For one thing , it 's not really a " theory " , it 's just a rule for making predictions in a very specific set of circumstances -- slowly - moving particles orbiting around massive bodies .
( Just as an observational matter , it does n't even seem to work very well for clusters of galaxies , although it does quite well for individual galaxies . )
Since it 's not a full - blown theory , it 's hard to make predictions for other tests you might like to do , like deflection of light or cosmology .
So people have been trying to invent an actual theory that reduces to MOND in the appropriate circumstances .
In a recent proposal ,
In addition to the theoretical difficulties , there is at least one model - independent reason to think that no modification of gravity will ever replace the idea of dark matter : we seem to be accumulating evidence ( tentatively at the moment , to be sure ) for gravitational forces pointing in directions where there is no ordinary matter .
The most basic such clue comes from studies of gravitational lensing of clusters of galaxies , which can be used to reconstruct the distribution of dark matter in the clusters .
The upshot is that the dark matter seems to be distributed much more smoothly than the ordinary matter ; see this
Of course , perhaps a modified theory of gravity could predict gravitational forces pointing in directions other than where there is ordinary matter ; you 'd have to tell me the theory first before we could say for sure .
MOND does n't , though , and such a theory is even harder to imagine than one that simply fits the galaxy data .
Tomorrow I 'll talk a little about modified gravity and the issues of vacuum energy and the accelerating universe .

Modifying gravity with the goal of replacing dark matter is a long - standing project that has met with mixed success , most famously pursued by Milgrom and his friends .
Milgrom has an idea called " Modified Newtonian Dynamics , " or MOND for short .
For some introductions see pages by Greg Bothun or Stacy McGaugh , or this review by Sellwood and Kosowsky .
The idea is to slightly increase the Newtonian gravitational acceleration when that acceleration is very small , so that slowly - moving particles feel more force than they ordinarily would , mimicking the presence of unseen matter .
This idea works extremely well for individual galaxies ; indeed , Milgrom made predictions for the behavior of low - surface - brightness galaxies before they were directly observed , and the predictions were later confirmed very nicely .
Unfortunately , there are problems with the MOND paradigm itself .
For one thing , it 's not really a " theory " , it 's just a rule for making predictions in a very specific set of circumstances -- slowly - moving particles orbiting around massive bodies .

Since it 's not a full - blown theory , it 's hard to make predictions for other tests you might like to do , like deflection of light or cosmology .
So people have been trying to invent an actual theory that reduces to MOND in the appropriate circumstances .
In a recent proposal , Bekenstein has claimed to succeed ; now people are at work putting this idea to the test , to see both if it makes sense and if it agrees with other things we know about cosmology .
In addition to the theoretical difficulties , there is at least one model - independent reason to think that no modification of gravity will ever replace the idea of dark matter : we seem to be accumulating evidence ( tentatively at the moment , to be sure ) for gravitational forces pointing in directions where there is no ordinary matter .
The most basic such clue comes from studies of gravitational lensing of clusters of galaxies , which can be used to reconstruct the distribution of dark matter in the clusters .
The upshot is that the dark matter seems to be distributed much more smoothly than the ordinary matter ; see this reconstructed cluster image for an example .
Less direct evidence is found in the acoustic peak structure of the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background .
( For an intro , see Wayne Hu's tutorial . )
Density fluctuations in the plasma of the early universe lead to sound waves , in which regions become more dense and therefore hot , and then bounce back and become less dense , in a repeating cycle ; this leads to peaks in the plot of temperature fluctuation as a function of angular scale .
But fluctuations in the dark matter do n't heat up ( they do n't interact with light , since they 're dark ) , so they only increase with time .
Consequently , odd - numbered peaks have ordinary matter and dark matter in phase , and even - numbered peaks have them out of phase .
The out - of - phase oscillations are suppressed , so we expect dark matter to boost the odd - numbered peaks .
This is exactly what appears to happen , as this figure indicates .
At least a little bit ; the data need to improve before we can be sure .
But it 's hard to see how a modified theory of gravity could explain this phenomenon .
Of course , perhaps a modified theory of gravity could predict gravitational forces pointing in directions other than where there is ordinary matter ; you 'd have to tell me the theory first before we could say for sure .
MOND does n't , though , and such a theory is even harder to imagine than one that simply fits the galaxy data .

I was savagely disfigured by my deranged boyfriend : Acid attack victim bravely shows her face
With painful honesty , Katie Piper , the former TV presenter tells why she has finally waived her right to anonymity – and reveals the awful events that changed her life for ever
However much she would like to forget them , the details of how she lost her dreams , her identity and very nearly her life will stay with Katie Piper for ever .
They are burned into both her memory and her face .
Katie , 26 , has remained fearful and anonymous in the 18 months since the man she met on the internet attempted to destroy her , so few will recognise her name .
Moving on : Katie Piper is learning to live with her rebuilt features and is exhausted by more than 30 operations following the acid attack by her former boyfriend
But the facts of the case – the rape , the vengeful boyfriend Daniel Lynch , the cup of industrial - strength sulphuric acid – are all too familiar , a cause of anger and revulsion when they were revealed in court earlier this year .
It was an added cruelty that Katie ’s world had revolved around her beauty .
She modelled for catalogues and magazines , presented television programmes and had dreamed of a full - time career in the media .
But on March 31 , 2008 , the old Katie Piper disappeared for ever .
The acid , hurled into her face on a busy London street , disfigured her beyond recognition .
Some slipped down her throat with further terrible consequences .
A vibrant Katie before the attack ( left ) , and the mask she wears to help heal the wounds from the acid burns ( right )
‘ I could hear someone screaming and screaming and kept wishing they ’d be quiet .
Then I realised it was me , ’ she recalls .
‘ I was standing in the street with people walking past me and I could feel my face evaporating .
I thought I was on fire as the acid ate at my skin .
‘ In one of Danny ’s calls he ’d told me he ’d got a present for me that would change my life for ever .
I knew instantly that he was behind it . ’
Afterwards , able to communicate only in writing , she gave her parents a note that said : ‘ Kill me . ’
Yet today , Katie is no longer in despair .
Beauty : Katie before the attack
Still learning to live with her rebuilt features and exhausted by more than 30 operations , she has agreed to waive her anonymity and speak in public .
Her fightback will be featured in a Channel 4 documentary this month .
She hopes her bravery will help her regain some confidence .
It is also a chance to insist – as she has discovered in the hardest way – that appearance cannot be the measure of human worth .
‘ I ’m never going to be the old Katie .
She ’s like a best friend I once had , ’ she admits .
‘ She ’s gone and there ’s a different one in her place .
I ’m not going to be a victim .
I ’m the woman who got through this .
I ’m full of life and looking forward to the future . ’
At the beginning of last year , Katie was living in London for the first time and enjoying it .
She was popular , particularly with men who were drawn to her blonde good looks and petite figure .
Like many young adults , she lived part of her hectic life through the pages of Facebook and it was not unusual for her to receive 80 emails in one day , many from admiring strangers .
Mostly , these were ignored .
But when 33 - year - old Daniel Lynch , a martial arts enthusiast , emailed Katie to say he ’d been following her career , she admits she was instantly attracted .
‘ He was wearing a martial arts suit in his picture and I ’d been doing some promotional work for martial arts in the UK , ’ she explains .
‘ We seemed to have a lot in common and , to be honest , looking at his picture , I fancied him . ’
A few days later Lynch turned up at a promotional event in Reading where Katie was working .
‘ He seemed quite shy and nervous when we first met , ’ she says .
‘ We just had a nice , normal chat .
He was 6ft 4in , quite macho - looking and handsome .
I liked what I saw . ’
Katie sent him her phone number and when they went on their first date , he met her with flowers and a teddy bear .
‘ We liked each other and we had fun , ’ she says .
‘ He told me on our second date that he loved me .
His arm was always around me and even when we were in the car and stopped at traffic lights , he would turn and kiss me .
Jailed for life : Ex- boyfriend Daniel Lynch left , and Stefan Sylvestre
‘ He was attentive and showered me with affection .
He rang me and emailed me constantly .
At one point he ’d sent so many messages he blocked my Facebook account .
If I ’m honest , I was flattered – at least at first . ’
She soon got a very different view of her new boyfriend , though .
Angered by a trivial slight when he was buying trainers , Lynch had exploded at a shop assistant , leaving Katie to pick up the pieces .
This was at the end of March last year .
‘ We were two weeks into our relationship and I ’d started feeling stifled by his constant calls and emails .
I did n’t say anything but I planned to break up with him , ’ she says .
Scarred for life : Courageous Kate underwent pioneering surgery to treat her burns
If she had known his true background , she would never have been with him in the first place .
Lynch , who lived in Shepherd ’s Bush , West London , with his mother and brother , had convictions for violence and had served a jail sentence for throwing boiling water into the face of another man .
But Katie knew none of this .
‘ Later on the day of the incident in the shop , when he suggested we make a night of it and stay in a hotel in Bayswater , I agreed , ’ she says .
‘ It was a Thursday and I had an appointment in town the next day .
We went for a meal , shared a bottle of wine and he seemed to be in a good mood again . ’
What happened next was terrifying by anyone ’s standards .
To a young girl from a comfortable home in a South of England market town , it was unimaginable .
Lynch raped her in the hotel room before holding her captive for eight hellish hours .
He smashed her head , beat her , threatened to slash her face with a razor and said he would hang her with a belt .
Later he claimed to have been high on steroids .
Even now , the details of the rape are hard for Katie to recount .
‘ One minute he ’d tell me he loved me and the next he was shouting and swearing .
His face was so contorted and I knew that I was dealing with a very sick person , ’ she says .
‘ I did n’t think he was going to let me leave that room alive .
‘ The blood from my head wound was everywhere – on the bed , on the carpets , on the bathroom tiles .
I told him the maids would be along soon and we had to clear up , otherwise they ’d call the police . ’
They drove back to Katie ’s flat in Golders Green where , to her relief , he agreed to let her out of the car .
It was 5 pm on Friday .
If her brief affair with Lynch was a dreadful mistake , Katie ’s next decision , too , might seem open to question .
She decided not to go to the police , gripped by the fear that he would kill her if she put one foot wrong .
Nor did she tell the truth to the doctors at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead , where her head wound was glued .
‘ I hated myself and what had happened to me , ’ she says .
‘ But I was terrified that he would hurt me or someone I loved .
I kept thinking that as long as I played along and did n’t make him angry , he ’d get fed up . ’
Instead , the bombardment of phone calls continued .
Lynch was full of apologies , she says , and the following Monday morning begged her to read an email he had written .
So , with her own internet line down , she agreed to leave her flat and walk to an internet cafe .
Katie admits : ‘ I was nervous about leaving the flat but thought that I could end this thing if I read the email .
The whole time Danny was on the phone to me , making conversation , asking me what I was wearing .
I was exhausted so I told him . ’
This was how her assailant , directed by Lynch , picked her out .
‘ I saw a man in a hooded top walking towards me , ’ she says .
‘ He was carrying a cup .
I assumed he was a beggar so I reached into my bag for some change .
He came up close , like he was going to speak , and threw liquid from the cup at my face .
‘ The pain was indescribable , but for a split second I remember thinking , “ How rude to throw coffee when I was trying to help him . ”
I could feel my skin and clothes burning off me . ’
The shocking attack can be seen on CCTV as Katie Piper ( on the right ) , is attacked in broad daylight
Losing her vision and disorientated , Katie staggered across Golders Green High Road , dodging in and out of cars to get help .
‘ I remember my Ugg boots slipped off and I just left them in the middle of the road , ’ she says .
‘ I could so easily have been knocked down . ’
To make things worse , Katie had to wait more than an hour in agony before ambulance crews were given the all - clear to treat her , because they did n’t know what the substance was and whether there was a risk of her attacker being nearby .
Chillingly , she confides : ‘ They zipped me up in a protective suit and I thought it must be a body bag and that I was dead and looking in on the scene around me .
All I could hear were voices and I figured I must be in Heaven . ’
David Piper , who runs a business , and his wife Diane took one look at their once beautiful daughter in hospital and silently believed she ’d be better off dead , as Diane now admits .
On one side , Katie ’s face had been destroyed as far as the fat layer – the only thing beyond it was bone .
She had lost the sight in her left eye and , because of the damage to her oesophagus , was unable to eat .
‘ I could n’t see a way back for her , ’ says Diane .
‘ I could n’t imagine what sort of future she ’d have .
Everything she ’d hoped for and dreamed of depended on her face and it was gone .
The thing that upset me most was when she wrote , “ Kill me . ” ’
So serious were the injuries that Katie ’s surgeon at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital , Mohammad Ali Jawad , resorted to pioneering techniques .
In a single operation , the first of its kind ever to be performed , he removed Katie ’s entire face , used a skin substitute , Matriderm ( which provides a ‘ scaffolding ’ for grafts ) , to rebuild its foundations , then grafted skin from her lower back and buttocks on to her face .
After the operation , she was put into an induced coma for 12 days and kept in intensive care .
Her weight plummeted to six stone and she had to be fed via a tube in her stomach .
Katie was given police protection even though Lynch and Stefan Sylvestre , now 21 and who threw the acid , had been arrested .
Her determination to recover astonished doctors but it was seven weeks before she knew and saw for herself the extent of the damage .
‘ When I held the mirror up I thought someone had given me a broken one or put a silly face on it as a joke , ’ she admits .
‘ I knew that they ’d taken my face away and that it was put somewhere in a bin in the hospital , but in my head I assumed I ’d look like the old Katie , just with a few red blotches .
‘ I was so embarrassed that people had seen me like this .
I wanted to tear the whole thing off and make it go away .
There was nothing about me that I recognised .
My identity as I knew it had gone . ’
Diane gave up her job as a classroom assistant in a primary school to look after her daughter full - time .
As well as regular massage at home to keep her damaged skin supple , Katie attends a clinic in southern France that specialises in treating burn - damaged skin .
Eating remains a struggle .
Just last week she had another operation to dilate her oesophagus because , every few weeks , scar tissue reforms , narrowing the passage to just a centimetre wide .
It is a measure of her progress that , a few hours later , she sat through a whole meal with her family to celebrate her 26th birthday .
‘ I ’m usually sick several times throughout a meal and prefer to eat alone , ’ she explains .
‘ To sit down with my family and friends , eat chicken and have a couple of glasses of wine was such a thrill that I felt I really had something to celebrate . ’
The psychological damage has been enormous and it has taken months for Katie to go outside .
She keeps all doors and windows locked , is terrified by unexpected callers and is frightened to make hot drinks because of the memories it revives .
For months she could n’t bear to have a shower because of the feeling of liquid moving across her body .
At night she has to wear a balaclava - style mask and a body suit to try to stretch her burned skin and during the day she wears a clear , plastic mask .
Pam Warren , who had been terribly burned in the Paddington rail crash and also wore a mask , came to see Katie to advise her .
In May , at Wood Green Crown Court , North London , Lynch and his accomplice Sylvestre were told by the judge that they were ‘ the face of pure evil ’ .
Both were jailed for life and Lynch will serve a minimum of 16 years .
But Katie still has nightmares and fears Lynch ’s release .
When he obtained a phone illegally in jail he used it to post a message on the internet saying how much he missed her .
She has now closed all of her social networking accounts .
Katie sounds remarkably well - adjusted despite what she has been through , and is full of praise for her treatment .
In particular , she says that the specialist rehabilitation she received should be standard for burns victims .
‘ I was fortunate to have a good surgeon and together with the correct aftercare I ’ve achieved results that exceeded even my expectations , ’ she says .
‘ Although , yes , I ’ve been scarred for life , I am extremely happy with my new beautiful face .
‘ There were times when I was so depressed I wanted to hide from the world .
Facing people looking like I do has been a huge ordeal for someone who lived her life to look beautiful .
My family have been amazing and without their support and the support of Mr Jawad , I would never have got through this .
‘ Now , though , I realise my life before was so superficial .
I used to refuse to go out if I had a spot on my face .
Now I wish a spot was all I had to worry about .
There are people who point and stare .
One man even knocked my sun hat off and laughed at me .
Those times hurt , but I wo n’t let them get me down .
I ’d like to be able to have a husband and family one day .
I ca n’t live a life of regret . ’
And what of Lynch ?
‘ Danny was sick .
He may have taken away what was once important to me but , cheesy as it sounds , I am a better person for it .
And he could n’t take away my spirit .
I love my life and I know that I have a future now , and it ’s a wonderful feeling . ’
My Beautiful Face , a Cutting Edge programme for Channel 4 produced by Mentorn , will be shown on October 29 at 9 pm .

Jacob Zuma manned the hotline himself when it first opened The anti-corruption hotline set up by South Africa 's President Jacob Zuma is proving unable to cope with the demand .
It was started in September in response to concerns about corruption and after demonstrations over lack of services .
The opposition Democratic Alliance says it has not been able to get through to the complaint line for 13 days .
South Africa 's Mail and Guardian paper says when it rang , a message said : " Due to extremely high call volumes we are unable to attend to your call . "
The BBC rang the 17737 hotline five times on Friday morning but was met with an engaged tone .
The DA has phoned the hotline a total of 42 times , over the course of 13 days , without once being able to get through
DA leader Helen Zille
When the line launched in 14 September , Mr Zuma himself took some of the first calls and promised callers that their complaints would be dealt with speedily .
But the Democratic Alliance says that three weeks on , getting through to the line is all but an impossible mission .
" The DA has phoned the hotline a total of 42 times , over the course of 13 days , without once being able to get through , " the DA 's leader Helen Zille said in a statement .
" These 42 calls translate into 572 minutes on hold ; or nine hours 32 minutes , " she said .
On its first day of operation , the free hotline took 27,000 calls and had in its first three hours received some 7,300 complaints from frustrated citizens .
The presidency at the time told the BBC the high call volumes were a good indication of the public 's " desperate " need to make their grievances heard .
However , the DA says the hotline is an " inadequate " attempt to deal with the lack of accountability and poor service delivery .
The opposition party said it did initially manage to make four complaints after numerous attempts , but was not given a reference number for any of them .
" A big promise is made , amid much fanfare and publicity , but then nothing follows , " said Ms Zille .
" It is ordinary South Africans who are let down as a result and lose faith in government 's ability to deliver . "
Attempts by the BBC to reach the presidency for comment proved unsuccessful .
It is reported that setting up the hotline cost an estimated 4 m rand ( $ 541,000 ; £ 325,000 ) .

“ Church Going , ” a 1955 poem by Philip Larkin , describes the mix of awkwardness and reverence many of us feel when faced with the monuments of our religious past .
The narrator , having removed his cycle clips to visit an old church , asks himself why he continues these debased pilgrimages , which “ always end at a loss like this , wondering what to look for . ”
Larkin ’s tourist is unwilling to embrace the rigidities of strict atheism or strict orthodoxy , and lives somewhere in the murky space between the two .
A majority of Americans are in a similar situation : over ninety percent believe in God , while less than one fourth believe that their faith is the only true one .
The sterile and increasingly hysterical debate between the self - appointed representatives of “ science ” and “ religion ” has very little to do with the experience of religion in modern society , and many of us are , at least in secret , at one with Larkin ’s shuffling visitor : “ Bored , uninformed , knowing the ghostly silt dispersed , yet tending to this cross of ground . ”
Perhaps the problem is the one diagnosed by Hannah Arendt : the collapse of orthodox religion has not caused us to turn towards the world with the piety and love once accorded God.
Benjamin Lazier , in his inspiring and beautifully - written God , Interrupted : Heresy and the European Imagination Between the World Wars ( Princeton , 2009 ) , suggests that there can be no simple path between these two forms of reverence .
A detour through the long tradition of heresy might be required in order to overcome religion without losing our faith .
Through a study of the surprising influence of heretical thought on Hans Jonas , Leo Strauss , and Gershom Scholem — three of the most influential Jewish intellectuals of the twentieth century — Lazier attempts to resuscitate the lost art of heresy , with all its possibilities and danger .
From the second century onwards , the prototypical heretic was the Gnostic : a catch - all term applied to anyone who believed that God was radically distinct from the created world , and that the creator God of scripture was , in fact , the devil .
This sounds almost unimaginably exotic to us now , but Gnosticism was , for centuries , seen as a real threat to early Christian and Jewish faith .
The other model heretic was the pantheist .
If the Gnostic sought to rigorously distinguish god and world , the pantheist sought to equate the two .
Although somewhat more charming than its predecessor , pantheism was , orthodox believers pointed out , perilously close to atheism ; this explains the endless controversy , some of which is tracked by Lazier , swirling around Spinoza , philosophy ’s most famous pantheist .
Although European societies were obsessed for centuries with the identification and persecution of heretics , Gnosticism and pantheism refused to die ( however many actual heretics were forced to ) .
The most recent resurgence of Jewish heresy occurred in the wake of liberal theology ’s implosion after World War I. Rationalist theologians , from Moses Mendelssohn onwards , had argued that Judaism needed to modernize , shedding the outdated trappings of Jewish tradition and replacing them with rational ethics ; likewise , the Jewish people had to transform from an insular religious community into “ German citizens of the Mosaic persuasion , ” as the slogan had it .
In Hermann Cohen ’s “ religion of reason , ” the God of Job — thundering in impenetrable clouds — is replaced by a sweetly reasonable deity , and the age - old struggle between Athens and Jerusalem is concluded with a peace treaty and handshakes all around .
After the blatant irrationality of World War I , this theology became literally incredible .
Leo Strauss liked to tell a story about a pious Jew who asked Cohen , perhaps the most prominent rationalist theologian , about the fate of God in his Kantian system .
Instead of providing an answer , Cohen wept prescient tears .
In the tumult of interwar Europe , many attempted to reclaim this absent God through heresy : both Gnosticism and pantheism , the twin rivals of a discredited orthodoxy , reappeared and flourished .
Jonas , Strauss , and Scholem , all of whom came to maturity in this postwar period , were indelibly marked by this revival .
They all felt , like the heretics , that we lived in a world from which the orthodox God had absented himself .
They also , however , argued that God ’s vanishing act was not the end of the story .
The creation of a modern form of faith — beyond both religion and materialism — required a final overcoming of heresy .
This time , the critique would not send us back into the welcoming embrace of orthodoxy , but rather propel us forward , into the world .
Both Jonas and Strauss argued that the horrors of modernity stemmed from God ’s disappearance .
Against the Gnostics and pantheists , whom they relentlessly attacked , the two German Jews held that the world left behind could be reinvested with the transcendent value that used to be God ’s alone .
Modernity , in other words , could only be redeemed by filling the God - shaped hole in our society with nature .
In Aristotelian terms , they see physis as an antidote to nomos .
We need , that is , to understand nature differently : not merely as “ that which surrounds us , ” but as a metaphysical and ethical order that sets limits to human activity — limits that we are manifestly incapable of setting for ourselves .
For Jonas , the modern worldview was tainted with Gnosticism : we treat the earth , and one another , with such consummate lack of care because , in the absence of God , living things appear to us as mere matter to be used and abused at our convenience .
Once we stop seeing nature as a stage for God ’s creation , and God ’s order , everything is permitted ( to quote another famous heretic ) .
From this insight he developed a robust philosophical biology and environmental ethics , premised on the final overcoming of the Gnostic heresy .
Similarly , Leo Strauss felt that the violence of his century was rooted in a disenchantment of the world .
In classical times , he argued , nature was seen as a source of ethical and political truths .
We have now forgotten this , and the consequences of our relativism are not hard to find .
As an antidote to modern nihilism he sought to revive the old philosophical approach to nature , which saw the world not as — again — mere matter , but as a repository of meaning and , in Strauss ’s special sense of the term , natural right .
Gershom Scholem , Lazier ’s third and most enigmatic subject , also travels through heresy to ground a modern , pious relationship between man and nature .
He does not so much reject certain orthodoxies as embrace all heresies .
For Scholem , God ’s absence from the world creates the space of nothingness from which we can hear His voice .
Nature is neither identified with nor distinct from God : these two heresies result , Scholem thought , in either “ absolute homelessness ” or “ absolute Godlessness . ”
When we encounter the world , Scholem suggests , we are not faced with the bare nothing of the Gnostics or the flaccid everything of the pantheists ; instead , we are faced with a unique something that is autonomous from God yet shot through with traces of its divine origin .
Only a gap between God and world allows us the space to develop autonomously as ethical subjects , but this gap is not absolute : from our all - too - human standpoint , we can still sense God , and we can still glimpse redemption .
Although neither Lazier nor his subjects , presumably , have been threatened with a burning at the stake , this remains heresy that counts , not the anemic “ heresy ” that is simply a masked form of indifference .
G.K. Chesterton describes the man who “ says , with a conscious laugh , ‘ I suppose I am very heretical , ’ and looks round for applause . ”
Heresy in this sense , of simply having opinions that do not happen to be orthodox , is perhaps the default religious option for many of us today , as it was for Larkin ’s cyclist .
This is not the heresy of Lazier ’s book , and that is its great merit : it shows us an alternative to strict orthodoxy that does not take the form of shrugging ecumenism .
Lazier , it should be clear , is not attempting to found a new orthodoxy .
Instead he is unearthing a style of thought and reasoning , which , following Peter Berger , he calls “ the heretical imperative . ”
This mode of engagement with the religious past replaces confused half - belief with exacting analysis , shaping the shards of exploded traditions into something new instead of leaving them in a mess on the floor .
If the God of orthodoxy has lost his plausibility for many of us — for two - thirds of us , apparently — heretical reasoning allows us a path to piety that does not circle back to a bankrupted past .
To adopt Lazier ’s title , the modern predicament is one in which God ’s call is “ interrupted . ”
The orthodox solution to this dilemma is to act as though she can still hear the word of God with complete clarity , while the atheist ’s solution is to clap her ears against the ever - quieter echoes of past revelation .
The Jewish intellectuals discussed by Lazier present us with a third option : to open our ears to nature , and to one another .
The skeptic would argue that a circuitous route through heresy is hardly necessary to arrive at such a banal conclusion ; in response , Lazier ’s modern heretics would wonder why such a simple resolution was ignored in the tragedies of the twentieth century .
As Scholem put it in a devastating formulation , whose simplicity belies the heretical complexity required to truly defend it : “ Develop peacefully , and do n’t destroy the world . ”
The Committee launched right into the public option this morning , with Rockefeller setting the stage by asking sharp questions on how much the insurance companies were providing to the reform in contrast to how much they are likely to gain in the Baucus bill as is -- half a trillion dollars -- and questioning insurance company policies and how precisely this bill might actually guarantee that insurance companies would have to abide by the reforms .
His concerns are more than valid .
There 's helluva lot of sweet deals for the insurance companies in the Baucus bill , including all those new enrollees it promises , and the lax oversight they 'll be subject to .
Like this :
Healthcare overhaul legislation moving through the Senate Finance Committee would put crucial rule - making authority in the hands of a private association of state insurance commissioners that consumer advocates fear is too closely tied to the industry .
The National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners currently writes model laws and regulations that individual states are free to accept or discard .
Under the bill by Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , it would craft a model rule governing " health insurance rating , issuance and marketing requirements " that would become " the new federal minimum standard without any further congressional action . "
States would be permitted to deviate from the standards only by appealing to the Department of Health and Human Services .
In effect , the bill would allow the group to write many of the new rules on issuing and marketing insurance to millions of uninsured Americans who would be required to purchase policies .
" The NAIC is clearly an organization that is dominated by the insurance industry , " said California Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , a former state insurance commissioner .
What 's standing between this giveaway to insurance companies and real healthcare reform is the public option .
And in the Senate Finance Committee , it 's Rockefeller and Schumer .

The attorney for a gang member kicked in the head by an El Monte police officer at the end of a televised car chase thinks his client has a great case .
On Thursday , Nick Pacheco filed a $ 5 - million legal claim against the city on behalf of the 23 - year - old .
But just in case , the attorney said his heavily tattooed client will be getting an extreme makeover in time for a trial , complete with a thick Tom Selleck mustache -- think “ Magnum P.I. ” -- to cover the name of his street gang , which is inked on his upper lip .
Richard Rodriguez will also grow hair to cover the tattoos on his shaved head .
And he ’ll wear a nice , conservative suit .
To make his point , Pacheco used Photoshop to show the difference .
In the booking photo , Rodriguez ’s head is shaved , and the name of his gang hangs over his lip .
Tattoos climb his neck .
In the “ after ” rendition , he ’s wearing a black suit with a metallic gray tie , neatly combed hair and a lush mustache .

“ People get past looks when you put on a suit and your hair is grown , ” Pacheco said .
Pacheco , a former L.A. councilman , said his client suffers from headaches and blurred vision , among other symptoms .
Dieter Dammeier , attorney for the El Monte Police Officers Assn. , said the officer acted within his training by using a “ distraction blow ” on Rodriguez .

NOTES
We were worried about no firepits being available .
Arrived 5 pm on Aug 30 , 2009 .
Hot day .
Weekend before Labor Day .
Parking lot looked crowded , but M____ could see available fire pits as we drove down .
Ranger at front said not likely to get fire pit , but there were plenty .
Someone was leaving a firepit at the first parking lot we pulled into .
Seems like there ’s plenty of turnover .
It took about 50 min from lighting the fire to being able to cook .
Used newspaper and firestarter and pine logs .
After 5 min , put the mesquite logs on .
I arranged the 4 - 5 burning logs in a row and placed the cooking grate over it at ~ 30 - 40 min .
Due to people being hungry , I started cooking at ~ 40 min but I think too many flames at that point - the veggies got burnt .
Maybe corn in the husk , potatoes in foil OK to start at 40 min .
I threw an extra log alongside the coals at this point so that would have new source of coals for marshmallows , boiling water , etc .
This was a good idea as this log burned slowly and steadily .
By the 60 min mark , nice steady heat from coals .
After cooking main course , I put the kettle on the grate for hot drinks afterwards .
By the time dinner done , hot water ready .
If doing dutch oven , nice to have 2 - 3 extra logs to put on top and bottom and not take space on grate .
Mesquite logs were good because they held heat a long time , and they had pleasant aroma and flavored the meat a bit .
I was worried about smoke and soot staining cooking pans .
But the kettle seemed perfectly fine after being on grill for a long time , though a bit ashy .
Fears Taliban are targeting Pakistan 's nuclear program as suicide bomber kills eight at airforce facility
There are fears extremists are targeting Pakistan ’s nuclear program after a Taliban suicide bomber killed eight people outside a key airforce facility today .
The bomber detonated explosives strapped to his body at a checkpoint outside the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex in Kamra , some 45 miles northwest of the capital , Islamabad .
There were also police and hospital reports of a blast in the northwest city of Peshawar that wounded seven people .
Security personnel stand at the checkpoint where a suicide attack took place in Kamra , Pakistan , today
Officials quickly denied suggestions the attack at the airforce facility was proof the Taliban are focusing on nuclear targets .
The attacks come as the army continues a major offensive against Pakistani Taliban militant strongholds in South Waziristan , near the Afgfhan border .
The offensive has raised fears the insurgents will step up a suicide bombing campaign on urban targets .
Over 150 people have been killed in a series of attacks in the past few weeks .
' Eight people were killed and 13 were wounded , three of them seriously , ' said Shaukat Sultan , head of the main government hospital in Kamra .
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani told a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the country 's nuclear infrastructure was safe and faced no threat from Taliban militants , and an airforce official was quick to dispel suggestions today that the Kamra facility was linked to the weapons program .
A policeman stands guard outside the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex which was targeted this morning
' It 's nonsense .
It 's rubbish , ' the airforce official told Reuters .
Today ’s attack came a day after an army brigadier and his driver were killed in a drive - by shooting in Islamabad , while at least six people , including two suicide bombers , died in twin attacks at an Islamic University in the capital on Tuesday .
Analysts have warned of the possibility of more attacks as the militants come under pressure in South Waziristan , with the Taliban hoping bloodshed and disruption will cause the government and ordinary people to lose their appetite for the offensive .
The offensive is a test of the government 's determination to tackle Islamic fundamentalists , and the campaign is being closely followed by the US and other powers embroiled in Afghanistan .
The bomber detonated a vest of explosives at the airforce facility , killing eight people and injuring 13
About 28,000 soldiers are battling an estimated 10,000 hard - core Taliban , including about 1,000 tough Uzbek fighters and some Arab al Qaeda members .
The army said 24 militants and two soldiers were killed in the fighting on Thursday .
Foreign journalists are not allowed anywhere near the battle zone and it is dangerous even for Pakistani reporters to visit .
Independent confirmation of casualty figures has not been possible .
More than 100,000 civilians have fled the area , with about 32,000 leaving since October 13 , the United Nations said .
The army has launched brief offensives in South Waziristan before , the first in 2004 when it suffered heavy casualties before striking a peace pact
“ I believe it was all because of your step by step guidance and coaching / mentoring that you provided [ my son ] over the course of the year , on how to put his best foot forward in various situations that he has had success .
He now has acceptances from a number of medical schools and will soon make his choice .
I am very appreciative of your help for him during the process and thank you for all you did for him …
Thanks in advance , and I hope [ my son ] will turn back to you when he is starting to think about residency programs etc .
Once again , thank you so very much and let me know if there is anything I can do for you . ”

Some widows hope to remarry one day
By Hugh Sykes
BBC News , Baghdad
Nearly three decades of war , brutal totalitarianism , invasion , occupation and insurgency in Iraq have left behind at least a million widows - and several million children without fathers .
That was the conservative estimate earlier in 2009 by Iraq 's acting minister for women 's affairs , Narmeen Othman .
She believes there may even be two million widows .
Under Saddam Hussein , despite the brutality of his regime towards so many of Iraq 's people , war widows were looked after by the state .
Now , they are mostly hidden and vulnerable .
It 's been called Iraq 's cultural time bomb .
Close to the surface of the new normality here , there are painful memories , and a yearning for lost loved ones .
And - there 's anxiety about looking after the children when the breadwinner has gone .
Success story
At the al - Ethar charity in west Baghdad , donations from well - wishers help support families without fathers .
They also help to find husbands for women who want to remarry .
The director , Hana Badrani , told me she has more than 2,000 widows on her books , with a total of 7,000 children whose fathers have been killed .
Most of the widows do not have any qualifications to help them get work .
They 're trapped .
She introduced me to one of their success stories - Iman and Hussein .
Iman 's husband was shot dead two years ago .
She has now re-married - and she and Hussein have a little boy called Yussef , who kept on catching my eye and grinning .
Hussein told me : " Marrying a widow is good for the man and for the children . "
Umm Fatima 's husband was shot dead at a petrol station Iman says her friends encouraged her to get married again .
Hussein 's mother Latife encouraged her too : " All these widows , " she said .
" All these children .
Who else is going to take care of them ? "
I also met Umm Fatima - a young widow who started to sob when I asked her how her four children were coping .
Their father Ahmad was shot dead nearly three years ago by men wearing military uniforms .
He 'd simply been refuelling his taxi cab when they killed him .
Umm Fatima has lost a husband and the family income .
She believes it 's very important for her and for the children that she re-marries .
" A father for them would make us all more secure , " she told me - financially , and emotionally .
" They miss their dad , " she went on .
" And when they meet men sometimes , they want them to give them a hug . "
Social traditions
But an Iraqi campaigner for women 's independence , Hanaa Edwar , questions the assumption that a widow would be better off re-marrying .
" For her dignity as a human being , " she said .
" Women should feel they are capable of doing what men can do .
They can protect their children without a man in the family .
" In this society where there are tough tribal traditions , " she added .
" We have to try to build a new look for women in Iraq . "
Hanaa Edwar is Christian .
I wondered what she would say to Muslims who might argue that their social and religious traditions are none of her business .
" I do n't care about that really , " she responded .
" I consider myself a human being .
I do n't bother myself with religions , I am an Iraqi citizen .
And , of course , I am an international human being . "
But there are still numerous women here - and their children - who yearn for a new husband .
And a new father .
One day , I sat with a widow , Umm Ahmed , and her three - year - old daughter Sara .
Umm
Ahmed told me , in a very matter - of - fact way , that her husband had been shot dead , simply walking down the street .
When her mother had finished speaking , Sara looked up at me and said : " Please stay with us . "

JERUSALEM , Oct 15 ( Reuters ) - A Turkish television drama series depicting an Israeli soldier shooting dead a Palestinian baby put more strain on Thursday on relations between Israel and Turkey , a Muslim strategic ally .
Previously close ties between the Jewish state and Muslim Turkey have deteriorated somewhat since Israel 's offensive in the Palestinian Gaza strip .
Turkey has at the same time strengthened its relations with neighbouring Syria .
Israel summoned a Turkish diplomat to protest at what it called " state - sponsored incitement " by TRT television 's " Separation " series , in which actors playing Israeli soldiers and Palestinians fight street battles in Jerusalem .
" The series , which has no connection to reality whatsoever , is not even suitable for an enemy country and certainly not for a country that has full diplomatic relations with Israel , " Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement .
The scene , broadcast on Israel 's Channel Two television on Wednesday , shows a Palestinian father holding a baby up above his head and an Israeli soldier in full combat gear taking aim and shooting the infant .
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Israel summoned the deputy chief of mission at the Turkish embassy to protest at the " highly inflammatory " scenes aired on state - owned TRT .
Turkish officials in Ankara and Tel Aviv were not immediately available for comment .
Turkey barred Israel from participating in a NATO war exercise this week and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said the move was a result of public concerns over the Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip earlier this year .
The drill was postponed indefinitely after other nations , including the United States and Italy , refused to take part without Israel 's air force .
Turkey , a secular state with a Muslim population , has been a key strategic ally of Israel , but relations have cooled over Erdogan 's outspoken criticism of Israel 's three - week offensive in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip in December and January .

Vampires to Life of Christ : Anne Rice 's Christ the Lord & the Incarnation
At this writing , Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt sits at # 11 on the definitive New York Times Best - seller List for hardcover fiction books .
That 's big enough , but the real news is who wrote it : vampire - novelist , self - styled " queen of the damned " Anne Rice , who claims renewed faith and a full - fledged return to her Catholic roots .
This is quite a shift , 25 years and 25 - odd horror novels later .
Whatever your take , Rice 's first installment on a project to write the life of Christ — in first - person , boyish narrative — is striking and provocative .
Janet Maslin writes in the New York Times that Rice " delivers the only shock effects still available to her , after a career - length cavalcade of kinks : piety and moderation . "
Christian cultural apologist and professor G. E. Veith believes she has navigated a " perilous project " niftily , maintaining orthodoxy as well as could be expected ( see review below ) .
Reformed seminary professor Dr. Derek Thomas questions
Rice 's incluences and her own understanding of the Christian faith ( also below ) .
Halfway through my first reading , this editor found the sparse prose and seven - year - old viewpoint tough to enter into at first .
But perhaps it was my doubts regarding such an ambitious enterprise that needled me , things like Rice 's inclusion of elements from the Gnostic Gospels and other legends .
Yet , it 's the questions inherent in Rice 's gutsy attempt to capture the heart and mind of Christ the nascent - yet - eternal Messiah that rocked me a bit :
Was Jesus really afraid , as depicted ?
Or being " tempted in all things as we are , yet without sin , " ( Hebrews 4:15 , NASB ) did He simply think distantly about fear , hate and other sins ?
The storyline somehow makes this less theoretical .
How cognizant was He of His own deity ?
His mission ?
His totally unique conception ?
After all , mention of Christ 's self - awareness is not included in the canon of Scripture nor is His childhood detailed , save one story about Him being separated from Mary and Joseph at the Temple in Jerusalem .
Thus , I feel that it 's high time I personally wrestled with the humanity and deity of Christ , even to meditate on what that may have looked like .
I have Rice to thank for bringing it up so poignantly .
As with another highly popular contemporary novel , ( supposedly ) anchored in historical , biblical and creedal bases —
The Da Vinci Code ( see our feature on it here ) — Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt readily issues forth into various deep streams of research , despite its terse text .
This editor found once again , as Rice makes plain in her afterword , that one such stream leads into a miry bog indeed : that of the " search for the historical Jesus . "
In fact , liberal scholars engaging in the historical - critical method have so deconstructed the Scriptures , particularly the Gospels , that little is left besides nice , " inclusive " and " tolerant " passages — and those with spurious origins , we are told .
Rice has assidiously rejected the work of such groups as The Jesus Seminar and navigated around pits they fell into , even as she weaves such sources as the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas into her book .
She was struck by the " incoherence and inelegance of the skeptical argument " ( in Derek Thomas ' words ) after conducting painstaking research from an array of sources , including primary ones .
Christmas just having past , the mystery of the incarnation , the divinity and humanity of Christ and the context of ancient Palestine seems one way to dive deeper and linger on the meaning of the Holiday .
We are privileleged to provide a start for you and anyone you wish to pass it on to in our Special Focus .

The Council of Chalcedon ( 451 A.D. ) failing to penetrate the mystery of the divine and human natures of Christ , offered four precautions that would protect the Christian from error when contemplating this mystery :
Attribute true and proper divinity to Christ ; Attribute true and proper humanity to Christ ;
Do not so mingle the human and divine that you end up with a being neither human nor divine ;
Do not dissect Christ so that there are two persons in one being .

Resources about the book and its unlikely author .
Perilous project : But Anne Rice hits an orthodox balance
Professor Gene Edward Veith
Veith briefly notes the careful historical and biblical care taken by Anne Rice in her novel Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt .
This careful approach , he says , helps her steer through the perilous project of imagining Jesus as a boy who awakens to His deity through the office of his young humanity - - a balance he believes she strikes well .
Book in Review : Toothless Vampires and the Holy Grail
Dr. Derek Thomas
Reformed theology professor Derek Thomas reviews vampire novelist Anne Rice 's latest novel , Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt .
He expresses reservations about some of the theological and historical presuppositions by which Rice constructs this highly conjectural story of Christ as a seven - year - old , as well as her own claims to Christian orthodoxy .
Given her goal to complete a series on the early life of Christ , this review reads as in interested but fairly serious spiritual advisory .
Into the Light
Lynn Vincent
Feature article on the stark contrast between novelist Anne Rice 's works on vampires and demons and her newly revivified Catholic faith , which sparked the goal of writing the life of Jesus Christ .
Her first such book , Christ the Lord : Out of Egypt , released in November , 2005 , features " the ultimate supernatural hero " as a seven - year - old boy .
Resources on Christ 's Incarnation , Humanity , Divinity and Self - Awareness
One of the greatest mysteries and most controversial doctrines of the Christian faith is that of the incarnation .
Our limitations in understanding how the divine and human natures of Christ , as revealed in the canonical Bible , interact , relate and are even possible as a union create thorny religious and philosophical problems .
But on this doctrine , claim such teachers as Bob Deffinbaugh , stands the possibility of atonement for sin ( among many other things ) and , thus the very reason for Christ 's coming as a baby at all .
Not a side - issue , this topic may ultimately make or break one 's faith , thus one 's eternal destiny .
Martin Luther : Disputation on the Divinity and Humanity of Christ
Debate featuring Dr. Martin Luther ( 1540 )
Martin Luther , the Father of the Reformation , debates theological rival Schwenkfeld on the nature of Christ 's humanity and divinity .
Translated from Latin for the Wittenberg Project , Luther presents dozens of arguments and subpoints pertaining to Christ 's creatureliness , humanity and divine nature , appealing to Scripture regularly , but relying on logic -- good late medieval philosophy .
In the 16th Century , public disputations like this were required for doctoral degrees .
The Importance of the Incarnation
Bob Deffinbaugh , Th.M .
According to Deffinbaugh , the importance of the incarnation goes to the very core of Christian orthodoxy ( and a true celebration of Christmas ) .
It directly or indirectly touches on the toughest problems for the faith : reconciling Christ 's humanity and deity , God 's union with man in salvation , the infallible Word of God through the agency of man .
" Once the doctrine of the incarnation is set aside , the whole matter of redemption through the person and work of Christ is scuttled .
And thus we find a great deal of controversy surrounding this vital doctrine ....
In order for God ’s purposes and promises to be fulfilled , the incarnation must occur ....
What He became in the manger centuries ago , is what He shall forever be - the God -Man .
To deny the incarnation is to deny the virgin birth , the miracles of our Lord , His substitutionary atonement , and His bodily resurrection .
In effect , to deny the incarnation is to deny all .
To accept the incarnation is to believe in all . "
Deffinbaugh concludes with implications of the incarnation , the gracious , essential salvation offered by Christ .
An important article itself .
The Day Jesus Went AWOL : Luke 2:39 - 52
Bob Deffinbaugh , Th.M .
Deffinbaugh exegetes a seemingly innocuous passage - containing the first recorded words of Christ - and offers practical insights for today 's believer .
Historical context and an understanding of the some conundrums created by Jesus ' humanity and divinity help this study , which is part of a larger body of in - depth teaching on Luke 's Gospel on this richly endowed site , Bible.org .
The Deity of Christ
Don Closson
The belief that Jesus was and is God has always been a non-negotiable for Christianity .
This belief is based on Jesus ' own words as well as the teachings of the early church .

Resources on The Jesus Seminar and the Historical Christ
Much of what one will find today searching on , say , Google.com on such terms as " historical Jesus " will result in sites deeply influenced by The Jesus Seminar and liberal scholars of similar leanings .
Such fodder includes perspectives ranging from a mystical " spirit of Jesus " that tends to sap the practical , literal nature of Scripture to the outright denial of Jesus Christ as a person of history — including His miracles and bodily Resurrection .
Figuring promintently into all of this : Christ 's incarnation and the undiminished union of humand and divine natures .
For more information on such theological bents , see the resources below :
Presuppositions and Pretensions of the Jesus Seminar
Dr. William Lane Craig
In this first part of a two - part article , the presuppositions and pretentions of the Jesus Seminar are exposited and assessed .
It is found that the principal presuppositions of ( i ) scientific naturalism , ( ii ) the primacy of the apocryphal gospels , and ( iii ) the necessity of a politically correct Jesus are unjustified and issue in a distorted portrait of the historical Jesus .
Although the Jesus Seminar makes a pretention of speaking for scholarship on the quest of the historical Jesus , it is shown that in fact it is a small body of critics in pursuit of a cultural agenda .
The Evidence For Jesus
Dr. William Lane Craig
Five reasons are presented for thinking that critics who accept the historical credibility of the gospel accounts of Jesus do not bear a special burden of proof relative to more skeptical critics .
Then the historicity of a few specific aspects of Jesus ' life are addressed , including his radical self - concept as the divine Son of God , his role as a miracle - worker , his trial and crucifixion , and his resurrection from the dead .

In Review : The Human Christ : The Search for the Historical Jesus
Reviewed by Luke Timothy Johnson
Book review of the book The Human Christ by Charlotte Allen .
The Historical Christ
Rick Wade
Rick Wade examines the PBS special ' From Jesus to Christ ' by focusing on the theological presuppositions of those who deny the supernatural and instead search for the ' historical Jesus . '
He examines the development of these views from Davis Strauss , to Rudolf Bultmann , to the Jesus Seminar and the work of Dominic Crosson .
Drawing from the work of Craig Blomberg of Denver Seminary , the author ably presents arguments for the early dating of the Synoptic Gospels and the historical accuracy and authenticity of their authors .
Finally , he demonstrates that the differences in the synoptic accounts can be reconciled without resorting to questioning their historicity .
The conclusion is that the Christ of faith is indeed the Jesus of history .
Big Fan Robert D. Siegel wrote and directed this comic drama about a lifetime New York Giants fan ( Patton Oswalt ) whose favorite player beats him up .
Siegel also wrote “ The Wrestler , ’’ so apparently there is more sports - world misery where that film came from .
Beeswax From Andrew Bujalski , the father of the accursed mumblecore genre , comes a new movie about twin sisters in Austin , Texas , played by Tilly and Maggie Hatcher , who face a possible lawsuit .

And Meryl Streep continues her streak of smart - looking choices , teaming with director Nancy Meyers to play a divorcée caught in a romantic - comic love triangle with Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin .
That movie is called “ It ’s Complicated . ’’
Not when it comes to her stardom .
Interestingly , the American movie that seemed farthest from Hollywood - “ Precious ’ ’ - has been thrust into the Oscar fray with the ecstatic backing of Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry .
So you ’ve been warned , James Cameron , director of the $ 200 million - plus “ Avatar . ’’
You too , makers of the glitzy , star - studded musical extravaganza “ Nine ’’ ( Day - Lewis ! Kidman !
Cruz ! Dench ! Loren ! Fergie ! ) .
This low - budget , mostly black , independent melodrama about an overweight teenage Harlem mother of two is looking to blow you out of the water .
But if Hollywood - centric Oscar speculation seems crass ( and it is ) , the margins this fall are n’t completely barren .
Lars von
Trier returns with a new provocation ( “ Antichrist ’’ ) .

One of the upcoming George Clooney pictures ( there are three ) has to be Oscar - worthy .
The Coen brothers have even made a dramatic comedy whose title captures , more or less , the mood of the season .
It ’s called “ A Serious Man . ’’
You may have heard that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , the folks who hand out Oscars , will double to 10 the number of best picture nominees this year .
Right now , the Academy would have a tough time finding five .
But that , of course , is what fall is for : promotion and positioning .

The new Pedro Almodóvar is hard to synopsize even by his standards .
There ’s this blind director ( Lluis Homar ) , see , who lives in the shadow of 14 years earlier , when he made a film starring the mistress ( Penélope Cruz ) of his producer ( José Luis Gómez ) . . . oh , never mind .
Just expect the usual stew of guilt , passion , humor , and melodrama , with colors that bleed as ripely as the emotions .

The findings of a pilot study have raised hopes that people with nut allergies might be able to reduce the effects by consuming other nuts .
Researcher Dr Billy Tao of Flinders Medical
Centre says doctors had long assumed people with nut allergies should not consume any nuts .
He says the research was set up to check validity of the theory .
" Practically all kids with a known nut allergic history will be told by their doctors to avoid all nuts , but this type of approach does not really have any evidence , " he said .
Under close medical supervision , nearly 50 patients were put through months of testing .
Dr Tao says it was surprising to find that regular consumption of other nuts could lower the reaction among patients to nuts they were allergic to .
He said 25 per cent of those involved showed improvements and a wider study was now needed .
" It shows that it is actually quite safe to eat the non-allergic nuts if you are allergic to some ... nuts , " he said , but Dr Tao stressed that medical advice was essential and people should not attempt anything at home to desensitise those with nut allergies .
By Wayne Madsen / Wayne Madsen ReportFormer FBI translator Sibel Edmonds testified August 15th that while she was working for the FBI she was aware of bribes being made by the Turkish government to elected and former members of Congress , as well as senior officials of the executive branch , including the Department of State .
Edmonds was subpoenaed by the Ohio Election Commission in a case brought against Ohio Democratic House of Representatives candidate David Krikorian by incumbent Ohio Republican Representative Jean Schmidt .
Schmidt alleges in her complaint to the Commission that Krikorian made “ false statements ” in his 2008 independent race against her .
Edmonds named Rep. Schmidt as one of the recipients of Turkish government bribes along with former House Speakers Dennis Hastert ( R- IL ) , Dick Gephardt ( D - MO ) , and brief House Speaker Robert Livingston ( R- LA ) , as well as Representative Dan Burton ( R - IN ) and former Representative Stephen Solarz ( D - NY ) .
Also named are Brent Scowcroft , former National Security Adviser under George H. W. Bush and Gerald Ford , and former George W. Bush State Department Political Undersecretary , Marc Grossman .
Edmonds was fired from her FBI job after she complained to her superiors about Turkish intelligence infiltration of the translation branch of the bureau ; she was exonerated in a report by the FBI ’s Inspector General .
Edmonds ’ testimony also dealt with Turkish and Israeli joint operations to engage in smuggling nuclear technology from the US .
In particular , the Turkish espionage and influence - peddling ring was heavily involved in the Bush White House “ outing ” the covert identities of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson and her Brewster Jennings & Associates , non-official , CIA - cover firm .
Perhaps the most explosive part of the deposition involved the Turkish government being engaged in a sexual blackmail operation against a sitting member of the House of Representative .
In what the FBI termed a “ hooking process , ” an American - Turkish Council ( ATC ) female operative enticed a female member of the House into a lesbian sexual encounter at a Washington , DC townhouse .
A Turkish intelligence surveillance team had placed surveillance bugs throughout the townhouse , including the bedroom and captured the lesbian tryst on tape , according to Edmonds ’s testimony .
WMR has learned that the House member in question is Representative Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , a strong supporter of AIPAC and Israel and a close political ally of President Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel .
To her credit , Schakowsky had been a vocal opponent of private military contractors and the lack of government oversight of their activities , especially in Latin American and Iraq , but since being compromised , she has “ gone quiet ” on all her signature issues , including private military contractors , and she has become very hawkish in support of Israel .
In January 2007 , Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Schakowsky to be a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence .
Currently , Schakowsky is chair of the House Select Committee on Intelligence ’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations — which puts her in a conflict - of - interest in investigating Turkish and related Israeli intelligence penetration of the FBI and State Department .
WMR has also learned from congressional sources that Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was aware of Schakowsky ’s “ problems , ” and he resisted pressure from Obama and Emanuel to appoint Schakowsky to Obama ’s vacant Senate seat .
When Blagojevich signaled he was going to appoint someone other than Schakowsky to the seat , the joint Israeli and Turkish lobbies , in addition to Emanuel , arranged for US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald to receive a green light to arrest Blagojevich , even before any federal corruption indictments were handed down by a grand jury .
Blagojevich was later impeached by the Illinois House and removed from office by the state senate .
An indictment on multiple counts was later handed down by a federal grand jury .
WMR has previously reported that Fitzgerald dragged his feet on the investigation of the leak by the Bush White House of the covert identities of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson and her Brewster Jennings & Associates cover firm .
Fitzgerald was trying to limit damaging exposure to the nuclear smuggling operation that involved the Turkish and Israeli Lobbies and Turkish MIT and Israeli Mossad intelligence operations .
Mrs. Wilson and her team were apparently narrowing in on the Turks and Israelis in nuclear smuggling around the world .
The key US government players in outing Brewster Jennings were named by Edmonds in her deposition .
Blackwater ( now Xe ) has been accused of smuggling weapons through Iraq to Kurdish guerrillas in Turkey .
Recent allegations that Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) terrorist attacks in Turkey have been “ false flags ” carried out by the “ deep state ” Ergenekon and the allegations by Edmonds that the ATC and its affiliates in Washington are part of the Turkish “ deep state ” point to possible long - time collusion between Blackwater and Turkish intelligence .
The fact that Turkish intelligence successfully blackmailed Schakowsky , the major congressional opponent of Blackwater ’s operations , could not have come as better news to the firm .
With the CIA and Blackwater / Xe vigorously opposed to any further details of their cooperation emerging , there is the strong possibility that Turkish state intelligence has shared its “ take ” with the CIA and Schakowsky is , once again , being blackmailed into submission as she was when the ATC and its sister organization , the Israeli AIPAC lobby , pressured her to back down on her support for an Armenian genocide resolution in the House .
Such juicy blackmail information certainly may have ended up in the hands of those CIA officials who went to work in senior executive positions for Blackwater , including the CIA ’s former chief of the Counterterrorism Center Cofer Black , former chief of the CIA ’s Near East and South Asia Division Robert Richer , former CIA Special Operations Group official Enrique “ Ric ” Prado , and Alvin “ Buzzy ” Krongard , who , while his brother Howard “ Cookie ” Krongard was blocking an investigation of the State Department ’s contracts with Blackwater while serving as State ’s Inspector General , was serving on Blackwater ’s advisory board .
In addition , Joseph Schmitz , the Pentagon ’s former Inspector General , was hired on as the general counsel for the Prince Group , the parent company of Erik Prince ’s Blackwater .
It is also reported that after CIA director George Tenet canceled the CIA ’s contract with Blackwater .
His replacement , Porter Goss , renewed the deal .
Goss ’s Executive Director , Kyle “ Dusty ” Foggo , now jailed for fraud and corruption , would have been involved in hammering out the CIA ’s renewed contract with Blackwater .
Foggo , had a personal and business relationship with Pamela Martin & Associates proprietor , his old friend from San Diego the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey , to provide escorts for the agency for clandestine tasks .
That activity also involved providing escorts for Washington hotel “ poker parties ” at which Goss , Foggo , and jailed former Representative Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham were present .
Cunningham served as chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Appropriations subcommittee , which approved Blackwater ’s Pentagon contracts .
Blackwater , according to recent court depositions in Alexandria , Virginia , is accused of running a prostitution camp in Baghdad , which also involved the use of children .
The connections between Blackwater and the CIA now indicate that the Pentagon entity that was working closely with Langley in paramilitary assassination operations was largely composed of Blackwater contractors .
Many in Congress are demanding an explanation for the CIA ’s contracts with Blackwater ; but with Schakowsky being blackmailed , there is little hope that her subcommittee can look into the contracts between the CIA and Blackwater / Xe , let alone the operations of the Prince Group ’s other murky entities , including Presidential Airways , Greystone Ltd. of Barbados , Falcon , EP Investments , Xe Airships , Total Intelligence Solutions , and Raven Development Group .
Patrick was the sort of student who made a teacher curious .
There was something capacious inside him .
He preferred listening to speaking .
Others rushed , jostled , to get to the front of the lunch line .
Patrick hung back .
Patrick ’s grin was a half - grin — as if he ’d once trained himself not to smile but had since abandoned the project .
I met him the year before I left the Mississippi Delta — my second year as a Teach for America member in Phillips County , Ark. , one of the poorest counties in the country .
Patrick had flunked eighth grade twice ; that year was his third try .
He simply would n’t show up .
He had no reason to ; nobody made him .
After he disappeared for two weeks , I asked a friend of his how to get to his house .
When Patrick saw me at his door , he said , very fast , “ The bus did n’t come . ”
He looked away .
“ I missed the bus . ”
Then : “ I ’m sorry , Ms. Kuo . ”
We sat on the porch , across from a burned - down house .
I handed him a postcard I ’d been saving .
It showed a statue , Rodin ’s “ Thinker . ”
The statue reminded me of him .
I ’d written a note on the back .
He looked at it carefully , holding the corner with his fingertips .
“ Thank you , Ms. Kuo , ” he said .
“ Thank you . ”
I told him I knew he could make it through eighth grade .
I told him that I would work hard for him , but that he would need to work hard , too .
It would take a lot of small steps .
I told him I would be at the ceremony when he graduated from high school .
At that , he grinned .
He had a gap between his front teeth .

If you want to change something , first you have to measure it .
That 's why the energy performance certificates you can now find on fridges , washing machines , cars and homes are so useful .
They show us where we are and where we need to go .
They are not always as clear as they first appear .
The rating system for fridges and freezers , for example , appears designed to bamboozle consumers .
On the charts stuck to every device , A looks like the top category in a simple scale from A - G .
But the most efficient fridge or freezer is actually an A ++.
An A should really be a C : the third - worst category .
Ever since this system came into play , retailers have been passing off goods which are literally third rate to energy - conscious customers .
Perplexed ?
You have n't seen anything yet .
Let me introduce you to the Kafkaesque world of the government 's privatised data services .
In principle you can – or so the government has promised – immediately discover how energy - efficient a public building is .
All you have to do is go online and look at the certificate ( which in this case is called a Display Energy Certificate ) which all such buildings – everything from government departments to theatres – of over 1,000 sq metres are now obliged to show .
There 's meant to be a hard copy visible in the building , and an electronic copy visible online .
But , as James Berry of the Energy Saving Trust has pointed out to me , it does n't quite work like that .
The government has outsourced the service to a company called Landmark Information Group .
So you go to its website to perform what should be a quick and simple search .
It says , " Click here to retrieve one of the below certificates or reports … Display Energy Certificate ( DEC ) " .
Having accepted some truly ridiculous terms and conditions you are then invited to enter the certificate 's identification number .
There 's just one snag : the only way to discover the identification number is to look at the certificate .
But you can't look at the certificate unless you have the identification number .
It 's a perfect catch - 22 .
Hoping that I might be able to solve the problem by telephone , I rang Landmark this morning , and spoke to a friendly man called Colin .
I told him I wanted an identification number for a Display Energy Certificate .
This is what he said .
" We are not allowed to disclose that information . "
" Why not ? "
" Unfortunately , that 's because of the way DCLG [ the Department for Communities and Local Government ] set up the contract .
I can't really comment on why we 're not allowed to release the information , because that 's the DCLG 's rules and regulations . "
" So how do I get to see the certificates in your database ? "
" You can view them if you 've got the number . "
" So how would I get the number ? "
" I would imagine you 'd probably struggle , to be honest . "
Thanks to some heroic efforts by the BBC Open Secrets blog , there is finally a publicly available database of Display Energy Certificates , but you wo n't find it on Landmark 's website .
It would n't be too difficult to devise a system that worked , would it ?
You would simply enter the name and address of the building and the certificate would appear .
But that would carry the danger that the system might actually work , and voters would then be able to see how public money is being spent .
Instead we have a system that is designed to be impossible to use , for which a private company is being paid by the taxpayer .
Is this what open government looks like ?

London 's Evening Standard became a free newspaper today .
The media world will be closely monitoring the paper 's progress as it adjusts to life after abandoning its 50 p cover price .
Evening Standard bosses made the switch to boost circulation from 250,000 to more than 600,000 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev , who bought the paper from the publisher of the Daily Mail , believes other newspapers will follow suit .
The newspaper had been under increased pressure from free newspapers in the city in the past few years , although one of these , thelondonpaper , recently closed .
Mr Lebedev , chairman of Evening Standard Ltd , has said doubling the paper 's circulation and " maintaining its quality journalism " is what London deserves .
" The Standard has been producing exceptional journalism since 1827 and that is not going to change under my ownership , " he added .
" The London Evening Standard is the first leading quality newspaper to go free and I am sure others will follow . "
Editor Geordie Greig said the decision was an " historic moment " as owners made the paper available to " more Londoners than ever before " .
He added : " The Standard has an exciting and secure future with this new , pioneering strategy of more than doubling our distribution .
" I also want the paper to continue being a cheerleader for London , the greatest city in the world .
We will celebrate where we can but also criticise and expose those who are not doing what is best for London and Londoners . "
The paper was launched in 1827 by businessman Charles Baldwin .
You might expect a man who graduated from Harvard Law School with honors , and was later a law clerk in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ( 1984 - 85 ) under Robert Bork , Ruth Ginsburg , and Antonin Scalia to know his stuff concerning the Constitution .
And with that kind of background you might also reasonably assume such a man would not suffer fools gladly when presented with an alternate view of reality on U.S. Constitutional matters .
Grayson uses the words of William Rehnquist and James Madison to destroy a rather hapless Paul Broun .
This is Rep. Alan Grayson and Rep. Paul Broun discussing a bill to deny funds to one specific named organization in a Science and Technology markup .
Such a bill is known as ' a bill of attainder ' .
h/t Ministry of Truth for the transcript
Chairman : " Mr. Grayson is recognized . "
Grayson : " Thank you .
I 'd like to ask the gentleman from Georgia a few questions , and I 'll yield to him for the purpose of having answers to these questions .
Um , does the gentleman from Georgia know what a Bill of Attainder is ? "
Broun ( R - GA ) " A bill of , the answer 's yes , in fact it 's been very explicitly described by the courts . "
Grayson : " What is it ? "
Looooooooooooooong pause while Broun looks through notes for an answer
Broun : " The courts have applied a two - pronged test .
Number one , whether specific individuals or entities are affected by the statute , Number two , when the legislation affects a quote " punishment " end quote , on those individuals , it serves no legitimate regulatory purpose . "
Grayson : " What , um , does the Constitution says about Bills of Attainder ? "
Broun : " Oh , I suggest that this is not a Bill of Attainder .
It 's , um , certainly does focus on a specific entity , but it does not inflict punishment by any means .
In fact . . . "
Grayson : " Will the gentleman from Georgia explain what the Constitution says about Bills of Attainder ? "
Outside Voice / another Republican : " Mr. Chairman , will the gentleman yield for a second ?
The gentleman from Florida ? "
Grayson : " No . I 'd like an answer to my question . "
Outside Voice / another Republican : " Well , frankly , I can't wait to see the discussion when it comes to . . . . "
Grayson : " I did NOT yield , and I 'd like an answer from the gentleman from Georgia to my question , I. . . "
Chairman : " Li , Li , Listen , let 's get back to all the time , is Mister , the gentleman from Florida , who will yield to the gentleman from Georgia , will . . . "
Grayson : " Right .
What does the Constitution say about Bills of Attainder ?
It 's a simple question . "
Broun : " The Constitution says " Congress shall pass no Bills of Attainder " but this is not one . . . "
Grayson : " Alright , now , would you agree with me that it is Unconstitutional to single out one or more persons without the benefit of trial ? "
Broun : " Uh , no sir , there is a two - pronged test , this is not a Bill of Attainder , it is . . . "
Grayson : " Alright , well , when I , when I said , I 'll reclaim my time .
I just quoted William Rehnquist writing the book " The Supreme Court " , he wrote that book and said " You can not single out one or more persons without the benefit of a trial . "
Will the gentleman agree that Bills of Attainder are contrary to every principle of sound legislation ? "
Broun :
" The two main criteria which courts would like to look , in order to determine whether legislation is a Bill of Attainder , one is whether a specific individual / entity is affected by extension , number two , whether the legislation affects a punishment to the individuals . . . "
Grayson : " Will the gentleman please tell me whether you agree or not that Bills of Attainder are contrary to every principle of sound legislation ? "
Broun : " Bills of Attainder are Unconstitutional . "
Grayson : " AND contrary to every principle of sound legislation , is that correct ? "
Broun : " That 's correct . "
Grayson : " Alright .
And you know who said that ? "
Broun : " Tell me . "
Grayson : " James Madison in the Federalist papers . "
" Now , do you , does the gentleman agree that the Bill of Attainder clause was intended not as a narrow or technical provision , but rather as an implementation of the separation of powers , and a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function , or more simply , trial by legislation .
Will the gentleman agree with me on that . "
Outside Republican : " Will the Gentleman yield ? "
Grayson : " No . "
Laughter throughout the committee room , then silence . . .
Outside Representative : " Um , the , the , will the gentleman restate the question ? "
Grayson : " The question is , will the gentleman from Georgia agree with me that the Bill of Attainder clause was intended not as a narrow or technical provision , but rather as an implementation of the separation of powers , and a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function , or more simply , trial by legislation .
Will the gentleman agree to that ? "
Broun : " No , sir , I will not , and I ask counsel to help us with this , I think all this is determination of the court and I 'd like to appeal to Mr. Sensenberner ( wingnut whose name I refuse to spell correctly )
Grayson : " Well , I 'm sorry , but it 's my time , not yours or Mr. Sensenberner 's , so I will reclaim my time , and I will point out that what you just you would NOT agree to is from a Supreme Court case called the United States V Brown , something I would expect you might know about , given your name . "
Outside voice : " Will the gentleman yield ? "
Grayson : " No . "
One voice laughs
Grayson : " Uh , listen , we , we are trampling on people 's Constitutional rights .
And I think it 's unfortunate that the mania that exists on the other side of the aisle regarding this one organization , and we know why that mania exists , it 's because they 've registered an awful lot of Democrats , continues to distort and waste the time of this committee and many other committees here in Congress .
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !

Captain Picard , the tech is overteching !
As keynote speaker for the recent New York Television Festival “ Development Day , ” Battlestar Galactica and Caprica creator Ronald D. Moore addressed many different aspects of creating and sculpting the new incarnation of BSG .
He also discussed how he broke into the business and the eight years he spent working as a writer and producer on Star Trek : The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine .
The best and funniest moment during the 55 - minute discussion emerged when one fan asked Moore why the decision was made in Battlestar to use technology that was similar to , and in some cases behind , our own .
His response to the question was illuminating not only in that the audience learned how good the esteemed writer was at doing impersonations , but also how ridiculous sci- fi gets when it becomes diluted by Hollywood formula and how it inspired him to build a better show .
Ron Moore on the reason to not let technology overshadow the characters on Battlestar Galactica :
“ That was in the original inception of the show , and that was really a reaction against Star Trek .
It ’s easy for me to bash Star Trek because I lived and breathed it so long , but I loved it , so let ’s make that clear .
I do n’t hate Star Trek by any means , but I got very frustrated with the amount of technobabble I had to write on it .
It became the solution to so many stories and plotlines .
You would just be writing these endless pages …
It was so mechanical that we had science consultants who would just come up with the words for us .
If you look at those scripts you ’ll see that .
Picard would say : ‘ Commander La Forge , tech the tech to the warp drive . ’
Geordi : ‘ Captain , the tech is over teching !’
‘ Well , the auxiliary tech to the tech , Mr. La Forge . ’
‘ No , Captain , I ’ve tried to tech the tech , but it wo n’t work ! ’
And then Data pops in and says : ‘ Captain , there is a theory that if you tech the other tech … ’
It ’s a rhythm and it works anyplace .
It ’s not about anything except going through this dance of how they tech their way out of it .
It became so frustrating and so annoying , I just swore I was never going to write those scenes anymore .
I just decided from the outset [ of Battlestar ] that I wanted a phone to look like a phone and wanted a retro technology .
I justified it in the story because they had this back story with the Cylons — the technology had rebelled and they had gone backwards .
I thought it was interesting to go that route and make the technology relatable in the same way that their coats and ties were relatable as well . ”

The wrinkle - faced bat looks ferocious but is a " gentle " fruit - eating bat
The wrinkle - faced bat 's strangely shaped skull gives it a remarkably strong bite force , say scientists .
Researchers report in the Journal of Zoology that this bizarre - looking bat has evolved a powerful bite that may give it an advantage over other bats .
It allows it to eat a broader range of foods than other small fruit - eaters with weaker bites .
The tiny creature , which weighs just 17g , produces bite forces up to 20 % higher than other bats of similar size .
The Centurio senex bat has a extremely short and wide skull , the shape of which has long puzzled evolutionary biologists .
A strong bite may give Centurio senex the edge over other bats
Enlarge Image
" We found that relative to head size , Centurio generates the strongest bites known for any fruit - eating phyllostomid ( or leaf - nosed ) bat , " explained lead author Elizabeth Dumont from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the US .
They proposed that a shortage of softer fruits during " lean times " may have provided a selective pressure , driving the evolution of its oddly - shaped skull .
" The New World leaf - nosed family of bats exhibits spectacular diversity in diet , " explained Professor Dumont .
" Centurio is a dedicated fruit - eater , but the family also contains insect - eaters , nectar - feeders , species that eat small vertebrates - such as lizards , frogs , rodents - and vampire bats .
" Although Centurio looks ferocious , it is a small and gentle animal . "

Need some figurative caffeine ?
Are you feeling stuck on the page , unable to write another line because your brain hurts , the inspiration is gone , and chances are you ’ve been slaving away on a project far too long ?
Before you stick your head in a vise , try a few of these little tricks I use to get unstuck long enough to wrap up another segment of the writing project you ’re slogging away on :
Turn your last idea inside out .
Are you writing about trying to succeed at something ?
Turn your idea on its head and write about failure for a few paragraphs .
If you ’re writing history , try a flight of fancy –speculate about something that might have happened had things turned out differently .
Be negative .
It does n’t have to be negativity per se , actually .
Invoke a strong emotion you have n’t used lately .
Get worked up , put some energy into the piece .
Abuse some substances … slightly .
Sugar , caffeine , peanut butter , a glass of Chardonnay in the middle of the morning , whatever it takes to get your brain moving in a slightly different direction .
Do n’t overdo it on any of these , just prod yourself a little .
Contradict your last paragraph .
Take the devil ’s advocate point of view for a few lines and see what happens .
Change the subject .
Anytime you hit a creative roadblock , try just changing topics , locations , anything .
Or ditch the section you ’re on and start a section ahead and revisit the old one tomorrow .
Say something outrageous .
Then either disprove it or back it up .
One of these tricks will grease the gears and get the old brainbox humming again .
If not , I guarantee double your money back .
What ’s that ?
You have n’t paid ?
Step this way , please …

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued a press release in which she purports to rebut those of us who have expressed doubts about the constitutionality of some health care reform plans .
Pelosi ( or her ghostwriter ) claims :
“ The 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states … or to the people .
But the Constitution gives Congress broad power to regulate activities that have an effect on interstate commerce .
Congress has used this authority to regulate many aspects of American life , from labor relations to education to health care to agricultural production .
Since virtually every aspect of the heath care system has an effect on interstate commerce , the power of Congress to regulate health care is essentially unlimited .
( bolded in original ) .

For several reasons , this is a highly misleading statement .
First , it fails to mention a concern expressed by many constitutional scholars , including those on the Left : Substantive due process .
“ Substantive due process ” is the doctrine by which the Supreme Court strikes down laws it deems unacceptably interfere with personal privacy or autonomy .
Health care laws that , for example , limit one ’s ability to fund and control one ’s own health care could well run afoul of substantive due process rules .
Second , the statement fails to mention that , while the Supreme Court has upheld many delegations of power from Congress to executive branch agencies , the Court has affirmed repeatedly that there are limits .
Some health care proposals involve wider delegations of authority than any since the New Deal ’s National Reconstruction Adminisration ( NRA ) — which was invalidated by a unanimous Court .
Third , the Pelosi release disregards the fact that on several occasions the modern Supreme Court has struck down overreaching federal legislation , supposedly adopted under the Commerce Power .
Also , on several occasions , the Court has interpreted congressional acts narrowly to avoid constitutional conflicts .
Fourth : Pelosi ( or her speechwriter ) clearly misstate the current Supreme Court ’s test for laws under the Constitution ’s Commerce Power .
The statement that Congress can regulate “ activities that have an effect on interstate commerce ” should be that Congress can regulate “ economic activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce . ”
Non-economic activities , such as some health care decisions , would have to meet a much stricter test .
This may seem to be a minor mistake , but for legal purposes it is an important one , and one that , for the Speaker of the House of Representatives , is not easily excusable .
Finally , Pelosi ( or her ghostwriter ) commits the mistake of failing to look at wider judicial trends .
One of these trends is the long - term movement by the Supreme Court toward interpreting the Constitution according to its real meaning – the original understanding of the Founders and Ratifiers .
And virtually no knowledgeable person thinks government health care is constitutional under that standard .

The word “ luau ” means “ feast ” in the Hawaiian language .
Luaus mean more than just good food , though – they mean a gathering to share good fun as well !
So here are some tips for hosting a truly memorable luau .
First , set a budget and allow plenty of time to plan and set up the luau .
In Hawaiian tradition , real luaus took months to prepare because Hawaiians did n’t have any of today ’s labor - saving devices .
So take advantage of calendars , calculators and party supply stores .
And since a luau is a practice of South Pacific culture , think “ tropical ” when setting up party plans .
Use decorations such as tiki torches along with palm tree cutouts , shells , candles , leis , straw hats , grass skirts , silk flowers , and brightly colored streamers .
In other words , go “ coconuts ” with bright tropical décor .
Hold your luau outside if at all possible .
Should space or weather cause the party to move inside , be sure the decorations and food are portable .
Make life and clean - up easier for everyone with paper and plastic utensils .
Next , be sure your guests know the party theme of “ Hawaiian luau . ”
They can get out their flashiest Hawaiian shirts , shorts , sarongs , grass skirts , surfer baggies , sandals and any other island gear .
Be sure you greet each guest with a hearty “ Aloha ! ” and a plastic or silk flower lei .
When it comes to beverages , plan to offer tropical cocktails like Pina Coladas , Mai Tais and Daiquiris .
Have non-alcoholic versions of these drinks as well , along with pitchers of iced tea or punch with plenty of floating fruit slices .
Serve the drinks in coconut shells if possible , and be sure to top them with little cocktail umbrellas !
Get out plenty of pineapple and fresh fruit chunks for the food menu .
Pineapple juice makes a great marinade for meat as well .
Check online recipes sites for authentic Hawaiian delicacies .
Some traditional foods include poi , Lomi salmon and chicken long rice .
Beef and pork with a teriyaki sauce marinade is also a sure winner .
A whole roast pig turning on a spit is an impressive option , but only attempt this is you ’re brave or experienced .
A local butcher shop should be able to help you find a pig suitable for roasting .
If the pig is too much of a challenge , then stud a nice big ham with pineapple rings and cloves .
Fun at a real luau involves games and tests of skill and strength .
If youngsters are invited , consider having them string their own leis with fake flowers and fishing line .
Give a Hawaiian twist to familiar games by playing “ Hot Coconut ” instead of “ Hot Potato , ” or “ Pin on the Piggy ’s Tail . ”
Grown-ups and older children can join in spear - throwing contests with darts or racing around an obstacle courses ( no fire - dancing , please ! ) .
Prizes for these games can include small , tropical - themed toys and gadgets for the kids , or some Kona coffee , one of Hawaii ’s greatest exports , for the adults .
No Hawaiian luau would be complete without island music .
Party stores often have CDs of beach tunes and Hawaiian songs , as do libraries , friends or online music sites .
The most important thing to remember about a Hawaiian luau is that it ’s all about the fun and conviviality – for the hosts and the guests .
Barbara Loe Fisher , president of the National Vaccine Information Center , an advocacy group that questions the safety of vaccines , said the swine flu has “ breathed new life ” into the cause .
“ People who have never asked questions before about vaccines are looking at this one , ” Ms. Fisher said .
The increased interest is frustrating to health officials , who are struggling to persuade an already wary public to line up for shots and prevent the spread of the pandemic .
According to a CBS
News poll conducted last week , only 46 percent said they were likely to get the vaccine .
The nationwide poll , which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points , found that while 6 in 10 parents were likely to have their children vaccinated , less than half said they were “ very likely to . ”
“ I wonder if the people disseminating this false information about this vaccine realize that what they are doing could result in some people losing their lives , ” said Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding , the director of the Department of Public Health for Los Angeles County .
The comments of vaccine dissenters , which he said “ politically come from the left and the right , ” were frequently “ not just counterproductive , ” he said , “ but downright disgraceful . ”
Web sites , Twitter feeds , talk radio and even elevator chatter are awash with skeptics criticizing the vaccine , largely with no factual or scientific basis .
The most common complaint is that the vaccine has been newly formed and quickly distributed without the benefit of clinical trials ; in fact , the swine flu vaccine was made using the same techniques as seasonal flu shots over the last two decades , and a small number of clinical trials were conducted this year to determine the adequate dose .

There are also claims that the vaccine contains adjuvants  sometimes added to make vaccines more effective  although they have not been used in this one .
In addition , there is fear that the vaccine could lead to Guillain - Barré syndrome , as was suspected the last time a swine flu vaccine was distributed , in 1976 ; flu vaccines are now much purer than they were , minimizing the risk , and Guillain - Barré is far rarer .
Everyone knows the flip of a coin is a 50 - 50 proposition .
Only it ’s not .
You can beat the odds .
So says a three - person team of Stanford and UC - Santa Cruz researchers .
They produced a provocative study that turns conventional wisdom , well , on its head for anyone who has ever settled a minor dispute with a simple coin toss .
It also could have profound implications in America ’s favorite sport — pro football — because the coin flip plays an integral role in deciding games that go into overtime .
But first , here ’s what the researchers concluded : Using a high - speed camera that photographed people flipping coins , the three researchers determined that a coin is more likely to land facing the same side on which it started .
If tails is facing up when the coin is perched on your thumb , it is more likely to land tails up .
How much more likely ?
At least 51 percent of the time , the researchers claim , and possibly as much as 55 percent to 60 percent — depending on the flipping motion of the individual .
In other words , more than random luck is at work .
The humble coin toss has been the subject of considerable study by researchers exploring concepts such as probability and statistics .
There even was an unscientific look by a prisoner who once flipped a coin 10,000 times inside his cell .
“ But they ’ve all been wrong because people write down whether it comes up heads or tails , but they do n’t know how it started , ” said Susan Holmes , a Stanford University statistics professor who co-authored the study , which was published in 2007 .
“ You have to know how it starts . ”
And if you know that , the researchers believe , then you have a better chance of knowing how it will land .
The power of a coin flip
Tossing a coin long has been a choice for deciding trivial matters — like a dinner - table spat over the last piece of pizza .
But coin flips also have played much more prominent roles .
The Oregon city of Portland got its name after a best two - out - of - three penny toss by two settlers .
( Boston was the losing name . )
There was a fateful coin flip on Feb.
3 , 1959 , that allowed early rock ‘ n ’ roll star Ritchie Valens to get a seat on a small plane that was supposed to carry him , Buddy Holly and two others to their next concert site .
The plane crashed shortly after takeoff , killing all four .
The coin flip even is found in literature and cinema .
Javier Bardem won an Oscar for his role in the 2007 film version of Cormac McCarthy ’s “ No Country for Old Men ” in which the villain tosses a coin to decide whether he should kill someone or let them live .
But nowhere in modern society does the coin flip loom larger than in sports — specifically the NFL .
A coin toss determines which team gets the football first in overtime if the score is tied after regulation play .
And heading into this season , the team winning the overtime toss had won 63.3 percent of the games — and won the game 43.3 percent of the time on its first possession , preventing the other team from even touching the ball .
Consider the very first game of the season , on Sept. 10 , when Tennessee quarterback Kerry Collins called the overtime coin toss and lost .
Pittsburgh elected to receive the kickoff and marched down the field for the game - winning field goal .
But before the coin flip , referee Bill Leavy , a former San Jose policeman and firefighter , had held the silver dollar out on his thumb .
It would have been clearly visible to Collins if he had looked .
The Stanford and University of California - Santa Cruz researchers would suggest that Collins missed a golden opportunity to shade the odds in his favor .
Although the study ’s results would seem to potentially tilt the NFL ’s playing field , the league office in New York does n’t believe it has a problem .
Officials were surprised that anyone had bothered to conduct a study examining coin - tossing odds .
They studied what ?
At the 49ers training facility in Santa Clara , players had two initial reactions :
1 ) Do n’t those eggheads have more important things to do ?
2 ) You ’re pulling my leg .
But the more the 49er players listened , the more they became intrigued .
They quickly saw how — if the study were accurate — they might be able to gain an advantage .
Center Eric Heitmann , a Stanford graduate and 49ers captain , said : “ I ’ve never heard anything like that before , but I guarantee that I will be thinking about it each time I ’m out there for the coin toss . ”
A sly smile even emerged on the face of linebacker Takeo Spikes , another 49ers captain .
“ And if it works for us , I ’ll be the first one to support that study , ” he said .
That , countered kicker Joe Nedney , is just plain ridiculous .
He was n’t buying the study one bit .
“ There ’s so much variance in how a coin is flipped , ” Nedney said .
“ How could you possibly know how many rotations the coin makes ? ”
Researchers would say Nedney was not asking the right question .
The determining factor is not how high a coin is flipped , according to the study .
Nor is it any other variable such as wind speed , air temperature or phase of the moon .
It ’s not the size or the weight of the coin , either .
( Legendary football coach Vince Lombardi was said to be a “ heads ” man because he mistakenly believed more metal on that side of the coin increased the odds of it landing up . )
It ’s all in the thumb .
“ The way we flip coins creates a bias , and that makes it stay more time in the position it starts in , ” said Holmes , the Stanford professor .
Holmes co-authored the study with Persi Diaconis , her husband who is a magician - turned - Stanford - mathematician , and Richard Montgomery , a UC - Santa Cruz mathematics professor , in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the physics involved .
Using a camera from the Stanford engineering department that snapped 1,000 frames per second , they determined that the laws of basic mechanics play a large role .
Coins flipped from a thumb do n’t merely rotate around their axis , but they also spin like a Frisbee .
The degree of that Frisbee spin depends on the motion of the thumb .
The more Frisbee spin , the longer the side facing up stays facing up when the coin is in the air .
And the longer the side facing up stays facing up , the better chance it will land that way .
“ Some people flip in a more biased way than others , ” Holmes said .
“ There ’s always bias to the side that ’s facing up , and the variance depends on the motion of the flipper . ”
A firm landing surface , like a wood table , changes the equation .
But grass — or the synthetic FieldTurf used in some NFL stadiums — mirrors the landing conditions used in the study and does not materially change the outcome .
If they had only known
That ’s why the results might have been of interest in the NFL — if anyone had known about it .
Titled “ Dynamical Bias In The Coin Flip ” when published in 2007 in the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Review , the paper drew a smattering of interest .
But it flew almost entirely under the radar in the sports world — where the impact could be the greatest .
“ We got a call from something called ‘ ASPN , ’ ” Holmes recalled .
She meant ESPN .
And no , she ’s not much of a sports fan .
Fans often grouse about what they see as the inherent unfairness of the NFL overtime system — usually after their favorite team loses a coin flip , and then the game .
Ray Anderson , a former Stanford player and the NFL ’s executive vice president of operations , said the league is well aware of the statistical edge favoring the team that wins the overtime coin toss .
Almost every offseason , the NFL competition committee discusses changing its overtime rules .
But the players largely are opposed to change because they worry that extending the length of the game would increase the risk of injury .
“ So until there ’s something more telling or seems to really violate the integrity and spirit of fairness , it probably wo n’t change , ” Anderson said .
“ There has n’t been anything dramatic enough to compel a change . ”
Not even research that claims the coin flip is not a 50 - 50 proposition ?
“ I really ca n’t add anything on the study because I was a political science major at Stanford , ” Anderson joked .
The 49ers kicker Nedney , with tongue firmly planted in cheek , suggested that there could be other ways of determining who gets the ball first in overtime .
“ We should start having it decided with Rock , Paper , Scissors , ” Nedney said .
“ Have the two captains out there battling the best two out of three .
Or the referee should stand between the captains and say , ‘ I ’m thinking of a number between one and 10 . ’ “

Mr. Karroubi works from a villa on a quiet street in Tehran that ends at a rundown palace once occupied by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi .
It is one of the many symbols of his standing among the revolutionary elite .
He was jailed nine times by the shah and spent years in prison , where he grew close to inmates of widely different political persuasions : nationalist , socialist , Islamist , said Rasool Nafisi , an Iran expert based in Virginia .

“ These forced companionships , Karroubi wrote in his autobiography , made him aware of the pain of the others , and relieved him from sectarian behavior , ” Mr. Nafisi said .
After the overthrow of the shah , Ayatollah Khomeini put Mr. Karroubi in charge of the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee and the Martyrs Foundation , two of the nation ’s most important and wealthiest institutions .
He also served twice as speaker of Parliament , where he earned a reputation as a conciliator ; served on the powerful Expediency Council ; and was appointed adviser to the subsequent supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
So it was hard for the leadership to brand him an enemy of the state when he posted on his Web site last month an impassioned , unyielding and damning letter to the nation , written in response to the judicial finding that his allegations of the rape of imprisoned protesters were unfounded .
“ The ugliness has reached the point that instead of the perpetrators and propagators and people behind this oppression , it is Mehdi Karroubi whom they want to put on trial , ” he wrote .
“ I take refuge with you , oh God , from these catastrophes which some are causing and are not only a disgrace to the Islamic republic , but a disgrace to Iran . ”
Mr. Karroubi ’s disenchantment with the revolution he helped create began not with the elections in June , but with the balloting that brought Mr. Ahmadinejad to office four years ago .
Mr. Karroubi was a candidate then , too , and late into the night after the polls closed , he was running second , behind Mr. Rafsanjani .
So it turns out that Contessa Brewer had good reason to see a connection between the rabidly hateful rhetoric spewed by the likes of Pastor Steven Anderson and the angry , gun-toting protesters turning out for presidential events :
One of the most prominent of these , an African - American man named " Chris " , is in fact a member of Pastor Anderson 's congregation .
" Chris " was on Alex Jones ' " Prison Planet " radio show late last week and discussed how " my pastor was beaten up " at a Border Patrol checkpoint .
Yes , that pastor is indeed Steven Anderson , who was arrested in April by the Border Patrol for being uncooperative at a patrol checkpoint .
Anderson attempted to make himself something of a national martyr to the conspiracists out there by posting a video to YouTube about it that quickly went viral .
Jones took note of the Anderson connection :
Jones : Now I 'm starting to get a clearer picture .
You go to Pastor Anderson 's church , I see .
Chris : Yeah , yes I do .
Proudly .
I think it 's the best church in the world .
The funny thing about these gun-toting protesters is that they like to portray themselves as being simple , honest defenders of their gun rights when they show up for public events , especially those featuring the president , packing heat publicly .
They adamantly deny that they 're bringing their guns to intimidate their fellow citizens from speaking out with a contrary view .
But this is beyond disingenuous ; it does n't take a genius to figure out that the vast majority of the people who attend a public debate will perceive someone with a gun as someone they should fear -- particularly if they have an opposing view .
Most people will see someone with a gun at an event that does not deal with guns as a potential threat .
And you can't tell me that most of these gun-toters are not perfectly aware of the intimidation factor they carry with them and are not in fact packing heat for just that reason .
Moreover , these gun-toters want to assure us they pose no threat whatsoever to either the president or his supporters by bringing these guns .
They 're just ordinary citizens standing up for their rights , right ?
The Secret Service need have no fear about their motives .
But then we find out that at least one of them ardently admires a pastor who preaches how much he hates Obama and wishes him dead , in order " to save this country . "
And we 're supposed to tell these " innocent " gun nuts from the people who might actually aim their weapons at the president how ?

Ramiro Rivera , Nueva Trinidad
A leader in the movement opposed to re-opening the El Dorado goldmine in northeast El Salvador was in stable condition after being shot eight times in the back and legs .
Doctors at San Salvador ’s Rosales Hospital said it was “ miraculous ” that Ramiro Rivera survived the attack , which occurred in front of Rivera ’s modest house .
Rivera identified one of two assailants as Oscar Menjívar , who was detained by police in Cabañas , where both men reside .
Ramiro Rivera is President of the local Community Development Association ( ADESCO ) of Nueva Trinidad , a small community located in the unpaved highlands of Cabañas Department .
In 2005 , as exploration permits were offered to the US / Canadian Pacific Rim Mining Corporation , the community found that it was in the crosshairs of a proposed gold mine .
As the company began to drill deep holes to estimate the quality of gold deposits , residents noticed their wells were drying up .
Some wells were poisoned by unknown chemicals , leading in some cases to stillborn calves and dead livestock .
Rivera was reluctantly elected to lead the group after residents accused the previous ADESCO Board of receiving hush money from Pacific Rim representatives in exchange for their silence regarding the mine ’s potentially detrimental impacts .
When Rivera took the helm , he organized three road blockades near Nueva Trinidad that prevented exploratory equipment from being transported into remote areas .
Rivera has previously reported threats against his life that he said were based on his opposition to the goldmine .
As complaints about the impacts on the region ’s water supply rippled , people throughout Cabañas actively confronted Pacific Rim contractors who brought heavy equipment into the backwoods .
In July 2008 , the company paused its exploratory work and publicly stated that its feasibility study about mining gold deposits could not be completed .
The accused Menjívar had previously attacked mining opponents .
According to Jesse Freeston , a US - based reporter who has covered events in Nueva Trinidad , Menjívar was arrested last year for a machete attack on Santos Rodriguez , a farmer also from Nueva Trinidad .
Rodriguez lost two fingers in the attack , but Menjívar was released after three days in jail and was never tried for the crime .
Freeston said that Menjívar ’s rapid release was likely due to political connections he built with mayors in Sensuntepeque ( Jesús Edgar Bonilla Navarrete ) and Ilobasco ( José María Dimas Castellanos Hernández ) .
Both mayors hail from the ARENA political party and support re-starting operation sat El Dorado .
The attack against Ramiro Rivera was another in a series of violent El Dorado - related incidents in Cabañas Department .
Last month , the body of Marcelo Rivera , an outspoken mining opponent , was found in a well after he had been forcibly disappeared 12 days earlier .
Marcelo — no relation to Ramiro — was founder of the Amigos de San Isidro , a local pro-ecology group which had warned residents about the poisonous impacts of cyanide - leach goldmining upon local water reserves .
Reporter at Radio Victoria
Earlier in July , a local parish priest outspoken on the mining issue barely escaped a harrowing kidnapping attempt by armed assailants .
And reporters from the Radio Victoria community radio station have received a broad volley of death threats over the last few months .
The threats are communicated through mail , text messages and phone calls .
One of which exhorted the newsgatherers to “ shut your mouths , or we will shut them forever . ”
The National Roundtable Against Metal Mining — a coalition of local residents , environmentalists , unions and faith - based activists — has denounced the disappearances , threats and attacks .
The group has mobilized public support for Cabañas activists nationally and internationally .
The group recently won the 2009 Letelier - Moffett Award presented by the Institute for Policy Studies for its human rights and environmental work .
However , contrary to expectation , the group has run into a tepid response on the mining issue from Mauricio Funes ’ administration .
Funes made his opposition to mining a talking point in his campaign stump speeches earlier this year , but his administration has done little to ratchet down on perpetrators of violence in Cabañas .
Funes himself has not commented on the future of mining under his stead , and police maintain that Marcelo Rivera ’s death was void of political motives , claiming he was murdered by a local gang .
In the larger political arena , Funes seems to be acquiescing to pressure from Pacific Rim and other corporate players .
When ex-President Tony Saca refused to grant the El Dorado permit citing “ political ” problems , Pacific Rim responded by suing El Salvador under the provisions of CAFTA to recoup $ 77 million of investment .
But instead of arguing malfeasance on the part of Pacific Rim , Funes ’ chief Economic Advisor , Alex Segovia , lamented in a recent interview that the Salvadoran government , “ is losing all of these cases , because in the first place , contracts and the rules of the game have been broken . ”
Such an admission was a tacit implication that the government would negotiate a settlement with Pacific Rim , though Segovia would not explicitly elaborate further .
In the interim , another mining company who has been denied operating permits has filed a separate $ 100 million claim against El Salvador .
( Note : El Salvador has not lost a case in the CAFTA courts to date . )
Regardless of a potential deal the central government might strike with Pacific Rim , the facts on the ground relay that local opposition to mining will have to be broken before any gold could be extracted .
Social opposition to mining spans the political spectrum in Cabañas , as ex-President Saca found out the hard way .
Meanwhile , National Rountable Against Metal Mining , has maintained its opposition to corporate control of land and resources in Cabañas .
It has demanded a full government investigation of the murders , kidnappings , attacks and threats .
In addition , the group has called on Salvadoran President Funes to defend against Pacific Rim ’s lawsuit , asserting that a nation has an obligation to protect its environment and honor the democratic will of those who would be directly affected by mining .
Perhaps the group ’s position can best be summed up in the words of Maria Leyva , a local resident who participated in a 2008 action :
“ We oppose mining because we want a good future for our children .
We ask that the Government not only govern for those with power , but also for we who live in the communities , because here is where we deal with the reality [ of their decisions ] . ”
It remains to be seen if Funes and his advisors will respond to Ms. Leyva by acting to quell rampant impunity in Cabañas , or whether they will fan the flames of corporate intrusion , thus inevitably generating continued local resistance .
( Update : An earlier version of this chart labeled the Y - axis “ dollars in billions , ” which is of course inaccurate .
Apologies to folks at Goldman for implying that this year ’s bonuses would make them quadrillionaires . )
Will have a column on Goldman ’s earnings later in the day .
In the meantime , thought I ’d share a chart I whipped up this morning :

* Abortion rates fall but unsafe abortions still kill 70,000
* Women in countries with restrictive laws are at risk
* Dangerous abortion imposes heavy economic , health burden
LONDON , Oct 13 ( Reuters ) - Increased use of contraceptives has pushed global abortion rates down , but unsafe abortions kill 70,000 women each year and seriously harm or maim millions more , a global report said on Tuesday .
Despite easier access to abortion with restrictions being relaxed in many countries , the number of abortions fell from an estimated 45.5 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003 , the report by the U.S. - based Guttmacher Institute said .
But the study found a stubbornly high number -- almost 20 million -- of unsafe abortions , mostly in poorer countries and often carried out by the women themselves using inappropriate drugs or herbal potions , or by untrained traditional healers .
" It is significant and tragic that while the overall rate of abortion is on the decline , unsafe abortion has not declined , " said Sharon Camp , president of the Guttmacher Institute , a think - tank which studies sexual and reproductive health .
" Legal restrictions do not stop abortion from happening , they just make the procedure dangerous .
Too many women are maimed or killed each year because they lack legal abortion access , " she told a news conference in London .
CONTRACEPTION CHEAPER
The researchers said 40 percent of women still live in nations where abortion is highly restricted , and called for greater effort to improve access to contraception to prevent some of an estimated 76 million unwanted pregnancies each year .
They also said that in the developing world as a whole , healthcare for women harmed by unsafe abortions costs an estimated $ 500 million .
" Behind every abortion is an unwanted pregnancy , " said Akinrinola Bankole , the Guttmacher 's international research director .
He said developing countries and donor nations should look at the figures , which he said clearly demonstrated that " preventing unwanted pregnancy is cost - effective " .
In Nigeria , for example , a recent study showed the costs of treating women for complications caused by botched abortions were some $ 19 million , while it would cost only $ 4.8 million to provide contraception for those who wanted it .
The researchers said preventing the need for abortion entirely was unrealistic , but said eliminating unsafe abortion by improving access to contraception and increasing pressure to lift abortion restrictions was a worthwhile and achievable goal .
" Women will continue to seek abortion whether it is safe or not as long as the unmet need for contraception remains high , " Camp said .
" With sufficient political will , we can ensure that no woman has to die in order to end a pregnancy she neither wanted nor planned for . "
Camp pointed to the Netherlands as an example of best practice and said she hoped to see global abortion rates come down from the current rate of 29 per 1,000 women aged between 15 and 44 rate , to the Dutch rate of around 10 per 1,000 .
" It 's a long way off , but it 's not impossible , " she said .
ROME 
For months , the staid newspaper of the Italian Bishops ’ Conference , Avvenire , steered largely clear of the major topic of conversation here : the spicy personal life of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
But when readers complained that maybe a Roman Catholic newspaper had a moral duty to denounce divorce , consorting with teenage girls , naked poolside parties and being caught on tape telling a prostitute to wait for him in “ Putin ’s bed ” while he showers , the newspaper ’s editor began to weigh in .
“ People have understood the unease , the mortification , the suffering that this arrogant neglect of sobriety has caused the Catholic Church , ” the editor , Dino Boffo , wrote last month .
On Thursday , Mr. Boffo was out of a job .
Late last week , Il Giornale , the newspaper owned by Mr. Berlusconi ’s brother , called Mr. Boffo “ a homosexual known to the Italian secret services ” and the culprit in a sexual harassment suit .
Il Giornale ’s attack expanded on Thursday , with another editorial aimed at the Catholic Church itself , mocking not just the “ hypocrisy ” of sexually active priests with “ weak flesh , ” but even the “ Mitteleuropean ” accent of Pope Benedict XVI , a German .

The delay could hurt Sun , the No. 4 maker of computer servers , by allowing its rivals more time to poach customers before Sun became part of Oracle , the world ’s No. 3 software maker , and thus became able to take advantage of its sales resources , analysts said .
Sun last week reported a loss of $ 147 million in its most - recent quarter as revenue tumbled .
Rivals Hewlett - Packard
Co and IBM have already been offering discounts and other incentives to woo Sun customers since Oracle agreed to buy Sun in April .
Sun shares fell 1.8 percent while Oracle shares fell 1 percent on Thursday .
“ The ( European ) Commission has an obligation to ensure that customers would not face reduced choice or higher prices as a result of this takeover , ” Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement .
Legal experts and analysts following the review said they expect European regulators will ultimately approve the acquisition , clearing the last hurdle for the deal to close .
But they said Oracle may need to make concessions , including the divestiture of Sun ’s MySQL software business , and that it is unclear how long European approval would take .
The process is unlikely to extend beyond January 19 , the deadline set by the Commission , the competition watchdog of the 27 - country European Union .
That would put Oracle months behind its original plan for closing the deal .
Oracle has already received the green light from the U.S. Department of Justice for its takeover of Sun , developer of Java software , which is among the world ’s most widely used computer languages .
Christopher Thomas , a Brussels - based antitrust lawyer at law firm Lovells , said the Commission ’s in - depth probe showed it was more cautious than its U.S. counterparts but did not necessarily mean the deal would be derailed .
MySQL is used to run popular websites operated by companies include Google Inc , Facebook and Amazon.com .
Its main customer base is small and mid-sized businesses .
Its primary competitor is Microsoft Corp ’s SQL Server .
Oracle ’s database , which is the top - selling product in the market , is far more robust , allowing companies to quickly access larger quantities of data .
Most companies that use MySQL do not pay for the software , which is available under a free , open - source license .
Sun also offers a paid version that comes with support services .
Eben Moglen , chairman of the Software Freedom Law Center , said he believed the European Commission is concerned that Oracle will prevent developers from adding features to make MySQL more powerful , which would make it more competitive with Oracle ’s database .
“ This is a reasonable concern from a legal point of view .
From a business concern , it is pretty obvious , ” Moglen said .
The Commission said it was concerned that the open source nature of MySQL might not eliminate fully the potential for anti-competitive effects .
With Oracle ’s databases and MySQL competing directly in many sectors of the database market , MySQL is widely expected to represent a greater competitive constraint as it becomes increasingly functional , the EU executive said .
Oracle , IBM and Microsoft are the main players in the proprietary database market .
Analysts have expressed doubts on whether Oracle ’s acquisition of MySQL would stifle competition in the $ 19 billion a year database market .
Sun generates about $ 300 million in revenue from MySQL .
Oracle brought in about $ 9.2 billion in database sales last year , according to market researcher Gartner .

Two weeks after the German election , the new coalition government is struggling with the consequences of the economic crisis .
Both the Christian Democrats and the FDP want to lower taxes to please the electorate , but the country 's massive budget deficit means that cost - cutting and tax hikes are more realistic .

A controversial Arizona sheriff known for taking a hard line against illegal immigrants has been stripped of some of his powers in what he described as a political move by the Obama administration .
Joe Arpaio , a gruff lawman who styles himself as America 's toughest sheriff , has won acclaim from US anti-immigrant forces for his relentless pursuit of mostly Hispanic illegal immigrants in Maricopa county , Arizona , a fast - growing county of 4 million people that is home to Phoenix , the nation 's fifth largest city .
Arpaio 's aggressive tactics include the jailing of illegal immigrants in tent cities surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of Arizona 's searingly hot summers , the reduction of meal costs to 20 cents per day , the use of pink jail clothing for men , and chain gangs for women inmates .
Arpaio also came in for criticism when he appeared on the Fox reality show Smile : You 're Under Arrest .
Under a two - year - old agreement with the federal department of homeland security , Arpaio and his deputies had been authorised to enforce federal immigration law by arresting suspected illegal immigrants in the field and by checking the immigration status of people arrested on other offences .
The department of homeland security includes the US immigration and customs enforcement ( ICE ) agency .
But after drawing thousands of complaints and a civil rights investigation from the justice department , Arpaio was this week stripped of his federal authority to make immigration arrests .
County attorney Andrew Thomas , one of Arpaio 's supporters , condemned the " setback in the fight against illegal immigration " .
For his part Arpaio has promised to continue chasing illegal immigrants using state laws .
In an angry press conference , he called US homeland security officials " liars " and said he would personally drive those caught on the streets to the border if federal officers refused to take arrested illegal immigrants into custody .
" I 'll take a little trip to the border and turn them over to the border , " he said .
Arpaio 's critics decried his continued plans to arrest illegal immigrants and said the Obama administration should sever all ties with him .
The now - rescinded authority to conduct field sweeps of illegal immigrants yielded only about 300 out of the roughly 33,000 total arrests of illegal immigrants since 2007 , the Obama administration has done little to curtail Arpaio , said Frank Sharry , executive director of immigration reform advocacy group America 's Voice .
" He 's going to go down in history as a man who terrorised the Latino community for the sake of his own visibility and political popularity , " Sharry said .
" The fact that the Obama administration would lend any of its legitimacy to any of his activities is surprising and disappointing . "
Arpaio was first elected sheriff in 1993 .
" The department of homeland security is making a historic mistake if it continues its relationship with Sheriff Joe Arpaio , " said Paco Fabian , spokesman for immigration reform advocacy group America 's Voice .
" The federal government is lending its full force and legitimacy to a rogue cop certain to go down in history as a serial violator of civil rights and an enemy of the Latino community . "
An estimated 12 million illegal immigrants live in the US .
The federal government is virtually paralysed over how to react , with conservatives like Arpaio calling for the arrest and deportation of illegal immigrants and increased border enforcement .
Obama , many Democrats and some Republicans call for a system that will allow most to gain legal status after paying a fine and learning English , but reform efforts in 2006 and 2007 withered under sustained rightwing opposition .
More than 60 law enforcement agencies across the country have signed onto the same programme under which local officers are effectively deputised to enforce immigration law .
But critics of the programme say it wastes police resources needed to fight street crime , promotes racial profiling of Hispanics , targets peaceful workers , breaks up families and breeds distrust of police among immigrants , who become afraid to report crime for fear they will be asked for immigration papers .

A pure cannabis cigar is perhaps the ultimate joint and a must for the rich , famous and well connected .
Using exotic , hard - to - get ingredients this can be a hard one to get together .
First , find yourself a thai stick , ( cured buds tied around a bamboo sliver )
Remove any thread and carefully coat it with liquid cannabis resin oil .
Wrap the coated stick with small , uncured , ' top ' leaves , taking care to remove any stems .
Secure the leaves with thread and coat with more liquid resin .
Leave the cigar to dry in a dark , dry and warm place for a day or so .
Remove the thread and repeat the entire process .
Use progressively larger cannabis leaves until the cigar is suitably fat .
Use large ' sun ' leaves to seal the cigar , add a final coat of cannabis resin and secure with more thread .
Leave the finished cigars to dry .
In two to three weeks it should be ready to smoke .
When drying is complete , remove the thread and carefully pull the bamboo sliver from inside the cigar to create a smoking tube .
Store your cigars in a dry air - tight container - the longer you leave them , the better ( and stronger ) the y will get .
A ‘making of ’ video of sorts has surfaced of Bungie ’s amazing live action Halo 3 : ODST short released earlier this month , giving a behind - the - scenes look at just how much effort went into filming the epic trailer .
Why do n’t we just cut out all the bullshit and have these guys make the actual movie eh ?
Actually it ’d be really cool if they released a full length movie in the same style , I really like how they let the images created in the scenes do the talking , well at least the discernible talking .

Sir Alex Ferguson is unconcerned whether Carlos Tevez recovers from a knee injury in time to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .
He is more pleased that the player he identifies as City 's biggest threat , Emmanuel Adebayor , is suspended .
While Tevez 's move from United to City created controversy , Adebayor has scored four goals in as many league matches .
His ban for last weekend 's stamp on Robin van Persie means he will be consigned to the sidelines .
" I am not bothered whether Tevez plays or not – Manchester City 's best player wo n't be playing , " said Ferguson .
" Adebayor is their star player , there is no question about that .
He has scored in every game so far . "
Ferguson repeated his assertion that City behaved in an " arrogant and cocky " manner when they displayed their infamous Tevez " Welcome to Manchester " poster in the city 's main shopping area last summer .
The Scot is aware the derby has far more interest and significance now City are pushing for a place in the top four , having spent in excess of £ 120 m this summer .
However , he will continue to view Liverpool as United 's major local rivals .
" To me , Liverpool has always been the derby , " he said .
" It is because of the history .
My aim was always to do well against them .
It is hard for me to think any other way . "
Ferguson has admitted he is concerned by Rio Ferdinand 's nagging groin injury .
The defender 's early - season appearances have been limited because of a thigh injury he picked with England last month , while his injury problems date back to last December , when he suffered back spasms during the Club World Cup that kept him out for six weeks .
He has missed four games this season and despite a return against Tottenham Hotspur , he was forced to sit out the mid-week Champions League match and could miss the derby .
" It is a concern for us and something we could have done without , " said Ferguson .
" He has one game back and picks up another injury when he really needs some games to get back to his maximum .
" We do n't need to make a decision right away but he really has to do something positive in training to give himself a chance .
We hope he is there , though .
We want all our big players for this particular game . "
Now bankers have the nerve to sue for £ 30 m in lost bonuses
A group of City bankers is flying in the face of public anger and suing an investment bank for £ 30 million in unpaid bonuses .
The lawsuit , the biggest of its kind ever lodged in London , comes as the Government attempts to curb excessive payouts , which have been blamed for contributing to last year 's financial meltdown .
The 72 traders and dealmakers - all current or former staff of German bank Dresdner Kleinwort - claim they were paid just a tenth of the bonuses they were promised .
Lawsuit : Seventy - two bankers who work for , or used to work for , Dresdner Kleinwort 's London office have sued for £ 30 million in unpaid bonuses
Six of the claimants are demanding more than £ 1 million each - despite Dresdner making a loss of £ 5.5 billion last year .
The biggest single claim is by Jonathan Powell , a former options trader for the bank , who is asking for £ 1.46 million .
He says he is missing out on £ 319 in interest each day on the outstanding amount .
Also on the list are foreign exchange traders Ian Robertson , who is claiming for £ 1,313,940 and Dominic Yip , who is demanding £ 1,062,275 .
Both calculate daily interest on the sums as £ 288 and £ 232 respectively .
Head of energy trading Sergio Pagani - claiming £ 944,268 - and head of inflation trading , Matthieu Robert - demanding £ 885,140 - are also included .
The extraordinary class action comes nearly a year since the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers , which wreaked havoc in the banking sector and triggered the global recession .
Eddy Weatherill , chief of consumer group the Independent Banking Advisory Service , said : ' That sort of legal action will fuel others to attempt it .
' At some stage common sense must reign .
It does n't matter what economic cycle we are in , the bankers always come out smelling of roses . '
The claims were launched yesterday in the High Court against Dresdner and its new owner Commerzbank .
It is believed that the case will be heard sometime next year although some experts believe the bank could settle in advance .
The claimants - all of whom come from a part of the bank that was profitable and focused on bonds and fixed income activities - argue that the bank reneged on guarantees to pay out bonuses worth a minimum of 400 million euros ( £ 351 million ) .
Clive Zietman , partner at Stewarts Law , which is representing the bankers , said : ' This is a very strong case and in some ways a very straightforward case . '
However , a spokesman for Commerzbank said that a slump in its profits last November and December resulted in a ' material adverse change ' in its fortunes , which entitled the bank to pay just 10 per cent of what it had originally earmarked .
He added : ' Dresdner Bank was entitled to take the actions it did in relation to these Dresdner Kleinwort employees ' discretionary bonuses in light of the marked deterioration in the investment bank 's performance in the months of November and December 2008 .
' We will be defending these claims vigorously in the courts . '
Although he refused to say how many of the claimants still work within the bank , it is believed only a handful remain .
Commerzbank has embarked on a wave of redundancies this year , and is still restructuring its UK operations .
As a result , the fate of many of its employees is still uncertain .
The lawsuit was filed as leading bank executives defended the City 's bonus culture yesterday .
Deutsche Bank 's chief executive Josef Ackermann said banks were still vying to hire the best dealmakers by offering lucrative pay packages , and attacked regulators for putting ' too much focus on bonuses ' .
Meanwhile , Walid Chammah , co-president of Morgan Stanley , said his firm is ' against absolute caps on compensation levels ' .
Commerzbank is being represented by law firm Linklaters .
A local sportswear and memorabilia merchandiser will donate 10 percent of its sales on the second Sunday of every month of the pro football season to the
Pennsylvania SPCA
to support homeless and abused dogs , according to a news release .
Sports Blitz , which has stores at 3071 William Penn Highway in Palmer Township and at 2544 MacArthur Road in Whitehall Township , will host the SPCA -- and adoptable 2nd Chance Dogs -- for kickoff events at noon and 4 p.m. Sunday at both locations .
2nd Chance
Dogs are pit bulls that have been rescued and rehabilitated .
Sports Blitz has decided not to sell any Michael Vick - wear at the stores .
Vick , who recently signed with the Philadelphia Eagles , spent two years in custody after participating in dog fights .
It was a " philosophical " decision on the part of the company , spokesman Geoff Slick said .
They said , " Let 's do the right thing here . "
He said the promotion was " kind of a reaction " to Vick 's signing , but that it is a " perfect fit " for the stores .
" With lives of Japanese people in danger , we think that we should make a pre-emptive attack if it is clear that North Korea intents to launch a missile against Japan . "
The party 's position in relation to China is no less direct .
" China is a huge military nation , " she said .
" They own a lot of missiles that are a danger to Japan .
That is why we view China as a great menace to Japan . "
Urging the nation to prepare itself for the possibility of military confrontation with China , she added : " They have already sent their troops to areas in Taiwan and Okinawa , the southern region of Japan .
It 's now 30 years since the publication of the first Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy novel .
Yet though the subsequent period of Hitchhiker - mania – by 1984 encompassing two radio series , four novels , a TV series , computer game and three major stage productions – may be over , the phenomenon has proved as indestructible as its constantly reincarnated bit - part character , Agrajag .
A fifth novel was published in 1992 and the franchise even survived the 2001 death of creator Douglas Adams : a film version and three further radio series have appeared within the last five years .
This month , the story has once again hit the headlines thanks to the imminent publication of a sixth Hitchhiker 's novel , And Another Thing by Eoin Colfer , the bestselling Irish author most famous for his Artemis Fowl series .
Judging by the frenetic blogosphere coverage it has generated , many are still obsessed by this tale of intergalactic high jinks .
Others , however , remain immune to the charms of a story most famous for its manically depressed robot and comedic use of the number 42 .
After all , is n't it just for science fiction geeks ?
I do n't think it 's only concerns over self - image which would cause many fans to answer with a resounding no .
For one thing , it 's debatable to what extent Hitchhiker 's is science fiction at all , but however it 's tagged , the cosmic setting is , to me at least , all but incidental .
Adams himself insisted he had n't set out to write science fiction , but simply found himself without many other options after he blew up the Earth in episode one of the original radio series .
And although he expressed admiration for Kurt Vonnegut and Robert Sheckley , Adams 's main literary influences , AA Milne and PG Wodehouse , were notably more earthly .
True , he did spend a period writing for Doctor Who , but he also wrote for Monty Python 's Flying Circus ; in many ways , Hitchhiker 's has far more in common with the latter series .
Although the majority of the saga is set on distant planets , and contains plenty of real - life science and technology , at its core it retains a thoroughly surreal and very English sense of humour .
Such a combination might sound incongruous , but it 's a formula which would help pave the way for everything from Red Dwarf to Men in Black ( the latter , admittedly , rather more transatlantic in its comedy ) .
The story 's most fundamental themes , meanwhile , include such reassuringly earthy – and earthly – subjects as cricket and towels .
Yes , this is a story populated by such exotic characters as Gargravarr , the disembodied mind in charge of the Total Perspective Vortex , and Eccentrica Gallumbits , the triple - breasted whore of Eroticon Six .
Yet there are also mentions of rich tea biscuits , Islington shops , Which magazine and American Express cards .
Spaceships await deliveries of lemon - soaked paper napkins ; aliens watch gameshows and take holidays in Bournemouth .
Main protagonist Arthur Dent is more Peepshow 's Mark Corrigan than Captain Kirk , sporting a dressing gown , forever in search of a nice cup of tea , and responding to his enforced interplanetary adventures with disgruntled , beta - male sarcasm .
Ford Prefect , his alien companion , likewise favours drunken parties over Star Wars - style heroics .
As Stephen Fry , one of the series ' most noted fans , told the South Bank Show , he was first attracted to Hitchhiker 's because , in contrast to most science fiction , " it was absolutely on a human scale " .
The broad appeal of Hitchhiker 's can be measured , in part , by the sheer range of high - profile figures involved in its various incarnations .
The five radio series , for instance , have found room for New York comedy legend Jackie Mason , astronomer Patrick Moore and Hollywood star Christian Slater , a group whose eclecticism is only enhanced by the additional presence of Richard Griffiths , David Jason , Rula Lenska , Joanna Lumley and theatre maverick Ken Campbell .
Alongside Martin Freeman , the film version featured Alan Rickman , John Malkovich , Helen Mirren , Bill Nighy , Bill Bailey and the rapper Mos Def .
Either list is a far cry from any standard roll call of SF fans .
But The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy is not without its faults .
Plots , for instance , can be weak , in part due to Adams 's notorious inability to hit deadlines .
Large portions of the saga were conceived at the last possible minute , often under house arrest by whoever had the misfortune to be his editor at any given point .
The third novel , Life , the Universe and Everything , sees Adams mercilessly cannibalising pre-written stories , with decidedly mixed results , whilst its successor , So Long , and Thanks for All the Fish , is a soppy affair apparently betraying troubles in its author 's own love life .
( Thankfully , the bleak Mostly Harmless represented a significant return to form . )
Also – and sadly this is a trait which does chime with science fiction stereotype – the Hitchhiker 's universe also suffers from a lack of women .
Trillian and Fenchurch , the only significant female characters , are almost as two - dimensional as Random , Arthur 's rather clichéd adolescent daughter , who shows up in the final novel .
For all that , however , the Hitchhiker 's saga remains thoroughly deserving of investigation – both on its own terms and for its wider contribution to contemporary popular culture .
( Purists , incidentally , would advise starting with the first radio series . )
It should perhaps be glossed over that revoltingly slick funk - pop act Level 42 are reportedly named after the story 's most famous gag , but take heart from the fact that Sanjeev Baskhar 's The Kumars At No 42 was so named for the same reason .
The Babel Fish online translation service is just one other example of the story 's reach , as is the popularity of its various catchphrases – including the one which should be borne in mind by all Hitchhiker 's newbies : " Do n't panic " .
James Dyson with the new Air Multiplier fan , which instead of blades uses forced air around its ring , and the shape of an airplane wing , to create a rapid and smooth flow of air .
Few inventions have lent themselves to as little improvement over the years as the simple fan , with its whirring blades that blow air across a desk or through a room .
But now even the conventional fan has been transformed .
James Dyson , the British inventor behind the vacuums that bear his name , has come up with an incredibly simple - looking , circular fan that has no blades .
It uses " Air Multiplier " technology to push 119 gallons of smooth air out every second .
The conventional fan relying on blades has been largely unchanged for about two centuries ; the first mechanical fans are said to have been built in the Middle East in the early 19th century .
Ceiling fans blew onto the scene in the 1860s , powered by running water and a setup that turned a series of belts with the ability to operate several fans at once ( some of these still exist in old buildings ) .
A personal electric fan hit the market in the 1880s .
But the traditional design is not perfect , Dyson figured .
Fan blades chop the air , creating an uneven airflow with buffeting bursts and moments of weaker flow .
Here 's how the new setup works :
Air is pulled into the machine 's cylindrical base with an impeller that draws from jet - engine technology .
The air rushes up into a hollow ring .
The air is then forced out of a 1.3 - millimeter - wide slit ( less than 1/16th of an inch ) that runs all around the ring .
Here 's the tricky part , developed during four years of testing :
As the air exits through the slit in the ring , it flows over the inner edge of the ring , which was modeled after an airplane wing .
Imagine an airplane wing bent around into a loop .
The air encounters what would be the leading edge of the wing , said Dyson engineer Andy Samways .
When it hits the wing - like structure , the air speeds up , creating an area of low pressure .
" Air or any fluid will tend to hug a smooth surface , " Samways explained in a telephone interview .
" Air over a wing follows the profile , and that creates lift . "
As the air exits the loop , the lower pressure pulls air from behind the fan along with it , and air around the front of the fan also gets pulled into the stream .
That 's simple physics .
But it was the wing - like ramp that served as a breakthrough .
" We realized that this inducement , or amplification , effect could be further enhanced by passing airflow over a ramp , ” said James Dyson .
“ This was the point where the idea of a bladeless fan became a real possibility .
Here was a way to create turbulent - free air and finally do away with blades . ”
Getting rid of blades has visible benefits :
The new fan needs no safety grill , and what few parts there are can be easily cleaned .
It runs on a small motor , and airflow can be fully regulated with a dimmer switch .
The 10 - inch fan is available now starting at $ 299.99 .
7.05 am :
There has been an intriguing build - up to today 's Quds ceremony ( it 's sometimes spelt ' Qods ' , I 'm not sure which is correct ) .
Here are the main developments :
• Quds , or Jerusalem , Day is celebrated in Iran as a day to denounce Israel .
But the opposition is hoping to use it as an opportunity to vent their anger under the legal guise of an official rally , as Middle East analyst Meir Javedanfar explains .
• The defeated presidential candidates Mir Hossien Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi , together with the reformist former president Mohammad Khatami , have pledged to attend the protests .
Banners have appeared in Tehran with pictures of Mousavi bearing the slogan : " Quds Day , Green Day " referring to the colour that has become synonymous with the protest movement .
• Iran 's police chief warned the opposition against using the ceremony as an anti-government demonstration .
• Hashemi Rafsanjani traditionally leads Friday prayers on Quds day , but he has been replaced by Ayatollah Seyyed Ahmad Khatami - a conservative cleric with strong ties to Ahmadinejad ( not to be confused with former presidient Mohammad Kahatami ) .
If you need a catch - up on Iran , there 's an informative discussion on what 's been happening since the post-election unrest on Blogging Heads TV .
Iran specialists Michael Rubin and Jamsheed Choksy cover Ahmadinejad 's new cabinet , the economy , the future of the universities and the continuing power struggle between hardliners and the pragmatists within the regime .
They agree that the radical question raised by the unrest is : " Why does Iran still need a supreme leader ? "
There continues to be tough restrictions on journalists in Iran which means that reliable information is difficult to obtain , so if you are in Iran and have news , please email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk or post updates or interesting links in the comments section below .
7.10 am :
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad again denied rigging the election .
In his first interview with a western broadcaster he was asked twice , " Did you steal the election ? "
He replied : " I do n't know what you mean .... we should be courageous enough to accept the vote of the people . "
He also described Neda Soltan 's death as " suspicious " .
7.20 am :
Opposition rallies are planned in Tehran , Isfahan and Tabriz .
Blogger homylafayette has published the planned routes of the marches .
7.30 am :
A contact in Tehran says he plans to attend today 's opposition rally , but he does not expect a mass demonstration like those in June .
Asked on email how many he thought would attend , he said : " Not millions , but that 's not important . "
The man , an academic , added : " If there is any unrest that would be very embarrassing for the government on such a special day . "
He said that while the willingness to demonstrate may have decreased , the anger has not , and the legitimacy of the regime has gone .
Asked what he thought of the leadership of the opposition he said : " I do n't think very highly of politicians in such a system .
We look forward to changes , not those who bring them about .
When I voted for Mousavi I expected much less of him .
I think he was n't expecting it either .
He turned into a revolutionary necessarily . "
7.43am :
The are chants of " death to the dictator " in central Tehran , according to usually reliable reports on Twitter and ePersian radio , which is run by Iranian exiles in California .
In between breaks for music it is broadcasting what sounds like mobile phone audio from protesters .
There are also reports that Karroubi has joined the protests .
8.05 am :
Security forces have clashed with opposition protesters in Tehran , according to a flash on Reuters .
8.10 am :
State - funded Press TV is showing live pictures of people gathering in Tehran for the official Quds day rally .
Some are dressed in green , but its broadcaster claims those gathering are united in favour of Palestine .
Press TV also confirms that Ahmadinejad will be speaking at Friday prayers .
8.22 am :
A picture claiming to show opposition supporters today in Karim Khan Street under a large green banner , has been posted by blogger onlymehdi .
8.40 am :
State TV is broadcasting footage of Quds day rallies from previous years to hide the protests , according to blogger homylafayette .
This is difficult to verify - there is a huge mismatch between the images claiming to show the official rally currently being broadcast , and the numerous reports of demonstrations posted on Twitter and blogs , and broadcast from Iranians outside Iran .
8.48 am :
Ahmadinejad is giving a pre-sermon speech at Friday prayers at Tehran University .
State - funded Press TV is broadcasting the speech live .
He begins with familiar anti-Israeli rhetoric .
Speaking about the founding of Israel , he says " criminal Zionists usurped Palestinian land with the help of the British " .
Meanwhile protesters have been chanting on the streets of Shriaz , according to this video , which is claimed to have been filmed today .
Another video from Shiraz shows opposition chanting anti-Russian slogans .
They also shout ' Neither Gaza , nor Lebanon , my life for Iran ' , which suggests it was filmed today .
9.01 am :
Thousand of protesters have shouted pro-opposition slogans today , according to the BBC .
9.08 am :
An al - Jazeera 's reporter in Tehran says he has witnessed opposition supporters chanting against the regime .
He said they were out - numbered by those on the official rally and the security forces .
He said the security forces were acting with restraint .
9.24 am :
Ahmadinejad is still speaking about the " destruction of the Zionist regime " .
Once again he denied the Holocaust .
" The pretext ( Holocaust ) for the creation of the Zionist regime ( Israel ) is false ...
It is a lie based on an unprovable and mythical claim , " he said according to Reuters .
9.29 am :
There have been clashes between protesters and basij militia in Taleghani Square , in Tehran , according to a usually reliable source on Twitter .
9.33 am :
Ahmadinejad has finished his speech .
I did n't hear him make mention the protests or the disputed election .

CNN 's ireport is showing an image of protester today splattered in blood with a gash on his head .
A new video purporting to show hundreds of protesters chanting in Isfahan today has been posted to YouTube .
9.49 am :
Former president Mohammad Khatami has been involved in a scuffle .
The reformist website Parleman News blames the attack on the son of the editor of the hardline newspaper Keyhan .
It is claimed that the windows of Khatami's car were reportedly smashed by hardline vigilantes when he turned up at today 's rally .
He was also said to have been jostled , with the result that some of his turban was knocked off , before being rescued by supporters .
10.02 am :
A number of pictures showing green - clad opposition supporters have been posted to Twitpic .
10.16am :
A stream of videos all purportedly from today are being posted to YouTube by onlymehdi .
They include this one of protesters chanting support for Mousavi and former president Khatami .
10.39 am :
A translation from the BBC 's monitoring unit on that Parlemannews report confirms the attack on Khatami .
10.46am :
The Guardian 's former Iran correspondent Robert Tait is monitoring events from Istanbul .
He writes :
Ahmadinejad was giving a live interview on IRIB 's Channel Two from the
scene of Quds Day .
As he spoke , viewers could clearly hear the chants of " Ahmadi , Ahmadi , resign , resign " - this all over live TV .
Apparently Ahmadinejad was aware of the chants and their effect on the interview .
He is said to have become flustered and quickly wrapped up the interview .
11.11 am :
Another video , just uploaded to YouTube by onlymehdi , purports to shows protesters chanting support for Mehdi Karroubi and " down the dictator " .
11.17am :
Al Jazeera cites " reports " that Mousavi 's car was attacked at the rally .
But many claim this is incorrect .
ePersian Radio says he was prevented from leaving home this morning .
This follows a familiar pattern .
In the aftermath of the election there were numerous conflicting rumours about Mousavi .
On most days there were reports on Twitter that he had been arrested .
So far he has not been arrested .
11.39 am :
" This is seriously big " says one of the comments on this new video which purportedly shows thousands of opposition supporters on Karim Khan Street , in Tehran today .
11.57 am :
At least 10 protesters have been arrested , according to Reuters .
" Supporters of Ahmadinejad are beating supporters of Mousavi near the Vali-ye Asr street .

An e-mail message buried by the Bush administration because of its conclusions on global warming surfaced Tuesday , nearly two years after it was first sent to the White House and never opened .
The Bush administration , and then EPA administrator Stephen Johnson , refused to release the document when it was written in 2007 , and labeled it “ deliberative , do not distribute ” to Democratic lawmakers .
The White House instead allowed three senators to review it in July 2008 , when excerpts were released .

The e-mail and the 28 - page document attached to it , released Tuesday by the Environmental Protection Agency , show that back in December of 2007 the agency concluded that six gases linked to global warming pose dangers to public welfare , and wanted to take steps to regulate their release from automobiles and the burning of gasoline .
The document specifically cites global warming ’s effects on air quality , agriculture , forestry , water resources and coastal areas as endangering public welfare .
That finding was rejected by the Bush White House , which strongly opposed using the Clean Air Act to address climate change and stalled on producing a so - called “ endangerment finding ” that had been ordered by the Supreme Court in 2007 .
As a result , the Dec. 5 e-mail sent by the agency to Susan Dudley , who headed the regulatory division at the Office of Management and Budget was never opened , according to Jason Burnett , the former EPA official that wrote it .
The Obama administration in April made a similar determination , but also concluded that greenhouse gases endanger public health .
The EPA is currently drafting the first greenhouse gas standards for automobiles , and recently signaled it would attempt to reduce climate - altering pollution from refineries , factories and other large industrial sources .

In response , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republican lawmakers have criticized the EPA ’s reasoning and called for a more thorough vetting of the science .
An internal review by a dozen federal agencies released in May also raised questions about the EPA ’s conclusion , saying the agency could have been more balanced and raising questions about the difficulty in linking global warming to health effects .
The agency released the e-mail and documents after receiving requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
Adora Andy , a spokeswoman for EPA administrator Lisa Jackson , said Tuesday that the draft shows the science in 2007 was as clear as it is today .

“ The conclusions reached then by the EPA scientists should have been made public and should have been considered , ” she said .
Some time ago I wrote an entry that got some attention about the Blu-ray format and why I refuse to release anything on it .
It ’d be nice to release the text adventure documentary in what Blu - Ray claims to be , but reality showed it not to be the case .
I was alerted recently to the fact that the Blu-ray fees I quoted had been modified , and were “ more friendly ” to independents , that is , groups for whom $ 5 - $ 10 k in fees are not chump change or somewhere near a couple days of catering bill .
Obviously this is not everyone but it ’s basically everyone I care about .
Naturally , I took a look .
I am referring , here , to this document , which is an excellent overview of the current fee schedule and changes made .
However , bear in mind that to truly understand what all the fees , licensing and issues are for you , you ’re really going to have to hit up the AACS site and download all the licensing agreements .
I am not in any way suggesting normal people do this , but to really get a handle on what it all means , you have to grab all that stuff , and trust me , any document with the words “ WITNESSETH ” in the contracts you have to sign is probably not something you want to waste your time on , unless you ’re a lawyer or hiring one , or actually want to release stuff on Blu-ray .
Then you kind of have to do it .
So here ’s the high - level message relating to these new changes related to the Blu-ray fees :
FUCK BLU - RAY .
I just wanted to make it clear .
The new changes , which are the “ final ” licensing setups ( the previous terms I covered were “ interim ” ) , are just as henious and stupid as they ’ve always been .
The pain has been shifted around and I guess for people who are looking for any silver lining in a fart you can convince yourself that the new terms are more “ independent friendly ” .
But the fact is they ’re more independent friendly just as not setting a house on fire that you just robbed is “ homeowner friendly ” .
A reasonable person whose tab is not being picked up by a huge , fat company with insider lines and entire legions of lawyers looking for some leathery contract to chew on still has no reason to go with Blu-ray .
Steady as she goes – this thing is as open and loving as a customized cartridge that plugs into a customized system and charges you an arm and a leg to make the cartridge .
Just because the “ cartridge ” is a disc that in ye olde days was a pretty inexpensive way to get your message out does not mean we ’re anywhere near the same animal .
Listen to me , people : a / v components being built now will decrease resolution on images if it “ suspects ” you ’re doing anything “ wrong ” with it .
Do you realize how sick that is ?
That we let it come to this ?
I mean , check this ass - fuckery :
Analog “ Sunset ” provision
The final AACS License agreements also include provisions to phase out the use of analog output in Blu-ray players .
It says that all Blu-ray players manufactured after December 31 , 2010 must limit the analog output to SD resolution .
After December 31 , 2013 , no device that can decrypt AACS content can have any analog outputs .
The intent of this is to limit casual piracy and has no effect on how you author your Blu-ray discs .
Did you see that ?
And you ’re fine with this ?
They ’re fucking breaking the functionality of shit just because they can and you ’re fine with this ?
Anyway , back to the new terms .
As mentioned before , these fees are related to the innovation and R&D of a given format .
The idea is that because a lot of research went into the items , the groups who have patents on them will get fees and payments related to the creation of the items .
It ’s a way to ensure that people who create stuff are then given money and credit for the years they spent working through all the hurdles of their technology .
You make an amazing new nail - clipper , and then everyone who buys your nail - clipper is paying $ 0.05 to the nail clipper inventor .
CDs and DVDs had this going on for many years , and we did n’t really care because the cost ( as low as pennies a disc ) were in the realm of chump change .
DVDs charged more , but again , it was enough that a duplicator would n’t even bring it up as a cost on your side ; you were just charged X for each duplicated disc , and some piece of that went to fees and to licensing and whatever .
The situation with Blu-ray is that the fees are significant enough , and the AACS bullshit is so mandatory now , that even duplicators have to let you know about it , lest you find them entirely uncompetitive or in some way ripping you off .
So let ’s address the base issue here : copy protection is mandatory .
That is , if you want to make a Blu - Ray disc , you have to put copy protection on it .
You have to pay for the privilege of the copy protection .
There is no situation where you ca n’t have that copy protection .
It ’s not even particularly good copy protection , since people are ripping Blu - Ray discs quite happily and have for significant months now .
But you have to have it and you have to pay for it .
A bunch of my issues with this format rise from this set of situations , where you are being latched onto mandatory crap -ass restrictions and licensing for something you very likely do n’t even fucking want .
Any of the changes they ’ve made to the fee structure is just a shell game after that .
Previously , you had to pay $ 3000 for your special key for your Blu-ray disc .
You had to buy this thing and you had to use it , and if the duplicator did n’t use it they ’d lose the license to duplicate discs .
Now , you can choose to pay $ 500 a year for this special key , paying every year you are duplicating discs ( up to ten years ) for a total of $ 5000 .
Or , you can pay the $ 3000 up front .
In other words , they have composed a loan - shark system around the key payment .
I do n’t know what part of that makes you say “ wow , they ’re opening up to independents ” .
The rest of the changes are similar .
You pay $ 500 for the use of a key you just paid that $ 500 to get .
You pay per disc for the use of that key .
You also have a number in there , a special arbitrary number , that defines you as an “ independent ” .
It is all wasted money , so you can buy into a system trying to close itself off and go completely vertical and keep people who are not part of the syndicate out .
It ’s heinous .
Sorry , I ’m sticking with it .
Fuck Blu -Ray .

Treated monkeys can now see in technicolour .
Dalton , a squirrel monkey treated with gene therapy , enjoys his new colour sense .
Neitz Laboratory
Researchers have used gene therapy to restore colour vision in two adult monkeys that have been unable to distinguish between red and green hues since birth — raising the hope of curing colour blindness and other visual disorders in humans .
" This is a truly amazing study , " says András Komáromy , a vision researcher and veterinary ophthalmologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , who was not involved in the research .
" If we can target gene expression specifically to cones [ in humans ] then this has a tremendous implication . "
About 1 in 12 men lack either the red - or the green - sensitive photoreceptor proteins that are normally present in the colour - sensing cells , or cones , of the retina , and so have red–green colour blindness .
A similar condition affects all male squirrel monkeys ( Saimiri sciureus ) , which naturally see the world in just two tones .
The colour blindness in the monkeys arises because full colour vision requires two versions of the opsin gene , which is carried on the X chromosome .
One version codes for a red- detecting photoreceptor , the other for a green - detecting photoreceptor .
As male monkeys have only one X chromosome , they carry only one version of the gene and are inevitably red–green colour blind .
A similar deficiency accounts for the most common form of dichromatic color blindness in humans .
Fewer female monkeys suffer from the condition as they have two X chromosomes , and often carry both versions of the opsin gene .
" Here is an animal that is a perfect model for the human condition , " says Jay Neitz of the University of Washington in Seattle , a member of the team that carried out the experiment .
The monkeys were trained to touch a screen when they saw coloured patches .
Neitz Laboratory
Neitz and his colleagues introduced the human form of the red- detecting opsin gene into a viral vector , and injected the virus behind the retina of two male squirrel monkeys — one named Dalton in honour of the British chemist , John Dalton , who was the first to describe his own colour blindness in 1794 , and the other named Sam .
The researchers then assessed the monkeys ' ability to find coloured patches of dots on a background of grey dots by training them to touch coloured patches on a screen with their heads , and then rewarding them with grape juice .
The test is a modified version of the standard ' Cambridge Colour Test ' where people must identify numbers or other specific patterns in a field of coloured dots .
Colour coded
After 20 weeks , the monkeys ' colour skills improved dramatically , indicating that Dalton and Sam had acquired the ability to see in three shades ( see video ) .
Both monkeys have retained this skill for more than two years with no apparent side effects , the researchers report in Nature1 .
Adding the missing gene was sufficient to restore full colour vision without further rewiring of the brain even though the monkeys had been colour blind since birth .
" There is this plasticity still in the brain and it is possible to treat cone defects with gene therapy , " says Alexander Smith , a molecular biologist and vision researcher at University College London , who did not contribute to the study .
" It does n't seem like new neural connections have to be formed , " says Komáromy .
" You can add an additional cone opsin pigment and the neural circuitry and visual pathways can deal with it . "
ADVERTISEMENT
Three human gene therapy trials are currently under way for loss of sight due to serious degeneration of the retina .
These phase I safety studies injected a similar type of virus vector ( but carrying a different gene ) behind the retina as in the monkeys , and people treated have shown no serious adverse effects more than a year after , with some participants reporting marked improvements in vision2 .
These first human trials — which repair rods , a different type of photoreceptor cell — can be seen as a safety benchmark for any future treatment of cone diseases and colour blindness in humans , says Neitz .
" The biggest issue is that people who are colour blind have very good vision , " Neitz says .
" So before people are going to want to treat colour blindness you 're going to want to ensure that this is completely safe , and that 's going to take some work . "
The Public Option Is Popular Among People .
But What About Among Land ?
You know what the public option is ?
Popular .
Always has been , still is .
Much more popular than health - care reform generally .
And yet it still might not pass .
Democrats might strip one of the most popular portions out of a politically contentious bill .
Kevin Drum comments :
If Democrats really do lose the House next year ( about which more later ) , this will be why .
If they do n't pass a healthcare bill at all , they 'll be viewed as terminally lame .
If they pass a bill , but it does n't contain popular features that people want — like the public option — they 'll be viewed as terminally lame .
At a wonk level , a bill without a public option can be perfectly good .
But wonks are n't a large voting bloc , and among people who do vote , the public option is very popular .
So , um , why not pass it ?
Because the Senate is where dreams go to die .
It 's not a coincidence that the chamber representing the American people will pass a bill including the public option while the chamber representing American acreage is likely to delete it .
The public option has majority support .
But a lot of that popularity comes because a lot of people live in liberal centers like California and New York .
It actually does n't have a majority in Nebraska , where not very many people live , or , I 'd guess , in North Dakota , where even fewer people live .
In the American political system , it 's not enough to be popular among the voters .
You also have to be popular among wide swaths of land .
Did n't you watch " Schoolhouse Rock " ?
All that said , I 'm not at all convinced the public option , at least as Schumer conceives of it , is off the table .
I try not to be naive about the worth of policy arguments in political debates , but virtually no Democrats have actually offered an argument against the level - playing - field public option , and the policy actually answers most of the arguments that they have offered , such as Conrad 's concerns about Medicare payment rates to rural hospitals .
That 's going to make for some interesting meetings , and it might give Schumer an opening .

We humans like to keep a linear , categorical , literal view of things .
When we say we ’re in control , we ’re in control — we think .
One thing we ’ve never as a species quite wrapped our minds around is the inversion .
This is a logical technique where you argue for something that you claim is against what you really want , but in such a way that it validates you using force or force of law to get what you want .
The most popular variant of this is claiming to fight for freedom , demand rights , or empower the disempowered .
This positive goal gives you moral legitimacy to demand the inversion :
If I fight for freedom , I must fight and destroy the enemies of freedom , which requires that I suspend freedom .
Instead of pointing out that “ freedom ” ( for example ) is a broken argument because , unlike natural selection or other ideas , it does not take into account all possibilities , the inverter deliberately selects an abstract , vague , fuzzy goal so that they can change the focal point of the argument to that goal — and then move the “ background details ” to empower their own actual crusade , which is to have power .
We ’ve seen this too many times — a leader claims he ’s doing something positive , and so he is given power , which he then runs away with .
We can see it in social discourse , too .
It ’s not socially acceptable to disagree with the empowerment of anyone , except those who do n’t talk about empowering others .
They could either be fascists , or they could be suggesting a more realistic solution , which makes us the fascists when we enforce it upon them .
One great fallacy here is the notion that every law must be the same in every locality .
When people band together to “ modernize ” or “ get with Progress ” and target a specific area , they ’re the fascists who are telling those people they cannot act as they wish .
In human history , we ’ve gone through a series of oppositions where inversion was useful .
First it was individual versus society , where the lone person found themselves on the wrong side of the law or social mores for something that was not unreasonable .
Now we ’re in the age of individuals versus the crowd of other individuals , who have banded together on an inverted idea and are using it to smash anyone they resent .
Resentment targets anyone with more of anything : wealth , intelligence , good looks , power , you name it .
There is no stopping point for resentment , but when given credibility by a logical inversion , it becomes like a virus we all must obey .
If you find yourself thinking modern society is out of control , and wondering where it will end , fear these inversions .
Among other things , inversions always involve symbols that sound good but are unrealistic ; nature , on the other hand , created us by offering a perpetually mixed bag of good and bad that ended up producing , for the most part , good .

The Obama administration has told Congress it supports renewing three provisions of the Patriot Act due to expire at year 's end , measures making it easier for the government to spy within the United States .
In a letter to Sen. Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , the Justice Department said the administration might consider " modifications " to the act in order to protect civil liberties .
" The administration is willing to consider such ideas , provided that they do not undermine the effectiveness of these important authorities , " Ronald Weich , assistant attorney general , wrote to Leahy , ( .pdf ) whose committee is expected to consider renewing the three expiring Patriot Act provisions next week .
The government disclosed the letter Tuesday .
It should come as no surprise that President Barack Obama supports renewing the provisions , which were part of the Patriot Act approved six weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
As an Illinois senator in 2008 , he voted to allow the warrantless monitoring of Americans ’ electronic communications if they are communicating overseas with somebody the government believes is linked to terrorism .
That legislative package , which President George W. Bush signed , also immunized the nation ’s telecommunication companies from lawsuits charging them with being complicit with the Bush administration ’s warrantless , wiretapping program .
That program was also adopted in the wake of Sept. 11 .
These are the three provisions due to expire :
* A secret court , known as the FISA court , may grant " roving wiretaps " without the government identifying the target .
Generally , the authorities must assert that the target is an agent of a foreign power and / or a suspected terrorist .
The government said Tuesday that 22 such warrants – which allow the monitoring of any communication device – have been granted annually .
* The FISA court may grant warrants for " business records , " from banking to library to medical records .
Generally , the government must assert that the records are relevant to foreign intelligence gathering and / or a terrorism investigation .
The government said Tuesday that 220 of these warrants had been granted between 2004 and 2007 .
It said 2004 was the first year those powers were used .
* A so - called " lone wolf " provision , enacted in 2004 , allows FISA court warrants for the electronic monitoring of an individual even without showing that the person is an agent of a foreign power or a suspected terrorist .
The government said Tuesday it has never invoked that provision , but said it wants to keep the authority to do so .
" The basic idea behind the authority was to cover situations in which information linking the target of an investigation to an international group was absent or insufficient , although the target 's engagement in ' international terrorism ' was sufficiently established , " Weich wrote .
The American Civil Liberties opposes renewing all three provisions , especially the lone wolf measure .
Michelle Richardson , the ACLU 's legislative counsel , said in a telephone interview , " The justification for FISA and these lower standards and letting it operate in secret was all about terrorist groups and foreign governments , that they posed a unique threat other than the normal criminal element .
This lone wolf provision undercuts that justification . "
The committee hearing is set for 10 a.m. Sept. 23 and will be webcast live .

Atlanta is among the largest cities in the US Atlanta , the capital of the US state of Georgia will soon be the world 's most digitally mapped city , according to organisers of a massive " mapathon " .
OpenStreetMap , or OSM , is behind the effort to produce a map more accurate than anything else on the market .
In addition , all the data will be given away free for others to use .
" We aim to map everything from bike paths to emergency phones and police precincts , " said Frank Howell from the Office of Research and Policy Analysis .
The office is part of an umbrella group of Georgia 's universities .
" In the Atlanta area , we have new buildings and streets being built all the time and this notion of sneakers on the ground going around mapping everything means you get up - to - date data .
" And what is neat about it is this information is free .
It will be owned by the community - not by Google or other mapping services like Tele Atlas .
These two things together really captured my imagination , " Mr Howell explained , when asked why Atlanta wanted to get involved in the project .
Mapping details
The Atlanta mapathon will take place this weekend , with around 200 volunteers armed with global positioning devices mapping the city .
" The way to think about it is as a really big mapping party , " said OSM founder Steve Coast .
OSM map showing Boston Common " We will have about 15 - 20 mapping stations throughout Atlanta and start by noting all the freeways and motorways , then the main roads , smaller roads and eventually go right down to the footpaths , bars and restaurants . "
Mr Coast said the success of the project was down to the passion and enthusiasm of the volunteers , who carry on working on the map once the weekend mapathon is completed .
" We have over 160,000 people around the world constantly updating the maps .
In Germany , the people there have done so much work that they are mapping trees and overhead wires . "
OSM is described as the " Wikipedia of maps " .
" Unlike Wikipedia we do n't have the same problems of providing this passive neutral point of view , " Mr Coast told the BBC .
" With OpenStreetMap it is not a case of whether Jesus did or did not exist .
The fact is there are either 25 exits off Highway 101 or there are n't . "
Benefits
One of the big attractions for Atlanta getting involved is the fact the data gathered for OpenStreetMap is free and open for users to edit and mash up any way they like .
A Google map showing Boston Common " If you are an iPhone developer and you want to make a map of pizza joints in San Francisco or Atlanta , you basically have two choices , " said Mr Coast .
" You can use Google maps but there are restrictions on what you can do with the data or you can pay tens of thousands of dollars to license the data from other organisations .
" With OpenStreetMap , it 's basically plug and play .
We want you to take that data for free and use it how you see fit , " added Mr Coast .
For Atlanta , Mr Howell said that approach opened up all sorts of possibilities for the city that is home to global brands from Coca - Cola to CNN and AT&T .
" When you have a lot of bright minds like we have here , give them a new toy like OpenStreetMap and they will come up with new applications and winning innovations around that information , " said Mr Howell .
In San Francisco and Oakland , OSM data is used to draw up crime maps .
The White House leverages the information to show where stimulus money is being spent .
The former professor of geographic information systems said he thought Atlanta would be able to lay claim to the title of the most digitally mapped city by the new year .
" We understand the symbolism of achieving that aim and the currency it gives us as we try to persuade companies to set up here , " Mr Howell said .
" We also think it will encourage other cities to follow our lead and improve that spirit of community as we all play a part to really put Atlanta on the map . "

The CIA as a Terrorist Organization
By Peter Meyer
This page is available in a Spanish translation by José Maria Martinez :
La CIA es una organización terrorista
The concept of " terrorism " is not clear and there is no generally agreed upon definition of the term .
It is , however , a tactic , a means to a particular end .
A tactic can always be used , and is always a possible course of action for some group or other .
Once this is understood it is clear that it is ridiculous to declare a " War on Terrorism " — one cannot defeat a tactic .
To declare a war on terrorism is to declare perpetual war ( which , in fact , is the intention ) .
" Terrorism " is here taken to mean the practice of the deliberate inflicting ( either directly or indirectly ) of harm , injury , death and / or destruction upon a civilian target sufficient to cause horror , revulsion or despair among civilian populations and / or their political leaders , with the goal of causing those populations or political leaders to act in a way desired by the terrorists .
Terrorist action differs from military action in two respects : ( 1 ) In military action the target is military ( or provides direct support to the military ) , not civilian ; in military action the military forces of some organization , usually ( but not necessarily ) a state , target the military forces ( and supporting infrastructure ) of an opposing organization , usually a state .
( 2 ) In military action the aim is to destroy a particular military capability of the opposing side rather than to effect some political goal ( though , of course , military action is usually conducted in support of some larger political strategy ) .
The distinction between terrorist and military action may not always be clear , for several reasons .
The distinction between a military target and a civilian target may not be clear .
( A police station may be a military target or a civilian target depending on what activities its occupants are engaged in . )
The goal of a particular militant action may be partly military and partly political , and although these aims may usually be distinguished when the instigator is a state , using its military forces , they may become blurred when the instigator is a non-state entity such as a resistance group .
The judgement as to what is terrorist activity and what is military activity may depend on who is making the judgement .
This is usually the case when there is violent opposition by the inhabitants of some territory to the unwanted control or occupation of that territory by some external entity , usually a state ( as in the West Bank , the Basque region , Kashmir , etc. ) .
Militant groups among the population of the occupied territory may carry out attacks against both military and civilian targets of the occupying power , attempting to persuade the occupying power to cease its occupation and withdraw control .
From the point of view of the occupying power such groups are composed of " terrorists " , but from the point of view of the inhabitants of the occupied territory they are " freedom fighters " — militant groups engaged in armed conflict with an occupying enemy state ( Israel , Spain , India , etc. ) .
Thus arises the saying , " One man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . "
Actually , as Noam Chomsky has pointed out , the distinction is quite simple :
If they do it , it 's terrorism ; if we do it then it 's counter - terrorism ( and so OK ) .
This is the excuse that Israel gives for its terrorism directed against the Palestinian people .
When Palestinians detonate explosives strapped to their bodies in the streets of Tel Aviv filled with Israeli shoppers it is terrorism .
When Israelis fire missiles from helicopter gunships into streets in Gaza filled with frightened Palestinians it is counter - terrorism .
So if acts of reprisal against violence directed at civilians is " counter - terrorism " then acts of reprisal against those acts of reprisal is " counter - counter - terrorism " .
And if counter - terrorism is OK ( a reply to acts of violence ) then surely so is counter - counter - terrorism .
The same excuse that the Israelis give for their terrorism could also be used to excuse the Palestinians .
That CIA was created just after the end of World War II ( from an OSS riddled with Nazis ) by an act of Congress ( and Congress can eliminate it in the same way ) .
Its official purpose is to function primarily as an intelligence - gathering organization ( at least , that 's what we are supposed to believe ) but in fact it has always been something different from that .
The CIA is not now nor has it ever been a central intelligence agency .
It is the covert action arm of the President 's foreign policy advisers .
In that capacity it overthrows or supports foreign governments while reporting " intelligence " justifying those activities .
It shapes its intelligence , even in such critical areas as Soviet nuclear weapons capability , to support presidential policy .
Disinformation is a large part of its covert action responsibility , and the American people are the primary target of its lies .
— Ralph McGehee , Deadly Deceits
The CIA has been a terrorist organization from its beginnings , when it included a large number of former Nazis — former members of the Gestapo and the Nazi military intelligence ( such as Reinhard Gehlen ) .
Unlike smaller terrorist organizations such as ETA the CIA does not normally engage in terrorism by sending its employees to plant bombs , etc .
Rather , it tends to act through intermediaries and agents , sometimes making use of U.S. military personnel .
That the CIA is a terrorist organization is clear from its record of terrorist activities ( sometimes called " counterinsurgency " or " low intensity conflict " ) .
Here are just a few examples :
During the Vietnam war the CIA conducted Operation Phoenix , an assassination program .
The goal was not only to eliminate those Vietnamese who might oppose the U.S. ( which in practice meant most of the population of Vietnam ) but also to terrorize the entire population of South Vietnam and to suppress opposition to the occupying U.S. forces .
Over 20,000 Vietnamese were murdered , often at random .
The CIA also recruited a mercenary army in Vietnam ( financed by profits from the CIA 's heroin smuggling ) , particularly from among the Hmong villagers , which was used to terrorize the civilian population and to prevent them from assisting the Viet Cong .
The CIA organized and financed ( with the profits from its cocaine smuggling ) the activities of the Contras in Nicaragua , who murdered tens of thousands of civilians , and tried to disrupt the economy , in an attempt to destabilize the legitimate Sandinista government .
( For this the U.S. was condemned in the World Court for engaging in international terrorism , and it rejected a U.N. security council resolution calling upon it to observe international law . )
The CIA planned and organized the military coup d'etat in 1973 in Chile which overthrew the legitimately elected government of Salvador Allende ( because he would not implement economic policies designed in Washington to favor American corporations doing business in Chile ) and brought to power the regime of General Augusto Pinochet ; this regime abducted , tortured and killed thousands of Chilean citizens in an attempt to suppress opposition .

The CIA organized and supported the Turkish government 's persecution of its Kurdish minority during the 1990s , resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and millions of refuges ; the aim being the suppression of Kurdish culture and the elimination of Kurdish demands for a separate state .
The September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are widely regarded as terrorist acts .
There is evidence of CIA involvement .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama delivered a rousing speech Saturday night to the nation 's largest gay rights group , praising the gay community for making strides in equal rights and pledging to deliver on major campaign promises that some say he 's left on the back burner .
President Obama speaks Saturday night at the Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington .
" For nearly 30 years , you 've advocated for those without a voice , " Obama said during his address at the dinner for the Human Rights Campaign .
" Despite the progress we 've made , there are still laws to change and hearts to open . "
Obama 's speech came as gay rights activists continued to lose patience over the lack of change to key issues for the gay community -- including the Pentagon 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
It comes on the eve of a major gays - rights rally in Washington .
" This fight continues now and I 'm here with the simple message : I 'm here with you in that fight , " Obama told the applauding crowd .
The Human Rights Campaign issued a statement praising the speech , saying it was a " historic night when we felt the full embrace and commitment of the president of the United States .
It 's simply unprecedented . "
Obama called for the repeal of the ban on gays in the military -- the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
" We should not be punishing patriotic Americans who have stepped forward to serve this country , " he said .
" I 'm working with the Pentagon , its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy , legislation that has been introduced in the House to make this happen , I will end ' do n't ask , do n't tell . '
That 's my commitment to you . "
The president said he backed the rights of gay couples , saying they should have the " same rights and responsibilities afforded to any married couple in this country . "
He said he has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and to pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act .
Obama also touched on protection against hate crimes , noting that legislation was passed in the House this week that expanded the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity .
" I can announce that after more than a decade , this bill is set to pass and I will sign it into law , " he said .
Obama acknowledged the fact that many in the gay community do n't believe government is moving fast enough to address their concerns .
" Many of you do n't believe progress is happening .
I want to be honest about that because it 's important to be honest among friends , " he said .
" I said this before , I 'll repeat it again , it 's not important for me to tell you to be patient . "
Obama said gay people , like other Americans , are affected by myriad concerns -- namely , the economy and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- and stressed that he 's focusing on issues that affect the entire nation .
Watch Obama say he will sign hate - crimes legislation »
" While some may wish to define you solely by your sexual orientation or identity alone , you know and I know that none of us want to be defined by one part of what makes us whole , " he said .
" So I know you want me working on jobs and the economy and all of the other issues that we 're dealing with . "
Still , Obama said , it 's imperative that the gay community continue to pursue the policies they support .
" It 's so important that you continue to speak out and you continue to set an example and that you continue to press your leaders , including me , and to make the case all across America , " he said .
The Human Rights Campaign in its statement praised Obama 's pledge that " we will see a time in which we as a nation finally recognize the relationships between two men or two women . "
The group said Obama " made it crystal clear that he is our strongest ally in this fight , that he understands and , in fact , encourages our activism and our voice even when we 're impatient with the pace of change . "

The Australian Senate Opposition leader Nick Minchin has joined the growing chorus of voices against Communications Minister Stephen Conroy 's plans for mandatory ISP - level filtering .
The project may not yet be deceased , but it is without doubt on the critical list .
Senator Minchin said the government had not only failed to release the results of recent trials of internet filtering software , but it had also refused to come clean on what measures would determine whether the trial could be considered successful or not .
" Almost two years after coming to office with a plan to censor the internet , Senator Conroy has not even managed to release results for long overdue filtering trials , let alone come close to actually implementing this highly controversial policy , " he said .
" Previous trials of filtering technology have exposed serious problems with both the over - blocking and under - blocking of content , and concerns also remain about the adverse impact a national filtering regime could have on internet speeds . "
This follows criticism from ISPs that a wide - scale roll - out could still hit internet performance , irrespective of apparently favourable results from the filter testing .
Asked in a radio interview to set out what results he would consider to constitute a successful outcome , Senator Conroy refused to do so .
Senator Minchin went on : " Huge doubts also continue to surround the type of content Labor wants to filter and how it will compile a black - list which would form the basis of its filtering regime . "
This reflects a longstanding debate as to precisely what sort of content the filter is designed to block .
Opposition politicians have been slow to act because they sensed a widespread and genuine public sense that " something must be done " to control material available on the internet .
This found parliamentary expression in a petition by Tasmanian Liberal senator Guy Barnett which attracted support from across all parties .
For a while , opponents of filtering were accused of being soft on child porn .
However , government reluctance to come clean as to what it intends to filter , and the fact that some pronouncements have focused on blocking material that is merely " undesirable " – as opposed to strictly " illegal " – has left supporters of the firewall looking increasingly shifty on this issue .
Despite his forthright opposition , Senator Minchin has left himself an escape route , adding that the Coalition remains prepared to look at filtering if the government puts credible trial results into the public arena . ®

Debate on censorship issues in Australia has always been acrimonious , reflecting tensions between liberals and fundamentalists .
In the 1950s , Australia was noted for its book banning , including Catcher in the Rye .
Today , controversy surrounds the absence of an RF18 + category for computer games , which means that many games that may quite legally be purchased elsewhere are simply unable to obtain classification in Australia .
Most recently , this ambivalence took a bizarre turn , as Queensland Police arrested a father of four on child - abuse charges for possession of a video that the Federal Government 's own censors have now classified as MA15 + ( suitable for aged 15 and above ) .
The man did not create the footage , of a man swinging a baby , but found it online and uploaded it to another website .
According to police , however , despite the apparent go - ahead from the State censor , simply viewing the images could result in a ten - year jail sentence .
He faces trial next year .
Our story on his arrest is here .
When the pain in Christina Woodkey ’s legs became so severe that she could no long hike or cross -country ski , she went to her local health clinic .
The Calgary , Canada , resident was told she ’d need to see a hip specialist .
Because the problem was not life - threatening , however , she ’d have to wait about a year .
So wait she did .
In January , the hip doctor told her that a narrowing of the spine was compressing her nerves and causing the pain .
She needed a back specialist .
The appointment was set for Sept. 30 .
“ When I was given that date , I asked when could I expect to have surgery , ” said Woodkey , 72 .
“ They said it would be a year and a half after I had seen this doctor . ”
So this month , she drove across the border into Montana and got the $ 50,000 surgery done in two days .

“ I do n’t have insurance .
We ’re not allowed to have private health insurance in Canada , ” Woodkey said .
“ It ’s not going to be easy to come up with the money .
But I ’m happy to say the pain is almost all gone . ”
Whereas U.S. healthcare is predominantly a private system paid for by private insurers , things in Canada tend toward the other end of the spectrum :
A universal , government - funded health system is only beginning to flirt with private - sector medicine .
Hoping to capitalize on patients who might otherwise go to the U.S. for speedier care , a network of technically illegal private clinics and surgical centers has sprung up in British Columbia , echoing a trend in Quebec .
In October , the courts will be asked to decide whether the budding system should be sanctioned .
More than 70 private health providers in British Columbia now schedule simple surgeries and tests such as MRIs with waits as short as a week or two , compared with the months it takes for a public surgical suite to become available for nonessential operations .

“ What we have in Canada is access to a government , state - mandated wait list , ” said Brian Day , a former Canadian Medical Assn. director who runs a private surgical center in Vancouver .
“ You cannot force a citizen in a free and democratic society to simply wait for healthcare , and outlaw their ability to extricate themselves from a wait list . ”
Yet the move into privatized care threatens to make the delays -- already long from the perennial shortage of doctors and rationing of facilities -- even longer , public healthcare advocates say .
There will be fewer skilled healthcare workers in government hospitals as doctors and nurses are lured into better - paying private jobs , they say .
“ What it means is that people who have no money , who are chronically ill , disabled , who require medical attention frequently , are going to suffer dramatically , ” said Leslie Dickout of the B.C. Health Coalition , which is involved in the lawsuit to determine whether the Canadian Constitution guarantees citizens the right to choose their own care .
“ There ’s so much money to be made by the insurance industry , ” she said .
“ If this [ legal ] case succeeds , what we would have is a system of U.S. - style healthcare -- along with a public system that is decimated . ”

Indeed , an investment group backed by Arizona businessman Melvin J. Howard this year filed a $ 160 - million challenge under the North American Free Trade Agreement , demanding that U.S. healthcare companies gain access into Canada .
The consortium hopes to build Canada ’s largest private health center in Vancouver , offering orthopedics , plastic surgery , general surgery and other services .
In many ways , the prospect of private investment is alluring in British Columbia , where the provincial government , like those all across Canada , funds the healthcare system .
Provincial officials recently announced a $ 360 - million shortfall in the $ 15.7 - billion healthcare budget for the fiscal year that ends in March .
The shortage will mean fewer surgeries and longer waits .
The Vancouver Island Health Authority has said it would reduce the number of nonemergency MRIs by 20 % ; nonemergency patients now are being booked for scans in March .

Vancouver Coastal Health , which serves a quarter of the province ’s population , said it would eliminate 450 elective surgeries , about 30 % of the schedule , during the four weeks of the 2010 Winter Olympics .
And in the rapidly growing suburbs east of Vancouver , the Fraser Health Authority plans to close its spending gap by , among other things , holding the number of MRIs to last year ’s total , ending $ 550,000 in service programs for senior citizens and reducing elective surgeries by about 14 % .
The authorities also are making administrative cost cuts and looking to pool resources for things like computers and laboratories .
“ We need to be crystal - clear . . . .
I ’m not denying anybody access here to urgent or acute or immediate care , ” Nigel Murray , the Fraser authority ’s chief executive , said in an interview .
“ If our surgeons feel people need access to urgent care , they get it . ”

The Canadian government has invested a large amount of money nationwide in a successful effort to reduce wait times , especially for life - threatening conditions such as cardiac disease and tumors , and for procedures such as knee replacements and cataract surgery .
Under Canada ’s system , most doctors run private practices but are paid uniform rates by a government - funded network .
( Many Canadians have private or employer - paid insurance that covers things such as dental and eye care , which are not part of the larger plan . )
Murray , a proponent of the system , acknowledged that the growing number of private clinics and public - private partnership hospitals could strengthen government healthcare .
“ You can lose staff to the private systems .
. . .
But the other side of the coin is that you may be keeping nurses in your communities by providing other employment options for them , so that you ’re adding to the pool of overall healthcare professionals , ” Murray said .
“ Additionally , the private system can take some of the strain off the public system . ”

The heart of the legal case is the 1984 Canada Health Act , which established the framework for the national insurance system known as Medicare .
It outlawed most private insurance for essential healthcare and provided the vast majority of Canadians with free medical services .
Canada spends about $ 172 billion a year on healthcare , which is one reason the nation ’s taxes are higher than those in the U.S. ( Canadians pay about 33 % of the gross domestic product in taxes , compared with 28 % in the U.S. )
British Columbia is the only province that still charges residents an extra health premium of $ 54 a month , subsidized for those who ca n’t afford it .
The first foot in the door for private medicine came in 2005 , when the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the laws in Quebec that banned private insurance .
The court found that having people die while on wait lists violated the province ’s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms .
The ruling does not apply outside the province , because only a minority on the court found that the laws also violated Canada ’s basic human rights charter .
The case to throw out the law in British Columbia was launched when authorities attempted to audit some clinics that were collecting government payments for surgeries in addition to fees they charged patients for the use of their private operating rooms and nursing staff .

Day ’s Cambie Surgery Center refused to open its books and filed suit along with other private clinic operators , saying citizens deserved a choice .
“ In Canada , the rights of the individual patient are trumped by the welfare of the system , ” said Richard Baker , who runs a Vancouver - based consulting group that helps patients find quick access to care in private clinics or in the U.S .
“ We have patients come from all over Canada , because B.C. has the most liberal rules on private surgical centers , other than Quebec , ” he said .
“ They complain , ‘ They ’re all jumping the queue ! ’
Well , it ’s not jumping the queue at all .
It ’s leaving the queue . ”
In fact , the British Columbian government has been slow to crack down on private clinics .
Health Minister Kevin Falcon told the Vancouver Sun newspaper in June : “ I do n’t have an objection to people using their own money to buy private services , just as they do with dentists , just as they do with . . . sending their kids to private school or what have you .
I think choice is a good thing , actually . ”

The outcome of the legal case , most analysts say , probably will determine the future of private healthcare in Canada .
Not all Canadian doctors have flocked to the defense of private clinics ; many see the public health system , for all its strains , as a gem that ought to be protected from the out - of - control expenditures and huge inequities that are part of the U.S. healthcare system .
“ We can and need to improve [ healthcare ] .
. . .
But it ’s always going to be more effective , and it ’s certainly going to be more equitable , if it ’s done within the public system , ” said Robert Woollard , a longtime family practitioner and member of Canadian Doctors for Medicare , which has applied to join the lawsuit in British Columbia .
Woollard said the public system has the nimbleness to provide speedy , quality care to those who truly need it .
“ Just six or eight weeks ago , I had a patient come in who needed urgent attention to her knee .
She was in severe pain , ” he said .
“ She was seen by a [ reviewing ] team within a week , and she was slated for surgery that will probably happen in the next two to three months . ”

Fox News ran a several segments yesterday touting New York City 's newly unveiled bicycle lanes , created in response to the sharp increase in bike ridership in the Big Apple :
Despite the dangers , biking is New York City 's " fastest growing mode of transportation , " says City Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik - Khan , who herself bikes to work in lower Manhattan , about a mile from her Greenwich Village home .
The number of cyclists has jumped by 80 percent in the past decade — to 185,000 among the more than 8 million city denizens .
City officials say they 've worked to make the city more biker friendly .
They note the hundreds of miles of marked bike paths created in recent years , safety awareness campaigns and handouts of free helmets to unprotected cyclists .
Over that time , bicycle accidents have fallen more than 40 percent .
" A lot of people consider it an act of bravery to get on a bike in New York City , " Sadik - Khan says .
" But we 've created a biking network that affords more security for bicyclists — a safer and healthier way to get around . " ...
The city now has 420 miles of marked bike lanes and paths along the streets in all five boroughs — half of those created in the past three years .
Another 200 miles are off the street , including Central Park and other green oases like the Hudson River path .
Three specially designed street lanes are separated from moving traffic by parked cars , which Sadik - Khan calls " a wall of steel . "
Two are on Manhattan 's far West Side and the third snakes downtown through the city 's Soho , Little Italy and Chinatown .
You 'll notice from the video segment that more than a few NYC riders still have some safety fundamentals to work on -- particularly the lack of helmets .
Still , it 's a great start for one of the nation 's more difficult bicycling cities .
In one of the Fox segments someone from the city bike program boasted that New York could now claim to be the nation 's biking capital .
That 's pretty laughable -- everyone knows Portland is king , and a long ways in front of everyone else -- but hey , at least it 's not in the same category as Dallas , which remains the nation 's worst .
Regardless , it 's encouraging to see so many people turning to bicycling as a viable transportation option .
It 's obviously not for everyone , but it is an option that makes great common sense from a variety of angles :
1. Bikes are non-polluting .
2. Parking and the space they occupy is so much less of a problem .
3 . They 're good for your health .
( If you keep yourself safe . )
4 . They consume far less energy .
Bikes , in fact , are considered by many mechanical engineers to be the most efficient machine ever devised by man .
It 's silly not to be using them as abundantly and efficiently as possible .
Still , as Matt Yglesias noted earlier this year , Republicans love to make fun of bicycling programs whenever they come up -- especially in the federal budgeting process , where they are regularly held up for ridicule as examples of federal waste .
No doubt because they make so much sense .

When ( * not* ) to use Force - Directed Layouts

I 'm currently working on three new visualizations for the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit that will be added in version 1.2 .
I started the development of these new visualizations a couple of weeks ago , and while trying to incorporate these new visualizations harmoniously into the Toolkit I 've found myself considering new design and code abstractions I have n't thought about before .
That 's good for the Toolkit , and also good for my brain :)
One of the visualizations I 'll be incorporating in the next major release is a Force - Directed visualization .
I first want to thank Marcus Cobden for donating a lot of code related to this algorithm that you can find here .
My code is based in his donation and also in a nice overview of Force - Directed layout algorithms that I 've found here Force - Directed Layout algorithms are graph drawing algorithms based only on information contained within the structure of the graph itself rather than relying on contextual information .
The most straightforward Force - Directed algorithm uses repulsive forces between nodes and attractive forces between adjacent nodes .
This physical model produces some local minima in which the graph , well , gets to a stable configuration and is drawn in an aesthetically pleasing way .
The main algorithm consists on a main loop that simulates the system for some iterations and then plots the graph .
The system will consist on repulsive forces between all graph nodes and attractive forces between adjacent nodes .
The force models considered correspond to Hooke 's law and Coulomb 's law .
Here 's an example with some JSON data I also use for other examples at the demos page
There are lots of refinements and different methods for making Force - Directed Layouts .
Some are just based on the model I described before , others are based on what 's called Graph Theoretic Distances :
If for two adjacent nodes their ideal distance is set as d , then for nodes with shortest path distance of n their ideal layout distance should be n * d.
Attractive and repulsive forces are used to make a graph system with random nodes positions get to a local minima based on these rules .
I implemented the first model I described .
For each iteration the computePositionStep method is called to update all nodes positions based on attractive and repulsive forces .
The formal parameters passed to the method are property which is an array of node properties which contain positions to be updated and opt which is an object containing layout options like generic repulsive and attractive force functions .
$ C creates a new Complex Number You can find more information about this algorithm in this overview of Force - Directed algorithms .
This method is called multiple times to provide a final layout , for example like this :
Where times corresponds to the number of iterations of the simulation , and is generally > 50 and t can be thought as the global temperature of a system that gets cooler with each iteration .
Although there are a couple of methods to reduce the complexity of this algorithm , this implementation runs like O ( V^3 ) , which can be considered as really bad performance .
This is not desirable for real - time interactive visualizations , in which everlasting computation algorithms can lead to blocking browser popups like " This Script is Taking too long ... " or things like that .
One way you can avoid these popups is by making incremental computations .
This can be done by splitting the main algorithm that has for example 100 iterations into smaller pieces of 20 iterations each .
The main iteration loop could then be changed into something like this :
This method could be called for example like this :
And the main computation would be split into smaller parts calling on each step of the computation the onStep callback .
For graph operations ( Adding / Removing nodes and edges , Graph Sum and Graph Morphing )
I make all iterations in the first layout and then only apply 20 iterations after some operation has been completed .
Here 's a video : Force - Directed Layouts can be a good choice when you 're drawing general graphs and you do n't have domain specific ( or any other topological ) information about them .
Tree structures however are a special case of graphs : this means that tree structures have more constrains and therefore there 's more contextual information for drawing a Tree than for drawing a general graph .
Also ,
Trees are easier to grasp for the human eye than " general graphs " .
There 's that intrinsic notion of hierarchy that can be used to draw aesthetically pleasing graph layouts .
Think about the " general graph " layouts that start with the drawing of a spanning tree and then add the " extra edges " to complete the graph structure ( for example here and here ) .
The Multitrees method I mentioned a couple of posts ago was also developed to try to extract more contextual information about a graph and draw it based on a notion of partial hierarchy .
Because of this , in my opinion , it would n't be wise to plot Trees that have many nodes with this Force - Directed algorithm : this extra-information about trees is n't used in this layout .
However , if you 're planning on drawing general graphs and you do n't have any other information about them , then this algorithm can detect interesting symmetries and make aesthetically pleasing drawings .
I 'll keep you updated with the other visualizations I 'm working on in the next posts .
The CIA ’s use of Predator drones to kill suspected terrorists in Pakistan , which has significantly increased under the Obama administration , is recognized for its success in taking out intended targets .
There are concerns , however , the program could also be helping Taliban leaders with their propaganda , as noted by Jane Mayer ’s recent expose in the New Yorker .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an appearance Thursday on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show , Mayer explained that as amazing as the remote control technology behind the drones may be , “ It is based always on human intelligence telling you which target to go after . ”
“ They ’ve gotten some tremendous success in killing al Qaeda leaders , ” Mayer noted , “ but at the same time , since 2006 , they ’ve killed between 750 and 1000 people .
The number of al Qaeda is a small fraction of all the people that they ’ve killed .
There ’s a lot of so - called collateral damage . ”
Because of this , Mayer suggests , “ It ’s a program that people fear is going to have unintended consequences . …
It ’s going to become a propaganda tool for the Taliban and it ’s going to create retaliation against the United States and maybe against Pakistan ’s government , which we ’re trying to prop up . ”
According to New York Times reporter David Rohde , for example , “ The drones killed many senior commanders and hindered their operations .
Yet the Taliban were able to garner recruits in their aftermath by exaggerating the number of civilian casualties . ”
There is also an “ accountability ” issue , according to Mayer , because the U.S. military is using the drones in Iraq and Afghanistan , but in Pakistan , where the US is not officially at war , the drones are operated by the CIA in a supposedly “ secret program . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ So there ’s no chain of command , ” Mayer told Maddow . “…
It ’s been described as an accountability void , basically , where people are dying but there ’s no kind of public acknowledgment .
So what happens if there ’s a mistake ?
Who do you hold responsible ? ”
Mayer also said the program raises broader questions about what will happen if Russia or China starts using the same tactics — and even whether the Americans who operate the drones by remote control from the United States could be considered battlefield combatants and targeted in retaliation .
“ It really is kind of a scary frontier , ” Mayer concluded .

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^
God is in charge .
He uses all things for His glory .
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ I was praying about our nation this weekend .
I received the strong impression that I must not worry .
There are many , many God-fearing people in this nation who are praying and God will not abandon us .
That does not mean that all will go as we would like and there may , or may not be , some rough times , but it will work out for our good and for the good of our nation .

For me it ’s the almost constant disbelief and anger that in just a few short months so many things that the people of this country believed in and that made our country great have been changed .
I ’m a solid conservative yet at this point I ’m wishing Hillary had won .
She could have been no worse than what we have and maybe have been better .
Sadly I think our wannabe dictator sealed our country ’s fate with terrorists today by appearing so weak to them .
He is worse than Carter and they will soon be standing in line to ‘ teach us a lesson ’ probably with a biological weapon .

Start reading the Psalms in the old testament - David was fleeing for his LIFE from the King of Israel AFTER David had been annointed to be the next king of Israel ... he spent many years living in caves , hiding from his own king ... so , Psalms is a great book to read when you are having these rough nights !

Last month , the FBI warned about a surge in mortgage fraud .
Well , it 's happening .
It seems like every day , authorities are breaking up another ring of lawyers , real estate brokers and other white - collar crooks who are taking advantage of the distressed housing market .
Today , New York law enforcement officials announced charges against 41 people in eight separate cases for allegedly running mortgage fraud scams that together cheated lenders of more than $ 64 million in home loans on more than 100 properties across New York State .
DOJ :
The mortgage fraud scams alleged in the cases announced today included , among other things , property flips , equity stripping , and appraisal and loan fraud .
In one case , defendants operated a foreclosure rescue scheme , targeting individuals who were on the verge of losing their homes by tricking them into giving up the equity in the properties with false promises that their homes would be saved .
Among those charged are six lawyers , seven loan officers , three mortgage brokers , an accountant , and a residential property appraiser .
" The type of criminal conduct charged today constricts the credit markets and makes it harder for honest people to realize the American dream of home ownership , " said Preet Bharara , U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York .
" It is especially alarming when lawyers , loan officers , and mortgage brokers treat their professional licenses as license to loot banks and profit from other people 's pain . "
Right .
But are we really surprised ?
As we noted today , home prices are n't ( yet ) at overinflated levels again , but the housing market is seeing a return of enthusiasm -- meaning risky speculation -- the likes of which we have n't seen in a long time .
And it 's exactly that froth that creates the environment for the mortgage fraud scammers to flourish .
So this last weekend I was very privileged to be invited to attend the Singularity Summit in New York , an annual meeting of minds to discuss the implications of growing ( and possible accelerating ) technologies .
Now , despite having written a comic story about this very subject , I ’ve never actually been in to an official gathering of these folks before , and did n’t really know what to expect .
Highlights :
– The audience was of a much higher caliber than what I expected .
Beforehand I had a lurking fear that Singularitarians were actually mostly navel - gazing sci- fi geeks who were more interested in a “ nerd rapture ” than the facts of emerging technologies .
In truth , it turns out that I was likely the dumbest guy in the room , with essentially all the attendees being very educated , thoughtful and ( often ) professionally successful individuals .
It was an interesting mix of industry leaders , scientists , economist and skeptics all possessing the necessary faculties for diverse and sober views concerning the subjects at hand .
Folks were friendly , too , and mingling in between talks I could always make my way into a group where interesting conversation was going on .
– The selection of speakers was very diverse .
I was concerned that the majority may involve a cheerleading squad for a particular view , but in fact topics and speakers ranged from those who believed in an inevitable “ hard takeoff ” Singularity to those who though * some * singularity was necessary to avoid existential risks to AI researchers who believed that belief in the Singularity is just a cognitive bias that futurists have .
Regardless of their views , though , every speaker treated the subject matter as a very serious and legitimate topic of discussion and investigation .
– Ray Kurzweil ’s talks were very good as one might expect , though I personally felt these were some of the less exciting parts of the summit .
I do n’t think it ’s any fault of Kurzweil ’s , though , since I ’m just really familiar with his work and arguments , and it seems like he ’s had to respond to the same tired arguments for several years now .
Two things that impressed me were the astonishing amount of evidence , detail and overall research he puts into his thesis ( far more thorough than any other speakers ) and second , the fact that he really looks a lot younger than a man in his 60s .
I know some folks take jabs at the astonishing amount of supplements and other dietary / medical steps he takes to increase his lifespan , but it really does seem to have an effect on his vitality and appearance .
He could easily be a good front man for the movement , though I noted that he was n’t presented as such , and a variety of other speakers seemed to be pushed to the forefront instead .
– Eliezer Yudkowsky , as always , was very clever and humorous in his examination of cognitive bias and how downright insane human beings are really wired to be .
With a series of statistics ( with the audience participating in some questions ) , he showed how even a “ rational ” person ’s mind can be hacked primarily due to its messy “ spaghetti code ” evolutionary history .
Symptoms of cognitive bias include tending to believe more specific or dramatic threats over more realistic ones ( examples included the Bush administration preparing for elaborate “ movie threats ” while ignoring statistically more likely and dangerous threats like hurricane disasters ) .
With relation to the Singularity , one popular fear is the “ Terminator Scenario ” where AI becomes violent , humanoid and bend on destroying the human race .
Despite having not even the slightest grounds in fact , this image is popular because it ’s specific and dramatic .
Likewise , in regards to futurism in general , we tend to overestimate the macroscopic ( flying cars , jet packs , space travel ) and underestimate the advances of the subtle ( internet , cloud computing , augmented reality , specific and general AI ) .
Peter
Thiel , co-founder of PayPal and venture capitalist , provided a very interesting perspective .
From the view of a technologist and businessman , he believes that the topic that needs to be discussed further is what happens if the Singularity does n’t happen or does n’t happen fast enough .
He seems to be of the opinion that if it does n’t develop quickly enough , there could be an incident similar to the ‘ dot com crash ’ ( where investors overestimated tech growth ) only on a much larger , more devastating scale .
He argued that the Singularity has the potential to be an extremely beneficial trend in the future , but there needs to be a more concentrated economic and industrial effort to ensure that it develops the right way and at the right pace .
Aubrey de Grey may have been my favorite speaker , as the topic of biological longevity research is an area where my education is sorely lacking .
Some magnificent leaps and bounds in this field have been made , and Dr. de Grey graphed life expectancy paths ( using only the most pessimistic predictions regarding advancements ) amongst different age groups today .
It was a very thorough talk and , while seemingly optimistic , it involved some of the hardest , tangible science out there .
I feel this is one angle of Transhumanism that should get more face time in the public eye .
While AI is the more significant thing to watch in the long run ( and the most terrifying ) , aging and longevity research is a very tangible , understandable science with a growing and continuous set of real - world applications that even the harshest cynic could n’t call useless .
On top of that , Dr. de Gray really does come off as a very charming , thoughtful person who is genuinely interested in helping everyone he can ( at the expense of perhaps his own longevity ) .
- Another interesting observation is that half the freaking people at the summit read Dresden Codak .
Why on Earth would such important individuals waste their time on this comic is beyond me , but it was kind of neat .
Even though I was just an attendee , I ’ve never gotten this much attention even at a comic show ( on the second day I was even roped into giving autographs in the lobby ! ) .
A definite highlight was when Aubrey de Grey pulled me aside to praise my satirical essay featuring Trans - Simianism .
Who knew ?
Conclusion : a wonderful group of intellectuals discussing a relevant and fascinating array of subjects , from autonomous cars to brain scans to curing blindness to avoiding being destroyed by a superintelligence .
Both the speakers and attendees are the type of people I would n’t mind seeing again at next year ’s summit .
If you ’re interested in the subject at all ( from skeptic to optimist ) and can afford the price of admission , it ’s definitely an event worth seeing for yourself .

One year since banking collapse , Iceland ’s crisis deepens
By Jordan Shilton
12 October 2009
Over the course of several days last October , Iceland ’s banking system collapsed .
The state was forced to take control of the country ’s three largest financial institutions , Kaupthing , Glittnir and Landsbanki , raising the threat of state bankruptcy .
One year on , Iceland is still confronted by grave economic and social problems , with massive state debt and worsening social conditions for the vast majority amidst ongoing revelations of the speculative and outright criminal practices of the financial elite .
As with the global economic crisis , none of the fundamental causes of Iceland ’s banking collapse have been resolved in the intervening year .
The population has been burdened with vast sums of debt that will take generations to repay , while the banks that precipitated the collapse have been recapitalised with state finances , allowing them to recommence their speculative practices .
The precarious position of state finances was illustrated last month in a comment from Prime Minister Johanna Sigurðardóttir to Bloomberg .
With the IMF persisting in delaying payment of the second instalment of a $ 2.1 billion ( € 1.4 billion ) loan to Reykjavik , she explained that time was running out and that the government could not wait much longer for the funds .
Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfússon warned that a failure to secure the outstanding loans could leave Iceland facing “ a second collapse . ”
In its takeover of the country ’s three main banks , the then conservative - led government of Prime Minister Geir Haarde assumed control of institutions that held assets ten times greater than Iceland ’s entire economy .
The immediate consequence was a sharp slide in the value of the krona , to a point where the currency could not be traded .
Prices rose dramatically , especially for imported goods .
Fully a third of the population of 310,000 lost all or most of their savings .
Instability in Iceland had been evident for some time , with the krona having fallen by over 30 percent against most major currencies in the first nine months of 2008 , and inflation rising steadily to nearly 15 percent .
Then in September , the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers brought the financial system to the brink of failure .
Iceland ’s banks , which had based their expansion by obtaining cheap credit on the international money markets , found that their avenues of finance were closed .
Faced with massive short - term debt and no means of paying it , they turned to the state for support .
On September 29 , Haarde announced that his government would take a 75 percent stake in Glittnir .
The value of the bank was reduced by more than half from its valuation a week previously .
One week later , on October 6 , the trading of shares on the Reykjavik stock exchange was halted .
Then , in the space of three days , Landsbanki and Kaupthing both fell into state hands , the latter in spite of receiving a loan equivalent to five percent of GDP from the central bank .
By late October , talks began with the IMF with a view to securing an emergency loan to avert state bankruptcy .
An agreement was reached in November , but ratification was delayed as the IMF insisted that Iceland begin negotiations to compensate international creditors who had lost investments in the collapsed institutions .
This included over £ 1 billion ( €1.1 billion ) from the UK , as well as large sums of savings from depositors in the Netherlands .
Since the IMF agreement was finalised , with a loan of € 1.4 billion being agreed , Icelanders have seen a massive assault on their living standards with deep cuts in government spending and sharply rising unemployment .
At less than one percent before the banking crisis , unemployment today is around nine percent .
The rate would be even higher were it not for the fact that thousands have made the decision to emigrate to make a living elsewhere .
The Social Democrat - Left Green coalition , in power since January , has proven no less determined than its conservative - led predecessor to place the burden for the financial crisis on the working class .
Submitting entirely to the demands of the IMF , the government announced in June deep public spending cuts , coupled with tax hikes .
Over the next three years , spending will be cut by 70 billion kronur ( €380 million ) , while tax rises will amount to 58 billion kronur ( €320 million ) .
At the same time , the government has sought to compensate the financial elite responsible for the crisis .
In August , it was announced that Kaupthing and Islandsbanki ( formerly Glittnir ) would be recapitalised with sums of 72 billion kronur ( €390 million ) and 65 billion kronur ( €360 million ) respectively , ensuring that their speculative practices can resume .
This despite fresh revelations detailing the criminal operations of the main banks .
The most noteworthy of these include the exposure of Kaupthing ’s practice of providing unsecured loans to bank employees and close associates .
Over 200 such loans , valued between € 50 million and € 1.2 billion , were handed out before the 2008 crisis , with many of them used to buy shares in Kaupthing to artificially inflate their value .
A crucial role has been played by the Left Greens , who have consistently offered a “ left ” cover for the implementation of government policies and worked tirelessly to restrict popular opposition .
The Left - Greens have also accommodated themselves with the call of the Social Democrats for EU membership .
Notwithstanding their professed opposition , the Left - Greens agreed to the sending of an application to Brussels to initiate negotiations .
Far from offering a road to recovery , joining the EU will only ensure the launching of further attacks on the living standards of working people through privatisation , deregulation and the deepening of budget cuts .
In spite of the government ’s implementation of austerity measures , the IMF is still refusing to release the second instalment of Iceland ’s loan , a clear sign that more is expected from the administration in Reykjavik .
Pressure is being exerted due to the inability of the government to reach a settlement to compensate depositors in Landsbanki ’s failed Internet savings scheme , IceSave .
In June , an agreement was reached in principle that would see the UK and Netherlands give Iceland loans of € 2.52 billion and € 1.2 billion respectively , thus enabling savers to be compensated .
But this deal was sidetracked when parliament refused to approve it without various conditions , including the ability to renegotiate terms if Iceland had not repaid the loans by 2024 .
The UK has opposed such a move .
Beyond the IMF funds , Iceland is relying on a joint € 1.7 billion loan from the Nordic countries .
Recent reports have also indicated that negotiations with Russia over a potential loan of $ 500 million ( €340 million ) have been reopened .
On top of the IceSave dispute , the IMF is also exerting pressure in other areas , including the removal of capital controls and other restrictions on the trading of the krona .
Plans have been drawn up for this to commence at the beginning of November .
With reports indicating that there are over € 1 billion in Iceland belonging to investors who intend to withdraw their funds , there is a real danger that the krona ’s value will plummet .
This would hit working people hard , with everyday items becoming unaffordable .
With many people repaying loans obtained in foreign currencies prior to the 2008 crash , repayment costs could spiral out of control .
While the remainder of the IMF loan may help avert a “ second collapse ” for the financial establishment , it will mean a deepening of the social crisis for the working class .
This will not go unopposed .
Protests have already broken out against the new government 's continuation of austerity policies targeting working people .
The largest of these protests came in August as the IceSave bill was being debated in parliament , when 3,000 gathered in Reykjavik .
This was the largest demonstration since the mass protests in January that brought about the toppling of the previous government led by Haarde , when on several occasions more than 5,000 demonstrated .
The mass protests of January , whilst fuelled by legitimate hatred for the financial and political establishment , lacked any clear programme other than calls for fresh elections and the removal of the central bank governor .
This prepared the way for the election of a government that has proven no less ruthless in defending the banks at the expense of the working class .
An entirely new perspective is needed : one that opposes the capitalist system and stands for the socialist transformation of society .
Such a programme must be based on internationalism , since there is no national solution to the current crisis .
While events in Iceland provide a particularly sharp expression of the impact of the economic crisis , the bailing out of the financial aristocracy at the expense of the working class is a global phenomenon .
Only by allying their struggles with workers internationally can working people in Iceland advance a viable alternative .
WASHINGTON –
A Rasmussen poll published Monday shows that 59 % of American citizens would be in favor of granting US support to Israel if the latter were attacked from abroad .
Almost a third of those polled ( 29 % ) opposed any type of US aid to Israel 's defense , and 12 % were undecided .
It is unclear from the phrasing of the question whether it refers to military equipment or the deployment of soldiers in the region .
Those polled were asked about a number of Western countries , of which Israel was one .
Thus , 78 % said they were willing to support Canada and 73 % said they were in favor of granting aid to Britain .
Mexico received the same rating as Israel , with 59 % saying they supported US aid to the southern neighbor in the case of an attack .
Willingness to help other countries , such as Germany , Japan , and France , was lower than this percentage , with 53 % supporting military aid to Germany and 46 % in favor of granting Japan and France aid .
Just 45 % said they would be willing to help France .
The amount Americans owe on credit cards and other consumer loans plunged a record $ 21.6 billion in July , clouding prospects that the budding economic recovery would soon extend to Main Street .
The drop in consumer debt for the month was the largest since the Federal Reserve began tracking the data in 1943 and the sixth straight monthly decline in outstanding consumer debt , the longest streak since 1991 .
The amount of the decrease -- five times what analysts had predicted -- along with continued job losses and an uncertain housing market show that consumers are still skittish about borrowing money for big - ticket purchases , even though economic data show that the deep recession may have technically ended .
Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 % of the nation ’s economic activity .

“ People want to see where the economy is going before they commit to more debt .
I would n’t make a major purchase right now , ” said Norman Moore , a semi-retired computer consultant from North Hollywood , who has trimmed his debt and cut back spending .
Although paying down debt and getting finances in order is a good strategy for individual households , it does n’t bode well for a nascent recovery in a nation deeply dependent on consumer spending .
“ The consumer credit data highlights one of the key reasons why the economic recovery will be a bit of a slog , at least through this time next year , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ The credit crunch has abated since the financial panic was at its worst earlier in the year , but credit is not flowing normally , ” he said .
“ Credit is the mother ’s milk of economic activity , and until it flows more freely , the economy will struggle . ”

Some economists cautioned observers not to read too much into July ’s steep decline in consumer debt , which does n’t include such long - term debt as mortgages .
Although the continued downward trend is a cause for concern , the economists said the big drop was affected partly by the government ’s “ cash for clunkers ” program , which led consumers to put off borrowing money to buy cars until late in the month , when the initiative kicked in .
The deepest decline in July ’s numbers was in the category dominated by auto loans , which fell by $ 15.4 billion .
Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight , expects those nonrevolving loans to increase in August , when most of the $ 3 billion in clunkers deals were made , somewhat offsetting July ’s record drop .
In the revolving debt category dominated by credit cards , consumers reduced their balances by $ 6.1 billion in July .
That ’s a decline at an annual pace of 8 % , compared with June ’s annual pace of 6.4 % .

Analysts had estimated that the total consumer debt would fall by only $ 4 billion in July .
The continued decrease in the amount of debt held by consumers -- consistent with recent anemic consumer spending data -- shows that the economy is still weak .
“ What we ’re seeing is part of the adjustment . . . from an economy that was really driven by consumer spending and households building up more debt to one where consumer spending is going to be much more driven by income growth than it was in the past , ” Gault said .
That ’s the case for Paul Van Lierop , a Seattle area network engineer who has slashed his spending to pay off debt .

“ I have always made good money , but I like the toys and am a spender by nature , ” said Van Lierop , 37 , who is married with two young sons .
“ After Christmas we came to the conclusion that we made too much money to feel broke all the time . ”
The Van Lierops attended a personal finance class at their church and vowed to change their spending habits .
The couple cut up their credit cards , devised a family budget and put some cash in a savings account for emergencies .
They also started to use “ every spare dollar to pay off debt , ” he said .
Their debt included $ 62,000 in auto and credit card loans with interest rates as high as 24.9 % .
As of last week , the family had paid off $ 32,000 , including all of the credit card debt .
Alan Levenson , chief economist at T. Rowe Price Associates , said consumers such as the Van Lierops were engaged in an unprecedented payoff of their debts .
July ’s steep drop surprised him , as it did many analysts , but he said that could partly reflect banks writing off more of their bad consumer loans .

“ Even as the economy moves toward recovery , we ’re going to see the saving rate rising , ” Levenson said .
“ That ’s going to limit spending . ”
Consumer spending has been sluggish recently , rising 0.2 % in July and 0.6 % in June , the Commerce Department reported last month .
Meanwhile , consumer debt declined at an annual rate of 10.4 % in July , according to the Federal Reserve data .
Overall , outstanding debt fell from $ 2.494 trillion to $ 2.472 trillion .
But because of high unemployment , consumers still do n’t feel confident ; the August jobless rate jumped to 9.7 % .

The Consumer Reports sentiment index this month fell to its lowest level since the height of the financial crisis last October , Consumer Reports magazine said Tuesday .
Almost 38 % of Americans had at least one major negative personal finance event in the last 30 days , the magazine reported .
Even those who borrow for big purchases are working to erase the debt as quickly as possible .
Paul Thomas , 56 , spent $ 6,000 in July to purchase new kitchen appliances for his Long Beach condominium .
He now owes less than $ 4,000 after making payments of more than $ 1,000 each in the last two months .
“ I do n’t have any car debt and I . . . only have a credit card balance for a big purchase like the appliances , but I will get rid of it quickly , ” Thomas said .

COLUMBUS , Ohio —
Ohio House lawmakers moved to shield gay and transgendered Ohioans from being discriminated against in housing and employment issues in a historic vote Tuesday afternoon .
By a vote of 56 - 39 , the anti-discrimination measure passed the House with five Republicans , including Rep. Matthew Dolan of Russell Township , joining all 51 majority Democrats present in the House chamber in approving the measure .
It now moves to the Senate , where Senate President Bill Harris , an Ashland Republican , has told reporters he does n't believe the measure is needed .
Supporters painted it as bringing fairness to the workplace by adding protections for gay and transgendered Ohioans , while opponents said it forced people to endorse a lifestyle that many object to on religious grounds .
Lawmakers may have been split over the issue , but the crowded public gallery above the House floor was united in support of the legislation .
Audience members gave lawmakers a standing ovation as House Speaker Armond Budish gaveled the crowd back to order .
It was the first time Ohio lawmakers have voted to extend civil rights protections to people on the basis of sexual orientation .
" This was a very big vote , " said Budish , a Beachwood Democrat , after the session .
" This was important for Ohio .
There is no reason why someone should be able to be fired from a job because of their race or their religion or their gender or their sexual orientation .
We have brought Ohio 's laws into a more fair and just state today . "
The legislation adds sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing , employment and public - accommodation purposes .
It is already illegal in Ohio to discriminate against a person on the basis of race , color , religion , national origin , handicap , age and ancestry .
Some conservative lawmakers were aghast at what they saw as an thinly veiled attack on the traditional family .
Rep. Jeff Wagner , a northwest Ohio Republican , said lawmakers " should not use the machinery of government to force people to accept lifestyles that they do not believe in . "
Said Wagner : " If I must blindly accept everyone 's lifestyle to be nondiscriminatory , then that is a price that I 'm not willing to pay . "
Further salt in the wounds for most House Republicans was a parliamentary end run Democrats used to block an amendment that Republicans wanted to offer .
The amendment , being pushed behind the scenes by the powerful Ohio Chamber of Commerce , would have made changes to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission 's procedures , including capping damages on awards .
Tuesday 's vote was a long time coming for supporters who had watched previous proposals do little more than gather dust since as far back as 2002 .
The vote helps make gay and transgendered people feel more welcome in Ohio , said Lynne Bowman , executive director of Equality Ohio , a nonpartisan group that advocates for gay and transgendered rights .
In 2004 , Ohio voters passed a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage .
" It 's about economic development , " Bowman said .
" It 's about tearing down the fences at the borders of Ohio that say , ' You are not welcome here . ' "

I do n’t want to write about John Edwards .
You do n’t want to read about John Edwards .
And yet here we are , nearly two years after the National Enquirer first reported he had an affair with a then - unnamed campaign staffer , and Edwards is still managing to keep his private screw - up in the headlines .
According to the latest reports , the former Democratic politician is maybe , kinda , sorta considering publicly admitting that he is the father of Rielle Hunter ’s young daughter .
Someone really should tell him we all already know .
Back when Edwards was a rising star in the Democratic Party , people used to say he was the next Bill Clinton .
But even Clinton only dragged his feet for eight and a half months of denials and partial - admissions before coming clean about his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
What they do have in common is that both men seem to have been just as afraid of privately admitting to their wives what they ’d done as they were of disclosing their transgressions to the country .
If Edwards failed to learn from Clinton ’s example , he ’s at least providing a textbook example for future politicians of how not to handle a scandal :
Do n’t have an affair while you ’re running for president .
Especially not if your wife is a beloved cancer survivor .
If you do have an affair , for God ’s sake , use protection .
If you do n’t use protection , and your mistress gets pregnant , do not ask a friend of yours to take the fall and claim the baby is his .
Friend or not , he will write a book someday .
If you do ask a friend of yours to take the fall , do not also enlist campaign supporters to pay off your mistress so that she ’ll stay quiet .
She wo n’t .
If you do convince supporters to pay hush money , do not go visit your mistress ( who you have publicly denied you were involved with ) and your child ( who you have publicly denied is yours ) at a hotel in Los Angeles .
And if you ignore all of this and do make that visit and get caught by the National Enquirer and decide to finally confess the affair , do not take your cue from 1980s pop songs and continue to insist that the “ kid is not my [ daughter ] . ”
That will only seriously piss off your mistress .
Not to mention your wife , when you eventually have to admit the truth to her , because this is the 21st century and we have tests that can establish paternity and even though your magical silver tongue made you rich and famous , you will not be able to talk your way out of that .
Plus , the kid looks exactly like you .
Now , in addition to the personal drama of whether or not Edwards will admit that he fathered Hunter ’s daughter–and , presumably , bear some responsibility for supporting her–Edwards is facing a potential legal battle as well .
A federal grand jury in North Carolina is investigating whether the efforts of Edwards and some of his campaign supporters to keep the affair secret violated campaign laws .
Why , that could almost be the premise for a primetime television drama …

Last week , a shocking GQ investigative report , “ None Dare Call it Conspiracy , ” hit the newsstands .
Not that most people would know about it .
Oddly , the magazine ’s parent company , Conde Nast , seems bent on squelching the explosive article .
The report links Russia ’s intelligence service to a series of bombings in 1999 — blamed on Chechen terrorists — that killed over 300 Russian citizens , led to the Second Chechen War , and propelled Vladimir Putin to the presidency .
At the center of the story is a Mikhail Trepashkin , a former KGB - turned - FSB agent , whose detailed allegations draw into question Putin ’s role in the bombings .
Similar inquiries have led to the mysterious deaths of both journalist Anna Politkovskaya and Trepashkin ’s former colleague Alexander Litvinenko .
Perhaps fearing that the story would impact the advertising revenues of the four titles Conde Nast publishes in the Russian market , the media company has attempted to bury the piece .
In an internal email on July 23 , obtained by NPR ’s David Folkenflik , one of the media company ’s top lawyers informed GQ editors that “ Conde Nast management has decided that the September issue of US GQ magazine containing Scott Anderson ’s article … should not be distributed in Russia . ”
The report was not teased on the magazine ’s cover and , as of now , is not available on the magazine ’s website .
Gawker has attempted to rectify the situation by posting a scanned copy of the article on its website and asking readers to help them translate the article into Russian .
While Conde Nast has thus far been silent on the NPR report ( they did not respond to my request for comment ) , this appears to be a clear - cut case of commercial interests trumping journalistic integrity .
As Scott Anderson , the author of the piece said to Folkenflik
I think it ’s really kind of sad .
Here now is finally an outlet for this story to be told , and you do everything possible to throw a tarp over it .
By attempting to stifle the report , Conde Nast may end up succeeding in bringing more attention to the piece .
That , and inadvertently making one of the strongest arguments yet for supporting independent nonprofit media like NPR ( and Mother Jones ) .
An arrest – and remand time – for being suspected of possessing extreme porn may act as wake - up call for those who thought that the new law on extreme porn would just quietly fade away .
Nathan Porter , of Jones Street , Pendleton , has been charged with seven counts of possession of extreme pornographic images and appeared for a bail hearing at Salford Magistrates Court on Wednesday 26 August 2009 .
This followed a police search of his house two days earlier , when various items , including a computer , were seized .
According to a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , seven DVDs were seized containing pornography that featured content of a bestial nature .
This is certainly not the first case in which individuals have been charged under the new law and a number of cases have been reported since the legislation went live in January this year .
So far , porn involving animals has featured on a fairly regular basis .
The first ever conviction under this law appears to have been of a man charged on 14 counts of possessing " images involving women and animals " on 10 February .
This may be something of a surprise for both advocates and opponents of the law .
During parliamentary debate , the focus was primarily on the question of extreme porn involving adults , and where the lines should be drawn on that .
It is , however , only the second confirmed case in which an individual has been prosecuted solely on grounds of possession – and as far as we are aware , it is the first in which an individual has spent time on remand .
Otherwise , cases have tended to be " extreme porn - plus " .
Colin Blanchard from Littleborough , near Rochdale was charged with possession of extreme porn plus indecent images of children .
Alan Moore , of Windslow Drive , Carrickfergus , was charged with extreme porn possession plus indecent touching of a minor .
The fact that an unconvicted individual can spend time in prison before a court has considered the nature of the material for which they have been arrested could well re-ignite debate on the issue .
Individuals may be remanded in custody on a number of grounds – usually where there is fear of them absconding , or where they might interfere with an ongoing investigation .
According to the CPS and police , opposition to bail in this case was the latter : investigations are still ongoing for other serious matters .
Mr Porter is likely to remain in custody until at least 7 October , when the case is sent to Crown Court for directions : that is , a judge will decide how it is to be tried .
Possession of extreme porn is what is known as an " each way " offence , as it can be tried by magistrates or before a judge .
The fact that this case is being sent to Crown Court would certainly imply that the CPS consider this to be a serious offence . ®

A Federal Government backbencher says the world 's rising population is to blame for the most serious global problems .
Labor Member for Wills Kelvin Thompson has told Parliament that global warming , water shortages and even terrorism and wars can be traced back to overpopulation .
Mr Thompson recently linked terrorism with Australia 's immigration levels , suggesting a smaller intake would allow more time to assess applications .
He says there is a strong case for population control if world governments are to deal effectively with environmental , economic and social problems .
" It is time for governments and policy makers around the world to come to their senses and take steps to stabilise the world 's population , " he said .
" It needs to happen in every country , including here in Australia - especially here in dry , arid Australia . "
Mr Thompson has also taken aim at his own city of Melbourne , saying planners have tried to prevent urban sprawl with high - rise development to accommodate the increased population .
" What they do n't realise is that it is n't halting any urban sprawl at all - suburbs continue to march out onto the horizon , " he said .
" Melbourne is becoming an obese , hardened - artery parody of its former self .
" There is something intangible but important about the personal space of a backyard .
" I believe the children who grow up in concrete jungle suburbs are subject to more bullying and harassment and are more vulnerable to traps like crime and drugs . "
Check out this celebrity wax figures , i know that author had some great idea but look this figures , few figures do n’t even like real person …
Epic fail !
A wax sculpture is a sculpture made in wax .
Often these are effigies , usually of a notable individual , but there are also death masks and scenes with many figures , mostly in relief .
The properties of Beeswax make it an excellent medium for preparing figures and models , either by modeling or by casting in molds .
At ordinary temperatures , it can easily be cut and shaped ; it melts at a low temperature ; it mixes with any coloring matter , and takes surface tints well ; and its texture and consistency may be modified by the addition of earthy matters and oils or fats .
When molten , it is highly responsive to impressions from a mold , and once it sets and hardens its form is relatively resilient against ordinary temperature variations , even when it is cast in thin laminae .
These properties have seen wax used for modelling since the Middle Ages .
One of the assets the government will sell is the Tote bookmakers Gordon Brown is to announce the sale of £ 16bn worth of assets by the government in a bid to shore up public finances .
The prime minister will give details of initial sales which could raise £ 3 bn - including the Tote , the Dartford crossing and the student loan book .
He will announce the sale in a speech on Monday as an alternative to immediate cuts proposed by the Tories .
The Conservatives said the sale was " probably necessary " but " no substitute for a long - term plan " .
Mr Brown will say premature cuts risk " snuffing out " the economic recovery when the job of fixing the global economy is only half done .
The plan is to sell a " portfolio of non-financial assets " held by Whitehall and local authorities over the next two years .
They will include the Tote bookmakers , Dartford crossing , the student loan book , the Channel Tunnel rail link and - having protected national security - the government 's stake in Urenco .
It is no substitute for a long - term plan to get the country to live within its means
Conservative Party spokesman
This is a European uranium consortium , in which the government has a 33 % stake .
It supplies equipment to enrich uranium for the nuclear industry .
The government will also sell surplus real estate which is part of the £ 220 bn owned by its departments and agencies .
" We need a deficit reduction plan that supports growth and jobs not one that snuffs out recovery before it has started , " the prime minister will say .
" Restoring public finance sustainability must be done in a way that supports growth not destroys it .
The failure to do so is the real risk of a lost decade of austerity . "
The funds raised will help finance new capital investment and pay down debt , Mr Brown will say .
In April , Chancellor Alistair Darling forecast that public borrowing this year would reach a record £ 175 bn over the next two years .
A Conservative Party spokesman said : " As any family knows selling off things helps in the short - term and , given the state the country is in , is probably necessary but it is no substitute for a long - term plan to get the country to live within its means . "
HAVE YOUR SAY I 'm surprised there 's anything left to sell Toby Coulson The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , Vince Cable , said the policy was fundamentally flawed .
He said : " Part of the problem here is that a lot of the family silver 's already been sold .
There is n't very much left , I mean the last government had massive disposal of assets and there 's only a little bit , there are a few offerings left .
" What worries me about the government proposal is that they 're proposing to sell off in very depressed markets , under very depressed markets for land and for shares .
" The student loan book is a slightly easier thing because it 's government backed , but they 're going to get very distressed prices .
This is not a good time to sell assets . "
Number 10 said the sale marks the beginning of a radical assessment of what other non-core government business activities can best be done by , or in partnership with , the private sector .
However Downing Street added that although these actions are important , a vital force for debt reduction will be the restoration of strong , sustainable growth within the economy .

' After 8 years of a president sent by God to lead the American people and rescue us from the horrors of 911 and Islamo - fascists , it now boils down to this ? '
JACKSON , Miss . --
The University of Mississippi has shortened one of its fight songs to discourage football fans from chanting " the South will rise again " during part of the tune , which critics say is an offensive reminder of the region 's intolerant past .
However , some fans have continued to recite the chant at the end of the song , " From Dixie With Love , " despite the change made last week at the chancellor 's request .
The Ole Miss band performs the medley before and after games .
Earlier this month , the Ole Miss student government passed a resolution suggesting the chant be replaced by the phrase , " To hell with LSU . "
Dan Jones , who became Ole Miss chancellor in July , said he asked the school 's band director , David Wilson , to modify the song to support the efforts of the Associated Student Body .
He said he has received complaints from alumni that the slogan is offensive .
" The fact is , the phrase ' The South Will Rise Again ' is not part of our tradition or spirit , and it is inconsistent with the university 's values and what Ole Miss stands for -- a great public university with a focus on the future , " Jones said in a phone interview Thursday from the campus in Oxford .
The modified version of the song ends abruptly before the chanting phase starts .
It was first played Saturday at Ole Miss 's homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham , but that did n't stop some fans from chanting .
Brian Ferguson , 26 , head of the Colonel Reb Foundation , said he views the university actions as an attempt to silence students .
" I think it 's a big to - do about nothing .
There were very few people other than the students who knew to say it , " said Ferguson , whose organization works to preserve traditions at Ole Miss .
But Ferguson agreed that the chant really is n't a tradition .
" If the students get fired up and upset enough about it , they 're going to continue to say it .
Our biggest fear is that that 's going to lead them to eliminate ' From Dixie With Love , ' altogether . "
The song blends the Confederate Army 's fight song , " Dixie , " with the Union Army 's " Battle Hymn of the Republic , " according to Peter K. Frost , a visiting professor of history and international studies at Ole Miss .
The school has worked to erase its image as a bastion of the Old South , which was solidified in 1962 when James Meredith 's admission as the first black student led to a bloody standoff .
The university six years ago decided not to have an on - field mascot during sporting events , getting rid of the long - standing Colonel Rebel , a white - haired old man who carries a cane and resembles a plantation owner .
At the time , school officials had said they needed a more athletic - looking mascot .
The teams are still called the Rebels .
Sophomore Cortez Moss , director of communications for the ASB , said the organization is trying to explain to students why the phrase is offensive .
" You take back on that slave mentality , " said Moss , who is black .
" I know the South wo n't rise again and the South can't rise again . "
Former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale , who donated $ 100 million to the university in 2000 , said the chant should be abandoned .
" I hope it will pass on quietly and the students will refrain from the chant , but I found out a long time ago it's hard to tell students what to say and what not to say , " Barksdale said Thursday .
Roun McNeill , a former ASB president who is now in law school at Ole Miss , said his own decision to refrain from the chant was easily made .
" I said the chant one day and there was a black family sitting in front of me and they turned around and gave me this look like I hurt them , " McNeill said .
Sarah Palin ’s done it again !
The most unpredictable , independent - thinking politician in generations has “ turned her back on the GOP ” by endorsing the Conservative Party candidate in upstate New York ’s special congressional election .
Declaring the pro-choice , pro-gay - marriage Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava no different than the Democratic candidate , Palin wrote on her Facebook page last night that Conservative candidate Doug Hoffman is really the one who “ stands for the principles that all Republicans should share . ”
But the fact is that this move , despite seeming mavericky on its face , just is n’t .
Enthusiasm for Scozzafava ’s candidacy among Republicans is noticeably lacking , and plenty of influential groups and high - profile names have already declared their support for Hoffman .
But more to the point , while bucking the official party establishment ( the one that , you know , wants to actually win sometimes in the Northeast ) , Palin is also ingratiating herself to the party ’s base , the one that will make or break her chances of ever becoming the Republican nominee for president .
To wit , when rumored 2012 candidate Newt Gingrich announced his support for Scozzafava last week , the conservative blogs went ballistic .
RedState editor Erik Erickson posted , and later deleted , an item with the headline , “ Today Newt Gingrich Takes Himself Out of the 2012 Running . ”
Michelle Malkin suggested Gingrich go “ his own way ” with Al Sharpton and Nancy Pelosi .
Yes , we ’re talking about Newt Gingrich .
So while we ’re sure Palin really does support Hoffman for the reasons she claims , she ’s probably also doing it to protect her own political future .
Which is fine — but it does n’t make her a maverick .

This view of the volcanic plains of Neptune 's moon Triton was made from topographic mapping of images obtained by NASA 's Voyager 2 spacecraft during its August 1989 flyby .
NASA released new pictures of Neptune ?s freezing moon Triton , made from data taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft on its way out of the solarsystem in 1989 .
The close - upshots reveal Triton 's pockmarked surface , covered with crater scars fromyears of space rock impacts , as well as smooth volcanic plains , mounds andround pits formed by icy lava flows .
The photographs were released to commemorate the 20 - yearanniversary of the Voyager flyby ofthe moon , the last solid object visited by the spacecraft .
The images weremade using topographic maps derived from Voyager 2 photographs .
Among its discoveries at the moon , Voyager 2 revealed that Triton has active geysers .
And with surface temperatures at minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 235 degrees Celsius ) , Neptune ' slargest moon is one of the coolest objects in the solar system .
The unmanned Voyager 2 probe launched in 1977 on a grandtour of the solar system , visiting Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune , aswell as many of their moons , before moving on to interstellar space .
The probe is currently about 8.4 billion miles ( 13.5 billionkm ) from the sun , or almost 90 times the distance between the sun and Earth .
Voyager2 and its sister , Voyager 1 ( also launched in 1977 , and currently thefarthest away man-made object , at about 10 billion miles , or 16 billion km fromthe sun ) are still operational and still transmitting data .
Both probes carry with them golden phonograph records withsounds chosen to communicate a sampling of humanity to any extraterrestriallife they may encounter .
The contents , which include greetings in 55 languages , as well as music such as Bach 's Brandenburg Concerto , gamelan music fromIndonesia , Louis Armstrong 's " Melancholy Blues , " and many others , were chosen by a NASA committee headed by Carl Sagan .
However , there has long been criticism that , while it accurately captures the growth or contraction of the overall economy , it is a crude tool for describing social health .
The United States , for example , with the world ’s largest economy , naturally tops G.D.P. rankings , but it ranks lower by other measures .
The United Nations Development Program ’s human development index , which incorporates G.D.P. as only one of a number of criteria , ranked Iceland , Norway and Canada the top three spots in 2008 , with the United States a distant 15th .
The human development indexes also seek to incorporate the value of a long and healthy life , access to knowledge and a decent standard of living .
As an alternative to the developed world ’s pursuit of G.D.P. , the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has chosen to focus on “ gross national happiness , ” complete with the 4 pillars , the 9 domains and the 72 indicators of happiness .
Mr. Stiglitz noted that recent U.S. Census data showed that over the years 2000 - 8 , America ’s median household income fell about 4 percent .
But over the same period , he said , G.D.P. — the number on which the media and government were focused — was rising .
“ There is n’t a single indicator that can encompass everything , ” said Enrico Giovannini , the chairman of the Italian national statistics agency , Istat .
“ It ’s not a question of replacing G.D.P .
It ’s a question of complementing it with other indicators that can provide other measures of well - being . ”
Mr. Giovannini , who until recently was the O.E.C.D. ’s chief statistician , said the challenge would be for national authorities to go back and try to begin implementing the commission ’s recommendations .
He said the best hope was that countries would work out common standards under the auspices of the O.E.C.D. , because “ otherwise we ’ll have a patchwork of indicators . ”
Yet for all the enthusiasm of Mr. Sarkozy and the participants at the conference , Mr. Stiglitz , a former adviser to President Bill Clinton , said “ putting together the new indicators is not going to happen overnight , ” because of the need to gather and test the data .

Essays and thoughts on the nature of the universe , our path in life , and about the human condition .
It was an amazing weekend - we saw Americans across the country taking to the streets in support of healthcare reform .
We saw many organizations coming together to tell Congress to get back to work and pass a real healthcare reform bill .
And even though the media is still trying to spin this as an equal contest between right wing reform opponents coming out to disrupt , and the mass of Americans who just want Congress to fix our broken health insurance system now - well , the facts are hard to argue with :
YallaDog 's great photoblog explains that although the tea party crowd showed up , they were seriously outmatched :
You will be pleased to know that just our overflow crowd out numbered the loons and factually - challenged by about 5 or 6 to 1 .
One of the organizers told me that they had about 1500 seats available in all the locations and more than 3 times that number showed up .
And in Orlando , Florida , 1,100 people from all walks of life :
Unlike the numerous town - hall meetings and tea parties that popped up opposing reform , the rally demonstrated support for President Barack Obama 's call to reform the nation 's health - insurance system .
Organizers estimated more thanthat about 1,100 people , many of whom were members of unions and religious and retiree groups , attended the event at the Orlando Downtown Recreation Complex near the Amway Arena .
Check out more photos at healthcare09 .
In New York 's Times Square , more than 3000 gathered , having walked from all five boroughs - and bria and casperr were there to document with amazing photos .
And of course the hundreds in Portland ( h/t Anima ) , and yes , 800 in Fargo of all places .
But wait there 's more : OFAonthebus , drawing crowds across the country :
These crowds come on the heels of last night 's 1,500 - plus reformers gathering in Denver , Thursday 's 1,000 plus rally in Albuquerque and another 1,100 on Wednesday night in Phoenix -- all part of Organizing for America 's national bus tour .
Not to mention 2000 in St. Louis last night .
Tonight is Indianapolis , with Columbus , Pittsburgh , Charlotte , and Raleigh to follow .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger today called on state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate ACORN , the left - leaning national community organization that has come under fire in recent days after conservative activists released videos that they said showed the group ’s workers offering advice on how to set up prostitution businesses .
A hidden - camera video released Tuesday by James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles , who posed as a pimp and a prostitute , depicts a woman who O’Keefe says is an ACORN worker in San Bernardino saying she could show them “ how not to get caught . ”
On the video , which is edited , she also discusses shooting and killing her ex-husband and says she “ laid some groundwork ” beforehand by going to domestic violence shelters and saying she was abused .
The pair has previously released similar videos in Baltimore , Washington , D.C. , and Brooklyn , N.Y. , that have appeared on websites and the Fox News channel .
In a letter to Brown released to reporters , Schwarzenegger , a Republican , said the reports “ concerned me greatly . ”
“ I believe it is appropriate that your office launch a full investigation into ACORN ’s activities in California , ” the governor wrote .
“ My administration stands ready to assist in any way necessary . ”
Brown spokesman Scott Gerber said in a statement that his office would review the video , " and if we think there 's any wrongdoing , we 'll look into it or refer it to the local " district attorney .
The U.S. Senate voted Monday to block federal housing grants to the group , which has also come under fire in voter registration fraud cases , particularly during last year ’s presidential campaign .
The group registers voters for Democrats .

In Oregon and Washington , there are many activities that give startup companies the chance to present to Angel Investors .
[ Editor : John Sechrest has put together what is , arguably , the most comprehensive collection of Oregon Angel events and organizations in existence .
It ’s an honor to have the opportunity to publish this guest post . ]
[ HTML1 ] Just as the sun is starting to fade and the rain is starting to be a daily occurrence , the Northwest Startup Ecosystem is starting to bloom .
During the quiet of the summer , seeds were being planted , companies reviewed and now in October , things start to move .
In Oregon and Washington , there are many activities that give startup companies the chance to present to Angel Investors .
In Oregon , there is a flow to the year .
Beginning with small opportunities to get out in front of people and followed by big events that can put you in front of potential investors .
This is the week where everything comes into full glory :
Stepping through the Oregon Angel cycle
The Seed Oregon events start with quick pitches , giving you the ability to network with Angels and other entrepreneurs .
The momentum continues to build from these beginnings to several more events throughout the year .
Following the Seed Oregon pub talks , the Oregon ecosystem has several Angel Conferences in Bend , Portland , the Gorge , and — this year — Eugene .
Each of these Oregon Angel Conferences has an associated collection of investors who have formed an LLC and which puts forward an investment as part of the conference .
Typically the investment is in the $ 100,000 range .
As a part of these Angel Conferences , the finalist companies are put through a multi - week due diligence process .
Entrepreneurs who have not won the conference investment have made comments about how valuable the due diligence process was for them .
More over , this due diligence frequently leads to side deals by the angels who have been deeply engaged in the company evaluation .
At the 2009 Willamette Angel Conference , there was an investment of $ 125,000 made to the winning company .
Shortly after the conference , a second company was funded to a similar amount by a subset of the conference investing LLC .
More over , a third company was able to raise a similar amount .
Within five months , three separate companies were able to raise funds over $ 100,000 each .
Close to $ 500,000 investments from a single conference .
After a company makes progress through the Angel Conferences , there is an expectation of a “ follow - on round ” which takes the company to the next level .
The Angel Conference term sheets typically are written as a convertible note , with a 12 - 18 month timeline for finding the next round of funding .
In Oregon , the Oregon Angel Fund ( OAF ) provides a medium sized Angel round , typically in the $ 400 – $ 500 K size .
OAF partners with the Portland Angel Network to review company pitches and to engage in the due diligence .
The goal for OAF is to invest in 4 - 5 companies a year , leading to an investment every couple of months .
Startups can also connect in with several different Angel Networks which also do investments .
Angel Networks will meet monthly to review company submissions and to decide which companies will get investment .
The Portland Angel Network , Oregon Angel Fund and the Women ’s Investment Network are all affiliated with the Oregon Entrepreneurs Network .
The OEN runs several programs for entrepreneurs .
In addition to the conferences , OEN provides business plan reviews and a series of courses on topics vital to startups .
One of the great side benefits of this public conference format for Angel Investing is that it grows new Angel Investors as well as supporting the growth of entrepreneurs .
The initial investment in an Angel Conference is around $ 5000 .
While the Oregon Angel Fund requires an investment of $ 25,000 .
These costs for participating as investors in the programs , provide a low cost , low risk way for someone interested in Angel Investing to explore the process with a support network to help guide the way .
This pathway from small ( $ 5000 ) to medium ( $ 25,000 ) to large ( $ 100,000 ) investments gives new angels a way to build a diversified portfolio and a set of investing skills .
It provides a way for entrepreneurs to develop relationships with Angel investors who can become champions for their work as they grow into needing further rounds of funding .
Angel investors beyond Oregon … but still within reach
The Northwest Entrepreneurs Network ( NWEN ) has a series of pubtalks , classes , business plan reviews , morning networking breakfasts as well as the NWEN First Look Forum , an introduction to new companies .
In contrast to the progression seen in the Oregon efforts , however , the Washington Angel groups are focused on the bigger deals .
There is no equivalent collection of Angel conferences that put money into the equation along with due diligence .
The Puget Sound area has several very successful Angel investment groups , including the Alliance of Angels , Tacoma Angel Network , Bellingham Angels , the Seraph Capital Forum , the Northwest Energy Angels and the Puget Sound Venture Club .
Each of these is an Angel Network , where you can connect with Angels and they may or may not invest in the deal that is presented .
The Keiretsu Forum is a larger collection of groups in several cities including Seattle , Bellevue , Boise , and Portland .
They are a for profit Angel program which typically invests larger amounts into companies .
This tends to cause them to be investing in later stage companies than the Angel Conferences .
On Oct 20th , the Keiretsu Forum is hosting a Angel Capital Expo , gathering several different angel groups together to look at several companies .
This follows closely on the heels of the NWEN First Look Forum on Oct 14th , which will provide 12 companies the chance to pitch to Angel investors for the first time .
Generally , none of the Washington conferences , pub talks or meetings provide an investor LLC making an investment in the prevailing company .
The one group which does have a prize is the Zino Society , which puts up a $ 50,000 prize for the prevailing company .
In the Oregon Angel Conferences and the Oregon Angel Fund , investors are typically putting in 20 to 40 hours of due diligence on each company .
This due diligence often has positive transformative impacts on the companies that are participating .
In Washington there is substantial deal flow and substantial amounts of Angel Investments being made .
This investment is in the form of private group investment , with little insight provided to the novice Angel investor or to the novice entrepreneur .
The Oregon process has significantly more access for companies to learn about the process , to engage deeply with Angel Investors and to watch the process from beginning to end .
The key question will be if that process leads to more entrepreneurs who make more successful companies that lead to more successful exits .
Since most Angel investments take an average of 7 years to mature , the results are not yet in on the Oregon process .
Running with the Angels
Both portfolios from the Angel Oregon Conference and from the Oregon Angel Fund are running above expectations for companies at their current stage .
This suggests that the process is working well .
If you are an Oregon entrepreneur looking for a way to make your company stronger , consider going to the Angel Conferences and Pub Talks .
The conferences are an effective way to learn more about the questions that you need to know the answer to .
Your business will be stronger for understanding the questions that the Angel Investors are asking , whether or not you are seeking external funding .
If you are a successful Oregon entrepreneur and you get your Oregon Angel Funding , there is a good chance you will be heading into Seattle to look for Venture Funding if you need follow on funding .
Consider participating in the Seattle events and start building your network in the Seattle region .
If you are a Washington Entrepreneur , consider coming to an Oregon Angel Conference .
You will learn a lot about the process and you might find a few good ideas to take home .
There are some interesting activities happening in Oregon which might be a way for us to increase the number of successful companies in the Northwest .

The FTC released guidelines designed to crackdown on the blogger payola the risible practice of paying people to write favorable things about your products or company .
As the editor who runs the Reviews team here at PCMag.com , I thought it would be worth my time to wade through the 81 - page guide of regulations .
After all , the penalty could be $ 11,000 per violation .
Near as I can tell , the regulation will require every blogger to disclose payments , gifts , and professional interests for every tweet , post , or email that supports a given company .
In other words , this mess of regulations misunderstands media , creates unenforceable rules , and , quite possibly , violates our First Amendment right to free speech .
For starters , let me review how PCMag.com does business .
Vendors loan us products to review .
We test them .
We send them back .
That 's pretty much it .
Staff can't take cash or gifts of value from vendors although you will be hard - pressed to find a staffer without at least a dozen 512MB USB keys filled with press releases and images .
There is also a drawer full of T - shirts .
Our advertising department has no say in what we write and neither do vendors .
Sometimes companies are upset about what we write , but they know the deal going in .
PCMag has been in business for longer than I have , and I take lot of pride in working here .
Truth be told , many of our competitors also have rigorous editorial standards .
A lot of established blogs have standards that are just as high .
For that matter , I know individual bloggers who are informed , scrupulous , and utterly enjoyable to read .
So why is the FTC setting up different types of rules for PCMag , or indeed , why is it setting up rules at all ?
The new rules extend far beyond bloggers .
Facebook updates , Twitter posts , Tumblr photos , even word - of - mouth marketing can be now be regulated by the FTC .
Like most people , I despise this type of covert marketing more than anything .
But , at some point , I think we have to let people post , blog , tweet , and say what they want to one another .
We can decide whether or not to believe them .
Part of my problem with the FTC is that it sees a line between blogs and traditional media that does not exist .
According to these new FTC regulations , if some 20 - year - old college kid convinces Microsoft 's PR department to send him a copy of Halo : ODST for free and he writes a blog post saying how much he loved it , he has to disclose that he got the game for free or face a $ 11,000 penalty .
Recently , PCMag got a copy of the and positively reviewed it ( It got 3.5 stars ) .
We do n't have to say a thing about where we got the software .
Why the difference ?
According to the regs :
" The Commission does not consider reviews published in traditional media ( i.e. , where a newspaper , magazine , or television or radio station with independent editorial responsibility assigns an employee to review various products or services as part of his or her official duties , and then publishes those reviews ) to be sponsored advertising messages . "
Well , bully for traditional media whatever that means these days .
As an occasional blogger , frequent Twitterer , reluctant Facebooker , and full - time journalist , I wonder what set of rules the FTC would have me follow ?
Better still , what are the chances it COULD make me follow them ?
Put aside the inconvenient fact that there are millions of bloggers in the world and hundreds of millions of social media users on Facebook posting new content every second .
Let 's assume the FTC can totally track all that and that the threat of an $ 11,000 fine scares everyone into line , even that @SexySingle334 spambot on Twitter .
Let 's say everyone wants to comply with these guidelines .
Where are all these disclosures supposed to reside ?
If Dell pays someone to post something nice on Twitter , must the disclosure fit within the 140 character limit ?
Would they reside on the company 's Web site ?
The regulations also have a lot of weird provisions for celebrity endorsements .
Near as I can tell , they say that Derek Jeter has to drive a Ford Edge , Tiger Woods has to wear Nike undershorts , and Kylie really , really has to like Windows 7 .
She also might be liable if " more happy is n't coming . "
I am only half kidding .
Again , from the FTC document :
" A significant percentage of consumers are likely to believe the celebrity 's statements represent his own views even though he is reading from a script .
The celebrity is subject to liability for his statement about the product . "
Unlike Kylie , who I hope has a good lawyer , we are not children .
When we read something online , we decide whether to trust the source .
We do the same thing when we watch broadcast TV , read established media web sites , and peruse the daily newspaper ( those that are left anyway ) .
If Law & Order 's Sam Waterston tells me how much he loves TD Ameritrade , I will assume he is being paid for it .
If I stumble on a particularly effusive review from an unknown blogger , I will take it for what it is possibly authentic , possibly payola .
What I do n't see is the need for FTC intervention .
I do n't doubt the FTC motives here .
I am all for consumer protection and think disclosure is always the best policy .
If the FTC wanted to do some good , it should wade into the morass that is the personal information business , a snake pit that consumers .
In those rare cases where an individual takes a payoff to post and we are mostly talking about individuals here there are better remedies .
We can decide for ourselves who to trust .
We can shame companies that participate in pay for post schemes and stop buying their products .
We can shun social media shills that fill our feeds with sponsored noise .
Consumers already have the power .
And the FTC is trying to take some of it away .
Yes , there are rules to the media business .
PCMag has been following them for years .
You have to build trust with an audience , and you do it with honesty , transparency , and accuracy .
These rules apply to old - school mags , new school web sites , and even aspiring social media luminaries .
These rules determine success or failure .
These rules should not be made by the Federal Trade Commission .

When diminutive French president Nicolas Sarkozy gave a speech at a factory he was flanked by workers no taller than him - leading to accusations of a set - up .
How do short people disguise their height ?
Tall partners can help by crouching At 5ft 5in ( 165 cm ) Nicolas Sarkozy is only an 2.5ins shorter than the average French male , yet his height is frequently commented on .
Now aides to the French president are accused of seeking out only short people to make their boss look taller .
On a recent visit to a motor technology plant in Normandy , 20 of the shortest workers were selected to share a stage with Mr Sarkozy .
One of them told Belgian TV she had been chosen because her small stature would n't make the president look short .
But the Elysee Palace dismissed the allegation as " absurd and grotesque " .
Yet Mr Sarkozy would not be the first person to try to appear taller .
So how do others manage it ?
1 . Wear heels , like cowboy boots .
And you do n't have to be short to seek a greater height in this way .
Sir Cliff Richard admitted donning heels to boost his 5ft 10in ( 178 cm ) frame on stage , to match his tall dancers .
And Sir Mick Jagger , who stands shoulder to shoulder with Sir Cliff on height , if not sexual politics , has worn elevated Nike trainers on the red carpet to get nearer to his 6ft 2in ( 188 cm ) girlfriend .
2 . Or elevated shoes , for a more discreet rise .
It 's not the sort of footwear that can be bought in a High Street shoe shop , but there are plenty of options available online , promising a height boost of anywhere between two and five inches .
Media commentator Vince Graff , who is " 5ft 2 - and - a - bit inches " , tried them for a night out , achieving a four - inch increase .
Instead of showing a big , chunky heel , the footwear conceals the lift it provides inside the shoe - making for a " discreet " way to grow instantly taller .
But the deception comes at a cost to the wearer - Graff likens the experience to wearing a pair of stilettos .
3 . Dress tall .
Fashion is governed by rules and dressing to give the illusion of a few extra inches is no different .
The golden rules include wearing one colour head - to - toe and avoiding turn - ups as they have the effect of shortening the length of the leg , according to the Style Directions website .
Also , go for well - fitted clothes as poor fitting ones can emphasise width which in turn decreases the perception of height .
A stool can provide a boost 4 .
Know your limits when picking a partner .
" When you 're a teenager , you learn quite quickly that if you 're 5ft 2ins you can't date a girl more than 5ft 6 , " says Mr Graff .
" Even if you do n't think it looks ridiculous , passers - by do . "
5 . Find someone who is prepared to compromise .
Love is a two - way street , which presumably explains why Rod Stewart 's partner Penny Lancaster , 6ft 1in , reportedly steps off the kerb for publicity and paparazzi photos shots , so she does n't tower over her husband , who is 5ft 8ins .
6 . Use a footstool .
Mr Sarkozy 's people may be rebuffing claims that he surrounds himself with shorter people , but there was no denying the president 's use of a footstool at the D - Day anniversary this year .
Speaking from the same lectern as President Barack Obama ( 6ft 1in ) and Prime Minister Gordon Brown ( 5ft 11ins ) , he stood on a box to deliver his address .
7 . Clever editing .
Pedestals are commonly deployed in Hollywood , especially for those actors who have the looks even if they lack sufficient stature .
In Top Gun , for example , viewers remain unaware that Tom Cruise is a few inches shorter than co-star Kelly McGillis , thanks to favourable camera work .
8 . Quit the denials and take advantage of it .
Short women may find their height less troubling than men but even for a woman 4ft 11ins ( 150 cm ) is considered extremely petite .
Yet that 's how tall British freediver Sara Campbell is .
Nicknamed Mighty Mouse , Campbell held the world record for free immersion , diving to 81 m without oxygen assistance .
Her lungs are 50 % larger than average and her extraordinary physiology has been studied by doctors .
In a world where a carefully manipulated image ( and sometimes stack heels ) are essential , definitive vital statistics can be hard to come by .
The heights shown here are those most commonly recorded for each world leader Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , for example , is variously reported as being between 5 ' 2 " and 5 ' 4 " tall Napoleon 's height was once commonly given as 5 ' 2 " , but many historians have now credited him with another 4 inches owing to a miscalculation between French and English units of measurement
A selection of your comments appears below .
I am 5 ' , and my husband is 6 ' 5 " .
Although I would love to be taller simply to find it easier to buy clothes , I do n't have any issue with my height and neither does my husband .
I have found in the past that short men feel I 've betrayed them for some reason , and tall women dislike me for " stealing " a tall man .
Ultimately , what difference does a persons height make to their ability to do a job ?
Let 's face it , until relatively recently , I would have been considered around average height .
Jennifer Brand , Dundee Being 6ft 1ins myself , I once dated a bloke who was 5ft 2ins .
I did exactly the same as Penny , stepping off the pavement when photos were taken so it would n't show the difference in height so much .
Now I have learned my lesson , and am now with a lovely partner who is 5ft 11ins .
This makes so much difference as we do n't get the funny looks from people .
Rhian Keene , Cardiff
My parents are one of these odd height couples , my Dad is 6ft3 " & my Mum is just over 5 ft .
She says she never noticed the difference , until she catches a glance of them together in a shop window where she has to admit , they look ' ridiculous '
Kitty , Nottingham
Always being the first to enter ( and last to leave ) a situation where ' impromptu ' photographs are to be taken means that a short person can position him / herself closer to the camera , making use of perspective to seem taller by comparison to others present .
( This can , however , make an average - sized head seem very much larger ! )
Gerry Campion , Glasgow , UK
When reading this barmy item I am reminded of what Britain 's 5 ' 2 " dynamic prime minister Lloyd George told a journalist who commented on his small stature during the First World War , " Where I come from they value the worth of a man from the neck up " .
But it 's rather like being female - to get anywhere you have to be better and more bloddy minded than the rest .
Small is beautiful - 5 ' 2 " ' Snowy "
' Snowy ' White , Guildford , England I do n't understand why people moan at being 6 foot or less .
I 'm 6ft 4 and struggle to fit in cars , planes and trains .
If you 're under 6ft consider yourself lucky that the world is scaled for you .
Some tall guy , Toobigville , Giantland
The only piece of advice worth listening to in that list is number 8 .
Being short is great .
I 'm 5 ' 1 " and I would n't have it any other way .
Emily , Edinburgh Talk about the " Napoleon Complex " .
From the press noise I was n't surprised about Sarkozy , but I had no idea Medvedev and Berlusconi were vertically challenged .
Peter Young , Surrey , British Columbia , Canada
When I was younger , I always wanted to be tall , as I thought being tall gave one an advantage ( and in some cases , it might ) .
Nowadays , I am quite happy to be small ( app. 5 ' 2 " , so compared to my husband who is 6 ' 0 " , I look really short ! ) .
I wo n't go into a list of advantages but as a confident , mature adult , I definitely do n't feel the need to try to hide my short stature in any way .
The only gripe I sometimes have is that it is difficult to find clothes which fit ( even so - called " Petite " sizes are sometimes too big / long ! ) .
Sophie Watson , London I am 4 ' 9 " but carry myself with confidence and authority .
Some people tell me they are suprised at how tiny I am when they stand next to me because I always give an impression of " height . "
Jen , Ontario I 'm 5 ' 0 " & perfectly happy with that .
I 'm normal , everyone else is tall .
I do get a bit annoyed when people say " oh , so - and - so 's tiny " when they 're taller than me !
I *really * want to know the height of John Holmes ( The Now Show & others ) because I 'm not convinced he 's my height or smaller .
But , my height means I get to ride ponies as well as horses & ponies are much more fun .
Puddingandpi , Brighton I 'm 4ft 10 and a half inches tall , and it's the first thing people notice .
I get fed up of people mentioning that I 'm so tiny .
It 's as if they think I 've never noticed not being able to reach high things !
Having a tall partner is n't a bad thing .
At least they can reach things that you can't .
Alternatively , wear high heels .
Lyndsey , Cambridge
One world leader who appears to be incredibly touchy about his height is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The New Yorker estimates he 's about five feet tall .
Davros , York Perhaps people would have less of a problem with height if we started quoting our own height in metric units , removing the arbitrary six - foot target .
Martyn , Manchester
If I was the president of one of the most powerful countries in the world , and had an ex-supermodel as a partner , I think I 'd manage not to worry too much about my height .
And all this high heels and stools is just silly .
It 's like people with thinning hair - having a comb - over looks SO much worse than just getting it all shaved off and forgetting about it .

In The Mythology of Intellectual Property , I mentioned that “ The Product of the Intellect Is n’t Property ” and pointed out that , consequently :
Even the law does n’t recognize copyright as “ property ” .
If you violate copyright laws , it is not called “ theft ” ; it is called “ copyright infringement ” .
There ’s always someone willing to argue the point , though , no matter how wrong the person might be .
I guess not everyone in the world has read my comments on the subject yet .
Earlier today , in fact , someone called copyright infringement “ theft ” in the context of altering the license on a piece of open source software — which would be a case of “ copyright infringement ” .
What follows is an adaptation of my response to that email .
I mostly just modified stuff that needed to be changed so it would make sense outside the context of the mailing list discussion .
The term “ Intellectual Property ” is essentially an invention of people who wished copyright , patent , and trademark bodies of law were treated more like actual property law .
Saying something is “ intellectual property ” sure makes it sound like violating the relevant law should be called “ stealing ” , but it ’s still not theft under the law ( unless you happen to live in some jurisdiction that treats this stuff in a very nonstandard manner — I ca n’t speak for all jurisdictions , since I know nothing about copyright law in Eritrea , for instance ) .
Not only is copyright not legally considered theft , but it is not practically equivalent to theft , either .
In theft , a person has a thing in his or her possession , and the thief takes it away .
There is no thing in a copyright holder ’s possession that is taken away when copyright is infringed .
The common excuse for calling it theft is reference to the copyright holder ’s profits being “ stolen ” , but because those profits do not even exist yet at the time of the copyright infringement , they are not literally being “ taken away ” .
As I hinted above , I suppose it is possible that Eritrea , or even Portugal , does not legally differentiate between theft and copyright infringement .
Maybe in Portugal the word for “ theft ” is defined differently than here , so that it applies not to property per se , but to any illegal act of acquisition ; that is not a jurisdiction whose copyright laws are familiar to me .
I rather doubt it , though , because a legal definition of theft that is applicable to copyright would fail to account for actual theft of actual property of naturally limited abundance .
Given an example with which I am more familiar ( the United States ) , though , I cite Dowling v. US :
The infringer invades a statutorily defined province guaranteed to the copyright holder alone .
But he does not assume physical control over the copyright ; nor does he wholly deprive its owner of its use .
Dowling v. US specfically set forth for those who wished to define bootleg recordings as “ stolen property ” the details for why this was not an appropriate definition , and rejected outright and in all its particulars the concept that copyright infringement is theft in any legal sense of the term .
The reasoning is summed up in the above two - sentence quote from the Dowling v. US decision .
The economic principle that differentiates copyright infringement from property theft is that of rivalry .
A rival good is one whose use by one consumer prevents the use by another , whereas a nonrival good is one whose use by one consumer does not interfere with use by another .
Copyright infringement is illegal acquisition , by a consumer , of a nonrival good ; property theft is illegal acquisition , by a consumer , of a rival good .
Copyright violation does not deprive anyone else of the opportunity to acquire or use the good in question , whereas property theft does , accounting for the differences of legal status for acquisition between rival and nonrival gods .
Thomas Jefferson , in discussions of the idea of copyright and patent law before such were even included in the US Constitution , made this distinction as well :
He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me .
The metaphor of a taper ( i.e. , candle ) is quite apt for these purposes , I think .
Disclaimer : I am not a lawyer .
This is not legal advice .
If you want legal advice , talk to a lawyer .
This is just “ please stop confusing the issue by using the wrong terms when you get into flame wars ” advice .
Developing Zapatista Autonomy : Conflict and NGO Involvement in Rebel Chiapas
By Niels Barmeyer
University of New Mexico Press , 2009
The influence of the Zapatistas has gone far beyond the small state of Chiapas or even Mexico .
Their message and political ideas have echoed around the globe , so much so that Oaxaca - based writer Gustavo Esteva writes that , “ Zapatismo is perhaps one of the most important political initiatives in the world today . ”
This is the starting point taken by German anthropologist Niels Barmeyer , who , “ like most other internationals , ” went to Chiapas in the 1990s for a Zapatista fix , “ drawn by notions of egalitarianism , communal living and independence from globalized economies . ”
Barmeyer relates how he was originally captivated by the dynamic Zapatista movement through his involvement in the left / autonomous scene in Berlin , which exposed him to ideas about participatory democracy and horizontal forms of social organization .
Barmeyer put these theories into practice through working in solidarity with the Zapatistas in Chiapas , first as a human rights activist in peace camps and later as a volunteer installing water systems in indigenous rebel villages .
But as he methodically dissects his extensive research and experience in Zapatista communities since the uprising of 1994 , Barmeyer ’s gaze moves from that of a bright - eyed solidarity activist to that of a dispassionate critical anthropological student , thus ensuring a rigid , unsparing and often scathing appraisal of his subjects .
Barmeyer ’s experience is not simply the familiar narrative of a white European going to a foreign land in search of the exotic other and finding only disillusionment and disenchantment .
His is a careful study of a revolutionary initiative and its repercussions , specifically the problem of reconciling the language and posture of the actors ( local , national and international ) and the actual situation .
So , for example , within the Chiapas solidarity and nongovernmental organization ( NGO ) circles Barmeyer moves in , he finds that , “ in order not to obstruct the efficiency of fundraising rallies and volunteer recruitment … critical overtones are often omitted and the proliferation of idealized images is perpetuated . ”
It is this proliferation of idealized images that Barmeyer deconstructs in this work .
These idealized images are , he posits , forged in the writings of Zapatista spokesperson Subcommander Marcos and reproduced by solidarity groups and NGOs working in the region .
The result is “ rosy portrayals ” that are “ stunningly uncritical ” in their analysis , more reflective of what the people outside want to hear than of the reality on the ground .
Taking a closer look at the much - feted workings of Zapatista governance — generally understood as an extension of a deeply rooted egalitarian indigenous culture —
Barmeyer describes how , in practice , decision - making structures are often dominated by men , older community members , and those who can dispense patronage .
“ Autonomous administrative structures and the way today ’s rebel municipalities are run have little to do with Mayan heritage but are actually a hodgepodge of practices ranging from the Catholic cult of village saints imposed by the Spanish crown to the ejidal administration structures laid down in Mexico ’s Agrarian Law and organizational elements introduced by cataquistas ( lay preachers ) and Maoist students in the 1970s . ”
Academic texts are often turgid and difficult to decipher .
Barmeyer ’s work ( conducted in the context of a Ph.D course ) is saved by a lively , informative and often witty tone .
Caught between activist and academic camps , he is mischievous in his descriptions , as his friends become “ informants ” ( informers , some would say ) , and his home in San Cristobal , where he invites Zapatistas to stay , his “ center of research . ”
Barmeyer befriends one local Zapatista — Cipriano , a self - described wild rover — and he and his extended family become the ongoing object of Barmeyer ’s research .
Therein lies the dubious academic practice of befriending people on the ground to study them .
Early in the book , Barmeyer describes how one local NGO operative refused to allow him to participate in the group ’s solidarity project , because he thought Barmeyer ’s anthropological research would injure the communities involved and provide fodder for the Zapatistas ’ enemies .
However , it can also be argued that an extensive and thorough investigation into the failures of the Zapatista movement such as Barmeyer ’s work can strengthen and consolidate the movement .
Despite its devastating critique , Developing Zapatista Autonomy aims not so much to undermine the validity of the rebel project , but to dispense with idealized images .
Instead of harboring untenable illusions or offering unconditional solidarity with revolutionary groups , Barmeyer ’s work allows Zapatista supporters to reflect on the development of the Zapatista project for autonomy so far .
As the tide turns for the Zapatistas and they fall out of local , national and international favor , is the movement strong enough to respond creatively to growing criticism , both within Mexico and internationally ?
We do n’t know what a birthday is but clearly this is the best one ever party .

A driver for the television show " Leverage , " the TNT series filming in Portland , picked the wrong guy to start yelling at .
The show was filming Friday night at Portland City Hall when the truck driver singled out Commissioner Randy Leonard as he walked into the building .
As Leonard tells the story , the man was sitting in the cab of his truck and started yelling at him , complaining that Leonard was getting in the way of having Mayor Sam Adams recalled .
Leonard said the man used derogatory language about Adams .
Leonard , who has a reputation for speaking his mind and not backing down from confrontation , told off the man in a way that 's inappropriate to repeat in a family blog .
" I told him that he could do to himself something that is anatomically impossible , " Leonard said later .
The conversation got increasingly heated and eventually , Leonard said , he went inside and reported the argument to the Mayor 's Office .
A couple of Adams ' staffers returned to the sidewalk and the conversation with the driver continued .
Michael Fine , who heads the city Office of Film and Video , apologized to Leonard in an e-mail after one of the show 's managers called him .
" The folks in production are not happy about it and I 'm sure will be speaking to their driver about his attitude , " Fine wrote .
A spokeswoman for Electric Entertainment , the Los Angeles - based production company that is filming " Leverage , " was unavailable today .
Leonard said he often gets confronted about his support for Adams , be it on the bus or the street , " and that 's fine . "
Adams has been under fire since January , when he admitted lying during the 2008 mayor 's race about a sexual relationship he had in 2005 with an 18 - year - old man .
Organizers of a recall campaign are collecting signatures to put the issue on the ballot .
" I usually ignore those kind of comments , " Leonard said .
But with the truck driver -- " Given his relationship to the city -- he was working in the building -- I felt they were inappropriate .
" On a number of levels I felt like he violated a number or protocols , " Leonard said .
" I said what I said and I do n't regret it . "

The Greens have proposed amendments to the Rudd Government ’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which expose Labor for the environmental hypocrites they are .
The Greens would replace the ALP ’s pathetic five percent reduction in greenhouse gasses by 2020 with a 25 percent reduction , and move to 40 percent if there is agreement at Copenhagen , compared to the Government ’s 25 percent in those circumstances .
There are some other amendments too .
The Greens would auction all carbon permits rather than give the polluters between 70 and 95 percent of their permits free of charge .
They ’d compensate trade - exposed industries only for the value of their lost competitiveness – not lost profits .
They ’d give no compensation to electricity generators .
Their Safe Climate Bill released today goes further .
It commits Australia to a target of 350 parts per million of CO2 , a result serious climate scientists like James Hansen from NASA say is essential now to save the planet from catastrophic climate change – ‘ fast - feedback ’ .
The level currently is 390 ppm , and growing by 2 ppm every year .
Rudd ’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme aims for a ‘ manageable ’ 450 to 550 ppm .
The Greens ’ Bill includes other measures .
As they say , it
introduces a suite of measures aimed at achieving 100 % renewable energy in Australia in the coming decades ; introduces a suite of measures to upgrade all of Australia ’s homes , offices and industry for energy efficiency ; establishes the pathway to a sustainable transport future ; protects and builds our carbon stores in forests and soils ; and creates hundreds of thousands of jobs in making this transformation a reality .
The last point is the most important for workers .
They want to save the planet and jobs .
While I disagree with the idea that the market can solve the problems the market created , I can count .
So can the Greens .
They have no chance of negotiating these amendments with the Rudd Labor Government successfully – they are two Senators short .
The solution ?
The Greens should build and lead a mass movement on the streets and in the workplaces and schools and universities to force Rudd to make the CPRS better .
The victories of the past have been wrested from the grasping hands of capital through mass mobilisations and strikes , not negotiating from a position of social weakness .
Most importantly the Greens could begin a real campaign for green jobs , green jobs , green jobs .
The working class wants climate security and job security and the Greens need to convince us their plans do n’t destroy jobs .
The argument is simple .
If we do nothing there wo n’t be an economy , let alone jobs .
If we adopt Labor ’s CPRS , there wo n’t be an economy , let alone jobs .
Only a fight for the future , for green jobs in renewable energy , in retrofitting houses , in a radical restructuring of energy provision can save the environment and jobs .
The costs will be much less than the wars we are involved in and the Defence machine that supports them .
The benefits will be a green healthy economy with jobs , jobs and more jobs .
But the Greens wo n’t mobilise people .
They wo n’t lead .
Their orientation is change from above , not change from below .
So they see negotiation , discussion and the like in Parliament as the ultimate goal and the failure to win parliamentary support the end of the story .
On the other hand , the majority of people , especially young people , think the major parties are n’t acting fast enough on global warming .
Imagine how a militant radical campaign for green jobs could ignite society , drawing in hundreds of thousands and actually having a chance of winning and gaining the Greens even more support .
Put your faith in us , Greens , not Rudd .
Fear of public speaking often feels like it hits you out of nowhere .
But I ’m going to suggest that there are three distinct causes of speech anxiety .
These three different causes of speaking anxiety relate to three different areas of the brain – the Old Brain ( it ’s called this in neuro ’ pop ’ books but is more correctly called the Hindbrain ) , Midbrain and the New Brain ( again more correctly called the Forebrain ) .
[ Note : I have edited this paragraph to make it more scientifically accurate – thank you to Zen Faulkes who commented on my previous description ] .
My descriptions are a simplification of the science – in particular , the parts of the brain all interact with each other , so it ’s not strictly correct to say that just one part of the brain causes nervousness .
But I think it ’s a useful model which may help you understand your fear of public speaking and work out the best way to reduce it .
1. Old Brain nervousness
Your old brain is the part of your brain that is constantly scanning the environment looking for threats .
Survival is what matters to the old brain .
Many people suffer from ‘ Old Brain ’ nervousness .
In prehistoric times , being part of a group was essential to our survival .
So one of the threats to our survival was being kicked out of the group .
What might get you kicked out ?
Standing out in some way , saying something offensive or stupid , or not performing up to expectations .
Fast forward to now .
You ’re standing in front of a group ready to open your mouth and your old brain goes ( metaphorically ) :
Oh -oh .
This is a threatening situation .
If you say something stupid , YOU MIGHT DIE !
It ’s no longer true that you might die , but your Old Brain does n’t know that .
Your Old Brain activates your survival system : fight , flight or freeze .
When it comes to public speaking the most common reactions are flight or freeze :
Flight –
You avoid public speaking if at all possible .
If you do have to speak , speak as fast as possible so that you get through it as quickly as possible .
Freeze –
You feel stiff and artificial as you speak , your mind goes blank .
Here ’s what can you do about this type of nervousness :
1. Accept nervousness
This type of nervousness may happen every time you speak .
Accept that nervousness may be your ever - present companion .
If you fight your nervousness ( eg : say to yourself ‘ I should n’t be nervous ’ – see New Brain nervousness below ) you ’ll make it worse .
In this post How to use your fear of public speaking to make you a better speaker I ’ve written about three specific ways to accept your nervousness .
2 . Get used to it
You may suffer from nervousness less as you gain more experience presenting .
That ’s because your old brain has gradually realized that this public speaking thing is possibly not that life - threatening .
So desensitize yourself – take every opportunity to speak in front of a group .
2. Mid Brain Nervousness
Our emotions are regulated by the Mid Brain .
In conjunction with other parts of your brain , your Mid Brain will make you nervous when you ’re reminded of a previous nerve - wracking experience .
So if you had an experience at school where you were humiliated in front of your classmates , or suffered an embarrassing mindblank in an important presentation , those strong emotional memories may come back to haunt you .
If you can readily identify a previous experience which is causing you to be nervous now , the most important thing to do is rationally evaluate how bad it was .
If you continue to tell yourself that it was a terrible , awful experience it will continue to create nervousness for you into the future .
So rationally evaluate how awful it was .
What were the consequences of it ?
Here ’s an exercise I use on our courses to help people put these experiences in perspective .
You can do this now :
Think of that nerve - wracking presentation experience .
How awful was it on a scale of 0 to 100 % ?
Imagine , your little finger has just been cut off in an accident !
How awful is that on a scale of 0 to 100 % ?
And now how awful is that nerve - wracking experience compared to losing your little finger .
Most people revise the awfulness of their nerve - wracking experience from somewhere near 100 % to somewhere near 0 % .
They would prefer to relive that nerve - wracking presentation experience rather than lose their little finger .
The loss of the finger helps them to put it in perspective .
( If you ’re happy to lose your little finger , imagine losing your hand , or the finger or hand of a loved one – at some point you ’ll gain some perspective ) .
The rational reality is that most of the things that happen to us in presentations , are not that bad .
They ’re nothing compared to the other things that can happen to us in life – like relationship break - ups , loss of a loved one , and serious health issues .
The most serious consequences of a presentation going badly are losing a large sale , an election or other contest , or your job ( though I ’ve never heard of someone losing their job because of one bad presentation ) .
These consequences are disappointing – but not catastrophic .
3. New Brain nervousness
The New Brain is the conscious thinking part of your brain .
Most of us have patterns of thinking that contribute to our nervousness .
You can reduce your nervousness by exploring your patterns of thinking .
This is part of the basis of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy .
One of the most common patterns of thinking that contribute to the fear of public speaking are demands .
Here ’s an example of how they operate .
A few weeks ago I was running a training course .
I knew that the CEO would be one of the participants .
I felt myself get a little nervous as we were setting up .
When he walked into the room I got hot and my heart started racing .
Why would I react in this way ?
I have a demand around CEOs .
It goes something like this :
CEOs are really important and I must have their approval .
My demanding thought made me nervous .
What was the result ?
I messed up the instructions for a simple exercise that we do at the beginning of every course and that I ’ve done perfectly hundreds of times before !
Here are some common demands people have about presenting and public speaking :
I must be interesting and engaging I must n’t leave anything out I must n’t waffle I must n’t show I ’m nervous I ’ve got to be able to answer every question
These demands make you nervous because you ca n’t guarantee that the demand will be met .
To reduce their power , rationally analyze the truth and usefulness of these demands .
For example , with my CEO demand I can see that it ’s not essential that a CEO approve of me .
I do n’t demand that everybody approves of me – and it ’s irrational to demand that a CEO must approve of me .
I can also see that it ’s not useful to have this demand as it made me mess up !
In the post The Seven Thinking Sins of Public Speaking I ’ve analyzed other common demands and explored how to defuse them .
I get that fear of public speaking can be debilitating , and can have you avoid opportunities in your life .
I hope this post has been useful to you in thinking through how you can best reduce your nervousness .
Please let me know what you found most useful by writing a comment below .
You may never have written a comment on a blog before , after all its similar to public speaking – you ’re saying something that many people will read .
It may make you nervous … accept that and write the comment anyway .
Look forward to hearing from you :-) .
NBC has a huge slate of new shows after their apparent failures of the last few years , and has filled the 10 PM slot with all Leno .
NBC is clearly the weakest of the broadcast networks , and has to do a lot to get back to the top or even approach .
Will it 's new shows survive ?
Let 's find out .
Trauma
NBC has been playing promo after promo of this and we get the deal .
Helicopter crashes , car crashes , Crash Bandicoot crashes .
There is going to be a huge accident every episode and the paramedics rush in to save people risking there own lives in the process .
While the premise gives chance that there will be some depth to the show , so far it looks like explosions and people screaming .
I expect this to fall flat on its face .
There are plenty of other shows with the same quality already out there and I do n't think people care about a medical - action show .
It 's airing after Heroes whose fans are n't exactly the brightest when it comes to knowing what constitutes a good show so Trauma has a chance to take the reins of the sheeple and run with it .
Parenthood
Maura Tierney 's medical condition pushed this to midseason , so all the buzz it was receiving might not be there .
I have n't watched the film this is based off , but the premise seems great and the cast is fairly strong .
Assuming it will stay in the 8 PM Wednesday slot , which does n't have much going on other than American Idol .
If it can pick up the people wanting scripted programming , this could succeed , but I really do n't know what to expect .
This is a wildcard for me .
Mercy
We get it .
Nurses are smarter , more caring , know more medicine , and better human beings than doctors .
Did n't you already know that ?
Other than Michelle Trachtenberg doing her crying routine , this shows looks stupid .
There is nothing that differentiates this from other nurse shows , so why watch ?
I know I wo n't and neither will most people .
Expect a resounding failure here .
Day One
The description of the show was released months before we saw an actual preview , so we were wondering , is this Jericho , Lost , The 4400 ?
Well it turns out that this is more NBC 's answer to ABC 's remake of V .
It 's an alien invasion story involving a group of residents at an apartment complex , put there specifically to save humanity .
The preview was highly impressive and it actually looked better than Flash Forward to me .
Later , there was some bad news .
NBC executives seemed to be planning for failure , saying this might be a single - event deal , so it may be planned to last for a season or two .
It has the 8 PM Monday midseason spot before Chuck , so the competition is heavy .
I expect this to do fairly well , and get a renewal .
Community
I already reviewed the pilot so there 's not much else to say .
I give some good info on the show so if you have to know more , check out my review .
Community is leading off NBC 's comedy block which does n't get many viewers before The Office .
Parks and Recreations is stupid ( yes , I actually watched 4 episodes ) and the ratings tanked as the season progressed .
The show is after The Office so it should get a considerable lead - in , and since people that watch The Office like funny , they should enjoy Community too .
It moves the 8 PM slot after the Olympics which worries me .
Hopefully it will gain a sizable following by then that will continue to watch at a different time .
100 Questions
Dumb all around .
It seems like NBC is trying to do some How I Met Your Mother deal , but whole marriage proposal thing is absurd and ludicrous .
The promo was n't funny and I 'm not expecting the show to be funny .
I expect this to be NBC 's biggest failure .

There is , moreover , virtue in all this .
It is something to be proud of .
Because it is only by embracing positive pride in torture that she can keep the nightmare of reality at bay .
But she is conflating private loyalty with civic responsibility .
This is , of course , one profound flaw of nepotism and dynasty in political life .
Perfectly admirable filial piety in the private sphere warps independent judgment in the public square .
Psychological forces best left to private dynamics rupture into civil discourse , giving some citizens far more power than others merely by the accident of DNA or marriage , distorting the debate , turning politics into melodrama , infesting the republican public sphere with monarchical and oligarchic cross-currents .
This was Hillary 's problem as it was Dubya's .
And so it is utterly unsurprising that family members are in the vanguard of defending a war criminal .
Family members are always , and understandably , the last defenders of the criminal .
The Cheneys ' natural inability to see Cheney in any reality - based perspective renders them psychologically able , even eager , to defend evil as a force for good in ways more forthright than others .
Why this should be a plus for Cheney among the GOP rather than an obvious conflict of interest is part of the right 's current derangement .
They too cannot hold the concept of their own moral fallibility in their fearful , clenched minds .
While I 'm at it , the next time Liz Cheney simply states that " waterboarding is n't torture " , will someone please ask her to follow through ?
She needs to take a trip to Cambodia , visit their Museum of Torture , and request that the waterboard be removed from the exhibit .
It is , after all , a mere enhancement of interrogation .
And television hosts are constrained from asking her such a blunt question because it appears unseemly to attack a daughter for the sins of the father .
And so the corruption spreads .

Psycle and Windows 10 Posted by : [ JAZ ] , 02.08.2015 , 17:14 .
Hello .
Windows 10 has just recently been officially released , and given the ability to upgrade to it for free that Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users have , it is to be expected that sooner than later you will start using Psycle on it .
I 've just done that , and so far , it seems to work well ( WASAPI , MIDI , VSTs in general ... ) , but there are a few things that pop up here and there .
First off , there is a strange problem with the plugin cache .
It has to be regenerated , else Psycle does n't start .
I am not sure if this is because of some concrete plugin , or it is in how the cache is saved ( i could n't made a compare between a working and a non working one ) .
There is an easy way to regenerate it without deleting the file explicitly ( the place where it is located depends on where you are saving the configuration ) :
* Launch Psycle with the parameter / skipscan
There are several ways to do this .
One is opening a command prompt in psycle 's folder , and then writing psycle.exe / skipscan .
The other is modifying the psycle 's start menu link and adding / skipscan at the end of the destination ( add a space before / skipscan )
* Once Psycle launches this way , go directly to " configuration " menu and clic on " Regenerate the plugin cache " .
Do not try to open the add machine dialog , since that runs the process that we 're trying to avoid .
The other issue is that some VST plugins might not work or crash .
Aside of the problems that were already present in Windows 7 and 8 ( which is that some plugins need Psycle to run as administrator ) , I 've encountered a problem with BlueCat freeware plugins .
I had to uninstall them , because they crash Psycle when it scans them .
Strangely , the 64bit versions seems to work well .
I will investigate this further .
If you found any other relevant issue , feel free to post it on the boards so that we take a look at it .

Development is near for a new release Posted by : [ JAZ ] , 02.08.2014 , 20:44 .
I am finishing the modifications on usability and verifying that there is n't anything broken .
Summary of changes :
* Virtual generators ( indexes from 81 to FE usable as " virtual generators " .
They appear in the generators combobox and can be used in the pattern .
* Sampler and Sampulse instruments have an option to assign them to a virtual generator index and sampler / sampulse machine that it will use to play .
* " aux " column is working properly as a volume column with virtual generators .
* The different modules load and use the virtual generators .
It is important to know that some pattern rows do not use virtual generator indexes , because of " previous unknown " ( data in the pattern without specifying which instrument it uses ) , or special meanings ( see in the tweakings and commands documentation , the Sampulse command part to know more about this ) .
* note duplicator machines support virtual instruments ( this might be useful now , think about multi-osci samples )
* Sampler machine implementation modified .
Now it supports the mcm command correctly ( needed for the volume column of virtual generators ) , and also added the portamento to note command .
There have also been some other changes related to how the keyboard handling is done , mostly to clean up the code and avoid duplicates .
I still need to test all the cases to validate it 's working as expected .
Finally , some of the bugs reported here have been fixed as well .
I will probably release 1.11.4 * alpha * tomorrow or so , in order to allow you to have a first look at it , before releasing 1.11.4 beta publicly in one or two weeks .
I will post some screenshots in google plus site .

Microsoft has released free security software for Windows .
But the company has confirmed it will only work with legitimate copies of the operating system .
The software , once codenamed Morro , is now known as " Security Essentials . "
It 's a replacement for OneCare , a previous Microsoft security product that was not free .
Effective , but Falls Short of Rivals
Independent tests of the finished product suggest it 's a useful tool , though falls short of the protection offered by commercial rivals .
One company testing it found Security Essentials detected 98.4 % of malware and 90.9 % of spyware .
Impressively , it picked up all 3,700 security threats when run against a database of the current most common threats .
( Source : computerworld.com )
However , the software does have some limitations .
It can only track down threats by matching the relevant files to its database , rather than using " heuristic " techniques which also look for suspicious behavior .
It also struggles to remove all traces of some viruses and does n't automatically switch the Windows firewall back on when it 's been disabled by a virus .
No License , No Protection
In somewhat of a surprise , Microsoft has announced that Security Essentials will only work on legitimate copies of Windows .
While installing the software , a user will need to go through a brief validation process which automatically checks if they are running a valid copy of the operating system .
( Source : windowsteamblog.com )
Making the software exclusive to legitimate Windows users would not have been an easy decision .
At first glance it seems obvious that only people who've paid for the software would deserve the freebie .
Viruses Don't Discriminate Pirates
From a practical standpoint , however , some might argue this theory is half baked considering that it will inevitably look bad upon Microsoft for allowing any virus to infect and spread onto other Windows systems -- whether the user owns a pirated copy of Windows or not .
It 's also arguable that security software is most needed in regions where piracy is rife because computer users are as much unable as unwilling to pay for protection .
The decision is not typical Microsoft policy : the firm does allow people running pirated copies of Windows to still receive automatic security updates for the system itself .
However , in that situation Microsoft is the only source of those updates , whereas other antivirus products , both free and paid , are available .

Issue # 101 • September / October , 2006
The year was 1873 .
Samuel Colt had invented the revolveror at least introduced it to Americain 1836 .
The Colt Navy .36 and Army .44 cap - n’- ball revolvers had been the primary handguns of the Civil War , and had proven themselves the dominant cavalry weapons of that conflict .
Smith & Wesson had leapt ahead of Colt ’s Patent Firearms with the Rollin White patent for the self - contained cartridge .
That patent had now run out , and Colt was not going to let its arch rival take over the market .
Colt now offered the world a new revolver .
Sam Colt had passed away , and one William Mason was the new gun ’s designer .
Colt called it the Model P .
It was quickly adopted by the United States Army and became the Single Action Army , or SAA in gun-enthusiast shorthand .
In caliber .44 - 40 , Colt called it the Frontier Six -Shooter .
This is the intuitive way to hold a single action , with all three grasping fingers in front of the grip .
It softens recoil but slows rate of fire because …
… it causes the gun to roll up in the hand at the shot .
If you can handle the recoil and want a fast follow - up shot …
… hold the cowboy - style revolver this way , with little finger tucked under butt , and …
… when fired , whole arm rises with gun , but gun stays in position relative to hand , allowing faster thumb - cocking to the next shot without having to re-grasp .
The world at large came to know it as “ the Peacemaker . ”
If you grew up in the 1950s and ’60s , and ever played “ cowboys , ” you probably had a Mattel Fanner 50 - cap pistol that was cloned from the Peacemaker .
Pausing briefly for WWI , Colt produced the original gun from 1873 until the beginning of WWII .
After the second great conflict , the company determined that the design was obsolete and not in demand , and let it die .
But , in the early - to mid-1950s , a spate of TV Westerns featuring the Colt six - shooter brought a new surge of interest .
A young entrepreneur named Bill Ruger , who had started a gun company in Connecticut in 1949 , decided in 1953 to bring out a copy of the famed “ cowboy gun ” in .22 caliber , and called it the Single - Six .
It was followed by the Blackhawk in .357 Magnum ( 1955 ) and .44 Magnum ( 1956 ) .
A new company called Great Western was formed exclusively to create copies of the old Peacemaker in the mid-’50s , and it was , in fact , a Great Western .45 that James Arness is said to have wielded as Marshal Matt Dillon on the classic TV series Gunsmoke .
Colt woke up and started making them again , in what gun collectors would call a Second Generation .
Colt made the SAA in various forms off and on through the rest of the 20th Century and through the present third generation , currently produced at Colt ’s Custom Shop with a hefty price tag .
In recent years , the sport of Cowboy Action Shooting truly rejuvenated these old - time six - guns .
Italian companies like Armi San Marcos and Uberti began duplicating these and many other firearms of the old frontier , at reasonable prices .
Today , the market is full of them .
An original Colt is still a pricey thing , and you can expect to pay well into four figures for an original First Generation Colt like the Frontier .44-40 I got for $ 150 along with a Colt Police Positive revolver thrown into the deal by the seller back in the 1960s .
They are excellent investments .
The best news is , there are many fine clones available for reasonable prices .
These include Ruger ’s Vaquero series , recently downsized from its heavy .
44 Magnum frame to a more manageable “ original Colt ” size ; the very nice Beretta Stampede revolvers manufactured with superior quality control since Beretta ’s purchase of Uberti a few years ago ; and the latest low - priced , high - quality bargain , the Gaucho series from Taurus of Brazil .
The allure of the Peacemaker
These revolvers are gate - loading single actions , and as such were obsolete before the 19th Century turned into the 20th .
“ Gate - loading ” means that cartridges are inserted one by one through a cut - away exposed by a flip - out gate at the right rear of the cylinder .
Live cartridges or spent casings are ejected through the same portal , with a finger - pushed ejector rod mounted in a housing offset on the right side of the gun ’s barrel .
Single action means that the hammer has to be manually cocked with one or the other thumb before the trigger will fire a shot , and this has to be done for each and every shot .
A fast “ cowboy shooter , ” holding the gun and working the trigger with the dominant hand and cocking the hammer with the support hand thumb in a two - hand hold , can shoot one of these old - time revolvers as fast as a modern double - action revolver , which needs only a pull of the trigger for each shot .
When firing one - handed , though the way half or more emergencies requiring reactive use of a handgun end up happening , it seems the single action just ca n’t keep up with a modern double action .
Since the 1890s , Colt and S&W and similar double - action revolvers have had swing - out cylinders from which all six spent casings can be ejected with a single push of an ejector rod .
With the cylinder swung out of the gun , all six cartridges can be reloaded at once in a double - action revolver if the shooter has a speedloader or a moon - clip device to hold all the cartridges together in a single unit .
Ruger ’s New Vaquero .45 is a faithful replica of the original Peacemaker externally , but with much sturdier and more modern ( and safer ) internal mechanism .
It is also far more affordable .
Let ’s put the difference in reloading time into perspective .
Plucking cartridges one by one out of belt loops or dump pouches , cops from the 1930s onward were able to meet a demanding standard that the FBI developed during that period : Draw , fire six shots double action , reload , and fire six more , all in 25 seconds from seven yards , the distance FBI had established was the average for gunfights back then .
This became much easier in the 1970s when speedloaders which had actually existed in the late 1800s became popular among police and armed citizens .
Give me a good double - action revolver and full moon clips or Safariland Comp III speedloaders , and on a good day I can do that drill in only six seconds .
And if that seems fast , consider this :
The record , held by Jerry Miculek , is 2.99 seconds for those same 12 shots , all hits , with a Smith & Wesson Model 625 .45 revolver , reloading with a “ moon clip ” that holds all six cartridges together .
By contrast , today or at any other time period , it took a true master shooter to make the 25 - second time with a single - action , gate - loading Peacemaker or equivalent .
That ’s how long it took to punch each spent casing out of the cylinder and reload each of the six chambers one at a time .
But today , you still see single - action frontier - style revolvers worn by traditionally minded people ranging from working cowboys to ordinary folks who just like living in the back country .
Part of it is tradition .
But there is more than tradition at work there …
The backwoods rationale of using the single action
There are several rationales for using the single action in the backwoods .
The least of these , but still on the radar screen , is the fact that the large frame models are more rugged with heavy handloads than double actions .
Back in the 1950s , the great outdoorsman and gun expert Elmer Keith wrote that he had determined the Ruger single - action Super Blackhawk to be a stronger .
44 Magnum than the only double action then available in the caliber , Smith & Wesson ’s Model 29 .
The first .454 Casull revolver , a crushingly powerful weapon , was the superbly crafted five - shot Freedom Arms , a gun designed faithfully in the single - action , gate - loading Peacemaker style .
A more important reason for some was cost .
A friend of mine who won many honors on the Alaska State Patrol calls the Ruger Super Blackhawk “ the official Alaskan handgun . ”
People who go fishing or hiking in bear country there are in truly deadly danger from the big brown bruins , and when the .44 Magnum came out in 1956 , the double - action Smith & Wesson cost in the $ 120 range , but the Ruger single action had a $ 96 price tag .
To this day , the top quality single action is less expensive than the equivalent quality double action , most brands for most brands .
I would submit that there is a much better and much more practical and tactical reason why so many people who live in rural America choose a single action as their “ backwoods gun . ”
They are not particularly concerned about self defense against human predators , and should that come up , they are not terribly disadvantaged in having a powerful , reliable revolver at hand that only holds a few rounds .
Most man - against - man gunfights are over with less than six rounds fired , anyway .
No , it ’s because even today , the modern backwoods dweller rides horses .
Rides snowmobiles .
Rides all - terrain vehicles .
And that person may have to fire the handgun from that moving platform to save his or her life .
And , when you ’ve had to fire a single action revolver from a moving platform such as that , it is not going to fire a second time by accident .
It ca n’t possibly fire again until you intentionally thumb its hammer back to prepare it for the next shot .
Unloading the “ peacemaker ” style single action .
Finger pushes rod ( A ) , inside ejector housing ( B ) , forcing spent casing ( C ) , out of cartridge port ( D ) , with loading gate ( E ) open .
Let ’s think about it .
You are the typical horseman , whose mount is not accustomed to gunfire .
Suddenly , that fox that has been at the henhouse comes into sight , or you see a feral dog chasing your livestock .
The handgun comes out of your holster .
You take a sight picture , you press the trigger , and …
BANG !
Depending on the caliber , the handgun ’s report explodes not terribly far from your horse ’s ear , at something between 100 and 140 literally deafening decibels .
Is the horse likely to shy ?
Oh , yes .
You have one hand on the reins and one hand on the gun .
As the horse rears violently , throwing you off balance and destabilizing you , your non-dominant hand desperately convulses on the reins .
You have just fired a shot an instant before , so the trigger finger of your dominant hand is on the trigger of the handgun .
Physiologist Roger Enoka long ago scientifically determined how certain natural human movements under stress cause accidental discharges of guns in hand .
There is interlimb response :
As one hand closes on something , the other hand closes sympathetically , and …BANG .
There is postural disturbance :
As we start to lose our balance , we move convulsively to regain it , and our muscles sympathetically tighten , and … BANG .
There is startle response : Something startles us and makes us jump or convulse .
The gun is in the hand ; the finger is on the trigger ; the flexor muscles that close the fingers are stronger than the extensor muscles that open those fingers , and …BANG .
It is very likely to happen with a self - cocking semiautomatic pistol .
Even if the trigger has come forward on a double - action revolver or semiautomatic pistol that might take 12 or more pounds to activate , the average human hand can close its fingers with far more pressure than that , and a person who is in shape can exert the equivalent of their body weight on the hand dynamometer , or hand - strength gauge .
Autoloader or double - action revolver , in that situation , you will hear … BANG .
But with a single - action , frontier - style Peacemaker or equivalent revolver , you will hear … nothing .
Because the gun ’s design is such that it cannot fire until the thumb has performed the deliberate movement of cocking the hammer again .
Does this sound far - fetched ?
If it does , you have n’t talked with some of the backwoods people I ’ve talked with .
I know men who have had to shoot snakes and such from horseback .
Even when the horse is supposedly “ broken to gunfire ” that is , trained not to rear up and panic at the sound of a shotnone of that training encompasses getting the horse used to the thing that may have triggered the shot .
In other words , you can train a horse to ignore gunfire .
You cannot train the horse to ignore the striking rattlesnake or the lunging mountain lion that has caused you to draw and fire your gun in the field instead of in training .
Is it far - fetched to think someone might have to fire from a moving snowmobile , mountain bike , or ATV ?
Perhaps .
But then , I have not been chased by a pack of wild dogs while astride a bike , a horse , or a snowmobile .
For those who have had that experience and have had to fire to protect their lives , a gun that wo n’t “ go off by accident ” as they struggle to regain control of their “ mount ” does n’t seem far - fetched anymore .
How to shoot a single - action revolver
The first thing you need to know about single action revolvers is , do n’t carry them with a live round under the hammer .
Load the six - shooter with five cartridges and leave that last empty chamber under the down - at - rest hammer and the firing pin .
For a century , Americans understood this .
You did n’t leave a live round under the hammer of a single - action revolver because it could go off if dropped or struck .
Historians say that happened once to Wyatt Earp .
Where does that leave the rest of us “ lesser gunfighters ? ”
Do n’t leave a standard - shift car parked on a hill in neutral without the parking brake engaged , do n’t put a live round under the hammer of the single - action revolver you carry , do n’t eat the yellow snow .
These were good , logical rules of life , well understood by people who had common sense .
Unfortunately , as the 20th century wore on , common sense became less than a common trait .
People forgot the old wisdom and the old ways .
Stupid people killed and crippled themselves and others when they dropped their six - guns that were loaded with all six shots and the predictable and terrible BANG ! was heard .
Gun companies were sued .
Led by Ruger , the gunmakers who produced single - action revolvers came up with floating firing pin designs that used a transfer bar mechanism and allowed modern SAAs to be carried safely with all six chambers loaded .
The problem that followed was one of habit :
If we got used to carrying one single action with a live round under the hammer , we realized , we could transmit that habit to others .
Thumb must cock the hammer for every shot with a single - action revolver like this Ruger Blackhawk
If you want to be really traditional , use a muzzle - loading black powder six - shooter , like this modern Ruger New Army in .45 caliber .
Once this Gaucho .357 Magnum has been fired , as shown , it ca n’t fire again until hammer is deliberately cocked .
This can prevent accidental shots on horseback or if thrown from mount with gun in hand .
Thus , it has become the mark of the firearms professional that any single - action revolver is to be carried with an empty chamber under the hammer .
Engineers may consider it redundant safety practice .
Anyone with common sense calls it “ the belt and suspenders approach . ”
Firearms professionals call it “ the rule . ”
My gun safes at the moment contain two old - style Colts that would discharge if dropped on the hammer with a live round under the firing pin , and one Colt ’s much more recent Cowboy model that wo n’t .
They also contain Beretta / Uberti , Ruger , and Taurus single actions that are mechanically drop - safe with all six chambers loaded .
In my hands , all of those revolvers will be carried with an empty chamber under the hammer .
End of story , end of safety lecture .
Now , let ’s talk about shooting this kind of handgun , and shooting it well .
If you can get both hands on the gun , use the dominant hand on the grip - frame and the dominant index finger on the trigger , and the thumb of the support hand to cock the hammer .
This is far faster and more efficient than asking one hand to do all the work and the other to just go along for the ride .
You want to have a firm hold on these guns .
They have a slow lock time .
In firearms parlance , “ lock time ” is what elapses between when the trigger pull is completed and the firing pin starts to move forward , and when the cartridge in the firing chamber actually discharges .
As the photos show , these guns had big , heavy old hammers to be sure they had enough impact to light off the percussion caps of the muzzle loaders and then the early - generation primers of the old black powder cartridges the Model P was originally designed for in 1873 .
Those hammers come down with a clank that can actually move the gun if it is n’t held firmly , not the click of the lighter hammers of more modern double - action revolvers .
The heavier the impact of the falling hammer , the more disturbance to aim .
This is why Peacemaker - style revolverseven Colt ’s Bisley model , named after the famed international shooting range not far from London , England : Bisley Camp was obsolete as far as target shooters were concerned very early in the 20th Century .
If you look at the accompanying photos , you ’ll see what has become known as the “ plow handle ” grip shape of the frontier - style single - action revolver .
It was designed to mitigate the discomfort of recoil by letting the gun “ roll up in the hand ” when the shot went off .
They do this very well , and it has made generations of heavy revolver shooters more comfortable in terms of “ kick ” with single - action .44 Magnums instead of double - action versions .
However , it also slows down recovery time between shots because the gun has to be repositioned in the hand before the next shot .
In my mid-teens , shooting my modern Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum and my antique Colt .44 -40 Frontier Six -Shooter , I figured out that if I curled my little finger under the butt of the gun , it would n’t roll up in my hand .
The recoil pattern did n’t hurt me that much more , it just changed to where the whole arm lifted in recoil instead of the gun lifting in the hand .
However , the relationship of gun to hand remained constant , and allowed me to get back on target and thumb - cock that Peacemaker - style revolver for the next shot much more quickly .
I was pretty proud of myself for figuring it out , until I read Elmer Keith ’s classic book Sixguns that was written in the early 1950s and showed the exact same technique .
Turns out that Elmer learned it from the old cowboys he knew in his own youth in the early 20th Century … and they had learned it in the 19th .
All I had done was re-invent the wheel .
Author practices for “ gunfighter ” class at a Cowboy Action Match , which requires a revolver in each hand fired alternately .
Taurus Gaucho .45 in right hand has just fired and hit the steel plate at right ( note hammer down ) , while .38 caliber counterpart in left hand is about to be fired ( hammer still cocked ) .
Know how to safely load and unload your “ cowboy - style ” revolver .
With that gate - loading system , only one chamber at a time is visible to the operator of the gun .
It requires your immediate and total attention .
Slowly rotate the cylinder around twice , six plus six , to make sure that every single chamber is empty .
When you are loading , to guarantee that an empty chamber comes up under the hammer when you ’re done , with most single actions you want to follow the protocol developed in the American West in the last quarter of the 19th Century , the original heyday of this gun .
It goes like this :
Load one cartridge .
Rotate the cylinder past the loading gate until an empty chamber has gone by .
Then load four more .
This should bring the one empty chamber up under the hammer .
Then lower the hammer on that empty chamber .
With the hammer all the way down on that empty “ launch tube , ” the action is locked and a loaded chamber ca n’t rotate up “ by itself . ”
The old cowboys called the protocol “ load one , skip one , load four . ”
Always double check visually !
Looking in through the side of the gunuse a flashlight , if you ’re manipulating the revolver in the dark you ’ll be able to see the space between the rear of the cylinder and the back part of the frame in which it sits , which is called the cylinder window .
You will see the rims of the cartridges in five of the chambers , and you should be able to see the empty space , indeed the empty rear of the chamber , at the back of the cylinder under the hammer .
If you are absolutely certain that you are seeing this , then things are as they should be , and you are safe .
To free up the cylinder to make it rotate so you can load and unload , the original Colt SAA and most of the clones require the hammer to be drawn back to the half - cock notch .
Modern Ruger revolvers , the so - called New Models , free up the cylinder when the loading gate is opened and the hammer is down in its “ at rest ” position .
Do you really want a single - action revolver ?
No single - action revolver will ever be as fast as this double action Smith & Wesson Model 625 .
It needs only a pull of the trigger to fire each shot , and it can be reloaded with six .45 rounds at once using a moon clip as shown .
Let me be plain here .
I ’ve discovered in three and a half decades of writing that if you say something positive about something , you are seen as endorsing and recommending what you wrote about .
That ai n’t necessarily so , and that ’s true here .
I live in a rural area these days .
I do n’t carry single - action revolvers .
I carry modern semiautomatic pistols and double - action revolvers .
I use single - action revolvers .
Sometimes for hunting .
Sometimes for cowboy competition matches .
Sometimes just for the fun of shooting them .
I do not recommend single - action revolvers for everyday carry , except for the rural person who is constantly on horseback and may have to fire from the saddle .
In that situation , and only there , I think the single action may have a place as a constant - carry sidearm .
If the “ mission profile ” of your handgun is geared more toward self - protection , you are better off with something more modern .
Slow loading / unloading / reloading time , slow pace of sustained fire if shooting one hand only , and difficulty of quickly and safely checking loaded versus unloaded status all militate against the old cowboy - style gun , and show you why it has so long been considered obsolete by those who go in harm ’s way .
What I am saying is , if you ’re more concerned about a mountain lion or a rattlesnake when you ’re on horseback than a carjacker when you ’re on the road , the single action may have an advantage for you if you carry it carefully and safely , the traditional way .
And if you are careful and responsible , and the old ways just feel better for you , and you just feel more comfortable when armed with a single action revolver , you know what ?
You ’ll get no argument from me .
Ricky Gervais has been making the media rounds the past few weeks to talk about his new movie The Invention of Lying .
In the movie , lying leads to , among other things , the invention of religion .
So , Gervais has been talking about religion in many of the interviews he ’s done :
When [ Gervais ’ character ]
Mark Bellison learns to lie , he learns it can be used to comfort people , not just for personal gain .
Something close to Gervais ’s heart .
“ I ’ve been an atheist all my life , ” he continues , “ but I always knew that if my mum asked me when she was dying if there was a heaven I ’d say yes .
I ’d lie .
I think that ’s how religion started – as a good lie .
If you ’re not an atheist you can watch this film without getting angry .
I watch films about angels , love ’em .
I do n’t think you have to treat something that comes down on one side as propaganda . ”
[ Link ]
…
Gervais insists he is n’t worried that his views about religion could ruin his career .
“ I ’ve never tiptoed around the subject , not even in America , ” he said .
“ I say it on TV in America ; I say it on radio in America .
I nail it to the mast .
I did Inside The Actors Studio and the students were taken aback .
[ Link ]
…
“ I do n’t see why we would ever get hate mail , ” [ Gervais ] said at the movie ’s press conference .
“ We decided that in this world , that ’s how religion started .
It ’s an alternative world .
It ’s in no way atheist propaganda .
I love films about angels and things like that and I would n’t go , ‘ Oh , they ’re coming down on one side here . ’
Like ‘ It ’s a Wonderful Life . ’
I do n’t leave the cinema with my faith or lack of it challenged .
I do n’t think people should take this as anything other than an artistic choice . ”
But as might be expected from a Gervais - led panel , every serious pronouncement about the film is countered with something funny .
[ Writer / director Matthew ]
Robinson adds , “ I wrote this film to denounce one organized religion in particular and that ’s Greek mythology .
Because Zeus is not real .
I do n’t believe in him and I do n’t think anyone else should . ”
The ever - earnest [ Jennifer ]
Garner embraces the prospect of controversy .
“ Is n’t it great if [ the film ] does start a conversation ?
Religion is something worth examining and your faith is something worth questioning .
So I think if this movie asks that of people , that ’s not a bad thing . ”
Gervais prods Garner for her own belief system .
“ Yes , I do believe in God , ” she confirms .
“ Thank you for making that clear . ”

* Dollar sags under weight of global imbalances pre-G20
* Euro at 1 - year high at $ 1.4799 EUR =
* Market sentiment firmly to sell dollars on any rally
( Updates prices , adds quotes and comment )
By Jamie McGeever
LONDON , Sept 22 ( Reuters ) -
The euro hit a one - year high against a sliding dollar on Tuesday as dealers took advantage of the U.S. currency ’s rise the previous day to resume selling ahead of a Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting and Group of 20 summit later in the week .
Market sentiment toward the dollar remained bearish .
Analysts expect the Fed to signal its ultra- loose monetary policy will remain in place well into next year and the G20 to discuss rebalancing the global economy , a process which will almost certainly require a weaker dollar .
A document obtained by Reuters showed how Washington would urge G20 leaders this week to launch a new push this year to get debtor nations like the United States to save more and exporters like China , Germany and Japan to spend more .
[ ID :nLL725947 ]
Options - related demand and strong buying from Asian accounts pushed the euro up toward $ 1.48 as a dearth of major economic data or events on Tuesday left technicals , positioning and pre-placed orders being triggered to lead the the way .
“ There ’s a lot of event risk ( tomorrow ) so I suspect this is a short - term move ... and that will probably continue for today , ” said Paul Mackel , senior strategist at HSBC in London .
The Fed and Norwegian central bank announce policy decisions on Wednesday , the Bank of England publishes the minutes of its last policy meeting , and closely - watched purchasing managers data will be released .
“ But having said that , the dollar is consistently under pressure .
Many people are questioning the longer - term outlook for the dollar and are looking for opportunities to scale into dollar short positions , ” Mackel said .
At 0905 GMT the euro was up 0.8 percent on the day at $ 1.4798 EUR= , a fresh one - year high .
Against a basket of currencies , the dollar .DXY was down 0.9 percent at 76.12 , approaching the one - year low of 76.01 struck on Sept 17 .
The index has shed more than 2 percent this month as speculators dumped the dollar in favour of higher - yielding currencies and assets amid rising confidence in a global recovery and expectations rates will stay at rock - bottom levels .
The dollar fell 0.7 percent against the yen to 91.35 yen JPY= on Tuesday and was down 0.8 percent against the Swiss franc at a 14 - month low of 1.0235 francs CHF = .
DOLLAR IN FOCUS AT G20 ?
European Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber said recent moves in currency markets were “ not out of line ” given the euro zone ’s economic performance relative to other areas .
[ ID :nLM205927 ]
Some said this suggested the ECB was comfortable with the euro where it is and a green light to push it even higher , especially in light of the U.S. proposals to put fixing global imbalances on the G20 agenda in Pittsburgh this week .
“ Overall the trend for the dollar is still down , ” said Marcus Hettinger , global FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich , predicting the euro at $ 1.50 by the end of the year .
But the risk is that the bearishness engulfs the market , and the selling turns into a rout .
“ These ideas that the U.S. and Europe can come up with a deal to resolve imbalances is a pipe dream and unworkable , ” said Maurice Pomery , managing director at Strategic Alpha in London , adding that protectionism from emerging nations in the form of currency intervention was more likely .
“ A discussion at the G20 on currencies , and especially the dollar , is not only appropriate but essential , as this move could accelerate swiftly , ” he said .
The biggest mover among G10 currencies on Tuesday was the New Zealand dollar NZD= D4 , which surged more than 2 percent to a 13 - month high against the dollar of $ 0.7230 .
Dairy exporter Fonterra raised its estimated payout to farmer shareholders , pointing to stronger global demand and a recovery in dairy prices .
[ ID : nWEL488566 ]
Fonterra accounts for around 7 percent of the New Zealand economy .
Dana Delany as Carrie Bradshaw ?
Cosmo Kramer as Monk ?
Here 's a look at 11 actors who passed on some of TV 's most popular shows .
1. Bridget Fonda as Ally McBeal
Calista Flockhart was n't David E. Kelley 's first choice for the lead on his series Ally McBeal ; he originally offered the role to Bridget Fonda .
Fonda decided to stick with films and turned him down .
There were no hard feelings , though , as Kelley kept her in mind two years later when he was casting the comedy / horror flick Lake Placid .
2. Michael Richards as Adrian Monk
As Seinfeld was winding down its nine year run in 1998 , the major networks were salivating to sign the series ' stars to new projects .
ABC pictured Michael Richards as a bumbling Inspector Clouseau - type detective and pitched a premise purchased from Disney Studios about a cop suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder .
Richards , however , disliked the pilot script ; he felt that the character of Adrian Monk did n't offer enough comedic possibilities for him to work with , so he passed on the project .
With Richards ' veto , ABC lost interest in the show and eventually sold the rights to cable 's USA Network .
Monk went on to become USA 's highest - rated show and Tony Shalhoub won three Emmy Awards for his portrayal of the title character .
3. Dana Delany as Carrie Bradshaw
Sex and the City creator Darren Star first offered the role of Carrie Bradshaw to his friend , Dana Delany .
Delany had previously won two Emmy Awards for her portrayal of the compassionate nurse Colleen McMurphy on China Beach , but she was still smarting from the negative reviews she 'd gotten for playing a dominatrix in the 1994 film Exit to Eden .
She told Star that the public would never forgive her if she talked about sex onscreen again , so the part went to Sarah Jessica Parker .
4. Paul Shaffer as George Costanza
According to Paul Shaffer 's memoir , We 'll Be Here for the Rest of Our Lives , Jerry Seinfeld personally left a message stating that the role of George Costanza on his upcoming pilot was Shaffer 's if he wanted it .
But Shaffer was preoccupied with his other work and said he never got around to returning Seinfeld 's call .
5. Stephen Tobolowsky as Tim Taylor 's Sidekick
Tim Allen 's Home Improvement sidekick was originally Glen , not Al .
When the series was first being cast , Stephen Tobolowsky — you might remember him from such roles as Bob Bishop on Heroes and Sandy Ryerson on Glee — was hired to co-host the fictitious Tool Time with Tim , but a previous commitment prevented him from appearing in the pilot episode .
Richard Karn , a struggling actor who was making ends meet by managing an apartment building , happened to meet Home Improvement 's casting director while attending traffic school and finagled an audition .
Karn was invited to be Tobolowsky 's " placeholder "  in the pilot , and then was asked to film a second episode when the series was picked up and Stephen was still off working on a different project .
The studio audience reacted favorably to Karn , so when Tobolowsky ultimately bowed out of the project , " Glen "  was out and " Al Borland "  was in .
6. Bonnie Hunt as Jamie Buchman
Talk show host Bonnie Hunt was offered the role of Jamie Buchman on Mad About You , but she decided against it .
Nevertheless , she is still frequently asked to autograph photos of Helen Hunt ( who is no relation to her ) , and Bonnie 's mom is often complimented on the success of her " other "  daughter .
7. Jayne Mansfield as Ginger Grant
Blonde bombshell ( and mother of Law & Order : SVU star Mariska Hargitay ) nixed the role of sexy Ginger Grant on Gilligan 's Island , stating " I am a movie star . " 
8. & 9 . Ken Howard & Blythe Danner as McMillan & Wife
When ABC decided to turn the 1949 film Adam 's Rib into a TV series , they cast Ken Howard ( Ann Landers ' son - in - law ) and Blythe Danner ( Gwyneth Paltrow 's mom ) in the roles originally played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn .
The show only lasted 13 episodes , but Howard and Danner had such good onscreen chemistry ( many viewers thought they were married in real life ! ) that they were offered the leads in the NBC series McMillan and Wife .
Neither was interested in being part of the " wheel "  format of NBC 's mystery movies , and the parts went to Rock Hudson and Susan St. James instead .
10 . Paul Giamatti as Michael Scott
As Bill Carter reported in the New York Times back in 2006 , NBC executives had a strong favorite for the role of Michael Scott on the American adaptation of The Office — Paul Giamatti .
He was n't interested , and the network eventually offered the role to Steve Carell .
11 . Polly Bond as Miss Kitty
Of the many reasons actors give for turning down a role , " they offered too much money "  is probably not in the top 10 .
Or even top 1,000 .
But that was the reasoning behind Polly Bond 's decision to refuse the part of Miss Kitty on Gunsmoke .
The former Polly Ellis had recently married Tommy Bond , a former child actor most famous for playing " Butch "  on The Little Rascals .
Tommy was working on the production side of a local TV station at the time , and the Gunsmoke salary would 've put Polly in a situation where she was out - earning her husband , which she felt would strain their fledgling marriage .
Amanda
Blake went on to play Miss Kitty for an amazing 20 seasons , and Polly and Tommy Bond remained happily wedded for an amazing 54 years .
Summary : Open Core proponent compares the FSF to religion as means of daemonisation and Jason Perlow does this by showing a humourous photo from Linus Torvalds , then throwing in another insult at Richard Stallman
THE OTHER day we wrote about the “ Open Core movement ” , of which Mono seems to have become a part .
James Dixon , the CTO of Pentaho , slams the “ Free Software movement ” , sometimes by playing the usual card which is to compare them to a “ religion ” [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .
The Open Core advocates are generally unhappy with the critical views of the SFLC .
“ To resist freedom - hostile software is not an intolerant action ; it is responsive and defensive … ” Jason Perlow , a self - admitted opponent of the FSF ’s values [ 1 , 2 ] , is now using a photo of Linus Torvalds ( captured in Tokyo the other day ) to smear the FSF .
He conveniently ‘ forgets ’ that the FSF has nothing to do with Microsoft and it ’s not a response to Microsoft , either .
The GNU project was started in the early eighties .
It seems safe to say that pro-GNU / Linux people who are also strongly pro-Apple are those who basically go for “ anything but Microsoft ” and are therefore the real so - called " Microsoft haters " , as opposed to genuine proponents of Free software .
They basically view Microsoft — not proprietary software , software patents , and unethical business conduct — as the single problem .
It ’s like targeting a boogeyman rather than behaviour ; like targeting “ terrorists ” rather than addressing the cause of terrorism .
If it ’s a case of just wanting to eradicate Microsoft and not elimination of users ’ and developers ’ rights as a whole , what gives ?
And who would then wonder the tendency to accept DRM , TPM and TiVoisation in Linux , for example ?
To resist freedom - hostile software is not an intolerant action ; it is responsive and defensive due to gradual erosion of control .
Software used to be free before proprietary ‘ zealots ’ came along .
And it ’s getting worse all the time , surveillance - , permission - , and ownership - wise . █
“ FSF did some anti-Apple campaigns too .
Personally I worry more about Apple because they have user loyalty ; Microsoft does n’t . ”

Big screen plasma televisions are to be banned in California because they use too much energy .
In a world first , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has given his backing to the crackdown on sets more than 40 inches wide .
These liquid crystal display and plasma high definition sets can use as much as three times the power of smaller cathode ray models .
Experts say the ban will reduce the state 's rocketing electricity bill by £ 5 billion over the next decade .
This is the equivalent of about £ 20 a set per year .
Environmentalists have applauded the move by the California Energy Commission , but manufacturers claim consumers will be hit in the pocket as they rush to switch sets .
About a quarter of televisions currently available will have to be pulled from the shops , according to Doug Johnson of the Consumer Electronics Association .
'Voluntary efforts are succeeding without regulations , ' he said .
Televisions account for about 10 per cent of residential energy use in California , the state with the highest population in the U.S. , driven largely by the surge in sales of large flat screens .
The bigger the set , the more energy they use .
A vote to confirm the proposal could come as soon as November 4 .
Sets with screens of up to 58 inches would have until the start of 2011 to comply with a minimum efficiency standard , with more stringent rules being introduced two years later .
However , state regulators are still debating what standards should apply to televisions with screens bigger than 58 inches .
Energy Commission spokesman Aaron McLear said Governor Schwarzenegger had given his support to the scheme .
Commissioner - Julia Levin , who is behind the push for new regulations , said : ' We would not propose TV efficiency standards if we thought there was any evidence in the record that they will hurt the economy .
' This will actually save consumers money , ' she added .
Manufacturers claim that hundreds of the biggest selling LCD models on the market already comply with the tough new standards .
They say they are quickly coming up with ways of slashing power use through new technology and materials , making even 50 - inch models more economical to use .
Indeed , Jahn ’s own interest in testing for evidence of such “ anomalous ” interactions between mind and machine stemmed from his efforts to replicate experimental work done in the late 1960s by a fellow plasma physicist , the German Helmut Schmidt , then employed as a research scientist at Boeing .
2
Schmidt appeared to have demonstrated that a particular experimental subject had the capacity to guess numbers generated by a randomizing algorithm at a rate considerably outside the calculated margins of probability .
Working with an interested undergraduate student in the mid-1970s , Jahn had successfully reproduced some similarly anomalous statistical results using a random number generator of his own devising , and by the time he found himself chatting with McDonnell in the summer of 1977 , Jahn was already contemplating turning his research attentions fully to the sustained investigation of what he would call “ the role of consciousness in the physical world . ”
He would give the next thirty years of his life to this work , building the controversial PEAR ( Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research ) laboratories in the basement of the engineering building at Princeton University ( in the teeth of lively opposition ) , and generating , with his co-author and collaborator Brenda Dunne ( whom he encountered for the first time at that same 1977 conference ) , a massive database of tens of millions of experimental trials in which human subjects sought to influence the workings of various devices merely by thinking , wishing , visualizing , or praying .
Together , Jahn and Dunne ( who closed the original PEAR lab in 2007 , but continue to write and speak about their work ) claim to have demonstrated that human cognition has a real and measurable , if small , influence on the perceivable dynamics of the material world .
If they are correct , the implications for physics , religion , etc. , are enormous .
If they are not correct , their labor - intensive and largely sober efforts over three decades limn a zone of techno - scientific quixotism perhaps best thought of as a suburb of performance art .
Let us go forward as if we have not decided .
Earlier today a pending non-provisional utility patent application assigned to Apple Computer published .
This application , US Patent Application 20090265214 , is titled Advertisement in Operating System , and covers exactly what the title implies ; namely an operating system that is capable of displaying a variety of advertisements to users .
You are likely to have heard of the first listed inventor , Steven Jobs , the CEO and co-founder of Apple Computer , Inc .
While it is difficult to know the purpose and strategy behind a patent application , the attorneys at Fish & Richardson in Minneapolis , Minnesota , who drafted and filed the patent application certainly did a very good job describing just about every conceivable feature and alternative that could coincide with the displaying of advertisements to users of an operating system .
It almost sounds funny to call the displaying of advertisements within an operating system “ a feature , ” particularly given the annoying , ubiquitous and ever more intrusive nature of advertising these days .
In any event , the patent application is well written , albeit it written in pre-Bilski style at least with respect to the claims .
If Apple does want to pursue this all the way to a patent I suspect there will be plenty of opportunity to do so , and there will certainly be allowable claims that fall within this disclosure .
The patent application explains the basics of the invention as follows ( with reference numerals removed throughout when the patent application is quoted to facilitate reading ) :
The operating system is configured to present one or more of the advertisements to users of the computer device .
In some implementations , the operating system can disable one or more functions during the presentation of the advertisements and then enable the function (s ) in response to the advertisements ending .
That is , the operating system can disable some aspect of its operation to prompt the operator to pay attention to the advertisement .
Egads !
Using an operating system is going to become like attending an online CLE , requiring you to pay attention enough to click to continue at the appropriate time ?
Even worse , in the version where the operating system disables functionality not only will you need to click to continue , but you are going to have to stop doing whatever it is that you are doing and pay attention to the advertisement !
In all reality , I have a hard time believing that makers of computer devices would be able to get away with totally disabling the device and forcing active attention to the advertisement , at least not without the natives picking up pitch - forks and marching on Silicon Valley .
But disabling some features , perhaps like the ability to turn the advertisement off , seem just plausible enough to make me take a deep hard breath followed by a gulping swallow .
With respect to the version of the invention where you will not be able to turn off and otherwise escape the advertisement , and will need to actively do something to verify that you are listening and watching , the patent application explains :
In an attempt to ensure that the user is actually watching and / or listening to the advertisement content , the method can include a step for verifying user presence and giving proper credit ( e.g. , time for using the operating system , time for using the application program , time extension credit ) .
In some implementations , the advertisement presentation module can prompt the user to confirm that he or she is reviewing the content ( e.g. , paying attention to the advertisement ) being presented ( e.g. , the user is prompted to click a certain button , click a certain object or area on the screen , press a particular key or keys ) .
In some implementations where the computer device is a cell phone or music player , the user may be prompted to press a certain button or keypad key in order to confirm that they are paying attention .
In one implementation , the approaches for verifying user presence can be made progressively more aggressive if the user has failed a previous test .
For example , after the user fails the test the first time , the subsequent tests can be made to appear more frequently or at varying times .
As another example , the test (s ) can be made more subtle so as to render them more difficult to perceive , such as by reducing the size of a message box on the screen , or by making an audio prompt more similar to the advertisement in which it is inserted .
If the user fails the test in step the method can perform step over again ; that is , the entire advertisement can be played again while the operating system maintains the function (s ) in a disabled state .
As another example , the user ’s failure can first result in any available extension (s ) being consumed ( compare step ) , and only thereafter is an advertisement played in its entirety .
Potentially even worse than not being able to turn off the advertisement is a Big Brother operating system version that will keep track of whether you turn off the advertisement and then somehow penalize you for not watching long enough .
The patent application explains :
In some implementations , a user may dismiss an advertisement presentation prior to completion , for example , by clicking on the advertisement ( or on an unoccupied screen area outside the advertisement if the advertisement presentation occupies only a portion of the screen ) , which may prompt the processor or the log to record such an action so as to debit the user accordingly for the unfinished presentation .
As I read this my head is spinning and the walls almost feel like they are closing in on me .
There is no where to escape !
Perhaps this is a way to extract additional payments from individuals who will pay almost anything not to have their computing sessions interrupted by such invasive commercial forces .
Wait a minute , perhaps I should file a patent application on a business method for extorting sums of money from individuals who do not want to have their computers disabled and subject themselves to needing to watch advertisements .
Yeah !
Now we are on to something , as I wring my hands and escalatingly chuckle the evil villain laugh – a la Vincent Price !
Did you catch the fact though that this “ innovation ” is not limited to computer operating systems ?
Yes , if you are carefully reading you have noticed that the patent application makes reference to cell phones as well as computers .
There simply will be no escaping this high - tech advertising assault !
Of course , this is an excellent drafting technique and illustration of what really needs to be done when you write these types of patent applications .
Any time you write a patent application for software or a method tied to a computer you do not want to limit yourself to a computer , but rather you want to discuss any computerized device .
To this end the patent application explains :
While the presentation of advertisements is described in examples herein with respect to a personal computer , it should be apparent that the disclosed implementations can be incorporated in , or integrated with , any electronic device , e.g. , a device that has a visual user interface , including without limitation , portable and desktop computers , servers , electronics , media players , game devices , mobile phones , wireless devices , email devices , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , embedded devices , televisions , set top boxes , etc .
I am not a fan of allowing students or junior associates to use the term “ etc. ” in patent applications because the term has not definable meaning in patent law .
Thanks to the written description requirement what you disclose is what you are limited to , and the fact that a reader might envision other things that fit within the term “ etc. ” does not mean that it is included in your application .
Having said that , while I do n’t use “ etc. ” myself I use the functional equivalent in more expansive language .
You never know when the Federal Circuit will change patent law , and if you want to give yourself some wiggle room to argue that stuff you never envisioned at the time of drafting is included in your application then you need something , but I digress .
Returning to my astonishment … no devises are safe from Apple ’s invasive advertising campaign !
But what kind of advertisements are we talking about ?
The patent application explains :
The advertisement may include , for example , a rectangular banner ad , an audio ad , a video clip , an image file , executable code , embedded information , or any other media , content , or interactive advertisement .
For example , in the case of a text advertisement , advertisement features may include a title line ( e.g. , the name of a product ) , advertisement text ( e.g. , text describing the general nature of the product ) , and an embedded link ( e.g. , a URL ) that links to a landing page ( e.g. , web site ) provided by an associated advertiser .
In the case of an image ad , advertisement features may include one or more images ( e.g. , images of a product ) , executable code ( e.g. , embedded HTML code ) , and an embedded link .
While the advertisements are shown to reside with the advertiser ’s system , the advertisements also can be stored in the advertising management system , or stored with the ad content in the computer device .
And just in case you as a user might want to watch advertisements , or re-watch advertisements , this patent application has you in mind , explaining :
The user also may manually activate an advertisement presentation .
As an example , a user may select the “ Watch Ads Now ” menu item to instantly begin the advertisement presentation .
If the user selects this menu item prior to a scheduled time of the presentation , the user may receive time extensions .
The user also may select the “ Watch Previous Ad ” menu item to view previously watched advertisement ( s ) .
In some implementations , a user may browser a catalog of previously presented advertisements when the “ Recent Ads ” menu item is selected .
Who knows whether Apple has any desire to integrate such an annoying “ innovation ” into their operating systems .
I would have to say that my guess is that Apple would not do such a thing , but their past business mistakes do not exactly inspire confidence .
In fact , the fact that Apple has as much success as they do enjoy is largely in spite of themselves , and extraordinarily bad business decisions have plagued the company at times over the years .
Their success at times might even be attributable to such superior technology that even bad business decisions could n’t kill the company , or maybe best described by the saying — even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while .
Whatever your take is , do you really think they would alienate their users with such nonsense ?
I doubt it , but I suspect they think that there is some company somewhere that might just be willing to engage in such alienation in the name of advertising revenue , and if they are going to do it should n’t they have to pay homage to Apple with a royalty payment ?

A while back , a book entitled JavaScript : The Good Parts made waves on the internet , especially social networking sites .
This book purported to show the inner beauty of a language that was long considered second or third rate , coming of age .
With the advent of toolkits like JQuery , Javascript / AJAX development has become easy and even fun .
I aim to do the same by showing " Java : The Good Parts " here at a high level .
When I was younger , I used to despise Java for political reasons and bad memories of early applets and applications .
I suspect many users and developers ( especially Libre software devs ! ) are on the same boat .
By the end of this article , I hope I swayed your opinion or at least caused you to reevaluate your bias .
I also wish to encourage further discussion about these points and ways we can improve any deficiencies .
Rough and Tumble Upbringing
When Java first started gaining popularity , it was loudly hyped as the end all language .
It was expected that Java would take the " rich client " by storm , and applets would be the go to solution for enhancing web pages .
What happened was a bit different .
Java floundered and struggled to find a niche .
On the client side , AWT apps looked horrendous despite using native widgets .
Then Swing came about and despite easing development , it looked equally bad on all platforms ( by default ) .
Applets were basically a stillbirth .
The ugly gray box , loadtime sometime measuring in minutes , and no coordination with the DOM and web browser made the average user hate Java .
One area Java was able to develop and secure a foundation , however , was the back end of large web applications .
The Virtual Machine approach provided a marked advantage over the CGI and interpreted scripts of the day .
Java 's rich networking libraries , clean Object Oriented design , and safety made this the language de jour for large web applications .
Open Source Matters
In my opinion , the open sourcing of Java during its early infancy would have had little impact on most of the teething issues .
The Virtual Machine , JIT , and Garbage Collection required many years of tuning to get acceptable performance and Sun did an acceptable job keeping it under wing .
The relatively limited CPU and RAM of the mid '90s also made these concepts a bit ahead of their time .
Somewhere in the 1999 - 2002 time frame , though , Sun really dropped the ball .
An Open Source Java would have led to ubiquity on the booming Linux platform and a chance for all sorts of cross-platform software .
Open Source matters , and not just for the source code .
Open Source projects naturally bring about very pragmatic and intelligent developers .
These are the folks that thoroughly enjoy their hobby , work , and tools .
The marketing guys and pointed haired bosses have much less pull here .
On one hand , a vibrant community built itself with the many Apache Software Foundation projects .
However , most of these were squarely focused on web applications or low level things such as build tools , testing frameworks , and message buses .
Due to the void , interpreted languages such as Python rose to the challenge while C and C++ remained the mainstay for applications programming .
Microsoft started dominating Windows development with their .NET CLR languages .
The glib / Gtk + and Qt toolkits brought about a renaissance in cross- platform development with C and C++ respectively [ though not limited ] .
It was n't until the open - sourcing of SWT that GUI development in Java became attractive .
The obvious killer apps here were the Eclipse IDE and the Azureus ( now Vuze ) bittorrent client .
Sun 's closed grip of Java really stagnated any chance of abundant expansion in these middle years ( 2001 - 2006 ) .
Microsoft leveraged this weakness to create the excellent .NET platform and associated languages to maintain their closed platform and market dominance .
The counterbalance that would have been Java was thus left playing catchup .
We are just beginning to see the fruits of this labor from 2006 through today .
The OpenJDK project is now distributed with popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora .
We finally have decent browser plugins and Java Web Start applications across 32 and 64 - bit machines .
The Java deployment problem will slowly fade from memory .
Application Development
SWT made Java apps beautiful .
OpenJDK should make them ubiquitous .
We finally have an Open Source platform that is widely deployed .
The strong built in standard library and clean OO design patterns of Java make it a very pleasant host for developing rich client apps .
Obvious areas for improvement here include better layout / form design tools and closer integration with upstream Linux distributors .
Somewhere along the line , Trolltech / QT Software ( now owned by Nokia ) released Jambi -- the complete Qt bindings , GUI framework , and incredibly rich library -- for Java .
Oddly , this bombshell received little of the community and fanfare I thought it would or deserves .
Indeed , QT Software demoted Jambi from their teir - 1 platforms and hopes the community will pick it up .
I hope this project is n't allowed to stagnate as there is a lot of potential here .
Web Apps
Along the " Enterprise Web Application " lineage of Java , we wound up with some disgustingly overcomplicated and bloated frameworks for building web apps .
Ruby on Rails and Python Django came about and put a new spin on the development of rapid and robust web apps .
The learning curve of these frameworks is much less than Java EE and I will go as far as saying they are more capable because of it .
By using Java , JSP , and Servlets directly on top of a light Model - View - Controller , I believe Java is just as compelling as some of the more popular scripting languages .
Developers need to know they can trim the fat and that there are many advantages to developing in Java , namely because of the next topic ...
Dynamic Languages , its all about the VM
It 's all about the JVM stupid !
One of the best features of Java and .NET are the underlying Virtual Machines .
By using JIT compiled VMs , Java code has a distinct advantage over the common interpreted languages such as Perl , Python , and PHP .
In the case of Java , the resultant is even naturally crossplatform .
The really interesting developments here focus on extending the JVM to syntax and paradigms other than the statically typed C++ lookalike .
Clojure and Scala deliver innovative new techniques while Jython and JRuby bring these excellent languages to the Java software platform and virtual machine .
In short , Java provides everyone with a counter to Microsoft 's .
NET CLR .
The Java VM has been around the block and tuned by giants such as Sun , IBM , Oracle , SAP and more .
I call on the community to discuss how we can encourage use of the JVM for languages other than Java and build this into a defacto runtime .
Continued tuning and integration with Windows , Mac OS X , and Gnome / KDE * NIX systems is paramount .
Research for easy multi-core development is also worthwhile .
Meanwhile , distributions need to continue packaging the JRE and make it a default .
Individual developers need to be made aware of " Java : The Good Parts " and myths debunked .
Applets , Rich Media , Native Code !?
With the release of Java FX , widespread deployment of the JRE , and better browser integration , Java has set the stage for a comeback to its roots .
During the late '90s and 2000s , Adobe Flash became the tool of choice for web animation and interactive pages .
It really exploded with the advent of Youtube and other internet streaming sites making use of the Flash video format .
Unfortunately , Flash player is notoriously insecure , resource intensive , and crash - prone .
It is also not widely available for the millions of smartphones that have become more accessible than computers .
Luckily , there seems to be a shift back to the browser with new developments in AJAX , JavaScript , and HTML .
The \ < video > tag will hopefully make video as easy and portable as graphics are today in the browser .
Clean JavaScript libraries and fast JIT JS engines make it practical to use this paradigm for many domains .
Yet one must acknowledge that somewhere along the line , manipulating a DOM / markup language with a scripting language is n't the most effective development platform for everything .
Google even thinks it poignant to run x86 machine code in a sandboxed environment in your browser .
I personally fail to see the logic behind this .
Java provides a well evolved , cross- platform solution .
Java can run on your ARM powered Android .
Requiring an x86 CPU just seems like the wrong track in this modern age .
Hopefully JavaFX will pick up the slack and return Java to its roots .
I would love to see the demise of the terrible Flash plugin .
Future and Conclusion
It 's time we considered Java for The Good Parts .
I hope some of my points caused you to reevaluate any bad preconceptions or past experiences you may have had with Java .
Java has undergone great change since its birth and I think it is capable of becoming the premier development platform for applications programming of all types .
Particularly interesting are some of the new languages such as Scala and Clojure .
Java has long been a staple in web development , but has traditionally scared away amateur coders .
If you cut the fat , Servlets and JSP are not much harder to set up than common place scripting languages .
Frameworks such as Grails bring it to parity with Rails or Django .
Java underwent a sea change in 2006 with the releasing of the source code and opening of the development process .
Java and the JVM should be championed by Libre software developers and users alike !
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
There are good reasons not to get too worked up about public - opinion polling on issues like climate change and energy .
Polls confirm , over and over , that the public opinion is malleable — so much rides on the wording of questions .
And most people do n’t analyze policy in their spare time , so why ask them about cap and trade ?
Only 24 percent of Americans could even identify cap and trade as an energy / environment policy in a May Rasmussen poll .
Twenty - nine percent thought it was a Wall Street regulation .
Still , it ’s hard not to be troubled by a Pew Research Center poll released today .
Conducted three weeks ago among 1,500 adults reached on cell phones and landlines , the poll finds a significant drop in the number of Americans who believe global warming is happening , is human - caused , and is a serious problem .
The poll found that only 57 percent of respondents believe that “ the earth is getting warmer , ” compared with 71 percent in April 2008 .
Pew has asked similar sets of questions six times since June 2006 and has never found such a dramatic rise in skepticism .
Those who believe warming is caused by human activity ( burning fossil fuels ) wavered between 41 and 50 percent in the first five polls .
This fall , the figure dropped to 36 percent .
Those who consider global warming a “ very serious problem ” ranged between 41 and 47 percent in the first five polls .
This fall , the figure fell to 35 percent .
The shift was most pronounced among political independents .
In that group , those who believe there is solid evidence for climate change fell from 75 percent in the April 2008 poll to 53 percent ( that ’s 22 points ) .
Democrats who believe there is solid evidence for climate change dropped from 83 percent in the last poll to 75 percent .
Republicans slipped from 49 percent to 35 percent .
Other recent polls have n’t found the rise in skepticism that Pew documents .
An August Zogby poll found a majority of Americans wanted additional or continued action from Congress on climate change .
A July poll from WorldPublicOpinion.org found Americans lagging other countries in demanding a climate plan , yet still asking their government to do more .
For a bit of context on what scientists think , yesterday 18 leading scientific organizations sent a letter to U.S. senators reminding them of the scientific consensus that climate change is happening , that it is caused by human activities , and that its effects will be severe .
There were two small ( and puzzling ) bits of consolation in the poll : many respondents support limiting greenhouse - gas emissions , and many want the U.S. to join an international climate - change plan .
Fifty percent of respondents favor CO2 limits and “ making companies pay for their emissions , even if it may mean higher energy prices . ”
Thirty - nine percent say they oppose this , and 11 percent are unsure or did not answer .
Fifty - six percent of respondents think the United States “ should join other countries in setting standards to address global climate change . ”
Some of them appear to support solutions — even ones that raise the cost of energy — to problems they do not believe in .
There are a number of possible explanations for the rise in skepticism .
Although , honestly , the findings are still surprising .
For one , it ’s been a cold summer in much of the country .
Let ’s not forget about that years - long , systematic disinformation campaign to confuse the public about climate change .
Also , the economy .
This week a POLITICO poll asked respondents to rank issues of concern .
Predictably , the economy came out tops .
Pew ’s poll did n’t ask respondents to rank their concerns , but there is an ( accurate ) perception that politicians can only address so many problems .
Telling pollsters you ’re not so concerned with the climate is a way of telling elected leaders that ’s great , now fix the economy .
A national climate plan has become more likely than ever before .
As the policy implications of this become more immediate and concrete , people may decide it ’s more convenient not to believe in the phenomenon .
Do n’t believe in the problem and you do n’t have to feel guilty for not responding to it .
Finally , the campaign against cap and trade might have the inadvertent effect of making people reject the problem along with the solution .
“ It ’s quite possible that anti-cap - and - trade messaging has seeped into America ’s unconscious mind , affecting opinion on global warming even as the public says it ’s heard very little about the legislation being proposed , ” Chris Good writes at the Atlantic .
None of these are especially satisfying answers .
It ’s not a very satisfying poll .
If nothing else , it underscores the importance of using clean - energy arguments to promote an energy and climate plan .

" I feel like I am in exile in my own city and my own community , " says Sharryn Aiken the morning after a conference she helped organize and for which she was vilified by her Jewish community .
A Torontonian , she teaches law at Queen 's University in Kingston .
It took her and three academics at Osgoode Hall Law School 18 months to mount the three - day event , Israel / Palestine : Mapping Models of Statehood and Paths to Peace .
It was to explore , among other things , the notion of one state in which Jews and Arabs would live as equal citizens , sans their religious identities .
The idea , not new , is anathema to those who see it as spelling the end of Israel as a Jewish state .
That it was to be debated at York University made it worse , given the history of toxic relations between pro- and anti-Israeli groups on the campus , especially during the annual Israel Apartheid Week .
Charges were hurled that the conference would be anti-Semitic .
The Stephen Harper government ordered the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council ( SHHRC ) to rethink its modest $ 19,750 federal subsidy .
Pressure was put on York University to pull the plug .
But it refused .
SHHRC stood by its decision .
About 200 people from Canada , the U.S. , Israel and Europe came .
A quarter were Jewish .
The dialogue was civil , Aiken reported from the meeting , which was closed to the media .
She said that many delegates , " first and foremost , the Israelis , " were outraged at the attempts to ban the meeting .
Among them : Meron Benvenisti , deputy mayor of Jerusalem under Teddy Kollek ( 1971 - 78 ) , now a columnist for Haaretz , the liberal Israeli paper .
He opposes the one - state solution .
He also opposes the notion of not talking about it .
Of the Canadian critics of the conference , he told me : " If they want to be more patriotic than me , I have no use for them ...
I am not going to take any lessons about Israel from people living here ...
It 's hypocritical of them to use my national flag to stop dialogue . "
FROM THE START , Aiken and her co-organizers – Bruce Ryder and Susan Drummond , professors at Osgoode , and Mazen Masri , a PhD candidate at the school – knew that they might draw criticism .
So they set up a high - powered advisory panel of 11 , four of them Israelis .
Besides Benvenisti , there were professors from Hebrew and Haifa universities .
" I am not naive , " she said .
" To allay anxieties , I did an outreach and met various Jewish groups " – to no avail .
The Jewish Defense League was " very much opposed , from the get - go , " as expected .
Others objected as well : the Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy , Hasbara , B'nai Brith , United Jewish Appeal Federation of Greater Toronto , etc .
The simmering controversy burst into the open when Science Minister Gary Goodyear asked SSHRC to revisit its promised grant .
The Canadian Association of University Teachers , representing 65,000 academics , was appalled .
The unprecedented political interference is " not something we have seen in this country since the McCarthy period , " in the 1950s .
At York , president Mamdouh Shoukri issued a statement May 21 affirming academic freedom .
He also noted that the university opposes an academic boycott of Israel as " antithetical to the very purpose of a university . "
On June 5 , Marshall Cohen , chair of the board of governors , and Paul Cantor , chair - designate , joined him in another statement :

" These issues are discussed on a daily basis in all parts of the world , especially in the Middle East , including Israel .
There is no reason why they should not be discussed at a university in Canada . "
The York senate asserted the right of " universities to organize and host academic conferences free from government intervention . "
Meanwhile , Aiken was battling B'nai Brith .
It had said one of the speakers was a Holocaust denier , attributing a statement to him he never made .
" We had to get a lawyer to have that defamatory statement withdrawn , " and have B'nai Brith apologize on its website .
OVERALL , Aiken is left with " a deep sadness .
I received a lot of hate mail .
The extent of the vilification has been very painful ...
" I am not a self - hating Jew ... I am not anti-Zionist .

She understands " the dynamics of diaspora , " where the more distant people are from a homeland or a spiritual homeland , the more orthodox they tend to be .
" What is specific to the Jewish diaspora is that Israel has been instrumentalized by mainstream Jewish organizations as the primary marker of Jewish identity .
Any criticism of Israel is perceived and interpreted as anti-Semitic . "
Thus , " critical dialogue becomes deeply threatening ...
What is routinely discussed in Israel becomes a problem in Toronto .
" That 's terribly wrong .
In the long run , it will be counterproductive .

I recently covered Ruby block basics in my post , More Advanced Ruby Method Arguments – Hashes And Block Basics .
I mentioned that blocks are not really method arguments and also covered the two different types of block syntax .
Towards the end of that post I promised to examine Ruby blocks more deeply and I am going to try and do that here .
In my opinion there are several interesting things about blocks :
is there any other difference between the two different types of block syntax besides the fact that one is predominantly used for single line blocks and the other for multi-line ?
besides the fact that one is predominantly used for single line blocks and the other for multi-line ?
in what context are blocks normally used and how does it look from the perspective of the methods that take blocks as ‘ parameters ’ ?
and how does it look from the perspective of the methods that take blocks as ‘ parameters ’ ?
is passing parameters to blocks similar to passing parameters to a method ( i.e. is the syntax just as rich , can you have default values etc. ) and what scope do those parameters have ?
( i.e. is the syntax just as rich , can you have default values etc. ) and what scope do those parameters have ?
can a block be a first class parameter and can you pass it around easily as opposed to just using it as a quasi - parameter like we normally do ?
Examining each one of those in turn can give one a reasonably solid understanding of blocks , so that ’s what we ’re gonna do .
The Two Different Block Notations
As we know there are two different types of block syntax , the curly brace syntax e.g. :
ruby [ 1,2,3,4,5] .each { |i| print " #{i} " }
and the do .. end syntax e.g.:
ruby [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . each do |i| print " # {i} " end
Aside from looking different and being used for single or multi-line blocks , there is one major difference between the two types of syntax – precedence .
As we know all expressions in Ruby return a value , this is no different when we execute an iterator .
So if we want to use a value that is returned by an iterator that takes a block ( e.g. print it out ) we can normally do so .
When we use curly brace notation this is not a problem e.g. :
ruby print [ 1,2,3,4,5] .each { |i| i}
this will print out :
12345
as we would expect .
But if we try to do the same with the do .. end syntax e.g. :
ruby print [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . each do |i| i end
we get the following error :
`each ' : no block given ( LocalJumpError )
this is due to the fact that the method call to print has higher precedence over the do .. end block syntax so that what we actually have happening is the following :
ruby print ( [ 1,2,3,4,5].each ) do |i| i end
to get this to work correctly we need to wrap the whole thing in braces e.g. :
ruby print ( [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] . each do |i| i end )
It is not a major difference but something to be aware of .
Learn About Blocks By Implementing Our Own Iterator
The best way I have found to learn how blocks and iterators work together is to implement some of your own starting with a really simple case .
Lets implement an infinite loop iterator of our own :
ruby def infinite_loop while true yield end end
We can call it in the following way , notice that we pass a simple block :
ruby infinite_loop {puts ' Looping Infinitely '}
this will print out ‘ Looping Infinitely ’ forever since the loop inside out iterator method has no exit condition and just keeps yielding to the block .
So far so easy , so lets move on to something more complex .
Let ’s say we need to add another iterator to the array class that can work with the array elements in reverse ( I am aware that Array has a method to reverse itself ) .
We could do this by opening up the Array class and putting our new iterator in :
ruby class Array def reverse_iterate current_index = self . size - 1 while current_index >= 0 yield self [ current_index ] current_index -= 1 end end end
We now have an exit condition for the loop in our iterator which means we wo n’t yield to the block more times than there are values in the array .
We can then call our new iterator method in the following fashion :
ruby [ 2,4,6,8].reverse_iterate { |i| print " #{i} " }
This is all pretty simple , a couple of things to note , the call to yield inside out new method , this is what causes the method to accept a block in the first place .
The second thing is the parameter we pass to the yield method .
By passing one parameter to yield we cause the block that the iterator takes to also take one parameter .
If we passed two values to yield then our block would need to take two parameters as well .
So , the above prints out the array because we yield each of the array values to the block ( in reverse order ) and just output it :
8 6 4 2
But what if we want our new method to not only take a block but also have some sort of default behavior when no block is provided ?
This is fairly simple to do , we just need to use the Kernel.
block_given ?
method :
ruby class Array def reverse_iterate if block_given ?
current_index = self .size - 1 while current_index >= 0 yield self [ current_index ] current_index -= 1 end else print self .
reverse end end end
we can now call our iterator with no block at all :
ruby [ 2,4,6,8].reverse_iterate
Our default behavior just prints out all the array values in reverse , concatenated together :
8642
The last thing to note is the fact that yield can actually return a value from the block back to the iterator .
The value yield returns is the result of the last expression executed in the block .
We can take advantage of this to , for example , collect the values that the block returns on every iteration and return a new array with all the new values as the result of the iterator method call , e.g. :
ruby class Array def reverse_iterate if block_given ? new_array= [ ] current_index = self .size - 1 while current_index >= 0 new_array << yield ( self [ current_index ] ) current_index -= 1 end else print self .
reverse end new_array end end
If we then call out iterator method with a block that squares all the values it receives :
ruby puts [ 2,4,6,8].reverse_iterate { |i| i*i}
the result returned from the method call will be an array with the values of our original array but reversed and squared .
We can print this out :
64 36 16 4
This can be pretty handy and is incidentally similar to how the more complex Ruby iterator methods ( such as map ) work .
Block Parameters
Using block parameters is very similar to using method parameters , the rules are pretty much identical .
If you ’re using Ruby 1.9 you ’ve got all the features like default arguments and optional arguments which you can mix and match pretty much any way you like .
If you ’re on Ruby 1.8 , you can still have optional and default arguments but you ’re a little more limited in how you can mix and match them .
So to give an example , you could create an iterator that yields 4 parameters to the block in the following way :
ruby class Array def reverse_iterate current_index = self . size - 1 while current_index >= 0 yield self [ current_index ] , ' Value ' , current_index , ' Index ' current_index -= 1 end end end
You can then call this iterator with a block but rather than using 4 parameters , you can use two with the second being a catch - all ( remember the * notation ) :
ruby [ 2,4,6,8] .reverse_iterate do |value , * others| puts " #{others [ 0 ] } = #{value} , # {others [ 2 ] } = # {others [ 1 ] } "
end
You use the values from the catch - all parameter just like you would an array , so our iterator call would output :
Value = 8 , Index = 3 Value = 6 , Index = 2 Value = 4 , Index = 1 Value = 2 , Index = 0
Fairly straight forward .
What is more interesting is the scope that variables have once we are inside the block .
In the simplest case we may call an iterator with a block from another method , which may already have some variables defined :
ruby def some_crazy_method random_variable=5 [ 1,2,3 ] . each do |i| puts " Array value=#{i} , Random variable=#{random_variable} " end end
It is curious that in this case we actually have access to these variables from within the block .
Calling the above method prints out the following :
Array value=1 , Random variable=5 Array value=2 , Random variable=5 Array value=3 , Random variable=5
As you can see we are able to print out _randomvariable from within the block and it is set to the same value as it was outside the block .
But , what happens when we have a variable outside the block and use a variable with the same name as a block parameter e.g. :
```ruby def some_crazy_method i=5 puts “ Before block i=#{i} ”
[ 1,2,3 ] . each do |i| puts “ In block i= #{i} ” end
puts “ After block i= #{i} ” end```
The behavior here depends on whether you ’re using Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 .
With Ruby 1.8 it is still the same variable as the one defined outside the scope of the block , so if we assign a new value to that variable within the block this value will be available outside of the block .
So calling the above method in Ruby 1.8 would produce :
Before block i=5
In block i=1 In block i=2 In block i=3 After block i=3
Notice that i now retains the last value it had within the block .
In Ruby 1.9 however , the variable within the block is not the same as the one outside of the block so the output in 1.9 would be :
Before block i=5
In block i=1 In block i=2 In block i=3 After block i=5
As you can see the variable retains it ’s old value after the block completes .
Ruby 1.9 also provides another feature to do with variable scope .
If you want to pass a variable to the block that is not automatically assigned to , but you do n’t want to accidentally pass in a variable which has already been initialized ( prior to the block and is therefore in scope within the block ) you can do the following :
```ruby def some_crazy_method some_variable=5
puts “ Before block some_variable=#{some_variable} ”
[ 1,2,3 ] . each do |i;some_variable| puts “ In block i= #{i} ” some_variable = i end
puts “ After block some_variable=#{some_variable} ” end```
By passing a variable to the block after the semicolon , we essentially say that we want to have a variable with that name local to the block and unrelated to a variable with the same name outside the block e.g. :
Before block some_variable=5
In block i=1 In block i=2 In block i=3 After block some_variable=5
This seems to be of limited utility and is not available in Ruby 1.8 ( it will produce a compilation error ) .
Block As Closures
That ’s right , you can use a block as a closure and pass it around and call it whenever you like .
It is a reasonably advanced feature , but essentially you can do the following :
```ruby def method_with_block_as_closure( &block ) another_method block end
def another_method ( variable ) x=25 variable .call x end
method_with_block_as_closure { |i| print “ I am happy block # {i} ” }```
By prepending the method parameter with the & symbol you tell the method to treat the block it gets as a closure and assign it to that parameter .
We can then pass this parameter around to other methods just like we would any other .
When we actually want to call the block we simply need to use the call method on the variable that currently contains the block , passing in any parameters that the block expects .
In our case the result of the above code would be to execute the print method that was called inside the block e.g. :
I am happy block 25
This is a very basic , surface view of how to use blocks as first class parameters ( closures ) .
At this stage , this is really all we need to know , but I do plan to dig more deeply into how and why this works in a later post ( i.e. Procs etc . ) .
If you ’re interested in that , then make sure you grab my feed so you do n’t miss it .
That ’s all I wanted to cover regarding blocks , hope you found it interesting .

Stressed mice grew larger tumours Social isolation may make cancer more deadly , US research on mice suggests .
Researchers found the social environment can modify the biology of the disease - and lead to significant differences in outcome .
Female mice stressed because they were separated from their mothers developed more and larger mammary gland tumours than more contented animals .
The University of Chicago study appears in the journal Cancer Prevention Research .
It is now widely recognised that stress plays a part in illness , but no - one really knows how much
Oliver Childs
Cancer Research UK
Previous research has suggested that social support can improve health outcomes for patients with breast cancer , while social isolation has been linked to an increased risk of death from several chronic diseases .
The Chicago team worked with mice genetically predisposed to mammary gland cancer .
They found changes in the activity of genes that play a role in tumour growth in the stressed animals , suggesting that they may have been directly influenced by surging levels of stress hormones .
The researchers said more work was needed to pin down exactly which cell types are affected .
New treatments
But researcher Dr Suzanne Conzen said the study raised hopes of new ways to block cancer growth .
She said : " Given the increased knowledge of the human genome we can begin to objectively identify and dissect the specific alterations that take place in cancer - prone tissues of individuals in at - risk environments and that will help us to better understand and implement cancer prevention strategies . "
Dr Caryn Lerman , editor of the journal , said : " This study uses an elegant preclinical model and shows that social isolation alters expression of genes important in mammary gland tumour growth . "
Professor Thea Tlsty , of University of California San Francisco , said it had long been known that psychological factors could influence disease , but not how .
She said the study added to growing evidence that chemicals circulating in the blood - such as stress hormones - could influence the development of cancer by turning genes on and off within cells with the potential to turn malignant .
Previous work has also suggested that depression can have a negative effect on cancer prognosis .
Oliver Childs , of the charity Cancer Research UK , warned against drawing any firm conclusions .
He said : " These experiments were carried out in mice , so certainly do not prove that the stress caused by social isolation causes cancer to get worse in humans .
" It is now widely recognised that stress plays a part in illness , but no - one really knows how much and there is no good evidence from controlled studies that stress contributes to cancer progression . "

One of the major parts of improving educational training is studying the students .
Discovering how the training for Law School admission exams boosted connections and sharpened and the reasoning skills that led to eye tracking in these exams .
Now , they have taken a big step so that they can understand how these tests make the students smarter .
computations
There are computations which the human brain undertakes when moving the eyes .
Shifting gaze as well as fixed movements convey more information about the computations which our brain is making during challenging tasks and it has defeated neuroimaging Technology .
with this eye tracking Technology , we will be able to watch all the progress in action said the author Sylvia bunge .
When the eyes are darting around , the person is trying to scan for relevant information and when your eye is fixed on a particular image or a piece of text , the person is encoding information .
One of the major future applications of eye tracking will include computers , phone , tablets and other devices which are digital in order to record the ocular movements of students when they are learning .
The movements of your eyes are closer to the speed of thoughts than any other behavioral indicators and by comparing it with neuroimaging technology , we conclude that this cannot capture the speedy brain computations in real time .
If we use the eyes of the students in order to monitor their activities then we can easily understand the mastery of materials as well as , detect when they are having difficulty learning .
When they conducted the studies , they saw that in only 7 seconds while solving a puzzle which had logical reasoning , there were 26 movements .
They were able to identify the activities which indicated the data which students observed as well as the data which students disregarded and they were able to arrive at their conclusions after the studies .
This study was built on previous findings in which the researchers tracked cognitive changes in students during mentally challenging tasks .
The circuitry and brains frontal network was boosted when students took 3 months LSAT course with some of best lsat prep books , suggested that they had less difficulty solving the reasoning problems then they had at the beginning of the course .
But , when we think about it , knowing about a particular brain region being activated is not enough to make sure that the task is easier .
therefore , we had developed a way to assess the brain mechanism using eye gaze patterns .
When we conducted our latest studies , we started comparing training for logic games section which requires a lot of reasoning skills with students practicing exams reading comprehension section .
after 33 hours of practice , there were stronger reasoning skills which logic games group showed .
By making the use of the eye tracking motion exercises , we developed a good amount of measures and indicators for knowing when the students were shouting their attention or when the students were engaged in working for the reasoning and which skills improve with practice and which part of the brain activated when there were particular patterns used .
We were able to discover that the biggest change when reasoning practice was reduced time spent and coding and integrating the relevant pieces of information which were only required to solve the problem .
This boost in performance was also effective for reasoning tests which did not resemble the exam problems .
These kinds of research results should be able to help the students in psychology as well as the neuroscientists who want to study mechanism related to learning as well as cognitive abilities and the educational researchers trying to learn about students in real - world contexts .
Conclusion :
These are some of the best studies conducted by the neuroscientists in order to study the human brain so that they can improve the performance drastically .
We hope that this article helped you find a relation between students and their eye movements .
Have a great day .…
The Pakistani army was preparing for a major anti-Taliban operation Pakistani security forces have freed about 40 hostages who were being held by militants at an army base in Rawalpindi , near the capital Islamabad .
Military officials said three hostages and two soldiers died in the operation along with at least four militants , one of whom was wearing an explosives belt .
One insurgent , named by police as Aqeel , was taken alive but wounded .
He was identified as the group 's leader .
The insurgents had attacked Pakistan 's military HQ on Saturday .
Six soldiers and four militants were killed in the initial assault .
" The operation is over .
It was highly successful , " military spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas told Pakistani television .
ANALYSIS Aleem Maqbool , BBC News , Islamabad
This has been an audacious attack by militants with a level of coordination and sophistication .
While Pakistan is claiming the rescue operation was a success , it 's a huge embarrassment that one of the most secure areas in Pakistan - where top military officials are based - has been attacked .
Many people here are nervous that the body supposed to protect them has been attacked at its very heart .
" The situation is now totally under control .
The entire area has been cleared .
There are no terrorists inside , " he said .
But the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Islamabad says it is a huge embarrassment for the military that one of the country 's most sensitive areas has been attacked .
Meanwhile US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , speaking in London , said the attack showed the increasing militant threat against the authority of the state .
Interior Minister Rehman Malik said an operation against militants in South Waziristan was now inevitable .
" Now the government has no other option but to launch an offensive , " he said .
" What happened in Peshawar , Islamabad and today , all roads lead to South Waziristan . "
' Very skilled '
The sound of blasts and gunfire rang out as Pakistani special forces entered the compound for the pre-dawn raid .
RECENT MILITANT ATTACKS 24 Sept -
Seven pro-government tribal elders killed by militants in town of Janikhel , north - western Pakistan 26 Sept -
At least 16 people killed in two suicide car bombs , in Peshawar and Bannu 5 Oct - Suicide bomber attacks UN offices in Islamabad killing five 9
Oct -
At least 50 killed in suspected suicide bombing in Peshawar
Pakistan 's ' new zone of militancy '
In pictures : Pakistan shoot - out Gen Abbas said the forces had met resistance in what he described as a " very skilled " operation .
They found the hostages being held in a room " with a terrorist who was wearing a suicide jacket " , he said .
Gen Abbas said the commandos had " acted promptly " and shot the suspected hostage taker " before he could pull the trigger " .
" Three of the hostages were killed due to militant firing , " Reuters quoted him as saying .
The military said later that the surviving militant , named as Aqeel or Dr Usman , was the leader of the group and was also suspected of masterminding an attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in March .
Senior military officials and civilian personnel were reported to be among the hostages .
The attack came as the army was preparing for a major operation against the Taliban , and officials said the militant group had claimed responsibility .
The Taliban had been threatening to carry out attacks unless operations against it were stopped .
High profile Witnesses said that the gunmen had driven up to the army compound in a white van just before midday local time ( 0600 GMT ) on Saturday .
They took up positions , fired on the compound and threw hand grenades , security officials said .
The military reported that the attack had been repelled after a gun battle lasting around 45 minutes but later admitted hostages had been taken .
The attack followed a series of bombings in north - western Pakistan .
On Friday at least 50 died in a blast in Peshawar .
In recent days Taliban positions in the tribal areas have been bombed by the air force , amid speculation that the army 's offensive there is soon to be intensified , says our correspondent .
There was a period of relative quiet in August after Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud was killed , but the rate of militant attacks has increased since then , he adds .
Islamist militants have carried out a number of attacks against high - profile , high - security targets in recent years .
In March this year gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team in the city of Lahore .
Six policemen and a driver were killed and several of the team were injured .
In the same month , dozens of people were killed when a police training centre on the outskirts of the city was occupied by gunmen .

MANILA - The Commission on Higher Education ( CHED ) is shutting down seven law schools which failed to produce even a single Bar passer among its graduates in the last 10 years .
These are the law schools of East Central Colleges , Eastern Samar State University , Polytechnic College of La Union , Samar College , Ramon Magsaysay Technological University , Southern Bicol College , and Abra Valley College .
The zero Bar passing rate of these schools was discovered after CHED evaluated the examination performance of law graduates from private higher education institutions ( HEIs ) and state universities and colleges ( SUCs ) from 1999 to 2009 .
“ We will be forced to close down the law schools which fail to comply with CHED standards , ” CHED chairman Emmanuel Angeles said .
“ We have to act now in order to put our education system in order and improve the competencies of our graduates and professionals so that we can compete in the global arena , starting with how we produce our law graduates , ” he added .
CHED initially short - listed 11 law schools but four HEIs in the list voluntarily phased out their law programs .
These are Virgen De Los Remedios College , International Harvardian University , Manuel A. Roxas Educational Institution , and Zamboanga A.E. Colleges .
Angeles said that CHED would also evaluate the performance of HEI and SUC graduates in other licensure examinations .
On the upside of the assessment , CHED said that for the past 10 years , the law program of Ateneo de Manila University has the highest Bar passing rate in the country at an “ impressive ” 91.24 percent .
This is followed by San Beda College with 88.4 percent , and the University of the Philippines with 82.85 percent .
Fourth in the ranking is Far Eastern University - De La Salle University ( Juris Doctor MBA ) with a bar passing rate of 77.42 percent , followed by Ateneo de Davao University , 75.92 percent ; University of San Carlos , 68.2 percent ; University of Santo Tomas , 67.64 percent ; University of Cebu , 52.81 percent ; University of Perpetual Help - Rizal , 50.81 percent ; and Arellano University , 49.3 percent .
Angeles said the top performing schools should serve as models for producing successful first - time takers of the Bar .
