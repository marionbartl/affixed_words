T- Shirt Hell going out of business ?
Really ?
Because of some hate mail ?
Are you fucking kidding me ?
To all the haters who were glad to see us go and really thought I was closing down because of a few angry e-mails ; good one , suckers .
To all the people who called me a pussy and who really believed I would cave in to the retarded masses , like a little baby , you can EAT MY SMELLY VAGINA .
Do you really think I would hang it all up because of hate mail ?
Give me a break ... the site is called T - Shirt Hell .
I guess I should have named it ' T - Shirt Cunt Rape Faggot Nigger ' , so less of you fuckers would have taken the bait .
Why in the world would I shut down a website that brings so much satisfaction to people who actually have a sense of humor ?
To customers who can't stand this ever - expanding , politically correct asylum we are imprisoned in ?
To women and children and men and farm animals who not only love what we do , but who cherish the fact that we CAN do it ?
Yes , we can .
Fuck you if you can't take a joke .
I want you to get up right now , sit up , go to your windows , open them and stick your head out and yell - " FUCK YOU IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A JOKE ! "
Things have got to change .
But first , you 've gotta get mad !
You 've got to say , " I 'm as mad as hell , and I 'm not going to put up with these overly sensitive morons who can't take a joke anymore " .
Then we 'll figure out what to do about the depression and the assholes who look at you funny .
But first get up out of your chairs , stand up in your cubicles , put down your bongs , zip up your pants and yell , '" FUCK YOU IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A JOKE ! " T - Shirt
Hell is not going out of business .
In fact , we would n't leave even if we had to resort to selling dead babies for food when this economy truly hits the fan .
Consider Feb , 2009 a fresh start for us .
We 're going to be bigger , better and more fucked up than before .
Worse Than Hell is back .
The black lady who writes the most intellectually ( anally ) stimulating newsletter on the net is back .
We 're fucking back .
But oh ... wait ... we never actually left .
And just so I make this clear .
I have n't decided to keep T - Shirt Hell going because of the tens of thousands of supportive emails we received or because of the press and sales we generated over the last 3 weeks ( nearly 100,000 shirts sold ) .
We were never ... ever ... leaving in the first place .
Let 's just call it tough love .
Sometimes you need to kick your loved ones in the assholes to get them to satisfy their need for awesome t- shirts ( and to fill my bank account ) .
I know a lot of our fans are stingy motherfuckers and need to be " inspired " to get off their fat asses to spend money in ways that truly enhance lives and bring joy to the world .
Well , that 's what I did .
Let 's call it my own personal stimulus package ( besides my normal , daily " personal stimulus " if you know what I 'm sayin ) .
In 3 weeks , I 've done EXACTLY what is needed to stimulate any economy .. and that is to get people to open their wallets .
Not only did the last 3 weeks save jobs at T - Shirt Hell , they 've opened up a whole new world to the people who had never bought our shirts until now .
Did you know that 9 out of 10 people who wear T - Shirt Hell shirts actually increase their job security , with 6 of those people getting substantial raises ?
Did you realize that owning one or more T - Shirt Hell products actually raises the value of your 401k by a minimum of 25 % ?
Were you aware that buying 3 or more T - Shirt Hell shirts at once will actually secure for you the most important seat in the White House ?
( Member id : barackoutwmcockout44 , Name : Barack Obama , Address : Chicago , IL , 3 shirts purchased , November 1st , 2008 ) Thanks B , we " hope " you 're enjoying your " I 'd Rather Be Snorting Cocaine Off A Hooker 's Ass " tee , your " I Shaved My Balls For This ? " hoodie , and quite fittingly , your " Sorry About What Happens Later " ringer .
Oh , the irony .
What I 'm trying to say is this ... our shirts are the key to fixing this economy and to getting people back on track .
You do n't need to thank me because I can feel the gratitude emanating from around the world at this very moment .
It 's a warm , fuzzy feeling .
You 're welcome .
Now that you know we 're not going anywhere , I 'd like to take a moment to address something .
My feelings on what we do and why we do it are best summarized in this excellent piece by Jacob , one of the writers here at TSH .
But the main point I wanted to reiterate is that there is no hatred / intention behind what we do .
None . Zero. Zilch .
We make stupid jokes for the sake of comedy , nothing more .
We enjoy it , our customers enjoy it and my mom enjoys it .
No one else matters .
There will always be extremists who think we 're doing something to tarnish the world and who will fight passionately against us because they misinterpret our actions .
I just do n't care anymore ... and am willing to risk my life ( and you can even try to win $ 50,000 by guessing when and how I get murdered ) for the cause .
What 's the cause again , exactly ?
Oh , I do n't fucking know .... to be allowed to make retarded jokes without people taking them so seriously ?
To have the right to take something that has been a source of pain for so many and to turn it upside down and into a preposterous joke on a t - shirt ?
Something like that .
Since , I 'm taking a moment to be genuine ( yup , I actually just wrote that out ) , I want to thank all the people who sent us positive emails over the last 3 weeks .
It would take months to answer them all , so , right now I 'll just send out a collective " YOU KICK FUCKING ASS AND I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU ALL " and say thank you for your support and your loyalty .
I would NEVER take something away from you that you seem to enjoy so much .
Times are tough enough right now and the least we can do is try to make you laugh and help you get through it ... seriously .
Since I have you here and you 've made it this far , allow me to touch on a few other items : 1 . I 'd like to thank all the feminist bloggers whose articles about how misogynistic we are helped generate tons of sales from their readers who actually enjoy what we do .
2 . My legal name is Sunshine Megatron , not Aaron Schwarz ... and I 'm not Jewish ( not saying I would n't like to be , I 'm just not ) .
Schwarz is not even my father 's last name , it 's my mom 's husband before my father ... and it 's German .
For all those who would like to know my actual background , in order to make jokes at my expense , I will say that I am 4 out of 6 of these possibilities ; Black , Irish , Polish , Italian , Yugoslavian , Gay Robot .
Have at it .
3 . For those who think I 've done something like this before , you 're wrong .
When I originally took down Worse Then Hell back in 2005 , it was because someone tried to kill me in response to some of our shirts and we took the section down to protect employees .
It legitimately happened and was not a publicity stunt .
My current employees are not worried about this kind of thing ( thank the economy ? ) , so this is why we 're bringing it back .
4 . To the entrepreneurs who thought we were actually going out of business and that they would be able to fill the void by starting their own offensive t- shirt companies and to all the existing companies who got their panties wet because it suddenly was going to be their chance to shine .
Hahahaha !
Sorry , guys .
Feel free to bring it on , but remember .. the cream always rises to the top ... of my dick .
5 . The 10 % off sale is still on for one more week .
Welcome back to everyone and I hope you enjoy the final 9 shirts I 'm bringing back from the vault and a new blog entry from Jesus himself .
We 've gotten so many email comments over the last 3 weeks that we will never be able to get to them , so if you want to say something , just do it in the comments right below this message .
Hold on to your seats , the ride to hell is bumpy .

For Ingelisa Keeling , a Houston mother of three children with multiple allergies , mealtime was a struggle .
Nuts , eggs , wheat , beef , peas and rice were all off limits  banned by the children ’s allergist .
But recently , Mrs. Keeling learned that her family ’s diet need not be so restrictive .
Although her children do have real allergies  to peanuts , milk and eggs , among other foods  extensive testing at a major allergy center showed that they were not in fact allergic to many of the foods they had been avoiding .
Her 2 - year - old son , who had been living on a diet primarily of potatoes , fruit and hypoallergenic formula , has resumed eating wheat , bananas , beef , peas , rice and corn .
“ His diet had become so , so restricted that nutrition had become a real concern , ” said Mrs. Keeling , who traveled to specialists at National Jewish Health in Denver last summer for answers about her children ’s diet and eczema problems .
Among other findings , she learned that neither of her younger children was really allergic to wheat .
“ That ’s the big one , ” she said .
“ Wheat is in everything , so it makes life a whole lot easier . ”
Doctors say that misdiagnosed food allergies appear to be on the rise , and countless families are needlessly avoiding certain foods and spending hundreds of dollars on costly nonallergenic supplements .
In extreme cases , misdiagnosed allergies have put children at risk for malnutrition .
Just about every Advertising company , Marketer , SEO rep and blogger is trying to unlock the secrets of Digg and to my delight , failing .
Well , the cats out of the bag because the big “ secret ” of Digg is to spend a shit load of time on Digg ( a devious scheme devised by the Digg developers no doubt ) .
“ Digg ” like there is no tomorrow , “ Friend ” like it ’s your last day on earth and “ Comment ” like your mentally unstable wife just caught you in bed with another woman .
And let me stop you right there before you jump on Digg and add the first 10,000 people you see because I guarantee the only people who ’ll become your “ mutual friend ” will be dickhead spammers such as yourself .
Just like with anything , it ’s not “ What you know , but who you know . ”
Your network of “ friends ” will be your base .
Take care of them ( Digg , comment and sometimes shout ) and they will take care of you .
But how do you know how good of a friend they ’ll be before you add them ?
Well here are some unwritten rules of adding friends on Digg that will come in handy :
1 ) Do not add any friends with a foreign name –
This goes double for Asians and triple for anyone from the Philippines ( country code PH ) .
They will almost with 100 % certainty be spammers for a site that A ) is n’t even in English and B ) sells ringtones .
My “ Fans ” page is filled with people whose names I cannot pronounce .
Forgive me if I come off as racist when I say STAY AWAY FROM ME YOU FILTHY SPAMMING FOREIGNERS .
2 ) Do not add any friends that are women – Well , more specifically women who have hot sounding names like Ashley , Melissa or Brittany and have a picture of “ themselves ” as their Icon .
That is not them .
In fact , it ’s probably a dude from the Philippines whose figured out that he has to trick people into friending them ( see point # 1 ) .
The picture is likely from Myspace , Maxim magazine or a porn that the real “ Tiffany ” has probably masturbated to .
Stay away from any profile that has a picture of something that remotely gives you a chub .
3 ) Diggs vs. Submissions Ratio –
When looking at a potential friend ’s history check out the number of Diggs and compare them to the number of submissions .
The ideal digger will have a high amount of Diggs with a low amount of submissions .
And even if someone has a huge amount of Diggs , I still consider people who have over 10 submissions a day to be like a high maintenance girlfriend : fun for a while but they ’ll eventually wear you down and dump you for someone else who can give them more free shit ( in this case , a massive amounts of Diggs ) .
4 ) Do n’t target users without pictures –
If they are too lazy to take 40 seconds to add an interesting picture , then they ’re more often than not too lazy to be a reliable friend .
5 ) Quality over Quantity -
If you ’re going to be looking at your friends ’ submissions most of the time , you might as well make sure they ’re interesting .
Check out what kind of stories they submit and if they ’re all from Rush Limbaugh ’s website and low quality tech blogs , you should probably take a pass on friendship while simultaneously burying all their Neo - Con propaganda behind their backs .
LOS GLACIARES NATIONAL PARK , Argentina ( Reuters ) - Climate change appears to be helping Argentina ’s mighty Perito Moreno glacier , which is thriving in defiance of the global warming that is shrinking its peers .
An overview of the Perito Moreno Glacier at the Lago Argentino , in the Parque Nacional Los Glaciares ( Los Glaciares National Park ) , 80 km ( 50 miles ) west of El Calafate city , in the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz in this March 25 , 2007 file photo .

While most of the world ’s glaciers are melting away because of warmer temperatures , scientists say the Perito Moreno ice field , known as “ The White Giant ” , is gaining as much as 3 meters ( 10 feet ) a day in some parts , pushed forward by heavy snowfalls in the Patagonia region .
“ Glaciers do n’t respond solely to temperature changes , ” said Martin Stuefer , a Patagonian expert from the University of Alaska Fairbanks .
He said the area ’s heavy precipitation has apparently increased along with the world ’s recent climatic shifts , combining with strong , cold Patagonian winds to reinforce the glacier .
“ Climate change is not the same everywhere , ” Stuefer said by telephone from Alaska .
The creaking Perito Moreno is one of the largest glaciers in South America and by far the most famous because it is so accessible to tourists despite its location about 3,000 km ( 1,900 miles ) southwest of Buenos Aires .
Visitors crowd onto boats and viewing platforms to see the 30 km-long ( 18 mile - long ) glacier noisily hurl huge blocks of blue - tinged ice into Lake Argentino .
Scientists say nearly 90 percent of the glaciers in Antarctica and Patagonia -- at the southern tip of South America -- are melting quickly .
The same is happening in the Arctic , the Andes , the Alps , the Himalayas and elsewhere in response to climate change linked to human activity .
The average melting rate of the world ’s mountain glaciers has doubled since the year 2000 , the U.N. Environment Programme and the World Glacier Monitoring Service said in a recent report .
Melting glaciers threaten to cause rising sea levels and dry up steady sources of fresh water that people now depend on for farming , drinking and even hydropower .
But glaciers are also affected by other factors such as snowfalls , winds , altitude and shade , and the Perito Moreno is among the few resisting the broad trend .
“ A small percentage seems to be doing strange things , ” David Vaughan , a British Antarctic Survey glaciologist and member of the United Nations climate panel , said by telephone from a field mission in Antarctica .
“ The odd 13 percent are either stable or advancing a little . ”
There are limits to the Perito Moreno ’s aggressive advance , however .
It periodically reaches as far forward as it can toward the Magallanes Peninsula and then sheds a large section of its front in a spectacular phenomena known as “ la ruptura , ” or the rupture .
More than 190 governments have agreed to work out by the end of 2009 a new U.N. treaty to rein in fossil fuel emissions and slow global warming , fearing that rising seas could swamp low - lying islands or flood coastal cities from Amsterdam to Sydney .

The Government Accountability Office has just released its second report [ PDF ] on the Treasury Department ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , and the troubling key takeaway is this : Treasury ’s “ strategic vision for TARP remains unclear . ”
Uh-oh .
At present , TARP is the primary mechanism for ensuring the nation ’s economy does n’t entirely collapse .
In other words , having more than an ad hoc plan for spending billions of taxpayer money needed to happen , like , yesterday .
With trademark understatedness , the GAO explains the problem :
[ E]arly on Treasury outlined a strategy and approach to purchase whole loans and mortgage - backed securities from financial institutions , but changed direction to making capital investments in qualifying financial institutions as the global community opted to move in this direction .
Moreover , once Treasury determined that capital infusions were preferable to purchasing whole mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , Treasury did not clearly articulate how the various programs ( such CPP , SSFI , and TIP ) would work collectively to help stabilize financial markets .
There ’s more :
Other actions have raised additional questions about Treasury ’s strategy .
First , the funding of the first institution to receive funding under TIP [ Targeted Investment Program ] was announced weeks before the program was established .
Similarly , the Asset Guarantee Program was established after Treasury announced that it would guarantee assets under such a program , and many of the details of the program have yet to be worked out .
Second , Treasury ’s efforts to mitigate residential foreclosures , which have contributed to increased volatility in financial markets , remain in the design phase with no clearly articulated strategy .
Finally , while Treasury has continued to publicly report on individual issues , testify , and make speeches about the program , it continues to struggle to convey a clearly articulated and overarching message about its efforts , potentially hampering TARP ’s effectiveness and underscoring ongoing questions about its communication strategy .
Without a clearly articulated strategic vision , Treasury ’s effectiveness in helping to stabilize markets may be hampered .
The GAO notes that Treasury has made some progress on the transparency front since it released its last report in early December , finding that the program was desperately in need of oversight .
But the inescapable ( and scary ) conclusion here is that the agency is still flying by the seat of its pants .
It literally can’t explain what its TARP strategy even is , let alone how it ’s going to help get us out of this mess .
At least the GAO is looking over Treasury ’s shoulder .
And its auditors could soon be granted enhanced oversight authority .
Earlier this week , Senators Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley , the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee , respectively , introduced a bill that would give the GAO access to the records of bailout recipients when it conducts regular reviews of the TARP program .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
It was billed as a " coming out party " for one of the GOP 's most promising young stars .
Gov. Bobby Jindal seemed " over - coached and over - rehearsed , " CNN 's Candy Crowley said .
But after nearly universal criticism was heaped on Gov. Bobby Jindal 's high - profile response to President Obama 's address to Congress Tuesday night , the Louisiana Republican may be wishing he had stayed home .
The criticisms came from all sides of the political spectrum , including from those in conservative circles who have promoted the 36 - year - old governor as the GOP 's most likely advocate to bring the party back from the brink of irrelevance .
Republicans who have followed Jindal 's upstart career from standout congressman to popular Louisiana governor know him to be an articulate and confident spokesman for the party 's fundamental principles of limited government and fiscal responsibility .
Watch " Is Jindal prime - time ready ? " »
But that 's not the man many saw delivering the GOP 's formal prime - time rebuttal to President Obama 's first address to a joint session of Congress .
" The Bobby Jindal you see on the Sunday shows was not the Bobby Jindal who showed up to give this speech , " said CNN Senior Political Correspondent Candy Crowley .
" He seemed over - coached and over - rehearsed . "
Watch Jindal deliver the GOP response »
Many conservatives say Jindal appeared at best off - balance and at worst downright amateur in his national debut .
" Some conservative needs to start a campaign to fire whoever wrote this cheesy response and coached him to talk like this , " wrote conservative columnist Amanda Carpenter on the popular social networking Web site Twitter .
" I can't watch . "
" He should never be allowed near a teleprompter again ! " declared the National Review 's Kathryn Jean Lopez on Wednesday , while noting the governor had a much stronger performance on NBC's " The Today Show " the morning after his speech .
Of course , to follow the oratorically skilled Obama in any setting is no enviable task , especially when the president had the benefit of incessant applause lines and the pomp- and - circumstance associated with a presidential address to Congress .
The contrast between the settings could n't be more stark , a challenge that even the most skilled politician would have difficulty confronting .
While the president had the benefit of the ornate halls of Congress as his setting and numerous camera angles to give a sweeping view of the grand House Gallery , Jindal had to deliver his speech in a solitary room amid an almost deafening silence .
" So much about it is perception , " said Eliot Shapiro , partner with EMS Communications , a firm that specializes in public speaking .
" The response is one person , face - to - face with a camera , and you can never generate the same kind of buzz and energy as when there are 500 people in a room applauding . "
To be sure , an opposition party 's response rarely wins wide praise : Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius ' rebuttal last year was widely viewed as flat , and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine was panned for appearing particularly awkward in his 2006 rebuttal .
" Everybody thinks [ the response ] is a great launching pad , " said CNN political contributor and White House veteran Ed Rollins , " I would n't recommend to any of my clients , whatever you do do n't take the honor . "
The Louisiana governor may also be a victim of overhype and outsized expectations .
Jindal 's impressive resume and compelling background have been touted to make him a natural fit to compete against Obama and rescue a Republican Party that many fear is in danger of becoming confined to the South .
But if conservatives are looking for Jindal to compete with the president stylistically , they should think again , sad Matt Lewis , a conservative blogger for AOL's Political Machine .
" Conservatives are looking for the conservative version Obama , a great orator , " Lewis said .
" Bobby Jindal is many things -- an intellectual , a son of immigrants and a policy wonk .
But if conservatives are looking for someone who is going toe - to - toe with Obama , he 's the wrong guy . "
iReport.com : Jindal 's tone ' insulting '
Some Republicans praised the content of the speech itself : namely a vigorous defense of conservative principles and an optimistic can - do outlook on the future .
They also say the speech laid out a cogent rebuttal to the Democrats massive stimulus bill , articulated a way forward for the GOP and rightly refrained from overly criticizing the president himself .
" Jindal on Tuesday was likable , his personal story was compelling and he offered a positive vision of conservatism for America , " Lewis said .
Jindal can also take solace in the fact that in politics , there often is more than one chance to make a good first impression .
After all , some of the most prominent politicians today floundered their first attempt in the national spotlight , including former President Bill Clinton , who was widely panned for his 32 - minute speech at the 1988 Democratic Convention .
The speech was immediately deemed disastrous by the political chattering class , and many predicted it would delay , perhaps even end , the his national ambitions .
iReport.com : Jindal speech portrayed GOP as ' one trick pony '
Four years later he was the Democratic nominee for president .
" Politicians often come back from moments such as these , " Crowley said .
" It was perhaps not the most auspicious debut for Jindal on the national scene , but there is a lot of time left for rehabilitation . "

But beginning in the 1980s , the Chinese government invested huge sums in penicillin fermenters , “ disrupting prices around the globe and forcing most Western producers from the market , ” said Enrico Polastro , a Belgian drug industry consultant who is an expert in antibiotics .
Part of the reason these plants went overseas is that the F.D.A. inspects domestic plants far more often than foreign ones , making production more expensive in the United States .
“ U.S. companies are more regulated and are under more scrutiny than foreign producers , particularly those from emerging countries .
And that ’s just totally backwards , ” said Joe Acker , president of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association .
“ We need a level playing field . ”
The Bush administration spent more than $ 50 billion after the 2001 anthrax attacks to protect the country from bioterrorism attacks and flu pandemics ; some of that money went to increase domestic manufacturing capacity for flu vaccines .
Even so , officials have said that during a pandemic the United States would not be able to rely on vaccines manufactured largely in Europe because of possible border closures and supply shortages .
And the situation is similar with antibiotics like penicillin ; researchers have found that during the 1918 flu pandemic , most victims died of bacterial infections , not viral ones .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a stockpile of medicines with enough antibiotics to treat 40 million people .
If more are needed , however , the nation lacks the plants to produce them .
A penicillin fermenter would take two years to build from scratch , Mr. Polastro said .
Dr. Yusuf K. Hamied , chairman of Cipla , one of the world ’s most important suppliers of pharmaceutical ingredients , says his company and others have grown increasingly dependent on Chinese suppliers .
“ If tomorrow China stopped supplying pharmaceutical ingredients , the worldwide pharmaceutical industry would collapse , ” he said .
On Saturday , January 18 , 2009 , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) advised consumers to avoid eating any products containing peanut butter or peanut paste until it can determine how many have been contaminated .
The FDA warning says this advisory does not include jars of peanut butter sold in grocery stores , only products that were made with peanut butter , such as crackers .
More than 450 people have been poisoned , and five people have died , as the result on of a Salmonella outbreak .
A sixth death may be linked to the outbreak .
The FDA said its investigators found contamination in a Blakely , Ga. , peanut - processing plant owned by Lynchburg , Va.- based Peanut Corp. of America .
They have not confirmed the contamination at the plant is the same strain that caused the Salmonella outbreak .
The plant suspended operations this week while investigators look for clues .
Normally any kind of salmonella contamination would be destroyed in the processing of peanuts for peanut butter as the peanuts are roasted to about 350 degrees .
Peanut Corp. of America on Friday expanded its recall of peanut butter for bulk distribution which is believed to be the source of the contamination .
The company had previously recalled 21 lots of peanut butter produced on or after July 1 , 2008 .
Late Friday , Kellogg announced it is recalling cookies and crackers made with peanut butter as a precaution .
This includes about 33,000 cases of cookies , and 7 million cases of crackers from grocery shelves .
Kellogg is also asking consumers who possess recalled products to destroy them .
Consumers wishing to receive a refund may do so by calling the customer service number listed on the recall notice .
These are the products Kellog has told retailers to recall and customers to destroy :

I have many well - meaning friends who are collectivists .
They believe there is a place , a time and a circumstance where government should do good by helping those who cannot .
They often state that just because this approach has been botched badly in the past by government , it does n't mean we should throw the baby out with the bath water .
There is some good to collectivism , they insist : Civilization started by the riversides with groups of people banding together so that some could hunt and gather , some could plant and harvest , and the well could attend to the sick , the wise could teach , and the strong could help protect the weak in their " family . "
We have gone far astray from those original intentions , but the intentions were good and not inherently flawed , so they would say .
If we can only get the right people into power , we will have " good government " and all of this will work again .
inalienable rights simply because one is born , which is what the founders intended for us .
Of course , we should always remember the founder 's hypocrisy regarding slavery and the rights of minorities .
Here is where I believe we threw the baby out with the bath water in the last 100 + years .
Why not respect those rights for every individual rather than creating the divisive mess we have now ?
I would much prefer a reformed constitutional democratic republic over a " democracy " any day : I would agree with them that collectivism can work and can be very desirable .
However , it works best and is most sustainable when it is done on a voluntary basis , not by institutionalized force or coercion .
The historic collective cooperation they often refer to was largely voluntary .
On the other hand , in a system of institutionalized coercive collectivism , people become divided into groups , from where they usually come to believe their rights originate .
This is much different from having individualsimply because one is born , which is what the founders intended for us .
Of course , we should always remember the founder 's hypocrisy regarding slavery and the rights of minorities .
Here is where I believe we threw the baby out with the bath water in the last 100 + years .
Why not respect those rights for every individual rather than creating the divisive mess we have now ?
I would much prefer a reformed constitutional democratic republic over a " democracy " any day : http://www.1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/repvsdem.htm
Our society has become polarized like never before .
Numerous pressure groups consistently growl at each other 's throats while attempting to seize the reins of government , so they can wrestle control of its spike club of power to beat the others over the head .
Look at America in 2009 ... I do n't mean to exaggerate .
20th Century , coercive collectivist governments flying the flags of communism and fascism killed approximately 200 million of their own innocent , unarmed citizens - often for the simple crime of being a member of the wrong religion , the wrong ethnic group or having political beliefs that the state did not approve of .
At this point in my life , when judging U.S. presidents , I look at the death toll for which each is responsible ...
The lower the better , with of course zero being best .
Hopefully our new president will fare much better than the previous , although this clip troubles me : During the , coercive collectivist governments flying the flags of communism and fascism killed approximately 200 million of their own innocent , unarmed citizens - often for the simple crime of being a member of the wrong religion , the wrong ethnic group or having political beliefs that the state did not approve of .

I 'm all for voluntary groups coming together to solve problems and I 've been a member of many such groups in my lifetime .
However , if someone wishes to cease from participating for whatever reason , they should be allowed to do so without threats of retaliation or violence .
This is why churches , mutual aid societies and private charities used to be so much more effective and efficient at helping the poor than government is today .
If such a group became corrupt or wasteful , its members / donors could leave , thereby de-funding the organization .
New organizations would form to take their place .
This process tends to keep private organizations more honest and accountable than coercive " public " ones .
With public institutions , you are required to pay them for their services no matter what , and when they fail in their mission , they often demand even more money from the taxpayer to " fix " the problem they created in the first place .
So we really have no choice .
Try to withdraw from the federal government system and see what happens - Your picture will be on the evening news and in the newspapers ;
Your home will be called a " compound " and you will be painted as a separatist lunatic as they prepare to storm your property with high - tech weapons ablazin ' .
The so - called " public " institutions have us by the cojones regardless of whether the D's or the R's are in power .

The entire system has spiraled out of control due a severe lack of vigilance and accountability ; A violent gang has been given a monopoly on violence ;
They have mountainous stack of deadly weapons with the perceived authority to use them with impunity on anyone they please , anywhere in the world .
To make matters worse , they can print as much funny money as they wish to accomplish their objectives .
This never ends well for the citizens - hence , the perils of big government .
How did it get so big and out of control in the first place ?
A growing number of people believe it is because we stopped following our own constitution , incrementally over many decades .
Without maintaining a strong , basic rule of law , any society is doomed to destruction .
When I use the term " rule of law " , I do n't mean to endorse all of the foolish , unjust and frivolous federal / state / local laws on the books .
There are two basic laws , under which we were originally founded , which can maintain a highly civil society :
1 . Do all that you agreed to do .
2 . Do not encroach upon other persons or their property ( this includes pollution ) .
Our monetary system is a large part of our problems .
Economist John Maynard Keynes once said that " by a continuing process of inflation , governments can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens .
There is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency .
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose . "
( The Economic Consequences of the Peace 1919 ) As we see , this is all coming to pass .
The financial crisis we are beginning to experience is exposing our centrally - planned , top - heavy government like no time before .
Both political parties have been at the feeding trough for decades , using fiat funny money ( non asset - backed ) to reward their friends ( Wall Street , Medical Military Industrial Complex , et al ) and punish their enemies ...
Not to mention the bombing of innocent brown people around the world into oblivion .
I do n't feel good about funding that , but with guns pointed at my head , so to speak , I have no choice and either do any of you .
Many people feel that government is what creates the order in society .
I would disagree and contend that the millions , if not billions of voluntary , often spontaneous interactions between people on a daily basis is what creates the actual order in society .
It is the real glue that holds us all together .
Some call it spontaneous order :
Due to the likely economic collapse on the way , many of us will be called upon in our communities to help the poor , the widows , the orphans and the elderly in need .
The silver lining could be that many of us will rediscover the value of voluntary cooperation .
When the governments go broke , there will only be us remaining to take care of each other .
We do best when we 're not being coerced .
As David McAlvany said recently , " if you look at the value of society , if you look at the value of what we do in community , it is not the corpus that defines us , it is individual autonomy ;
It is individual dignity that matched with someone else 's individual autonomy and individual dignity , makes for a great society ; A great society is not because the society defines greatness , but a society is defined by the greatness of its individuals . "
What would the Beatles have been without John Lennon ?
Without Paul McCartney ?
At the same time , neither were as good outside the Beatles in their subsequent solo careers .
Ultimately , for most of society to survive in the coming years , confidence in government must be replaced with self - confidence .
Vibrant , prosperous , harmonious societies are built from the bottom up , not from the top down .
Economically , I believe that it is unrealistic to believe that we can all be equal .
We all have unique talents and abilities which should be pursued with as much vigor as we please .
The marketplace may value these talents differently , depending on quality , coupled with supply & demand .
However , I am hoping to see the day when all of us are equal before the law , regardless of financial standing .
That coupled with an honest monetary system would do wonders for our communities , as there would be no more counterfeit money in circulation , created out of thin air by elitist bureaucrats .
The gap between the richest and poorest citizens would be greatly reduced .
There would n't be any more stupid money in existance to throw at wasteful projects .
There would be far less debt creation and far more wealth creation , which leads to prosperity for all .
There are presently too many politically - connected paper pushers making too much synthetic wealth from our counterfeit fiat monetary system .
In my humble opinion , limited government , an honest rule of law for everyone and sound money will turn us around like nothing we 've ever seen before .
This is how the U.S. became successful in the first place .
Just imagine how it could be with equality before the law for everyone .
Historians would refer to it as a renaissance .
Laissez - faire capitalism is a politico - economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and in which the powers of the state are limited to the protection of the individual ’s rights against the initiation of physical force .
This protection applies to the initiation of physical force by other private individuals , by foreign governments , and , most importantly , by the individual ’s own government . "
See :
The other area where I believe many of us have thrown the baby out with the bath water is with free enterprise , otherwise known as laissez - faire capitalism : " capitalism is a politico - economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and in which the powers of the state are limited to the protection of the individual ’s rights against the initiation of physical force .
This protection applies to the initiation of physical force by other private individuals , by foreign governments , and , most importantly , by the individual ’s own government . "

While elections can be manipulated by the media and / or rigged outright by insiders , the most powerful and just form of democracy known to man is exercised from one 's own checkbook , with one 's hard - earned resources .
I 'm all for enterprising people creating jobs and wealth , as long as they seek to create win-win situations while refraining from encroaching upon others or their property .
Of course , we should be vocal in promoting fair and honest competition within the marketplace .
People who do n't like the way a business operates are free to refrain from patronizing them .
Further , an ethical business does n't use government to protect them from competition , shield them from liability for faulty products , or to mandate the use of their products by force .
This is not capitalism , it is mercantilism / facisim , which is the common practice in America today .
Particularly notable are the healthcare industry ( vaccines , drugs , insurance ) , the energy industry ( big oil , big ethanol ) and public education , just to name a few .
Wal - Mart , although nobody is forcing us to shop there .
As a corporation , they are still much smaller in revenue than the federal government , who forces their citizens to pay for services regardless of whether they want them or not .
I would also direct you to this article , which clarified my view of Wal - Mart as a company : Regarding corporations , I share your distaste for , although nobody is forcing us to shop there .

We should also remember that corporations are government - sanctioned fictional entities , formed so their owners can avoid taxes and liability .
If government was so concerned with the evils of corporations , it could revoke their corporate charters , putting them out of business overnight .
They do n't do so because they 're in bed together .
Again , it 's called mercantilism , often referred to as fascism since the 1930's .
In many ways , I prefer the days where an individual - run or a family - run business was the norm .
There was always a place where the buck stopped .
The big government / big bank / big corporate dominance of today has discouraged and / or destroyed too many productive small businesses for my tastes .
My issue with the big boys has not been any competitive advantage over smaller businesses , but a willingness to use piles of easy counterfeit credit to finance operations , giving them unnatural staying power in the marketplace .
As the big finance , funny money system collapses , it should provide ample openings for nimble small businesses to once again thrive .
We merely need to return to a system that handsomely rewards entrepreneurial risk - taking with an absence of bureaucratic hassles .
History has repeatedly shown that when too much power falls into too few hands , bad things happen to the people .
Granted , there are many , many good people who work for government , at every level .
The problem is that whenever power concentrates into a territorial monopolist of money , law and violence like government , it eventually becomes an organism of its own , growing increasingly hungry for all the resources and flesh it can get its beastly claws on .
When it begins to run out of booty to confiscate from its own people , it usually turns outward , to violent foreign conquests in order to keep its game going .
We should n't forget the ancient Chinese proverb that says " a fish always rots from the head " .
Hopefully there is still time for us to revive the fish known as the USA .
Maybe we can push it back into the water .
I wish our new president well and I hope that he allows the correct solutions to emerge for our current malaise .
So far , I am not encouraged but I do have hope .

A great idea ?
Not if you 're reading it here !
You see , the tree vastly outweighed the truck .
The man was standing with one foot on the ground and the other foot on the accelerator .
When he gunned the engine , the tree acted like an anchor , and the truck yanked itself backwards .
The open door rammed into him , and he was swept over the embankment along with the pickup .
When the dust settled , our lumberman had entered the great beyond .
But his escapade served as a warning to others .
The next lumberman cut up the tree where it lay , and carried it off .

Reader Malcolm points out , " Unless the truck had a differential lock this could not happen .
The differential gearing on the rear axle would spin the other wheel but not the one with the load .
It 's the same when you put one rear wheel in a ditch .
If that wheel has no grip , power does not go to the wheel still on the road .
Agricultural and off - road vehicles have differential lock , but there is no mention here . "
Reader Daniel says , " Could this only happen if the truck had a locking differential ?
Not necessarily .
If the lumberman had only jacked up one wheel , and not the whole rear end , the other rear wheel would be held in place by contact with the ground , allowing the one with the rope enough force to pull hard on the rope "

Justice Department will stop medical marijuana raids , Attorney General says John Byrne and David Edwards
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This
In a little - noticed remark Wednesday , Obama Attorney General Eric Holder said that the Justice Department will no longer raid medical marijuana dispensaries established under state laws but technically prohibited by the federal government .
The decision marks a shift from the Bush Administration , which was more draconian in its approach to hunting those who sought to dispense marijuana for medical purposes .
Numerous states have decriminalized marijuana in recent years , and new fiscal pressures are turning more states toward being more lenient toward first - time drug offenders as the cost of keeping drug users in jail becomes untenable for state budgets .
The remark was caught by The Huffington Post 's Ryan Grimm .
The Drug Enforcement Administration continued to carry out such raids after Obama 's inauguration , Grimm says , despite an Obama campaign promise to cease the practice .
But asked at a press conference Wednesday , Holder said it would n't be the Administration 's policy going forward .
" No " it wo n't be Obama policy , Holder said .
" What the president said during the campaign , you 'll be surprised to know , will be consistent with what we 'll be doing in law enforcement .
He was my boss during the campaign .
He is formally and technically and by law my boss now .
What he said during the campaign is now American policy . "
During the campaign , Obama told an Oregon newspaper that he agreed with the idea of medical marijuana .
" I think the basic concept of using medical marijuana for the same purposes and with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors , I think that 's entirely appropriate , " said Obama
At a campaign stop 2007 campaign stop in New Hampshire , Obama was specific about medical marijuana raids .
" I would not have the Justice Department prosecuting and raiding medical marijuana users . "

Spelmarknaden i Sverige
Som det är nu är spelmarknaden i Sverige statlig reglerad , och alltså förbehållen vissa enstaka aktörer .
Detta kritiseras av många , och Moderaterna har sedan några år haft på sin agenda att slopa monopolet .
Spelmonopolets anhängare menar att monopolet skyddar folk från spelberoende , och drar paralleller med Systembolaget , som ska skydda folkhälsan .
Att stoppa spelmonopolet skulle göra att staten förlorar pengar , vilket kan vara en orsak till att det fortfarande finns kvar .
EU - kommissionen har tidigare attackerat det svenska spelmonopolet och menar att det enbart syftar till att staten ska tjäna pengar , och inte har något socialt motiv .
Det är enligt EU olagligt eftersom en medlemsstat inte får monopolisera en marknad för att tjäna pengar .
Många menar att man skulle göra spelarna en stor tjänst genom att avskaffa spelmonopolet .
Den genomsnittliga vinstandelen från svenska spel är 55 % , jämfört med över 90 % hos konkurrenter som bedriver sin verksamhet från utlandet .
Detta att verksamheten finns utomlands gör också att Sverige går miste om många arbetstillfällen och skatteintäkter .
Svenska spel
När du söker på ” spelmonopolet ” på Wikipedia omdirigeras du till sidan för Svenska Spel .
Svenska spel är ett statligt bolag som från början var två bolag , Tipstjänst och Penninglotteriet .
Svenska Spels verksamhet kontrolleras av Lotteriinspektionen .
De bedriver försäljning via ca 6700 ombud , 2000 restauranger och pubar samt via Internet .
Statens avkastning från Svenska Spel uppgår till omkring 4 miljarder kronor om året , varav en stor del går till den svenska idrottsrörelsen .
År 2005 gav regeringen klartecken att låta Svenska Spel bedriva nätpoker .
Dock avrådde Statens folkhälsoinstitut från detta , då de menade att det skulle öka förekomsten av spelberoende .
På 1920 - och 1930 - talet ökade den olagliga vadslagningen och Sveriges regering såg det som ett samhällsproblem .
Tipstjänst fick därför 1934 tillstånd från staten att starta sin verksamhet .
De gick in för att organisera ett säkert sätt för människor att spela på sportprestationer .
Företaget förstatligades 1943 .

The family of an emotionally disturbed man who plummeted headfirst to his death when police stunned him with a Taser is suing the NYPD and the officers involved in the incident , including the estate of one who killed himself in remorse .
The family of Iman Morales , 35 , is asking for $ 10 million in damages against the city , the New York Police Department , and Lt. Michael Pigott and Officer Nicholas Marchesona .
The lawsuit also seeks additional training for police on stun guns and on dealing with emotionally disturbed people .
Pigott killed himself in October after becoming increasingly distraught over ordering Marchesona to use the stun gun during the standoff on Sept. 24 in Brooklyn .
The city law department said the lawsuit involves a very tragic case and it would review the legal papers thoroughly after it receives them .
It has n’t been determined yet who will represent the officers , but the law department represents employees sued for acts within the scope of their employment .
The civil lawsuit filed Wednesday in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn claims the stun gun should have been used only as “ a last resort . ”
An amateur video of the incident was posted on Web sites and replayed frequently on news stations .
Witnesses and neighbors said Morales , who had a history of emotional problems , had become distraught and threatened to kill himself .
His mother arrived at his apartment to pick him up for a doctor ’s appointment but he would n’t open his door .
They argued , and someone in the building called 911 .
Police arrived and Morales fled naked out the window of his third - floor apartment to the fire escape .
He tried unsuccessfully to get into an apartment on the floor above , and then climbed down until he reached a ledge over a shuttered storefront .
Morales was teetering on the ledge and jabbing at police with a long fluorescent lightbulb when Pigott ordered Marchesona to fire the stun gun .
The 50,000 - volt shock immobilized Morales and he fell 10 feet and suffered fatal injuries .
Officers had radioed for an inflatable bag , but it had not yet arrived at the scene when Morales fell .
“ I asked them to please bring out an inflatable mattress , I was begging them , as a matter of fact , ” his mother , Olga Negron said at a news conference Wednesday .
“ I even mentioned them , he has one inside the house , please just throw it out because my son ’s going to get hurt . ”
Negron , 55 , and her two sons , Danny and Jessie Hernandez , ages 17 and 21 , wore pins with a photo of Morales .
Negron said she watched in horror as her son froze and fell to his death , and described him as a vibrant , intelligent man who had his medication changed the day he died .
Almost immediately after the death , police said the use of the stun gun appeared to violate department guidelines , which explicitly bar their use “ in situations where the subject may fall from an elevated surface . ”
Pigott , who was stripped of his gun and badge and reassigned to desk duty after the incident , was found about a week later in a police locker room , dead of a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
Marchesona was reassigned to desk duty after the incident , but has since returned to the force and was promoted to detective .
The investigation was closed .
After the incident , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a new commander of the NYPD ’s Emergency Service Unit , which responds to many incidents involving the mentally ill .
He also ordered the unit ’s 440 officers to get refresher training on how to deal with emotionally disturbed people .
Negron and her attorney , Seth Harris , reiterated their sympathy for Pigott ’s family .
“ I think all of our hearts go out to the lieutenant ’s family and obviously the pain that he suffered … but it still would n’t detract from the anger that you might feel in the decision he made when it ’s related to a loved one , ” Harris said .
The M1028 is a 120 mm shotgun shell for the M1 tank .
The shell holds 1100 10 mm tungsten balls .
They are apparently lethal up to 700 m ( 765 yards ) .
Here is a video of the shell being fired in slow motion .
It shows the shot breaking the sound barrier and the shot pattern ( H/T to Sebastian ) .
I tried to calculate the weight of each ball .
It depends on how pure the balls are .
My calculations , based on a company that makes tungsten balls that weigh 18 grams per cm3 , indicate that each ball will weigh about 145 grains .
That is a combined weight of 159,500 grains / 10 kilograms / 22.8 pounds !
( 4/3 ) x pie x 0.5 cm ^ 3 = 0.52 cm3
0.52 * 18 = 9.42 grams ( 145 grains )
Please correct me if I am wrong .

I recently appeared on Vanessa Fox ’s new Webmaster Radio show , “ Office Hours ” where we discussed some of the simple things business owners can do to increase search traffic to their website , but which are often neglected .
During the show , Vanessa answered a bunch of frequently asked questions , and her answers often started out with something like , “ People do n’t like it when I say this , but there are no specific numbers or formulas for that , because it depends on a variety of factors to determine relevancy . ”
I know exactly what she ’s talking about and was glad to hear her answer the questions that way , because “ it depends ” is often the only way you can answer SEO questions .
In fact , it ’s so common that “ it depends ” has been said 357 times on various High Rankings Forum threads !
To show you what I mean , here ’s a list of SEO questions that I get asked all the time , along with what the answer depends upon , and then a quick answer based on the various factors that might be involved :
Q. How quickly will Google re-index my pages after I ’ve SEO ’d them ?
It depends on : how popular your site is , how often Google ’s spiders typically come around , how deep in the site the changes have been made , and more .
The quick answer : Anywhere from 1 day to 6 weeks .
Q . What should I do if my rankings drop by 10 pages in the SERPs ?
It depends on : how long you had your previous rankings , how competitive they were , if you ’ve done anything to purposely deceive the search engines , how long rankings drop has existed , etc .
The quick answer :
Do nothing and give it a few weeks to see if your rankings come back .
In most cases , they will .
Q. To what extent is SEO effective ?
It depends on : who ’s doing it , their knowledge and skill levels , as well as the types of keyword phrases you ’re targeting .
The quick answer : SEO done correctly by a knowledgeable and skilled SEO consultant can be highly effective in increasing the targeted traffic to your website .
But SEO done by someone who ’s just read about it …well … not so much !
Q. Should my Title tag exactly match the main headline on my page ?
It depends on : whether your content management system ( CMS ) does this as the default and it would be difficult to change , or how much time you have to create separate Titles and headlines .
The quick answer : Typically you ’d want your Title tag and your main headline to be different because they serve different purposes .
But if it ’s a major undertaking to ensure this does n’t happen , it ’s not a deal breaker as far as SEO is concerned , assuming you have some control over what they say .
Q. Should I change my URLs to have keywords within them ?
It depends on : whether your current URLs are getting indexed and found , whether you ’re currently in the midst of a redesign , how awful your URLs currently look , how easy it is to implement within your CMS , and whether you can easily 301 - redirect the old versions to the new ones .
The quick answer :
If you have to change all URLs anyway because of a website redesign and CMS change , then sure , make clean , keyword - rich URLs that look nice in the search results .
But if there ’s nothing really wrong with your current ones other than you do n’t like the way they look or you think you need to add keywords to them , it ’s probably not worth the hassle that goes with such a major change to the structure of your website .
Q. How many keyword phrases should I target ?
It depends on : how many keywords phrases people would type into the search engines to seek out what your company provides and how many pages your site has .
The quick answer :
If everything else is in place , you can typically target anywhere from 2 - 5 keyword phrases on any one page of your website .
Multiply that by the number of unique , optimizable pages on your site and you should have a rough estimate of how many potential keyword phrases you could target .
Q. Should I put my blog in a sub- directory , a subdomain or on its own domain ?
It depends on : whether you want to brand the blog as part of your main website or brand it as a separate entity , and whether you want people to be able to easily remember the URL .
The quick answer :
Whether it ’s in a sub - directory or subdomain does n’t make too much difference , although if it ’s in a subdomain you may have more chance of it showing up in the search results at the same time that your main domain also shows up , than if it ’s in a sub- directory .
On the other hand , the average person does n’t think to type in subdomains if they ’re trying to go directly to your site and are more likely to remember something like yourdomain.com / blog than blog.yourdomain.com .
For SEO purposes , none of these things really matter , so it ’s more of a business / branding decision .
Q. How many words should my pages be ?
It depends on : how many words it takes to say what you need to say .
The quick answer :
There is no specific number of words a page should be for SEO purposes .

If you ’re like me , you ’ll have hundreds of accounts all over and you ’ll need to remember an equal number of usernames and passwords .
Good security requires you do not keep the same password for all your accounts and so it would totally impossible for you to memorize all the passwords .
This is where password managers come into play .
A password manager will allow you to save the username and passwords for your various accounts and visit the site and fill in the password and login to the site .
Here are five completely free software that allow you to manage your passwords .
LastPass is a Firefox or Internet Explorer browser add - on that stores all of your passwords locally and synchronizes all of them to any other browser ( with the same add - on ) using 256 - bit AES encryption .
LastPass includes added features of sharing passwords with your friends , importing and exporting data , generating secure passwords .
It also allows you synchronize your accounts with your online LastPass account and use bookmarklets to fill in the passwords .
KeePass is a free open source password manager , which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way .
You can put all your passwords in one database , which is locked with one master key or a key file .
So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database .
The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known ( AES and Twofish ) .
Password Safe allows you to safely and easily create a secured and encrypted user name / password list .
With Password
Safe all you have to do is create and remember a single “ Master Password ” of your choice in order to unlock and access your entire user name / password list .
AnyPassword is an easy - to - use tool that lets you store and arrange all your passwords , user IDs , and related information in a tree form .
The program saves this information in encrypted files which can be protected by a password .
So , the only thing you need to remember is the password for the file .
Any Password can also generate random passwords with specified parameters ( length , used characters , etc. ) .
You can find any stored information using the incremental search feature .
RoboForm makes logging into Web sites and filling forms faster , easier , and more secure .
RoboForm memorizes and securely stores each user name and password the first time you log into a site , then automatically supplies them when you return .
RoboForm ’s powerful Logins feature eliminates the manual steps of logging into any online account .
With just one click RoboForm will navigate to a Web site , enter your username and password and click the submit button for you .
Unfortunately , the free version is limited to 10 passwords and a single user profile .
However , in spite of this , RoboForm is my favorite password manager and I soon became so dependent on it that I picked up a pro version as well as the portable version .
And , it is well worth the money spent !
So , do you use a software to manage your passwords ?
Which password manager do you use ?
Two UK mobile operators are reportedly fuming at Nokia for including a mobile version of Skype on its N97 handset .
Both Orange and O2 are so terrified that the popular VoIP service will siphon away profitable cell minutes by allowing users to make free calls that they are supposedly threatening not to carry the device unless Skype is removed .
The outrage is going on behind closed doors for the time being , though it 's hardly surprising , given the power that carriers have traditionally had over handset manufacturers .
They do n't like customers having options that the handset maker wants to offer when they believe it might threaten their bottom line — even if they ultimately benefit consumers .
This attitude is merely reinforced by the anonymous comments made to Mobile Today about the issue .
" This is another example of them trying to build an ecosystem that is all about Nokia and reduces the operator to a dumb pipe , " one mobile operator told the site .
" Some people like 3 may be in a position where it could make sense to accept that .
But if you spend upwards of � 40 m per year building your brand , you do n't want to be just a dumb pipe do you ? "
3 is a mobile operator in the UK that can apparently see the VoIP writing on the wall ; it already offers a handset with Skype capabilities , and T - Mobile has also gotten on board with support for the service .
Unfortunately O2 and Orange are n't fans of it , and are visibly holding back on allowing VoIP software so they can make sure it wo n't hurt their business .
This is , of course , a frustrating development for customers who are increasingly buying handsets equipped with WiFi capabilities and want to be able to take full advantage of their capabilities .
VoIP use on cell phones helps customers to save money and minutes by making extremely low - cost calls when on a WiFi network , without having to carry a second Skype phone with them .
Including VoIP software on mobile phones could actually lead to more sales , more new customers , and even more cell network use because of the new customers .
In fact , a " senior industry source " speaking to Mobile Today suggested exactly that : " If you look at what 3 has done — chargeable calls on Skype phones is bigger than those without it . "
This fear of VoIP is certainly not limited to the UK ; mobile operators in the US have also been extremely cautious in allowing handsets to be equipped with Skype or other VoIP software , though some are taking baby steps .
AT&T sort of tolerates VoIP apps on Apple 's iPhone , though they must be restricted to WiFi-only — no VoIP calls over the cell network for you !
Additionally , T - Mobile has launched HotSpot@Home here in the US , which allows users to make VoIP calls over WiFi networks that automatically switch to the cell network when users wander outside of WiFi range .
As VoIP becomes more pervasive , customers will put more pressure on cell operators to let them make those calls when they want to .
It seems like a better idea for carriers to get on board now — even in a limited sense with WiFi - only VoIP — than to put it off until customers get really irritated .
New Albany family involved in COVID - 19 vaccine trial
The Cleres joined a clinical trial with others from Southern Indiana and Kentucky who are taking part in the area 's first COVID - 19 vaccine trial .
( CNN ) -- A Connecticut woman pleaded for police to " please hurry " to save a friend from an attack by a pet chimpanzee , according to emotional 911 recordings released Tuesday by Stamford police .
Police say Travis , seen here as a younger chimp , was like a child to his owner , Sandra Herold .
" He 's ripping her apart , " Sandra Herold , 70 , tells dispatchers about her pet , Travis .
With the chimp squealing in the background , Herold cries out , " He 's killed my friend ! "
The victim , Charla Nash , 55 , remains hospitalized with life - threatening injuries after the chimp , once featured in television commercials for Coca - Cola and Old Navy , attacked her Monday afternoon , police said .
Nash had just arrived at Herold 's house when Travis jumped on her and began biting and mauling her , causing serious injuries to her face , neck and hands , according to Stamford Police Capt .
Rich Conklin .
Conklin said the attack was unprovoked , but he described it as " brutal and lengthy . "

Herold had called Nash to her house to help get 14 - year - old Travis back inside after he used a key to escape .
While her friend was being attacked , Herold was unable to pull the primate off .
She then called 911 before stabbing the chimp with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel .
Neither fazed Travis , who police said had been like a child to Herold .

A Stamford police officer later shot the chimp multiple times after the primate went after him inside a police cruiser , Conklin said .
Travis returned to the house , where police found him dead .
Conklin estimated that Travis weighed close to 200 pounds .
Conklin could n't confirm media reports that the chimp had Lyme disease , though he did say investigators were taking their time with the case to determine what may have provoked Travis to attack Nash .
Animals often do not exhibit symptoms of Lyme disease , caused by the bite of certain types of ticks , although aggression is a possible symptom , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Conklin said Nash had recently gotten a haircut that changed her appearance significantly .
Conklin said the chimp had been acting " rambunctious " earlier , prompting Herold to put Xanax in a cup of tea for him to drink .
He did not know if the animal had been prescribed the medicine or if Herold had ever given her pet such a mixture before .

Conklin added that his department is not used to dealing with cases such as this , and they were trying to familiarize themselves with laws and regulations before deciding if charges will be filed .
Conklin said this is n't the first interaction his officers have had with Travis .
The chimp , who was well known and liked in the community , escaped in 2003 and " wreaked havoc " on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours , Conklin said .
Travis ' body was removed from the home and taken to two locations :
His head was taken to the state lab for a rabies test and the body was taken to the University of Connecticut for an animal autopsy .
Conklin said this is standard procedure .
The chimp , who was known to walk around town , sometimes without a leash , also liked to surf on the Internet and was able to change the TV channel with a remote , according to a Stamford Advocate article .
The paper also reported that Travis watered plants , was able to feed hay to his owner 's horses , ate at a table with the rest of the family and sometimes drank wine from a stemmed glass .

Extremophilic microbes are a wild bunch .
They can be found thriving in some of the most hostile environments imaginable - swimming in near - boiling water , eating rocks , lounging in sub - zero temperatures , and hanging out where radiation levels rival nuclear reactors .
They 're tougher than duct tape , boldly going where humans dare not and cannot .
Extremophiles are also a multimillion dollar - a- year business - some of them are employed to eat oil and help clean up spills .
Others have important applications in medical research .
But for many scientists , these hardy microbes are interesting because they suggest the potential for life on other planets .
Recent discoveries have greatly expanded the range of these wild things .
Here 's a census of small creatures living in some of the worst conditions imaginable .
Needs more salt
Microbial extremophiles have recently been discovered thriving in the extremely hostile environments in the depths of the Mediterranean Sea .
Would you live here ?
Mono Lake is like Mars , and it is inhabited .
Bizarre Creature in Idaho Raises Prospects for Life on Mars Titan : A World of its Own
At nearly 2.5 miles ( 4 kilometers ) below sea level , with salt concentrations ten times higher than seawater , pressure 400 times greater than atmospheric pressure , and a lack of oxygen to boot , the conditions these microbes thrive in are some of the most hostile environments on Earth .
In the Jan. 7 issue of the journal Science , researchers working on the European Biodeep project reported the discovery of new microbes in the anoxic basins , or ' brine lakes ' , located off the coast of Sicily .
It is these types of conditions , particularly the high concentrations of magnesium chloride , that have scientists imagining what the environments of other planets might consist of , and whether they contain life .
" Ascertaining the nature of the subsurface on other planets is tricky , but there is growing evidence for hypersaline environments of Mars and Jupiter 's moon , Europa .
Indeed , Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean rich in magnesium salts , " Terry McGenity , the lead scientist of the University of Essex group working on the Biodeep project , told LiveScience .
Since light cannot penetrate water of this depth , there are no photosynthetic bacteria in the basins .
Most of the organisms the Biodeep workers have found reduce sulfates to run their metabolism .
Some of the microbes McGenity 's group found were completely unknown ; including a new group of Archaea they have named MSBL - 1 .
McGenity speculates that these microbes are methanogens because they are related to methane producing Archaea and no other methane - producing microbes were found in the basins , which are abundant with methane .

The European Mars Express mission detected hints of methane in Mars 's atmosphere last year , and some astrobiologists have speculated that the methane could be a by - product of extremophilic methanogens or some other form of microbial life .
Hydrogen - fueled
Another recent extremophile study discovered microbes in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park using hydrogen as their primary fuel source , refuting the popular conception that sulfur is the main source of energy for microbes living in thermal features .
The research was designed to find the main source of energy of microbes living in hot springs with temperatures over 158 degrees Fahrenheit ( 70 Celsius ) , a temperature too high for photosynthesis .
" It was a surprise to find hydrogen was the main energy source for microbes in hot springs , " said University of Colorado researcher Norman Pace , who led the team .
Pace 's colleague John Spear , lead author of the study published in January 's online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , speculated about what the discovery of hydrogen fueled microbes means for life on other planets .
Studying an Antarctic Lake to Prepare for Europa
" Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe , " Spear points out .
" If there is life elsewhere , it could be that hydrogen is its fuel . "
Beat the heat
Other tiny critters prefer the cold .
Hiding beneath sheets of ice in Siberia and Antarctica are microbes called pyschrophiles or psychrotrophs .
They consist mostly of bacteria , fungi , and algae , thrive in freezing temperatures ranging from 23 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 5 to 20 Celsius ) .
In addition to being cold , the environments that these microbes are found in are sometimes at tremendous depths - sometimes over two miles ( 3.2 kilometers ) below the surface .
Pyschrophiles help us clean up arctic oil spills .
They also turn our milk sour .
There is a good chance , scientists say , that extraterrestrial life could be similar to this class of microbes .
In a solar system where many of the planets -- including Mars -- have large ice deposits and colder temperatures in general , pyschrophiles might thrive .
Undersea hot spots
Rising as high as 15 stories off the ocean floor at depths of 7,000 feet ( 2,100 meters ) , hydrothermal vents that spew acidic , mineral rich water are the places to be - if you can stand the heat .
The water coming out of the vents can reach temperatures as high as 750 ? F ( 400 ? C ) , but that 's just fine to undersea thermophiles .
Where Life Might Have Begun
The mineral - munching microbes living around these volcanic " chimneys , " which are so deep no sunlight can reach them , give yet another view of what life could be like on another planet , where lack of sunlight would hinder organisms relying on photosynthesis as their energy producing mechanism .
A number of the planets and moons in our solar system are covered in ice , but scientists speculate that below some of that ice are liquid oceans .
If there is also volcanic activity on those ocean floors , it is possible that similar hydrothermal vents could be growing there as well .
Although it is nearly impossible to know whether there is life in those oceans , at least an environment that we know organisms can live in could be present .
Under pressure
A sediment sample recently drudged up from Challenger Deep , the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean , was abundant in single - celled protists called foraminifera .
Researchers were surprised to find these soft - shelled critters at depths of nearly 7 miles ( 11.2 kilometers ) , where the pressure is 1,100 times greater than at the surface .
Organisms Found in Deepest Part of Ocean
" I am very surprised that so many very simple , soft - shelled foraminifera are dwelling at the deepest part of the ocean , " said Hiroshi Kitazato , of the Institute for Research on Earth Evolution at the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology .
Kitazato suggests that the deep trenches , where the creatures can feed on bits of sunken organic matter , may provide a refuge for the foraminifera .
The fossil record of foraminifera is over 550 million years old .
In last week 's issue of the journal Science , Kitazato suggested that these new creatures probably represent the remnants of a deep - dwelling group that was able to adapt to high pressures .
The rest of the wild bunch
It 's a hard rock life : Endoliths and Hypoliths are two types of extremophiles that live inside rocks or between the mineral grains .
Endoliths have been found over 2 miles below the Earth 's surface , and if they can stand the heat , they could dwell much deeper .
Early observations show that they feed on surrounding iron , potassium , or sulfur .
Water is scarce at these depths , and this slows down the procreation cycle of the organisms - some reproduce only once every 100 years !
Biotechs Mine Bacteria for Industrial Use
Hypoliths are photosynthetic organisms , so the rocks they live in must be translucent , like quartz .
Hypoliths are commonly found in extreme deserts in cold climates , such as on Cornwallis Island and Antarctica .
Their translucent homes provide them with many comforts , such as trapped moisture and protection from ultraviolet rays and harsh winds .
Hot and hotter : Hyperthermophiles are organisms that prefer temperatures above 140 degrees Fahrenheit , some even as high as 250 ? F ( 121?C ) , although those have trouble reproducing .
The hardiest of the 50 known species are those living near hydrothermal vents - these require temperatures of over 194 ? F ( 90 ? C ) to live .
In addition to being heat resistant , many hyperthermophiles can withstand other environment stresses , such as high acidity and radiation .
One thermophile , Thermus aquaticus , produces a DNA polymerase enzyme that is widely used in molecular biology research for use in high temperature polymerase chain reactions used to replicate DNA .
Mightier than a cockroach : Toxitolerant organisms can withstand high levels of damaging agents .
They can be found swimming around in benzene saturated water or in the core of a nuclear reactor .

One species of bacteria , Deinococcus radiodurans , can withstand a 15,000 gray dose of radiation - 10 grays would kill a human and it takes over 1,000 grays to kill a cockroach .
Extraterrestrial life forms would most likely need to possess similar tolerances to radiation , as the atmosphere on other planets , or lack thereof , filters out much less radiation than Earth's .
On a diet : Oligotrophic bacteria survive in , and in some cases prefer , environments that are low in nutrients .
They have evolved metabolic processes that allow them to produce their own sulfur and phosphorus and they feed on their own organic waste .
While there is no evidence for life beyond Earth , information about extraterrestrial environments combined with the discoveries of life in places on our planet thought to be inhabitable keeps scientists optimistic .
" If it works this way on Earth , it 's likely to happen elsewhere , " says Spear , the University of Colorado scientist .
" When you look up at the stars , there is a lot of hydrogen in the universe . "

The point of Music
Thing over the last few years has been to celebrate hardware when all around were defecting to the sensible , practical world of software synths and in - the - box mixing .
Celebrating hardware not because it 's better , but because it looks cool and is nice to have around .
The best hardware is ambitious , bonkers , knob - covered and over engineered ; where no switch is left unilluminated and there 's always a joystick .
Synths should be modular and / or white .
Sequencers should be analog and involve copious blinkenlights .
We should remember the mega synths of the past - the Yamaha CS80 , the ARP 2600 , the Roland Jupiter 8 , the Moog Modular , and we should remember the crazy experiments of the early digital era - Dave Smith 's gnarly Prophet VS ..
The Arturia Origin is a big white synthesizer .
It has a hand rest like an old studio console or an MPC60 ( unfortunately curved steel , not pleather , but still ... )
It 's made in France , of all places .
It 's a digital modular synth , containing models of oscillators and filters from Moog , Arp , Roland and Yamaha , plus a VS - style wavetable section .
Editing is done on a little colour screen surrounded by knobs and buttons - just like the one on the prototype PPG Realizer - the German machine that anticipated soft synths and virtual analog long before it was possible .
Why am I writing this , rather than playing with the thing ?
How come I 've already taken the top off to have a look inside and see how it all works ?
Because the Origin has crossed that line - it's not a hardware synth , it 's a computer in a box covered in knobs .
This is n't Sound on Sound .
I 've lived with this box for days , not weeks .
I 'm not a real musician , I have n't read the manual properly - most of what I say is ill - informed prejudice . , after first plugging it in , using the OEM external power supply that must have cost 99 p .
( Seriously , a £ 1900 hardware synth only really makes sense if you 're playing live .
An external PSU only makes sense if you 're desperately trying to cut costs .
If Behringer can manage a proper internal universal PSU in £ 70 mixers , why can't you ? )
Anyway , when you turn it on , it takes 30 + seconds to boot .
Because it 's a computer in a box .
like an Open Labs Neko or a Hartman Neuron , so it will have taken serious R&D investment to design and build .
The hardware was designed - in 2005 - by Wave Idea , a French company who make MIDI interfaces .
What 's frustrating about the Origin is that it's a computer in a box pretending to be an analog synth ... and nothing more . , although it 's a shame that combining 40 years of synth design produces a bunch of trance noises .
The switch - covered interface means its rather too easy to turn off the layers of reverb and chorus on all the presets .
It 's a bit unfair , but does leaves many of the patches sounding weedy and thin .- delving in to that glorious vintage toolkit .
And it 's easy enough .
You control the whole process through one one those big encoders with a push switch .
I found it quick enough to patch together a basic VS - four wavetable oscillators , mixed by the joystick and running through ( why not ? ) parallel CS80 and Jupiter filters .
I like the little design features - the Yamaha filters look like knobs on a CS80 . - and here 's where I 'm so conflicted - I just wanted a mouse and a decent - sized screen ( oh , the shame of it ) .
I 'd much rather have the beautifully realised screen - based Nord Modular editor - which reproduces the reach - and - grab simplicity of a real modular synth , while allowing for endless complexity .
Because patching a modular synth is more than rearranging a few filters and oscillators .
It 's about weird connections - putting control signals through audio effects , building oscillators from envelope generators .
The Origin is not a tinkerer 's paradise .
Apart from anything else , the modules are so restricted - no sample player , no FM , no granular synthesis , nothing that 's been invented since 1986 .
And it 's a completely closed system - it does n't run VSTs or allow users to develop their own modules .- hidden away in menus I missed , or planned in future upgrades .
It does much more than the £ 190 Analog Factory software / controller combo which presumably contains all the same synthesis algorithms .
Unfortunately it costs as much as Analog Factory and a brand new mid-range MacBook Pro .
That is a very , very big ask ..
It looks good , it feels good .
I 'm sure it 's not overpriced for what it is - a boutique , limited - run machine with a lot of custom hardware and software .
But I can't imagine who would be willing to pay £ 1,900 for it .
It 's too digital for an analog fetishist , too analog for a sound experimentalist .
The potential of this box is immense - DSP power + screen + knobs + blinkenlights + wooden end panels .
But at the moment it 's just - tragically - boring .
Post later .
Getting ready for podcast .
Much good it will do him .
The public was never going to acquit Gordon as readily as he does himself .
They are already looking beyond his premiership to what might come next and whether the Tories are up to the task .
The Tories , for their part , are privately wondering which of his prospective successors they should fear most : as it happens , Alan Johnson , interviewed in the current issue of The Spectator , is the figure who bothers the Cameroons most , although the Tory leader believes Harriet Harman is the Cabinet member running most aggressively for the job .
An era has ended but the PM does not know it .
And while the rest of us look ahead to the post - Brown world , the increasingly isolated Prime Minister sits in No 10 and broods angrily over whom to invite to dinner .
Umar S. Israilov saw the men who had come to kill him .
They confronted him in the neighborhood where he lived in hiding in Vienna .
He must have sensed their intentions , because he ran .
For more than two years , Mr. Israilov , a Chechen in exile , had formally accused Russia ’s government of allowing a macabre pattern of crimes in Chechnya .
Even by the dark norms of violence in the Caucasus , his accusations were extraordinary .
A rebel fighter turned bodyguard of Ramzan A. Kadyrov , Chechnya ’s current president , Mr. Israilov had access to the inner ring of Chechen power .
Mr. Kadyrov ’s career has been sponsored by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia , who as president lifted him from obscurity with unwavering Kremlin support .
In written legal complaints , Mr. Israilov described many brutal acts by Mr. Kadyrov and his subordinates , including executions of illegally detained men .
One executed man , Mr. Israilov said , had been beaten with a shovel handle by Mr. Kadyrov and Adam Delimkhanov , now a member of Russia ’s Parliament .
Another prisoner , the defector said , was sodomized by a prominent police officer and at Mr. Kadyrov ’s order put to death .
For computing 's early - adopters , the phrase " floppy disk " probably conjures up images of a pile of plastic and metal now gathering dust in the back of a wardrobe .
Though it may well be a few years since the machinery designed to play them was thrown out , thanks to a new project by researchers at the University of Portsmouth they may not necessarily be also consigned to the dustbin .
With the development of the world 's first " general purpose emulator " , researchers hope it will be possible to read all types of computer file , from the arcade machines of the 1970s to the floppy discs and minidiscs of more recent years .
The emulator , which can recognise and play files previously held back by being tied to a particular and often outdated computer , is part of an EU project worth more than € 4 m designed to preserve digital files from the past which may otherwise have been lost .
Computer historians Dr David Anderson and Dr Janet Delve and computer games expert Dan Pinchbeck at the University of Portsmouth are partners in the project , entitled KEEP ( Keeping Emulation Environments Portable ) , which aims to develop methods of safeguarding digital objects including text , sound and image files , multimedia documents , websites , databases and video games .

Dr Delve said : " People do n't think twice about saving files digitally - from snapshots taken on a camera phone to national or regional archives .
But every digital file risks being either lost by degrading or by the technology used to ' read ' it disappearing altogether .
Former generations have left a rich supply of books , letters and documents which tell us who they were , how they lived and what they discovered .
There 's a very real risk that we could bequeath a blank spot in history . "
Every year a vast amount of new digital information is created - it has been estimated that in 2010 this will be equivalent to 18 million times the information contained in all the books ever written - and the rate of growth shows no sign of slowing .
Britain 's National Archive holds the equivalent of 580,000 encyclopaedias of information in file formats that are no longer commercially available ; research by the British Library suggests Europe loses £ 2.7 bn each year in business value because of difficulties in preserving and accessing old digital files .
Dr Anderson said : " We are facing a massive threat of the loss of digital information .
It 's a very real and worrying problem .
Things that were created in the 1970s , 80s and 90s are vanishing fast and every year new technologies mean we face greater risk of losing material .
" Early hardware like games consoles and computers are already found in museums but if you can't show visitors what they did , by playing the software on them , it would be much the same as putting musical instruments on display but throwing away all the music .
For future generations it would be a cultural catastrophe . "
Researchers and those in charge of national archives globally have long been concerned about the threat of losing digital information .
Mr Pinchbeck said : " A vast bank of information needs to be catalogued and stored .
Games particularly tend not to be archived because they are seen as disposable , pulp cultural artefacts , but they represent a really important part of our recent cultural history .
Games are one of the biggest media formats on the planet and we must preserve them for future generations . "
Exclusive to STR
Economic downturns are inevitable under the capitalist system .
Currently , we are paying for ten years of unprecedented economic growth with a harsh correction , yet few look at the reality of what we 're facing and what it will take to dig us out of the hole .
The " stimulus " bill just signed into law by President Obama is a fool 's errand that will only make our situation worse .
It ignores the natural conditions of capitalism while dangerously undermining what precious little remains of the free market .
In every capitalist economy there is an ebb and flow .
Sometimes the economy expands , and sometimes it contracts .
In the 1800s , these periods of contraction were known as " panics . "
Euphemistically , they became known as " depressions " in the early 1930s , and government intervention , some economists have argued , turned that particular depression into the Great Depression .
Now , like Influenza became simply " the flu , " we call periods of economic contraction " recessions . "
No one dare utter the " D " word .
Yet if you examine the hard numbers , we appear to be experiencing economic contraction on a grand scale .
Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's peak of 14,164.5 in October 2007 , that index has lost 6,611.9 points , or 46.68 percent of its value , as of February 17 of this year .
The NASDAQ Composite has experienced a 47.6 percent decline in the same period .
If that is n't a depression , I do n't know what is .
Every day brings more news of layoffs , foreclosures , and bankruptcies .
Large corporations return , hat in hand , again and again to the government trough .
We are told that ' something must be done , ' and that if you disagree with the Obama administration 's plan you are a dangerous obstructionist playing politics with the country 's future .
But suppose you had lost 46 percent of your net worth in the past year and a half .
How would you react ?
Would you pull out the credit card and buy that boat you always wanted ?
No.
Common sense would tell you to cut unnecessary spending , balance your budget , and try to pay down your debts .
You could borrow your way back up to your previous worth , but then you would just add to your economic troubles in the future .
Likewise , the government cannot spend its way out of this crisis .
Money , as they say , does not grow on trees .
In order to redistribute cash to hurting sectors of the economy , it must be taken from the taxpayers , printed , or borrowed .
None of those options will help us in the long run .
Recessions will come and go .
After the unprecedented economic inflation under President George W. Bush , we were due for a harsh correction .
Housing and oil prices could not continue to go up .
Lower - middle class families could not live off of credit cards and afford $ 400,000 homes in the suburbs .
The hyper - consumerism of the past decade was unsustainable .
We all knew it , but we were too intoxicated to care .
Something must be done , but that something should not include more and more handouts , borrowing , and wealth redistribution .
Spending is not the only action we can take in relation to this economic crisis .
Like the rest of us , the federal and state governments need to tighten their belts .
This is not a time to invest tax dollars , or dollars borrowed from foreign governments , in social experiments or in pet projects .
At a time when we should pay down the national debt , reduce or eliminate spending , and lure businesses back to the states through lower taxes , the Obama administration is acting like a teenager who stole her parent 's credit card .
Rather than being offended by a New York Post cartoon comparing the author of the stimulus bill to an out of control chimp , we aught to be offended by the inability of our so - called leaders to act moderately and rationally when it comes to economic recovery .
Their rhetoric of fear only serves to make investors increasingly nervous , and when promises of the quick - fix fail to deliver , fear turns to panic .
Although our economy is already far from a free market , politicians and business leaders should not make the situation worse by systematically dismantling the best way we have of generating wealth : competition and private ownership .
Yes , things are bad , but if we stop reckless spending , reduce our debt , and reign in corruption , we will come out of this OK .
Our children will enjoy the fruits of prosperity , instead of the stranglehold of debt and more government bureaucracy .
Obama joins the ranks of cold - blooded murderers Share This :
The first attack yesterday was on the village of Zharki , in Waziristan ; three missiles destroyed two houses and killed 10 people .
One villager told Reuters on the phone that of nine bodies pulled from the rubble of one house , six were its owner and his relatives ; Reuters added that intelligence officials said some foreign militants were also killed .
A second attack hours later also in Warizistan killed eight people .
It matters not one whit that the " relatives " were not the intended targets ; how many children were killed ' by mistake ' I wonder ?
If you or I fired repeatedly and with dubious accuracy into a crowd of people in order to kill one person , then the law would find us guilty of murdering those who were unintentionally slain .
Their deaths would not even be declared accidental because it is / was entirely predictable that firing into a crowd would injure innocent people .
In short , Obama ( as commander - in - chief ) not only ordered a strike that killed innocents but did so with the reasonable expectation that such deaths would occur .
Why should he be judged by standards of law or morality that are different than those applied to you or me ?
It matters not one whit that he was ' only doing his job as President . '
Hit men , torturers , and child - sex traffickers are only doing their jobs .
There are some jobs that cannot be done by a decent human being ... not if he wishes to retain a claim to decency .
It matters not one whit that Obama was half - a- world away from where the murders occurred or that his fingers were n't physically on the weaponry .
Anyone who wishes to exonerate Obama from the blood of the innocent on those grounds must also exonerate Hitler from the Holocaust .
After all , I doubt that Hitler was physically present at mass executions or that he ever directly killed a Jew .
What he ( and Obama ) did was to give orders that amounted to contract killings .
And why did Obama do it ?
There may be military reasons .
There were certainly political ones .
As The Guardian states , " The strikes will help Obama portray himself as a leader who , though ready to shift the balance of American power towards diplomacy , is not afraid of military action . "
In other words , the strike sent the right message ; the murder of innocent people was an acceptable price to pay for that telegram .
Obama is not a good man .
He is not a decent man .
He is a politician .
And the only form of humanity worse than that is a politician in time of war .

There is now blood on Obama 's hands , and nothing can make them clean again ; he has joined the ranks of cold - blooded murderers who kill for profit ... by which I do not necessarily mean money .
Yesterday , Obama ordered a missile strike " against suspected militants " in Pakistan ( with whom the U.S. is not at war ) , which killed at least 18 people .

It matters not one whit that Obama was half - a- world away from where the murders occurred or that his fingers were n't physically on the weaponry .
Anyone who wishes to exonerate Obama from the blood of the innocent on those grounds must also exonerate Hitler from the Holocaust .
After all , I doubt that Hitler was physically present at mass executions or that he ever directly killed a Jew .
What he ( and Obama ) did was to give orders that amounted to contract killings .
And why did Obama do it ?
There may be military reasons .
There were certainly political ones .
As The Guardian states , " The strikes will help Obama portray himself as a leader who , though ready to shift the balance of American power towards diplomacy , is not afraid of military action . "
In other words , the strike sent the right message ; the murder of innocent people was an acceptable price to pay for that telegram .
Obama is not a good man .
He is not a decent man .
He is a politician .
And the only form of humanity worse than that is a politician in time of war .

Today I logged back into a Bebo account that I had n’t used in ages .
The first thing it asked me to do was to add friends – and like so many other social networks it does so by logging into one of your email accounts and finding email addresses .
Since their terms and conditions say they wo n’t store your gmail password and just retrieve email addresses , I tend to use this service to add a few select friends .
But Bebo is really f….d up in this respect .
Parden my words , but today I have spammed each and every one of my contacts and all the mailing lists I am subscribed to , I have been blocked from multiple mailing lists and my email has probably been marked as spammer by many , so that I may ultimately have to change my mailing account .
It was unintentional and I apologise to all of you who had to suffer .
I usually regard myself as fairly intelligent , but Bebo ’s system totally tricked me .
So , when you sign up with Bebo , make sure not to fall into the same trap .
It looks like this is a pretty common complaint .
Here are links to at least three others that had the same issues :
If you look at the second post , it has screenshots .
My screen was indeed slightly different to that .
I had three sections with contacts – one already on Bebo out of which I selected a hand - ful , ones suggested as contacts through contacts which I completely unselected , and a third one with all my email addresses .
Each of the sections had a submit button .
Naturally assuming that only the ticks in the particular section would be submitted with the button underneath that section , I clicked ok underneath the hand - ful of selected contact .
Half an hour later I am now totally shattered and do n’t know how to apologize .
The only interesting effect out of this faux pas is that within the first I hour I made 22 friends !
An amazingly fast way to get to a lot of friends in a social network .
Unfortunately , Bebo has broken my trust and made it to the bottom of my social networks , so if you ’d like to be in contact with me , try me on Linked In or Facebook .
Mr Correa enjoys huge popularity in Ecuador
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador has ordered the expulsion of a senior US diplomat , accusing him of suspending aid to Ecuador 's anti-drugs programme .
During his weekly TV address , Mr Correa said US customs attache Armando Astorga was " insolent and foolish " and had treated Ecuador like a colony .
The US embassy denied that Mr Astorga was responsible for any policy change and said he had already left Ecuador .
Analysts say Mr Correa has generally enjoyed decent relations with the US .
But he launched a vitriolic attack during his weekly TV programme , accusing Mr Astorga of trying to make some economic aid conditional on Washington being allowed to choose the head of Ecuador 's anti-narcotics police .
" Mr Astorga , keep your dirty money , we do n't need it .
We have dignity in this country , " he said .
Mr Correa then told his foreign minister to " give this gentleman 48 hours to pack up his suitcases and get out of the country " .
" We 're not going to let anyone treat us as if we were a colony here . "
US embassy spokeswoman Marta Youth said Mr Astorga had left Ecuador in early January at the end of his assignment .
A state department spokesman said the US ambassador would hold talks with the Ecuador 's foreign minister to " check why this announcement was made " .
Mr Correa has clashed with Washington over several issues - most notably refusing to renew the lease on airbases used by US forces to mount anti-narcotics missions .
But compared with other left - wing governments in Latin America , the rows between Quito and Washington have been low key .
Bolivia and Venezuela both expelled their US ambassadors late last year , accusing Washington of trying to oust Bolivia 's left - wing government .
Washington responded by throwing out envoys from Bolivia and Venezuela .
Something that 's pretty surprising happens as you cover the game industry : you start to like the bigwigs at the companies you cover .
I 've had the pleasure of meeting executives from Nintendo , Sony , and Microsoft , and I 've never been anything less than impressed with their passion and love for the business they work in .
At E3 , Jack Tretton answered every question posed to him at a breakfast with the press , and I had the pleasure of his company for a few minutes afterwards .
This is a guy who knows the PlayStation business inside and out , and clearly loves the products he sells .
At a Nintendo event years ago , I was lucky enough to speak with Nintendo 's Reggie Fils Aime for an extended period of time , and I thought the same thing .
Peter Moore , back before he left Microsoft for EA ?
Charismatic , and very knowledgeable about the titles he controlled .
I 've since met Microsoft 's John Schappert , and he was an open and amiable fellow .
Even on the developer level , people like Alex Rigopulos from Harmonix and Kelly Zmak from Radicial Entertainment all love games , play games , and they live and die by their products .
In other words , even though it 's frequently my job to write about these people when I disagree with their decisions , I 'm happy to report that almost everyone who works in the business loves what they do .
Being a game writer has been like crashing in the North Pole and finding out that not only are Santa and his elves real , but they 're all passionately devoted to Christmas .
That 's why I find Bobby Kotick so distasteful — the man is a carpetbagger .
The only reason we care about him is that he makes a ton of money , and yes , that 's great for business .
I get that .
But usually , when you put the devil in charge , you have the good graces to at least keep a smooth - talking demon or two around to deal with the press .
With Kotick , he 's very brazen about his need to squeeze every last dollar he can out of every franchise under the Activision Blizzard label .
He wants to exploit his games .
He wants to make sure he has a sequel every year , and do n't forget the Wii and DS ports .
Why have one StarCraft game if you can have three ?
Just because people are used to Battle .
net being free does n't mean you can't find some way to make more money from the service .
I firmly believe that EA handed Activision the bottle of special evil sauce because , while Electronic Arts used to be the most hated name in gaming , the tide is turning .
At least with EA , the franchises mostly stay the same year after year ; Activision 's tend to age poorly , like wine made from rancid grapes .
This is a company that looked at Ghostbusters and decided it was n't interested because Harold Ramis most likely would n't write a sequel every 10 months .
Kotick does n't play his games , and it shows .
He has a tin ear when it comes to speaking to investors or the press .
This is a guy who looks at the balance sheets of World of Warcraft and wants more , more , more ... and it 's doubtful he even knows the name of Azeroth .
Under his control , Activision Blizzard has started to look and feel like the Shire at the end of the Lord of the Rings ( and by that , I mean the books ' vision ) .
The only difference is I doubt Activision will see any brave hobbits willing to do a little scouring , not when cutting down the trees remains so profitable .
I 'm going to get out of this paragraph before the Tolkien metaphors get too mixed , but I hope you get what I mean .
Reading the story in Forbes detailing Kotick 's business maneuvering , including the asinine editorial assertion that Rock Band is " a shameless knockoff of Guitar Hero , " left me impressed by his savvy , but not much else .
Remember , Harmonix created Guitar Hero , only to have Kotick 's Neversoft take over and create not only a somewhat lazy and locked down Aerosmith addition , but a portable version that 's more of a sick dare than a solid product .
He 'll shrug this piece off , as will all of Activision Blizzard , because the money is so good .
But you can only slash and burn for so long .
Neversoft and Treyarch will continue to clothe the bones that Harmonix and Infinity Ward have left behind in Guitar Hero and Call of Duty , but they 'll never be able to make the corpses dance as well as the games ' creators .
I can't imagine what it 's like to give Call of Duty to Treyarch between games — it must be like leaving a child you love dearly with an abusive aunt six months out of the year .
World of Warcraft may look like it will go on forever , but the only thing greater than the loyalty of those players is Kotick 's cash - lust .
The only question is if the two will ever collide .
Or maybe I 'm just being a downer , the clichéd crying Indian looking over the dirty fields of Activision 's future .
It 's possible this could go on forever , and Kotick will extract his pound of flesh from gamers by a thousand tiny cuts .
But we 'll be the worse for it , and the idea of looking at those beady eyes every time I write about the man gives me enough incentive to hope for someone — anyone — to come in and love the children that Kotick wants to beat until they work harder .
Until then , the company will have to be happy with a nearly infinite cash stream , delivered by a man who seems to proudly refuse to handle a controller .
If our Activision game reviews are a little late for a while , we hope you understand why .
Team United States
Updating our World Baseball Classic 2009 Preview , today we examine the United States .
No nation garnered more attention for their performance in the 2006 Classic than Team USA as the nation exited the tournament surprisingly early , eliminated when it lost to Mexico in the second round .
This was after a first round loss to Canada and a second round loss to South Korea .
Despite those defeats , the country still controlled its own destiny when it faced Mexico , with a spot in the semifinals up for grabs .
However , a loss to Mexico eliminated the team and left the overall record at a disappointing 3 - 3 .
Officially the team finished 8th overall .
This year provides an opportunity for redemption , and the U.S. roster will again be stacked withstar power .
Every country runs into problems about fielding their best players , but withthe U.S. squad the issue is largely moot .
There is so much depth that the absence of one or two big names will not really be noticed .
For example , at second base the U.S. can choose from Chase Utley , Brian Roberts , or Dustin Pedroia .
If Utley does n’t play , Roberts or Pedroiaare fine alternatives .
Meanwhile a country like Canada is simply hoping for Pete Orr to fill the position .
That ’s not exactly the same kind of player .
This depth keeps expectations high , but allows for a better on - field squad .
The national team is managed by Davey Johnson .
HITTERS :
Catcher – Joe Mauer , Minnesota Twins
First Base – Mark Teixeira , New York Yankees
Second Base – Chase Utley , Philadelphia Phillies
Shortstop – Jimmy Rollins , Philadelphia Phillies
Third Base – David Wright , New York Mets
Rightfield – Carlos Quentin , Chicago White Sox
Centerfield – Grady Sizemore , Cleveland Indians
Leftfield – Ryan Braun , Milwaukee Brewers
Designated Hitter – Lance Berkman , Houston Astros
Bench : C Brain McCann , Atlanta Braves ; 1B Ryan Howard , Philadelphia Phillies ; 2B Dustin Pedroia , Boston Red Sox ; 2B Brian Roberts , Baltimore Orioles ; SS Derek Jeter , New York Yankees ; SS Troy Tulowitzki , Colorado Rockies ; 3B Evan Longoria , Tampa Bay Rays ; 3B / OF Chipper Jones ; OF Josh Hamilton , Texas Rangers ; OF Vernon Wells , Toronto Blue Jays ; OF Matt Holliday , Oakland A’s , OF Nick Markakis , Baltimore Orioles , OF B.J. Upton , Tampa Bay Rays .
Mauer was going to accept an invitation , but has pulled out due to kidney surgery .
McCann is a fine fill - in , but Mauer would have been the top choice behind the plate .
At first there ’s are plenty of options between all - stars like Teixeira , Berkman , and Ryan Howard .
Ca n’t really go wrong there .
The only position where the team might be considered thin is at shortstop where Derek Jeter and Jimmy Rollins remain the best options .
Still a big name , Jeter has never been a strong defensive player and his once top notch offensive game has begun to slip .
Rollins is the 2007 NL MVP , but he ’s not quite to the level of elite shortstops like Hanley Ramirez or Jose Reyes .
Still , he ’s a fine option in the hole .
Another option would be someone like Troy Tulowitzki , an excellent glove man who regressed on offense in 2008 .
The outfield has plenty of choices as well .
Sizemore is one of the game ’s best players , and Quentin and Braun were MVP candidates last season .
Quentin might have won the hardware had he not gotten injured .
It ’s hard to leave a bat like Josh Hamilton out of the starting line - up , but I do n’t see him as better option in center than Sizemore .
He ’d be a fine choice in left or right , if you ’re willing to play him slightly out of position .
I would n’t argue that strategy .
Matt Holliday and Nick Markakis are also very strong bets to play in the outfield , and B.J. Upton can basically act as a utility man of a team like this .
PITCHERS :
Starter – C.C. Sabathia , New York Yankees
Starter – Jake Peavy , San Diego Padres
Starter – Brandon Webb , Arizona Diamondbacks
Starter – Tim Lincecum , San Francisco Giants
Set - Up Man – Jonathan Papelbon , Boston Red Sox
Closer – Joe Nathan , Minnesota Twins
Bullpen : Cole Hamels , Philadelphia Phillies ; Scott Kazmir , Tampa Bay Rays ; Cliff Lee , Cleveland Indians ; Roy Oswalt , Houston Astros ; Justin Verlander , Detroit Tigers ; Zack Greinke , Kansas City Royal ; Dan Haren , Arizona Diamondacks ; B.J. Ryan , Toronto Blue Jays ; Jonathan Broxton , Los Angeles Dodgers ; Bobby Jenks , Chicago White Sox ; Brad Lidge , Philadelphia Phillies ; Joba Chamberlain , New York Yankees .
The starting rotation has simply way too many options , and I ’ve selected what I view as the top four candidates .
That includes the last three NL Cy Young winners plus C.C. Sabathia , who won the AL Cy Young the year before last .
All are aces of their respective club teams .
That leaves plenty of big names for the bullpen .
And while there are some great natural relievers to choose from , starters are generally the better pitchers .
Allowing a guy like Scott Kazmir or Cole Hamels to come out of the bullpen only makes the team that much better .
As for true relievers , the two best options are Nathan and Papelbon .
I ’ve listed Papelbon as the set - up man , as I like his ability to go more than one inning if needed .
Both are among the best closers in baseball .
Chamberlain has been excellent in relief and is another useful arm , with guys like Bobby Jenks and B.J. Ryan providing depth .
Outlook : Anything less than a championship will be viewed as a disappointment .
That ’s understandable given the considerable talent on the U.S. team , but it ’s a bit of an unfair expectation in a short tournament with single elimination involved .
Baseball ’s not the kind of sport where the best teams dominate .
At the Major League level , winning sixty percent of your games makes you pretty good .
So the chances of losing one of the final games remains strong , particularly against top nations like the Dominican or Venezuela .
Still , the United States is the odds on favorite to capture the championship in 2009 .
Jesus I ’m broke , sometimes I wonder how I ’ve come this far .
Luckily , there are enough cracks in the system to not have to find out the nutritional value of my own piss .
Here ’s how it works : Restaurant reviews -
Anyone can be a freelance restaurant critic .
While it helps that I ’m actually a writer , it helps a lot more that LA is teeming with contingency - paid PR folks who only get cash when someone does a piece on their clients .
So when you 're calling to set up a review , the sound of clanking coins is heard by the PR person .
This is by far the best way to dine .
Everything is comped and the staff spoils you to help insure that you ’re having a good time .
You get to eat great food in great quantity , drink like a sailor .
Best of all , you can bring a guest to offset the fact that you have nothing in life to offer , but witty anecdotes .
Manufacturer coupons -
The only bad thing about restaurant reviews is the fact that it ’s tough to do one every day .
On a good week , I ’ll have one or two .
For those other days , I ’m dining in .
One way to keep the pantries full is by getting UPC numbers off packages at the supermarket and phoning the companies complaining about declining standards .
No matter how absurd your complaint , the company will send you a coupon to get what you bought for free .

Bloodstream infections caused by methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , have dropped 50 % in the last decade , at least for one high - risk medical procedure , according to a new study .
The finding , although limited to a single procedure in the intensive - care units of hospitals surveyed -- insertion of a central line , or catheter , into a major blood vessel -- runs contrary to the widespread perception of MRSA as an out - of - control hospital superbug .
“ This study shows that at least in one facet of healthcare - associated infections , things seem to be moving in the right direction , and that ’s a good thing for patient safety , ” said study coauthor Dr. John Jernigan , an epidemiologist at the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ Are we all the way there yet ?
No . ”
The finding was published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn .
Advertisement
MRSA catapulted to the general public ’s attention two years ago when infectious disease experts estimated that the antibiotic - resistant bacterium causes 19,000 deaths a year and that 85 % of the infections are contracted in healthcare settings such as nursing homes , dialysis centers and hospitals .
Many states , California among them , have passed laws since then aimed at stopping MRSA and other healthcare - associated infections , prodded by patient safety advocates .
Such measures include screening patients on admission for the bacterium , isolating those found to be infected and publicly posting hospital infection rates .
Hospital and physician groups have generally opposed such laws as neither cost - effective nor scientifically proven .
The authors of the new study , all CDC researchers , said that the decline in central line - associated infections was underway before such laws were passed .

A central line is a catheter , or tube , inserted into one of the main blood vessels close to the heart .
It is used to administer medications and monitor blood and heart pressures .
Inserting this and other devices , such as urinary catheters or ventilator tubes , puncture the skin ’s protective barrier and allow microbes that may be harmless on the outside into areas where they can cause harm .
The new study was drawn from data on central - line bloodstream infections reported voluntarily to the CDC from more than 1,600 intensive care units .
“ There ’s this perception that there ’s a big cover - up and hospitals are n’t addressing these issues as aggressively as need be , ” said Dr. Mark Rupp , president of the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America , who was not associated with the study .
“ This study would indicate that people have been working on these problems and having a big effect for some time now . ”
Lisa McGiffert , who directs the Stop Hospital Infections project for Consumers Union , which supports legislation , said , “ This shows us that we really can have an impact on these infections that for so long have been treated as inevitable .
Passing legislation has been a major factor in generating attention to the problem and putting pressure on hospitals to do something about it . ”

The study looked only at the number of infections , not at practices that may have contributed to the decline , so researchers cannot say what led to the drop in MRSA infections .
The issue is difficult , scientists said , because studies have reached conflicting conclusions on how to best control the spread of hospital - acquired infections .
In 2008 , for example , a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. concluded that screening surgical patients for MRSA was n’t particularly effective at reducing infections .
One week later , another study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that aggressively screening all patients and isolating those with bacteria was effective .
Advertisement
About 1 in 3 people carries some variety of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in the nose or skin , usually without harm .
The antibiotic - resistant strain MRSA first emerged in hospitals in the 1960s .
In the last decade , a new , more virulent strain of MRSA has emerged outside of hospitals , causing an explosion in rates of severe skin infections .
First identified in 2000 and named USA 300 , the community - acquired strain is n’t the same bacterium that strikes patients in hospitals .

Advertisement Benjamin Netanyahu , the leader of the right - of - centre Likud party , has been asked to form Israel 's next government .
Mr Netanyahu said Israel faced " great challenges " including the global economic crisis and what he said was Iran 's wish to obtain nuclear weapons .
He said he would try to form a unity government with his political rivals .
But Tzipi Livni , leader of the centrist Kadima , has suggested she would rather be in opposition than join a government led by Mr Netanyahu .
Kadima narrowly defeated Likud in the election held on 10 February , but Mr Netanyahu has the support of religious and right - wing parties in the Israeli parliament .
His position was bolstered on Thursday when Avigdor Lieberman , head of Yisrael Beiteinu , which favours tightening the Israeli blockade on Gaza , said it wanted him to be prime minister .
Let 's unite to secure the future of the State of Israel
Benjamin Netanyahu
Likud leader
Profile : Benjamin Netanyahu President Shimon Peres and Mr Netanyahu held a news conference to officially announce that the Likud leader now has six weeks to put together a coalition .
He told the news conference he wanted to open talks with his political rivals to form a " broad national unity government for the good of the people and the state " .
He said : " I call on Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni and Labour Party chairman Ehud Barak and I say to them - let 's unite to secure the future of the State of Israel . "
On Iran , Mr Netanyahu returned to a key campaign theme , suggesting that Tehran had emerged as Israel 's greatest security threat .
The Islamic Republic was seeking to develop nuclear weapons , he said , as well as sponsoring the Hezbollah and Hamas militant groups in Lebanon and Gaza .
' Pawn '
The BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus , says the decision to choose Mr Netanyahu marks the beginning of a period of serious horse - trading .
He says Mr Netanyahu will have a real job on his hands - either to persuade Ms Livni to join his government , or to reconcile the differences among the various factions on the right .
ELECTION RESULTS Kadima : 28 seats Likud : 27 seats Yisrael Beiteinu : 15 Labour : 13 Shas : 11 United Torah Judaism : 5
See results in full Tough dealing ahead Q&A : Israel 's general election Minutes before the news came out that the Likud leader would be asked to form a government , Ms Livni said what was being proposed was a government " without political vision , a government with no values " .
" I will not be a pawn in a government that would be against our ideals , " she said .
Israel 's Haaretz newspaper reported on Thursday that Ms Livni said she would consider a coalition which included Likud , Kadima , and Yisrael Beiteinu .
She ruled out joining a coalition which included a number of other right - wing parties , the newspaper reported .
One of the main points of contention between the two parties is how to handle the Palestinian territories .
Ms Livni favours more talks and the creation of a separate state for the Palestinians .
Mr Netanyahu says he does not want Israel to rule the Palestinians , but says they should not be allowed things he considers a threat to Israeli security , such as an army , or control of airspace or the Jordan Valley .
Likud 's 1999 charter " flatly rejects " a sovereign Palestinian state , but backs Palestinian self rule .
Palestinian officials reacted with caution to the news of Mr Netanyahu 's appointment .
Saeb Erekat , a senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , who has been negotiating with Israel 's outgoing Kadima - led coalition , said Israel needed a government committed to peace .
" We will not be in the negotiations with an Israeli government that continues settlement activities , that refuses the two - state solution , and that does n't accept agreements signed , " he said .

Why CSS should not be used for layout Ron Garret , 2 Feb 2009
Seeing as how the CSS wars seem to have flared up again , I thought I would weigh in .
I have finally had a chance to really dive in to the details , and I have come to the following conclusion :
CSS is really cool .
It is useful for a lot of things .
The basic idea of separating content from presentation is sound .
But when it comes to layout , the design of CSS is fundamentally flawed .
Use tables instead .
There , I 've said it .
But you might want to hear what I have to say before you release the hounds .
There are two reasons that CSS is fundamentally flawed for doing layout :
The CSS layout primitives are inadequate because they do not allow elements to be positioned relative to each other , only relative to their containers .
The way CSS layout is rendered results in unavoidable interactions between the style sheets and the underlying content .
So even when CSS is used exactly as intended , it is not possible to separate content from layout .
These points are best illustrated by means of example .
Here 's a typical CSS layout :
Top Left Right Center
One of the problems with criticising CSS is that it 's very hard to write good CSS , so pointing out problems with CSS begs the question of whether this is an indictment of CSS or one 's coding ability .
The problem is particularly pernicious for layout .
( One indication of this is how many CSS layout tutorials there are on the web . )
The code for the example I 'm using here was taken almost verbatim from MaxDesign 's CSS tutorials , so this was written by someone who actualy knows what they are doing .
If this code is n't written properly that to me would be in and of itself evidence that CSS is broken , because if the MaxDesign folks can't figure it out there is little hope for the rest of us .
In order to understand the argument I 'm about to make we have to look at the code that generated the rendering above .
The CSS is here .
Here 's the HTML :
< div id =" container " > < div id =" top " >
Top </div > < div id =" leftnav " >
Left </div > < div id =" rightnav " >
Right </div > < div id =" content " >
< h1 > Center </h1 > </div > < div id =" footer " >
Bottom </div > </div >
Pretty straightforward .
This is CSS at its best .
But you will notice one odd thing about this code and how it relates to what you see on the screen .
On the screen the natural order of flow for the five major layout elements is : top , left , center , right , bottom .
But the actual order in which they appear in the code has " right " and " center " reversed .
Is this a mistake ?
To find out , let 's see what happens if we change them around so that the order in the code matches the presentation order :
Top Left Center Right
Youch !
That looks terrible !
Apparently the order matters .
The reason that the order matters is that this layout , like all multi-column CSS layouts , is achieved with floats , and the way that floats get rendered depends on the order in which they appear .
So we have not managed to separate content from presentation .
How things appear on the screen still depends on the order in which they appear in the content .
Worse , in order to be rendered properly , the order in which elements must appear is different from their natural flow in the layout .
It gets worse .
Let 's go back to our original content , the one that layed out properly , and try to make a small change to the appearance : suppose we want the left column to have a background color .
This is the sort of thing that CSS is made for .
It should be trivial .
All we have to do is to add " background - color : blue ; " to the style sheet for the leftnav style .
Let 's see what happens if we try this :
Top Left Right Center
Hm , maybe not quite what one would have expected .
( BTW , if you actually look at the CSS you will notice that I 've actually been kind by tweaking the width of the leftnav div so that the color does n't leak over into the center div , which is what it would have done if I 'd just made the small incremental change .
So the real situation is generally even worse than what I 'm showing here . )
And it gets even worse than that .
If the content of the leftnav gets too long then you really lose :
Top Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetuer adipiscing elit , sed diam nonummy Right Center
Top Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Right Center
Likewise if it gets too wide :
Of course , all of these things can be fixed .
But the point is they have to be fixed !
The correct CSS is inextricably bound to the content .
Smarter people than me have tied themselves into knots trying to figure out how to make a three - column CSS layout that does n't have these problems .
To my knowledge , no one has succeeded .
It may be possible .
I do n't have a mathematical proof that it 's not .
But it sure ai n't easy .
By way of contrast , doing the same thing with a table is borderline trivial :
< table > < tr >< td colspan=3 >
Top</td></tr> < tr> < td> Left</td> < td> < h1 > Center</h1 > </td > < td> Right</td> </tr > < tr >< td colspan=3 > Bottom</td></tr> </table >
If you compare the structure of this code to the CSS example above you will see that they are very similar indeed .
In fact , about the only difference is that in the table example , the elements all appear in their natural order .
Of course , a naked HTML table looks like crap :
Top Left Center Right Bottom
but we can still add CSS to make it look decent .
This is the result of adding just five lines of CSS :
Top Left Center Right Bottom
In case you 're curious , here 's the CSS :
table.demo1 { width : 480 px ; margin : auto ; border - collapse : collapse ; } table .
dem o1 td { text - align : center ; border : solid 1 px gray ; padding : 10 px ; } table .
demo1 td.shaded { background - color : #ddd ; } table .
demo1 td.center { width : 80 % ; } table .
demo1 td.left { background - color : #cce ; }
It looks exactly the same as the pure - CSS version .
But now , when the center content grows , the left column grows with it :
Top Left Center Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipiscing elit .
Ut sodales , augue sed ornare adipiscing , orci dolor blandit ligula , id mattis ipsum ante eget velit .
Phasellus pretium commodo est .
Donec scelerisque lectus vel justo .
Vivamus lorem lorem , congue a , tincidunt in , convallis eget , nunc .
Proin interdum .
Etiam vel nunc .
Cras pharetra auctor sem .
Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae ; Morbi nisi magna , malesuada et , feugiat interdum , lacinia non , urna .
Sed dictum hendrerit eros .
Praesent tempus , sem adipiscing tincidunt vulputate , nunc arcu sodales mauris , et tincidunt quam leo eget neque .
Right Bottom
Even if the left column content gets out of control , it still looks reasonable :
Top Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ,
consectetuer adipiscing elit ,
sed diam nonummy
Center Right Bottom
Top SupercalifragilisticexpialidociousSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious Center Right Bottom
The reason this was so easy is that tables have the correct semantics for doing layout .
CSS does n't .
When you do layout you want to be have things adjust their sizes and positions based on not only their containers but also on their siblings .
When the leftnav content grows you want the center div to grow to compensate , and vice versa .
Table cells do this naturally .
CSS DIVs do it only under extreme duress , and only by making assumptions about ( and thus becoming tightly bound to ) their underlying content , which undermines the whole point of CSS .
And that is why , while CSS should be used for styling , tables should be used for layout .

Hi !
I am really happy to finally let the internets know the official launch date for Flower .
Hooray for releasing games ( It ’s really my favorite part ) !
Flower is a tough game to describe .
We like to think of it as a video game version of a poem ; an exploration into the tension between urban bustle and natural serenity .
Players accumulate flower petals as the onscreen world swings between the pastoral and the chaotic .
But even at E3 this year , a lot of the responses in the press were “ it ’s tough to describe … you just have to play it . ”
Because it ’s not fair to only ask game journalists to try and describe such a different game , I ’ve also asked all the people here at TGC to describe .
To keep things even , they could only use 10 words – we ’ve had more time to think about the game :
Nick Clark ( Game Designer ) :
A windy journey that lets you flOw in 3D .
Martin Middleton ( programmer extraordinaire ) :
We hope you enjoy our flowers .
Matt Nava :
Flower ’s simple concept conceals grander themes that will provoke thought .
Jenova Chen :
An interactive poem exploring the tension between urban & nature .
John ( Lead Programmer ) [ John broke the rule , but earns points for style here ] :
Flower , shower , power tower ,
First class , string bass , grass en masse ,
Sun , fun , nearly done ,
Petal , metal , lightning gun ?
Once the game is out , maybe I can get you all to submit your 10 - word descriptions of the game , and we can see what comes out of it .
( Yes , yes , snarky commenter , we know what you ’re about to submit . )
… I like to think that if we could have expressed it in words , we would n’t have made a game about it in the first place .
In honor of the announcement , we ’ve got some gameplay footage for you below .

Corporate fraud run amok : FBI investigating over 500 cases The Associated Press
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This By DEVLIN BARRETT
WASHINGTON 
The FBI is conducting more than 500 investigations of corporate fraud amid the financial meltdown , FBI Deputy Director John Pistole told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday , and there is an even bigger mountain of mortgage fraud cases in which hundreds of millions of dollars may have been swindled from the system .
Pistole says there are 530 active corporate fraud investigations , and 38 of them involve corporate fraud and financial institution matters directly related to the economic crisis .
Additionally , the FBI has more than 1,800 mortgage fraud investigations , more than double the number of such cases just two years ago .
There are so many mortgage fraud cases , he said , that the bureau is not focusing on individual purchasers , but industry professionals generating fraud schemes that could total as much as hundreds of millions of dollars .
" It is a matter of lawyers , brokers or real estate professionals that are systematically trying to defraud the system , " Pistole said .
Agents have even seen some instances of organized crime getting involved in mortgage fraud , he said .
Also appearing before the committee was Neil Barofsky , the watchdog of the government 's $ 700 billion Wall Street rescue package passed last year .
Senate Democrats are urging more spending to expand the ranks of the FBI 's financial fraud investigators .
After the 2001 terror attacks , about 2,000 FBI agents were moved to counterterrorism work , and Pistole said they are moving some of them back to buttress anti-fraud efforts .
Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , urged the FBI and the Justice Department to put people who have committed mortgage fraud behind bars .
" Most people are honest , " Leahy said .
" The ones who are not honest in this field are creating economic havoc and I want to make sure that we 're able to go after them .
" I want to see people prosecuted ...
Frankly , I want to see them go to jail , " he said .
Barofsky , who was appointed the inspector general of the ongoing financial bailout plan , suggested the best way to clean up mortgage fraud is to pursue licensed professionals in the industry , and make examples of them .
" They have the most to lose , they 're the most likely to flip , and they make the best examples , " said Barofsky , a former federal prosecutor in New York .
She was provided with a personal trainer from age 7 .
She was obsessed with being the best , always afraid someone was working harder than she was .
Her skills seemed to be exceeded only by her maniacal work ethic .
Elena Delle Donne towered over the competition .
The 6 - foot - 4 guard from Wilmington , Del. , could handle the ball as easily as the expectations .
She could shoot like Bird .
She was on the fast track to greatness until her heart began steering her in a different direction .
" About age 13 , I thought , ' I do n't know if I want to do this anymore , ' " Delle Donne says .
" ' It 's not fun . ' "
But fun was never the objective .
Delle Donne was the consensus 2008 Naismith National High School Basketball Player of the Year .
She saw herself as the future of women 's basketball .
So did most everyone around her .
She was supposed to follow her idol , Diana Taurasi , to Connecticut , win four national titles and become a superstar in the WNBA .
" I kinda was driving myself to be happy , and I was like , ' Well , you better like this ! ' "
Delle Donne says .
" ' Because this is what it 's gonna be . '
And I was trying to force happiness upon myself , which I could n't find in the sport . "
Delle Donne was a Connecticut Husky for all of 48 hours .
She says it took her only that long to realize she lacked the passion to play the sport at the highest level .
She says she could no longer pretend .
Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma does n't pretend to understand why the top recruit in America left his school in the middle of the night in June .
" I do n't know how you can play that much basketball and be that good at it and say , ' I hate it since the time I was 13 . '
To me , those two things do n't go together that you would be that good at something and not enjoy any of it .
It 's hard for me to come to grips with , " Auriemma says .
Elena Delle Donne , a McDonald 's All - American , walked away from basketball and decided instead to play volleyball at Delaware .

" I 'm still not able to see how that makes any sense .
I did n't understand it and have n't understood it right from the beginning . "
Auriemma is not pining for Delle Donne .
His No. 1 - ranked Huskies are unbeaten and virtually unchallenged , winning their games by an average of nearly 40 points .
But he says he has never coached a player who left his program because she lost her passion for the game .
" Nope , " Auriemma says .
" Not anybody that was any good -- let 's put it that way .
Never experienced anything like that from somebody who is really talented and successful .
" How could [ you ] get to be the best if you do n't have some passion for it ? " he asks .
" It would 've come out a long time before .
A lot of kids probably do n't like playing piano , but I do n't know that you become the best if you do n't like it at all .
At some point , you would screw it up on purpose , would n't you ? "
Delle Donne does not expect Auriemma to understand .
She was n't sure anyone would .
Perhaps that 's why it took her so long , about five years , to come clean .
Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma says fans might never know why Delle Donne quit basketball .

" You ca n't understand it unless you 're in my shoes , " Delle Donne says .
" And that 's the thing :
You do n't understand burnout unless you 've been burned out .
And it 's something you can't even explain .
It 's just doing something you have absolutely no passion for . "
When coaches would ask the teenage Delle Donne whether she was feeling drained by a sport she played 12 months of the year , she would tell them burnout was not in her vocabulary .
" It 's hard to explain , and people are like , ' How are you doing this ? '
Like , ' Look at your future , do you not see it ? ' " she says .
" And I 'm like , ' I do see what I could have been . '
And it 's harder for me than it is for anyone else because I see these God - given abilities that I 've been blessed with and I can't go forth with them . "
When Auriemma released Delle Donne from her scholarship , she transferred to the University of Delaware , 20 minutes from her home .
She plays volleyball in front of crowds of fewer than 500 fans instead of the 10,000 raucous rooters who fill the Huskies ' Gampel Pavilion for women 's hoops games .
She no longer plays basketball .
She recently was named to the Colonial Athletic Association All - Rookie Team for her new sport .
" Now that I play volleyball , I know how it feels to have a passion for your sport , " she says .
" Before , I just thought , ' Maybe everyone 's faking it because this is horrible . ' "
Delle Donne says she was burned out on basketball years ago .
She feels passion for volleyball now .

Delle Donne , who turned 19 on Sept. 5 , says she 's too young to rule out a return to basketball .
Yet she says she has not picked up a ball in months and has no interest in watching the game on television unless her friends are playing .
" I 'd rather be a face for happiness and doing things that you have a passion for , rather than faking it and pretending like I 'm this face of women 's basketball when I can't stand the sport at all , " she says .
Auriemma says we might never know why Delle Donne pushed basketball aside .
Or why she chose to leave the stage at the moment an entire nation finally would get to see her shine .
" I ca n't imagine Elena Delle Donne did n't love playing basketball , " he says .
" I can imagine she may not have loved the stuff that came along with it .
That , ' I got to be Elena Delle Donne , ' or , ' I 've got to play at a certain level . '
Maybe that makes more sense than , ' I hated the game since I was 13 . '
There 's something missing , he says like a detective still searching for leads .
" There 's something not quite out there yet , " he says .
" There 's a lot of things that do n't fit together . "

The same type of plane that crashed into a home in Buffalo this week has been cited in numerous incidents in the past and was consequently removed from one airline ’s fleet .
The plane , a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 74 - seat turboprop , went down in New York late Thursday night .
All 49 passengers — including Beverly Eckert , a woman widowed by 9/11 — died .
Bombardier Q400 : Past Problems
The Bombardier Q400 series of planes has been involved in 13 previous incidents , Bloomberg reports , none of which resulted in deaths .
The majority happened during landing , and many centered around landing gear issues .
The parent company of Scandinavian Airlines , as such , grounded its entire fleet of Q400s in 2007 .
The airline stopped using the planes altogether soon thereafter .
Scandinavian said landing gear malfunctions had caused three crashes within a timespan of six weeks .
“ Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably , and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying in this type of aircraft , ” the airline ’s president and CEO said in a statement issued in October of 2007 .
“ Accordingly , with the board of directors ’ approval , I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service . ”
Bombardier responded by saying it was “ disappointed ” with the decision , and that it “ [ stood ] behind the Q400 aircraft . ”
About Buffalo ’s Bombardier Dash 8 Q400
The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 involved in Thursday ’s crash , registration number N200WQ , was built in 2008 .
It had been in the hands of Colgan Air — which operated Continental flight 3407 on behalf of Continental Airlines — since April of last year .
Bombardier released the following statement Friday regarding the crash :
“ Bombardier confirms a Dash 8 Q400 aircraft was involved in an accident near Buffalo , New York on February 12 .
We extend our sympathies to the families of those who perished in this accident .
Bombardier has dispatched a product safety and technical team to the site to assist the National Transportation Safety Board with their investigation .
Until such time as the investigators release any information or findings , Bombardier cannot comment further or speculate on the cause of this accident . ”

Advertisement Egyptian police are questioning three suspects over the bombing of a Cairo market that killed one person and injured 20 others , officials say .
They were detained near the market shortly after the blast , police said .
It happened at an open - air hotel cafe packed with tourists in the Khan al - Khalili area - a major attraction and home to a prominent mosque .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has expressed " deep sorrow " at the death of a French teenager in the blast .
Police said they thought the device had been thrown from a balcony .
It is not yet known who was responsible .
There have been conflicting reports the bomb , which is believed to have been home - made , may have been left under a bench .
' So powerful ' " Three people there were arrested on the site as suspects after the attack , " AFP quoted a police official as saying on Monday .
" Others are being questioned as witnesses . "
The blast was so powerful that the earth shook underneath us
Witness
Carnage at Cairo bazaar
' It felt like a war zone '
Those injured in the blast included more than a dozen French nationals , four Germans and three Egyptians , according to police .
Six are thought to be in a serious condition .
The French foreign ministry confirmed the death of one of its citizens , a 17 - year - old girl .
" The victim was 17 years old and had travelled with a group of young people from Levallois , " foreign ministry spokesman Eric Chevallier was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying .
Levallois - Perret is a suburb of Paris .
Many of the injured were among the group of 54 teenagers from Paris , AFP reported .
Mr Sarkozy gave his condolences to the family of the victim , and expressed his " deep sorrow " over the attack .
The early evening explosion happened near the Hussein mosque and a well - known bazaar , in what is a historic area .
This is a very crowded area with tiny streets , which is why even a small blast would appear to have had such a devastating effect , the BBC's Christian Fraser in Cairo says .
It is thought the bomb was thrown from an upper floor of the hotel , our correspondent says .
But news agencies have also quoted a report from the Egyptian state news service Mena , which said the bomb had exploded under a bench .
Montasser el - Zayat , a lawyer who defended Islamic extremists , told Arabic news channel al - Jazeera the attack might be linked to anger over the recent Israeli offensive in Gaza .
" The nature of the explosion looks like an act carried out by young , inexperienced amateurs whose emotions were inflamed by the events of Gaza , " Mr el - Zayat was quoted by the Associated Press as saying .
The area was sealed off as bomb disposal experts were sent in to defuse a second device which failed to explode .
' Plenty of enemies '
" The blast was so powerful that the earth shook underneath us , " an eyewitness told Egypt 's Nile News TV.
EGYPT ATTACKS April 2006 : Bombs at Dahab , on the Red Sea , kill at least 23 April 2005 : Bombing at Khan al - Khalili kills three people , including Frenchman and American July 2005 :
At least 88 people die in bomb attacks in Sharm el - Sheikh , on the Red Sea March 2005 : Hungarian couple stabbed while kissing near Khan al - Khalili Oct 2004 : Bombs at Red Sea resorts of Taba and Nuweiba kill at least 34 people 1997 : Gunmen fire on tourists in Cairo and in Luxor , killing 68 " We all lay down on the ground .
Blood was streaming from the back of one of the people running away from the blast .
I even saw a separated hand and an arm .
Just shredded human flesh , " the witness said .
No cars are allowed into the area but motorbikes can get around the barriers , our correspondent says .
The Khan al - Khalili area was targeted in 2005 , when three people - including an American and a French tourist - were killed in a blast .
Sunday 's explosion will be of huge concern to Egypt 's security services , our correspondent says .
These are tense times for the Egyptian government , he adds , which has been criticised for its stance over the recent conflict in Gaza and has many enemies .
Are you in Cairo ?

Meet the new Britain : just like the old one where green protesters are spied on
It does n't happen often , but very occasionally something I write seems to make a difference - if only at the margins .
Just before Christmas , I wrote a column showing how peaceful environmental protesters had been tarred by the police as dangerous subversives .
A group of villagers campaigning against an attempt to turn their local lake into a dump for fly ash from Didcot power station had found their names on a list of " domestic extremists " .
As well as defaming them , the website of the National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit ( Netcu ) also carried images of people marching with banners , of peace campaigners standing outside a military base and of the Rebel Clown Army ( whose members dress up as clowns to show they have peaceful intentions ) and published press releases about Greenpeace and the climate camp at Kingsnorth .
All this , it suggested , is domestic extremism .
On the day my column was published , Netcu took its site down .
Now a skeleton site has been restored , without the misleading material : it no longer makes an association between peaceful protest and domestic extremism .
So credit where it 's due : Netcu took no time at all to recognise that it was doing a disservice to democracy .
No sooner is one battle won than another begins .
Last night , I was sent an email linking to this story about a new police body , the Confidential Intelligence Unit , which has been set up to tackle domestic extremists .
If the Mail on Sunday is to be believed – always a big if – the new unit does exactly what NETCU was doing until Christmas : conflating peaceful protest with violent extremism .
Among its targets , apparently , are " environmental groups involved in direct action such as Plane Stupid " .
The paper reports that :
The CIU 's role will be similar to the ' counter subversion ' functions formerly carried out by MI5 .
The so - called " reds under the bed " operations focused on trade unionists and peace campaigners
There 's progress for you : if the report is true , the new unit appears to be taking us back to the days when the security forces played a blatantly partisan role in seeking to destroy progressive politics .
Like Netcu , the CIU is answerable to the Association of Chief Police Officers .
So why is it running two units with the same function ?
Perhaps we 'll never know : the CIU 's work will be covered by public interest immunity certificates and wo n't be susceptable to freedom of information requests .
Meet the new Britain : just like the old one , except that this time the Labour government – previously a target of MI5 's subversive activities - is also waging war on progressive politics .

Most tattoo of the world !!!
The ultimate in multi-layered tattooing is represented by the chainsaw
juggling , unicycling , sword - swallowing Lucky Diamond Rich
( Australia , born New Zealand ) , who has spent over 1,000 hours having
his body modified by hundreds of tattoo artists .
He began by having a
full collection of colourful designs from around the world tattooed over
his entire body .
But not content with stopping there , Lucky next opted
for a 100 % covering of black ink , including eyelids , the delicate
skin between the toes , down into the ears , and even his gums .
He is now
being tattooed with white designs on top of the black , and coloured
designs on top of the white !
Sidna grew up in a poor neighborhood of Nouakchott called Toujanine .
When I went there one evening in December , I found kids playing soccer at dusk in a wide dirt road .
Goats rummaged through trash that filled a ditch about five feet from the front door of Sidna ’s home .
According to friends , neighbors and relatives , Sidna had a reputation as a scrappy kid .
“ Sidi was n’t a thief , because thieves rob you and run , ” one childhood friend told me .
“ Sidi took your watch or your T - shirt right in front of you . ”
By his midteens , Sidna was smoking hashish , drinking wine and hanging out with an older crowd .
He liked to dance and earned the nickname Lambada .
Besides robbing people , he also stole cars .
Friends and law - enforcement authorities claim that he was involved in multiple rapes .
But his conscience apparently caught up with him by his late teens .
He joined a friend at a mahadra — an Islamic seminary — outside Nouakchott .
He spent several months there and , like many restless young men in the region , grew fond of listening to jihadist audio recordings , particularly those of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the leader of Iraq ’s Al Qaeda franchise , that circulated around the mahadra .
“ Why Zarqawi ? ” I asked the friend who took Sidna to the mahadra .
“ What made his sermons appealing ? ”
“ Everyone in the Muslim world wants to see American tanks blown up and their troops killed , ” he said .
“ But bin Laden and Zarqawi were the only ones actually doing it .
Sidna admired them for that . ”
Sidna returned home to Toujanine a changed , yet no mellower , person .
As part of his Zarqawi - fueled indoctrination , he adopted the ideology of takfir , or excommunication , which some extremists use to justify violence against nonbelievers .
He began converting some of his fellow gang members into militant Salafists .
Sidna ordered his sisters to cover their heads , patrolled the neighborhood for unmarried couples walking together and spent long hours arguing with his father , a Sufi , during which times he called him an infidel .
He told his younger brother that he wanted to wage jihad against the Americans .
Then Sidna headed off to a training camp .
In the spring of 2006 , Sidna traveled to a camp in northern Mali run by the G.S.P.C. , the notorious Algerian - Salafi group .
He prayed that those running the camp would send him to Iraq to fight against Americans .
The invasion of Afghanistan , followed by the one in Iraq , attracted young men from all over North Africa eager to wage jihad against the United States .
Fernando Reinares , the director of a program on global terrorism at Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid , says G.S.P.C. camps served as one of the main conduits of foreign fighters into Iraq .
“ They recruited individuals at the local level , trained them and then sent them to Iraq , ” he said .
European police reported a growing number of G.S.P.C. cells in major cities .
In 2002 , authorities in Italy claimed to have disrupted a G.S.P.C. plot in Bologna to bomb the Basilica of San Petronio , which has a 15th - century fresco of the Prophet Muhammad being tormented by demons in hell .
Sidna was disappointed when he reached the camp .
The G.S.P.C. was in the midst of an overhaul .
He found that the group was no longer looking for able - bodied young men to dispatch to Iraq , in part because of American pressure on North African leaders to clamp down on the migration of jihadists to Iraq .
But it was also by choice .
Now the G.S.P.C. had a new mission , to recruit non-Algerian militants to spread jihad south of Algeria .
Sidna fit into the group ’s plans perfectly .
The G.S.P.C. ’s finances could n’t keep pace with its ambitions , however .
So G.S.P.C. leaders reached out to Zarqawi , who , until he was killed by American forces in Iraq in June 2006 , enjoyed not only name recognition but also a seemingly endless pile of money .
With Zarqawi as matchmaker , the G.S.P.C. courted Al Qaeda itself .
After lengthy negotiations , bin Laden ’s deputy , the Egyptian doctor Ayman al - Zawahiri , announced the “ blessed union ” between the G.S.P.C. and Al Qaeda on Sept. 11 , 2006 .
He declared that the merger would be “ a bone in the throat of American and French crusaders . ”
Months later , the G.S.P.C. proclaimed its new name : Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , or A.Q.I.M .
PHNOM PENH , Feb 17 ( Reuters ) - Survivors of Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge atrocities reacted with pain , anger and relief on Tuesday as they watched Pol Pot 's chief torturer in the dock , 30 years after the fall of a regime blamed for 1.7 million deaths .
Nearly 800 people , including saffron - robed Buddhist monks who were persecuted during the 1975 - 79 Khmer Rouge era , flocked to see the first formal trial of a senior Pol Pot cadre by a U.N. - backed tribunal .
" When I see Duch , my anger comes back , " Phok Khan , 56 , told Reuters during a break in the trial being held on the outskirts of Phnom Penh .
( For a selection of current stories , click on [ ID : nSP313683 ] )
Duch , also known as Kaing Guek Eav , has admitted to atrocities at S - 21 , the former school where up to 14,000 " enemies of the revolution " were tortured before being beaten to death in the Killing Fields outside the capital .
Vann Nath was among a handful who survived .
The 63 - year - old , white - haired artist , who was beaten by S - 21 guards but escaped death due to his talent for painting portraits of Pol Pot , said he had mixed emotions after seeing his former tormentor on trial .
" This is the day we have waited for for 30 years .
But I do n't know if it will end my suffering , " he told reporters during a break in the nationally televised hearing .
Duch sat impassively in the wood - panelled court wearing a blue , long - sleeved shirt and sipping water .
He occasionally donned reading glasses , an ironic twist since the Khmer Rouge targeted those who wore spectacles , seeing that as a mark of the intelligentsia and enemies of the revolution .
Duch , now a born - again Christian , has confessed to his crimes but says he was just following orders .
The French - speaking teacher - turned - torturer did not address the court on Tuesday .
A court guard sat nearby as the frail ex-commandant wore headphones and took notes while the five - judge panel considered procedural motions .
Outside the glass - enclosed trial chamber , hundreds of Cambodians sat in the public gallery , some listening intently on headphones .
A few dozed as Cambodian and international lawyers argued over procedural issues .
HEINOUS ACTS
Them Khean said he had travelled 240 kms ( 150 miles ) from the province of Kompong Thom where Duch and Pol Pot were born .
" I want to see what Duch has to say about his past crimes , " said Khean , 65 , who lost 10 relatives to starvation and torture .
Va Boeurn , 66 , said he wanted to see Duch 's face to try to understand how a human being could commit such heinous acts .
" What does his face look like ?
Why was he so brutal ? " asked Boeurn , who lost seven family members during Pol Pol 's reign of terror , aimed at building an agrarian utopia .
Most Cambodians lost relatives during four years of killings , starvation and overwork before the Vietnamese army ousted Pol Pot in 1979 .
Pol Pot died in 1998 in the last Khmer Rouge stronghold of Anlong Veng on the Thai border .
" Duch is in front of the victims .
That is all that matters today .
It is a moment of importance , " said Pierre Olivier - Sure , a lawyer for 15 victims .

Echoing and expounding upon concerns first raised by Charles Krauthammer , columnist Jeff Jacoby is criticizing President Barack Obama for portraying tension between America and the Muslim world as a recent development triggered by American arrogance :
" Missing is any sense that the United States has long been the target of jihadist fanatics who enjoy widespread support in the Muslim world . "
Krauthammer wrote that Obama thus far has been " needlessly defensive and apologetic " and pointed out that American soldiers have fought and died to save Muslim lives five times in the past 20 years .
Jacoby compares Obama ’s overtures to Jimmy Carter ’s conciliatory posture early in his presidency toward the Soviet Union .
Carter tried to accentuate his belief that America and the USSR shared a desire to live in a " more peaceful , just , and humane world . "
But Soviet tanks stormed into Afghanistan a few years later and Carter had to adopt a harder line .
Jacoby worries that Obama could be following the same path , calling the President describing the President ’s " seeming cluelessness about US - Muslim history " :
" The golden age of American - Muslim relations that Obama harks back to did not exist .
Radical Islam 's hatred of the United States is not a recent phenomenon , it has nothing to do with ' respect , ' and it is n't going to be extinguished by sweet words -- not even those of so sweet a speaker as Obama .
Sooner or later , Barack Obama must confront an implacable reality :
The global jihad , like the Cold War , will only end when our enemies lose their will to fight -- or when we do . "
The Carter analogy is an interesting one .
There ’s nothing wrong with working toward better relations in the Muslim world , Jacoby writes .
Just do it without absolving the party ’s of their contributions to the problem .
A growing group of environmental activists are taking advantage of emergency power shut - off switches found on the exteriors of businesses throughout France ; toting broomsticks , they wander the streets at night to find businesses with neon lights still blazing in the window despite being closed , and simply reach or climb up to switch the power off.[ social_buttons ]
They call themselves Le Clan du Néon and believe they are doing the planet a favor .
Thousands of shops across Europe leave their lights on overnight , just as they do in America , unnecessarily eating up tens of gigawatt hours of power every year .
“ If all the neon signs in the world were turned off , the impact on global warming would be very significant , ” said one member of the group .
“ There ought to be a law against it , but since there is n’t , we have to go around doing it ourselves . ”
In France , about 80 percent of electricity is generated by nuclear plants , so the night - time neon lights increase nuclear waste more than CO2 emissions .
After starting as a student - group in Paris , others have popped up in Normandy , Bordeaux , the Alps and Dordogne .
The group also encourages people in other countries to develop similar renegade tactics to fight global warming .
“ The signs are a waste of electricity and a visual pollution , ” said Michael , another activist .
“ It ’s crazy that when we all need to save energy , these neon signs are left on for 24 hours day . ”

There are entire songs dedicated to it .
The pickiest , finickiest of folks will accept it .
And it can add flair to just about anything you eat .
Peanut butter .
For some people , it ’s a food group all its own .
But warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have people wondering if they should be eating it at all .
The latest news has a Texas connection , with a Plainview peanut processing plant under scrutiny According to the FDA , more than 500 people in the United States have contracted salmonella from products with peanut butter .
The key here , said Dr. Anish Masharani with Texas Children ’s Pediatrics Associates , is “ products . ”
Packaged food with peanut butter added to it should be avoided for now .
“ The only other thing that ’s been found to have issues is the big , institutional - size jars of peanut butter , ” Masharani said .
“ So maybe do n’t order it in a restaurant or cafeteria for now . ”
But peanut butter in the jar at the grocery store is safe , provided you do n’t have allergies — but those are a separate issue .
Full of healthy fats and protein , peanut butter has plenty of benefits , said Emily Banes , clinical dietitcian at Houston Northwest Medical Center .
But do watch portion sizes , Banes said , since two tablespoons pack nearly 200 calories .
Since store - bought peanut butter can have lots of sugar and salt , Banes urges making your own .
With a juicer or food processor , it ’s easy to do .
Kids might complain that it ’s not as sweet as store - bought , but you can sweeten it up by pairing it with jelly , honey or bananas .
Meanwhile , Masharani said incidents of peanut - butter - induced salmonella are on the decline .
But it ’s still wise to have the facts .
First , gastroenteritis is common this time of year , and its symptoms — vomiting and diarrhea — mimic those of salmonella .
“ You ’re not going to test ( for salmonella ) unless the parents say the child definitely had something on the recall list , or if they are likely to have been exposed , ” Masharani said .
“ You have to have common sense . ”
And it ’s important to note that if you or your child has eaten something on the recall list , it does not mean you will get salmonella .
Masharani said it depends on how much salmonella is in that particular batch , and there ’s no easy way to test for that .
For a list of recalled peanut - butter products , go to www.fda.gov and search “ peanut butter ” and / or “ recall , ” , or call 888-463-6332 . kimberlywrites@yahoo.com

“ Like cocaine , Ritalin is a powerful stimulant that increases alertness and productivity .
Ritalin and cocaine also look and act the same .
Both have a similar chemical structure , and both increase dopamine levels in the brain .
They do this by blocking a dopamine transporter protein responsible for the reuptake of dopamine at the synapse . ”
“ Ritalin is not addicting when taken as prescribed by doctors .
Why this difference between Ritalin and cocaine ?
Ritalin is a pill that you swallow , so the drug takes longer to reach the brain .
Cocaine is taken in high doses by injection or snorting .
It floods the brain quickly with dopamine , which makes it dangerous and addicting .
Unfortunately , Ritalin is quickly becoming a drug of choice for teens .
It ’s relatively cheap and accessible .
And because it ’s a prescription drug , it ’s perceived to be safe .
But if Ritalin is abused ( taken in high doses ) or taken improperly ( by injection or snorting ) , it can be just as addicting as cocaine .
This is because drug delivery methods can influence the addictive potential of a drug . ”

Drugs are drugs .
The War on Drugs has been a success .
It has done what was intended : growing the size and scope of the government , militarize local law enforcement and injecting into local law enforcement tendrils of federal influence via funding .
“ Drugs ” is simply the vehicle .
A convenient enemy who has a tangible form but no real constitution .
For the state a handy skeleton key was crafted :
Need to get in someones home ?
–
They have drugs inside
Shot down the wrong plane ?
–
It was carrying drugs
Botched decision making leading to a false arrest ?
–
The person had drugs
Want to intimidate the locals and give a show of force ?
– Random backpack search for drugs
And on and on …
What I find most interesting is that , at least here in America , nearly everyone uses drugs of some form .
Yet most choose to believe in two separate worlds ; the drugs that come from an educated man in a white lab coat are good and drugs from the dropout dude who hangs at the mall are bad .
In truth drugs are neither good or bad , they are simply drugs .
Like guns and knives they carry no taint of judgment they are merely material .
Actions , decisions , intentions are good or bad , positive or negative , creative or destructive .
Really this all comes down to behavior , to decisions people make and the arrogance of humanity to believe that words on paper ought to dictate the choices of all .
And just to point out the complete absurdity of it all in a grander sense .
We continue to believe we can pick the best and wisest of our people when given , usually , 2 choices every couple years .
And these wise folk shall make the laws that govern us and our behavior .
Time and again we are shamed when the one we chose turns to shenanigans instead of service .
We joke with our coworkers about the corruption of government and take another bite of the shit - sandwich as we head to the polls ; believing that this time will be different .
The crew in Washington have all the trappings of the worst “ drug dealers ” .
Lying , cheating , stealing and starting wars with rival gangs , there is no telling what horrible secrets have been buried and the number of people that have been buried with them .
In the end I am reminded about the latest anti-drug commercial :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nB05mTwPHY
“ When you give up the ability to decide for yourself .
You give up what makes you , you . ”
The shear hypocrisy is astounding .
It should read :
“ When you give up the ability to decide for yourself .
You give up what makes you , you .
Only give this ability up to the state or a state appointed agent . ”
Four months before the invasion of Afghanistan , six Special - Ops soldiers and one embedded reporter are faced with an enemy that none of them could ever have imagined .
While on the mission they find themselves lost in a Middle Eastern ‘ Bermuda Triangle ’ of ancient evil .
Thanks to UGO and Spike , we now have the final poster and trailers for the upcoming ( The Blair Witch Projects ) latest horror project , “ . ” Without spoiling anything , here ’s the gist :
On the hunt for a contact who will direct him toward some “ WMDs , ” CIA agent Ben Keynes has returned to Afghanistain after a ten - year absence , and it ’s there that he takes charge of a gung - ho , no - nonsense , bad - ass military unit .
Keynes has a very shady assignment , but his new charges are on a need - to - know basis … and suffice it to say that the CIA guy ’s secret assignment is , well , it ’s pretty frickin’ weird …
[ Cinematical
The Objective fails to deliver on many levels , but the most obvious indication of failure is the film ’s reliance on the Blair Witch formula .
Send a group of hapless individuals into the great unknown , slowly building suspense by subjecting them to increasingly bizarre and unexplained incidents .
Throw in some spooky , iconic imagery – those triangles are remarkably similar to the earlier film ’s stick figures – and root the eventual explanation of it all in real - world myth .
Only this time , the writing is more structured , the performances more directed , and the overall experience suffers as a result …

The US rapper 's lawsuit could set a precedent for artists distributing their music through digital downloads
Eminem 's lawsuit against his label finally went to trial this week after two years , in a case worth hundreds of millions of pounds to artists worldwide .
Eminem 's publishing company , FBT Productions , is suing Universal Music Group for $ 1.6 m ( £ 800,000 ) in alleged unpaid royalties .
But what 's at stake is not just an unpaid bill – it's the definition of digital royalties .
When a song or ringtone is bought online , at the iTunes Music Store or anywhere else , the artist receives a royalty .
The amount of this royalty is governed by a contract between labels and artists .
For many artists , however , that digital royalty is not explicitly stated – millions of contracts , after all , predate iTunes and did not anticipate the boom in digital music sales .
Eminem 's lawyers argue that downloads should fall under the " licensing " agreements that cover physical releases such as CDs and vinyl records , but Universal Music Group says they are governed by " distribution " arrangements , which have lower royalty rates .
Whereas an artist might split licensing royalties 50 - 50 with their label , under distribution rates they often earn less than 30 % .
" If you give the music to a third party without cost to you , like manufacturing or packaging , that 's the same as a licensing agreement , " a member of Eminem 's legal team explained to The Wrap magazine .
" [ Universal ] are characterising it as something else . "
FBT Productions 's court papers cite numerous instances of the words " licence " and " licensing " in comments by Universal executives and their digital distribution partners .
" Steve Jobs ... discussed his company 's relationship with UMG as that of a ' license ' in an essay titled ' Thoughts on Music ' dated February 6 , 2007 , " the papers read .
" Although he consistently referred to Apple ' licensing ' music from ' the big four music companies ' , when deposed in this case he claimed not to know whether his company 's relationship with Universal was , in fact , a licence . "
The trial is the first major legal test for these issues and the witness list is appropriately star - studded .
Although Eminem will not likely attend , UMG founder Jimmy Iovine will probably take the stand and Steve Jobs , CEO at Apple Computers , is scheduled to testify by video .
Relapse , Eminem 's first album in five years , is expected early this year .
So , poking around idly on Google this morning , I came across the interesting fact that there is , in fact , a native Linux driver for Intel GMA 500 - Poulsbo - graphics on Linux .
Do n't get excited , though .
It 's not like it 's actually any use .
That was the summary .
Here 's the gory details ...
As I wrote in my previous post , the GMA 500 is not really a follow up to all the previous Intel chips .
It 's a bit of Intel 's platform with a PowerVR ( those of you who 've been breaking crap as long as I have may remember PowerVR as an early contender to 3DFX and NVIDIA ; they 've since scurried off into niche markets ) chip slapped on top of it .
So it 's basically a whole new architecture that needs a whole new driver .
Aside from the Vaio P and a couple of other systems , there 's one significant machine with the GMA 500 chip in it : the Dell Mini 12 .
Why 's it significant ?
Because Dell ship it with Ubuntu .
So , yes , there 's a native driver .
Intel , Dell or some combination of the two contracted out to Tungsten Graphics to write a driver for it .
This is presumably because Tungsten have been supporting PowerVR chips for a long time , so they know their way around the hardware .
So , the driver was written , and included in the special - sauce version of Ubuntu that Dell uses , and also in Ubuntu Netbook Remix .
It was even developed under the auspices of the Moblin project at first , and you can find the code in Moblin git - X.org driver , kernel module .
Where it has n't been touched for eight months .
This is the first clue that all is not well .
Up to that point it all looks fairly straightforward , but after that it rapidly goes to the dogs .
Trying to get the thing to work on a modern distribution , the first thing you notice is that it 's messy code .
The kernel driver consists of a copy of about half of drm , with all sorts of stuff included and built that does n't really need to be .
And it 's not remotely in sync with current drm .
All it really ought to be is a few files which should have rapidly been merged into Mesa upstream .
There 's even a comment in the code that shows the authors are aware of this , saying that one fairly trivial change should be done before the code is contributed upstream .
But the change has n't been done to any Tungsten- , Dell - , Intel - or Ubuntu - sourced version of the code I can find , so it 's still a mess languishing in its own repository .
The second thing you notice is it does n't build with any kernel post - 2.6.24 , due to that issue and a couple of others .
The third thing you notice , if you 're lucky , is that it 's not even really the latest version of the code , and this is where things get really odd .
As I mentioned , the copies of both the X driver and kernel module in moblin.org git have not been touched for eight months .
However , squirrelled away in dank corners of the Ubuntu empire , you 'll find rather later versions of the code .
It has eventually been figured out that the latest version of the X driver code is this one , if you combine the ' upstream ' tarball ( which is not , in fact , available anywhere ' upstream ' that anyone I know of can find ) and Ubuntu patch in that directory .
The latest version of the kernel module code is stuffed in Ubuntu 's Miscellaneous Kernel Modules tarball - this one .
The further you dive down the rabbit hole , the odder things get .
The X driver seems to depend on a proprietary firmware file , called msvdx_fw.bin , for ... something .
Apparently it 's needed for 3D acceleration and video playback acceleration to work .
You can download this file from a post in an extensive and frequently messy and / or downright ill - informed Ubuntu forum thread on the topic .
And , as far as I can tell , nowhere else .
It also seems to depend on a supplementary X driver , Xpsb , for the same things - without both the firmware and Xpsb , 2D video playback acceleration and 3D acceleration do n't work .
I do n't know where the heck you find that .
The source trees definitely do n't build it .
Some of this is documented - in passing , seemingly more as an example case than anything else - here .
A page that 's just sort of lying in the Ubuntu Wiki .
Again , I only found it through the giant forum thread .
The associated Launchpad project is listed as ' Approved ' , since May 2007 , but ' Not started ' .
With no other information .
So , anyway .
I picked my way through this bizarre minefield and then tried to get the fricking thing to work .
First I hacked up a patch for the kernel module myself to make it build , not really knowing what I was doing .
But it seems to more or less work .
When it loads , it gives me a native resolution framebuffer .
Out of interest , trying to start X with the fbdev driver at this point gets started and shows the grey dithered " X is starting up now " screen , but then hangs the system with caps lock and scroll lock lights flashing .
Interesting result , but not what I was really looking at anyway .
Later on , while trying in vain to find some combination that would work , I found that Olivier Blin of Mandriva has been poking at this stuff , as he has a cleaner patch to make it build against 2.6.27 in his personal scratch directory : here .
So I tried building with that patch instead of my own hack .
They seem to work about the same .
Then I poked about at the X driver .
It expects to build against various headers from the version of drm in the kernel module source , not the system copies ( or at least not the system copies on Fedora 10 ) .
It also expects a particular xf86 mm.h , which I pulled out of the relevant Ubuntu libdrm - dev package - so already having to hack stuff up here .
With that and a few other minor tweaks , I got it to build .
But ... yeah , it does n't work .
With the newer version of the X driver from Ubuntu , it fails with a " could not mmap framebuffer ( invalid argument ) " error , almost immediately on trying to start X . With the older version from Moblin git , it just freezes on X startup .
The system 's still running - I can power it off clean with the power button , it shuts down properly - but X does n't start and I can't see a console either .
There 's just a text cursor frozen at the top left of the screen .
The last lines in Xorg.0.log are :
( II ) Primary Device is : PCI 00@00:02:0 ( WW ) Falling back to old probe method for psb ( II ) Debug : psbProbe
Okay , so after a whole day spent bashing around at this crap , I can very confidently and conclusively say , it 's utterly broken .
By the looks of it , you can get it up and running , with a bit of futzing around , either by running Ubuntu Netbook Remix or running Ubuntu Hardy and forcing the Netbook Remix packages onto it - see the forum thread for details on that .
But with any modern distro , it just does n't look like it 's going to work .
This is really silly , because the code is obviously 99 % basically there and working .
It just needs the people who actually know the code and the hardware to put it in the right places and not random obscure undocumented repositories , submit it upstream , and keep it up to date .
But because , for whatever reason , the Intel , Tungsten , Dell and Ubuntu folks can't get their fingers out of their asses and actually provide the code in a sensible , sane and open way , few people even know it exists , no - one 's seemingly working to keep it going with newer kernels , X.org and libdrm , and no - one has a freaking clue how to use it .
And every Linux user with this chipset is getting screwed .
It 's not good enough , guys .
Just get together , fix the freaking code , and get it in the kernel and X.org so distributions can make it just work and everyone will be happy .
Thanks .

During a time of controversy , the best way to win over public opinion is to convince the public that there is no controversy .
Sometimes , when an issue is too complicated for the general public to make an informed decision on their own , they rely on the opinions of experts , and politicians stop debating the points of the issue , and start debating the consensus .
That ’s a consensus war .
It ’s happening with the global warming issue , and it ’s happening with the economy .
A reasoned , logical debate of the finer points of the fiscal policy wo n’t convince the average American .
The only way to win the hearts and minds of the American people is to tell them the experts opinion .
Recently , Obama attempted to shut down the controversy surrounding his so - called “ stimulus ” package by saying “ there is no disagreement that we need action by our government , a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy . ”
Then later saying “ economists from across the political spectrum agree ” on the need for this massive government spending package .
Of course , that is not the case .
In actuality , many , if not most , economists disagree with the stimulus package .
So in response , the Cato Institute took out a full page ad in the Washington Post , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune , Washington Times , and Roll Call disputing the president ’s claim .
Hundreds of top economists , including Nobel laureates and prominent scholars from major universities , signed the statement .
There were more than 200 economists signatures on the original ad , and over 100 more have signed on since then .
Read on to see the original ad :
the original , full - page Cato ad can be found here in pdf form
Text from the ad :
“ There is no disagreement that we need action by our government , a recovery plan that will help to jumpstart the economy . ”
— PRESIDENT -ELECT BARACK OBAMA , JANUARY 9 , 2009
With all due respect Mr. President , that is not true .
Notwithstanding reports that all economists are now Keynesians and that we all support a big increase in the burden of government , we do not believe that more government spending is a way to improve economic performance .
More government spending by Hoover and Roosevelt did not pull the United States economy out of the Great Depression in the 1930s .
More government spending did not solve Japan ’s “ lost decade ” in the 1990s .
As such , it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the U.S. today .
To improve the economy , policy makers should focus on reforms that remove impediments to work , saving , investment and production .
Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth . ”
Brookeland is a town of about 1,800 , just north of Jasper .
So it 's small enough that when a teacher claims to have been railroaded out of a job because he's an atheist and an Obama - supporter , it does n't take long for the rumors , trash - talk , wild accusations , and just plain weirdness to fly .
Richard Mullens has taught at Brookeland High for the past six years of his 37 - year teaching career .
According to the principal , he 's never had any complaints filed against him .
But in January , Mullens sent a statement to various media accusing a handful of small - minded parents of conspiring with school - board members to kick out a teacher they felt was a bad influence on the kids .
Mullens wrote that one of his students left the classroom one day and complained to the principal that Mullens was condoning ( or taking part in ) an " inappropriate " discussion .
Eventually , Mullens wrote , he met with the principal , as well as the girl 's mother , Tammy Lowe .
" Lowe accused me of being an atheist , saying I was too liberal , and that I allowed the students to talk about inappropriate things in the classroom .
I told her that occasionally students would get on topics and say things , but I was unable to censor them before they were able to say them .
She said that I called her daughter a name and I denied the accusation .
But then she said that I did n't believe in god and should n't be teaching .
She also said that she had spoken to 3 other board members who agreed with her that I should n't be teaching because I was too liberal and I was an atheist . "
Mullens was ultimately put on administrative leave , and has now decided not to renew his contract .
But Lowe told Hair Balls today that she never had a problem with Mullens 's athiesm or politics .
She says that the teacher engaged his students in , to use Mullens 's own word , " inappropriate " discussions .
" This has nothing to do with religion , " Lowe said , adding later , " I 'm being badmouthed , my daughter 's being harassed at school .... A lot of my school - board members up here are wanting to stick their head in the sand like a bunch of damn ostriches and not say anything . "
Lowe was born and raised in Brookeland , but moved when she got married , and moved back last year .
She said her daughter complained about the classroom conversations since day one , but " I had not said anything because she was the new kid at school , and she did n't want nobody saying anything .... She did n't want to cause problems , because everyone likes Mr. Mullens .... "
And boy , do they !
Some blogs ( such as westtennessee.blogspot.com ) have been flooded with posts by current and former students saying Mullens is a great teacher , and that Lowe once killed a student 's dog and is on probation .
( Lowe denies both .
Hair Balls did a quick criminal records check , and there 's no evidence Lowe was ever arrested and charged with a criminal offense , let alone is on probation .
Curiously , the person who accused her of being on probation failed to identify the originating offense .
As for the dead dog - that 's apparently a she - said / she - said thing . )
Lowe says about twenty other parents and students have provided corroborating allegations to the school 's principal - but Lowe and her daughter are the only ones taking the brunt because none of the other complainants have been publicly identified .
" They wo n't say anything out in the open , " she said .
" They did it in private . "
Hair Balls has calls in to Mullens , his attorney , the principal and the district superintendent .
So stay tuned for more .

Google is hard at work on a new version of its Linux - based Android mobile platform .
The new branch — which is codenamed Cupcake — introduces support for several important features , including an on - screen keyboard .
This critical feature , which was missing from Android at launch , will make Android a viable platform for touchscreen tablet devices that do n't have hardware keyboards .
Cupcake is still a work in progress , but gadget makers are already getting a head start .
The GiiNii Movit , an Android WiFi tablet that was introduced at CES , is one of the first Cupcake - based products to be unveiled .
It will offer support for Skype for VoIP and include an integrated video camera .
The 4.3 - inch model is on track to ship in Q3 and it will followed up by a 7 - inch model .
The latest hardware maker to jump on the Android bandwagon is Archos , which is planning an ultra-slim touchscreen media tablet device with 500GB of built - in storage , 3G Internet support , and a powerful OMAP3440 processor .
The press release claims that it will deliver 7 - hours of HD video playback .
With a 5 - inch screen , however , it 's not quite like your average pocket - friendly smartphone .
Previous Archos Internet devices have used the company 's own Linux - based platform .
Adopting Android could bring several advantages to the Archos devices , including access to the third - party software ecosystem .
Electronics Weekly is reporting that California touchscreen device maker Touch Revolution is modifying Anroid to support additional kinds of non-phone devices .
They have adapted the software so that it can work better on a wider range of screen sizes .
Such efforts could also help to increase Android 's presence on consumer electronics devices .
The major mobile carriers have been hesitant to adopt Android and there do n't appear to be any carrier - backed phones coming soon from any major mobile player other than T - Mobile .
Sprint , which was originally planning to launch a product this year , changed its plans after struggling with bugs and technical issues .
The availability of Android - based products from third - party hardware makers through regular retail channels could be Android 's fastest path to consumers and could help validate the platform .

You know how when all the water finally evaporates from your dirty , clogged sink , you get to see how many roaches were really drowned in there ?
That 's how Wall Street is now , with frauds !
Today we have three — count em , then count em again with a more honest accountant — three new mini-Madoff frauds !
Well they 're not all " Mini - Madoffs " because they 're not all massive Ponzi schemes .
But the alliteration , you can't deny .
Let 's take them in order of outrage :
Mark Bloom took millions from investors , lied about where he invested it , collected $ 1.6 million in fees , and is now insolvent !
James Nicholson told investors he was putting their money into hedge funds , and that those funds were performing well .
When the Madoff scandal broke , people asked for their money back from Nicholson .
The checks bounced .
Now investigators think he may have vaporized up to $ 900 million !
Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh took hundreds of millions from investors and just blew it all on stupid shit like expensive teddy bears .
But they wrote IOU 's for all of it , okay !
But Greenwood and Walsh used " $ 160 million for personal expenses , including rare books at auctions , horses , Steiff teddy bears for as much as $ 80,000 [ each ] at various auctions . . . and a residence for Walsh 's ex-wife , Janet Walsh , in the amount of $ 3 million , " the Commodities Futures Trading Commission said in a civil suit .
Greenwood , who was elected town supervisor of North Salem in Westchester in 2007 , and his wife are believed to own the world 's largest collection of rare Steiffs - 1,350 of them ...
Records showed that of the $ 812 million in assets held by their operation , $ 794 million were in promissory notes saying Greenwood and Walsh owned their own fund money .
Now that Wall Street is losing money and investors are all spooked and asking for their cash back , we expect more and more of these every day .
It is the idle entertainment of the bitter poor ! [ NYP ]
Energy Secretary Steven
Chu warned that , if climate change continues unabated , California 's agriculture could vanish by the end of the century .
Speaking with the Los Angeles Times , Mr. Chu , a Nobel Prize - winning physicist who ran the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory before joining the Obama administration , said that warming temperatures could eliminate up to 90 percent of the Sierra snowpack , which provides water to many of the state 's 76,000 farms .
" I do n't think the American public has gripped in its gut what could happen , " he told the newspaper .
" We 're looking at a scenario where there 's no more agriculture in California . "
" I do n't actually see how they can keep their cities going , " he added .
According to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture [ PDF ] , California is responsible for about half of US fruit , nut , and fresh vegetable production .
As the LA Times notes , Chu is not a climate scientist .
His Nobel Prize , which he shared with French physicist Claude Cohen - Tannoudji and American physicist William Daniel Phillips , was awarded in 1997 for his contributions to “ laser cooling , ” a method of trapping gaseous atoms with laser light .
Chu 's warning – that Sierra snowpack could dip by 90 percent by century 's end – is far more dire than others have predicted .
A report last year written by University of California , Berkeley , researchers Fredrich Kahrl and David Roland - Holst said that snowpack on the mountain range is " projected to shrink by 30 percent by 2070 - 2099 . "
The report adds that " [ d ] rier higher warming scenarios " put that figure at 80 percent .
[ Update : Commenter Daniel Zappala has pointed to a February 2006 report [ PDF ] from the California Climate Change Center that says that a 90 percent reduction in snowpack is plausible under a worst - case scenario .

Still , as The Monitor 's Pete Spotts pointed out in his Horizons blog , as California enters its third year of drought , the water content of snowpack on the Sierras and elsewhere in the state sits at 61 percent of normal ( as Mr. Spotts explains , measurement of water content is different from measurement of the snowpack itself ) .
Mr. Spotts quotes Lester Snow , the Director of California ’s Department of Water Resources , who warns , “ We may be at the start of the worst California drought in modern history , ”
( To the great disappointment of this blogger , Mr. Snow does n't let people call him " Les . " )
The decline in spring runoff from the mountains is often cited as contributing to the state 's wildfires .
Chu told the LA Times that he hopes that , in addition to mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions and billions in funding for alternative energy , public education will play a role in helping to curb global warming .
" I 'm hoping that the American people will wake up , " he told the Times .
Smoke could be seen coming from the dunes near Porthcawl
Shock as witnesses see air crash
In pictures : Crash scene
Two Air Training Corps cadets and their RAF instructors have been killed in a mid-air crash between two light aircraft near the south Wales coast .
The cadets , who were teenage girls , were cousins .
They died after a collision near the seaside resort of Porthcawl just before 1100 GMT .
The Grob planes had been involved in 20 - minute " air experience " flights from RAF St Athan , Vale of Glamorgan .
The wreckage was spread over about half a mile near a nature reserve .
Three separate inquiries are under way into the crash .

At least one of the twin - seater planes was on fire when emergency services reached the scene .
One eyewitness told the BBC she saw two planes hit each other , before she heard an explosion .
Reena Callingham told the BBC
News website she was putting out her washing when she saw two planes flying close together .
" I just could n't believe it .
At first there was n't an explosion straight away but then there was .
They just went down , " she said .
Police said wreckage was strewn across quite a wide area and officers were receiving reports from members of public coming across the debris .
Flight lieutenant Alastair Hawes said the planes were on " air experience " flights from RAF St Athan , about 20 miles away .
Such flights usually feature an RAF instructor alongside someone , usually a young person or cadet , who is interested in a military career .
The crash scene was close to the M4 motorway , near a nature reserve
The aircraft involved were Grob Tutors , twin - seater light aircraft with propellers , popular with flying training .
Although the aircraft were based at St Athan , their " parent " headquarters is the number one Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Cranwell , Lincolnshire .
Andy Naismith , group captain in charge of flight training at Cranwell , said a service inquiry was being run in parallel with the police and air accident investigation .
He said : " We would like to learn what lessons we can from this tragic incident . "
He added : " Four members of the RAF family have tragically lost their lives following an accident which took place near Porthcawl just before lunchtime today .
" Those who died were two members of the RAF and two Air Training Corps cadets .
" Grp Cpt Naismith said next of kin have been informed but the families want more time before they are named " to let them absorb and come to terms with this devastating news " .
An RAF Grob training aircraft - photo : Air Team Images " I would like to hereby thank all members of the emergency services for their rapid and caring response and once again ask for the media to exercise restraint at this most difficult time for the families , " he added .
Supt Tim Jones , of South Wales Police , said : " A major incident room has been set up at police headquarters in Bridgend and a response is being co-ordinated from there . "
He said it was a complex response because of the nature of the scenes they were managing and that it would be a joint investigation .
" Clearly , the scene is expansive and we will be needing to protect the scene tonight to maintain the integrity of the investigation and we would appeal to members of the public to avoid the area tonight , " he said .

Rod Hammerton , head of operations for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service , said some 90 firefighters were initially sent to the scene of the crash , near Kenfig nature reserve .
He said : " Twenty - four appliances and 90 firefighters were despatched , as well as chemical units and search and rescue .
During the incident most resources were not used .
" We would like to extend our sympathy to those who have and will be touched by this , and would like to thank the other emergency services . "
A number of helicopters were used during the incident to gather evidence and mountain rescue teams were on stand - by .
The inquiries will be undertaken by police , Ministry of Defence and the Air Accident Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) .
A casualty bureau number 0800 096 1011 has been set up for members of the public to contact if they are concerned relatives may be involved .
Anyone who witnessed the crash or has information is asked to contact South Wales Police on 01656 306102 or 01656 306103 .

Japanese exports have been hit by the global economic downturn Japan 's economy contracted by 3.3 % in the last quarter of last year - its worst showing since the oil crisis of the 1970s , official figures show .
The contraction means the economy shrank at an annual pace of 12.7 % during the October to December period .
Economic Minister Kaoru Yosano said Japan faced its worst economic crisis since the end of World War II .
The slowdown in the world 's second - biggest economy is steeper than that being experienced in the US or Europe .
Japan has been hit particularly hard by falling global demand for its products .
People had been saying for some time that GDP would be bad , so while the market did n't welcome the numbers there was no excessive reaction
Hiroaki Osakabe , Chibagin Asset Management Exports , particularly of electronics and cars , have slumped and production has been slashed .
Consumers have cut back too , alarmed by rising unemployment .
" This is the worst economic crisis in the post - war era .
There is no doubt about it , " Mr Yosano said at a news conference .
" The Japanese economy , whose growth is heavily dependent on exports of automobiles , machinery , and IT equipment , was literally battered " by the global downturn , he said .
Mild reaction However , Japan 's stock market largely brushed off the latest economic news .
The Nikkei share index lost 0.4 % , while the broader Topix rose 0.7 % .
" People had been saying for some time that GDP would be bad , so while the market did n't welcome the numbers there was no excessive reaction , " said Hiroaki Osakabe at Chibagin Asset Management .

" The next quarter is likely to also be tough because consumption may well fall off . "
Mr Yosano said the government would consider new stimulus measures to aid the economy .
" Japan alone wo n't be able to recover .
The economy has no border .
It is our responsibility to rebuild the domestic economy for other countries , " he added .
Prime Minister Taro
Aso is hampered in his response by a divided parliament and a fractious ruling party .
There were reports over the weekend that he is considering another stimulus package of government spending worth 20 trillion yen ( $ 218bn ; £ 152bn ) .
But the latest opinion poll has showed that fewer than 10 % of people support the prime minister , who must call a general election by September .

TORONTO
IN the last few years , Michael Ignatieff ’s friends in the United States and England began receiving self - deprecating e-mail messages from him lamenting how dull and low - profile his life had suddenly become .
He had spent most of the preceding four decades making a name for himself in both countries  writing essays on the world ’s war zones for The New Yorker , The New Republic and The New York Review of Books ; writing novels and screenplays ; enjoying popularity as a television - show host in Britain and a regular at the Groucho Club ; and teaching at Harvard and Cambridge universities .
Now , he joked , he was stuck in the pedestrian life of a freshman civil servant  in Canada no less .
Mr. Ignatieff shocked friends and colleagues three years ago by chucking the life of the mind for the hurly - burly of politics and returning , after a long exile , to his native country to win a seat in Parliament .
And if he was bored , it was n’t for long .
Last December , after a tumultuous fortnight of machinations in parliament , Mr. Ignatieff , 61 , became the leader of the opposition Liberal Party , which has been called Canada ’s “ natural ruling party ” and has been in power for much of the last century .
Should his party win control of the government , something it came close to doing last week and still hopes to in the coming months , he would become the next prime minister of Canada .
All of science owes debt to Darwin 200th birthday

As many as 15,000 marine iguanas died on a Galapagos island in the year after a January 2001 oil spill , say scientists who blame trace amounts of the fuel .
Naturalists initially believed that the unique Galapagos ecosystem that inspired Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution largely escaped damage from the spill .

All of science owes debt to Darwin 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
The shy young naturalist Charles Darwin , who voyaged around the world aboard HMS Beagle and became the bearded sage of rational scientific thought , is having a birthday this week - his 200th - and celebrations have already begun throughout the Bay Area , and indeed on every continent .
" No one , " says Kevin Padian , a Berkeley biologist and tracker of dinosaur evolution , " has influenced modern thought , modern science , and indeed our modern culture more than Darwin .
" His influence is everywhere , and science would be impossible without him . "
Every true scientist at work today is in fact a Darwinian .
They are decoders of the human genome , immunologists battling AIDS , stem cell researchers seeking tomorrow 's cures , anthropologists unearthing fossil hominids to define our human ancestry - even the " astrobiologists " seeking life on other planets while they study organisms living in extreme conditions on Earth .
The man who was born just 200 years ago Thursday did not stumble on his theory of natural selection in one blinding insight - as legends that have morphed into quasi-history would have it - when he observed the varied finches and mockingbirds and tortoises of the Galapagos Islands during the Beagle 's stopover there .
No , his theories developed long after the observations he had made while adventurously collecting fossils of long - extinct beasts and living plants and animals - largely in South America .
His first insights on evolution and the emergence of new species came to him two years after the Beagle returned to England , and it was n't until 1859 , more than 20 years later , that Darwin , inspired by the writings of Thomas Malthus on population pressures and Charles Lyell on the ancient age of Earth 's geology , completed his first great work : " On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life . "
To evolution researchers today , the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco is an important source of information , for the academy maintains the world 's largest collection of Galapagos plant , animal and insect life .
The Galapagos archipelago and the Darwin Research Station in the tourist - jammed town of Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz there remain an international monument to his achievement .
Collecting specimens
Darwin , no ornithologist , had collected scores of finches and mockingbirds from different Galapagos islands and noticed how widely varied the finch beaks were .
He thought some were not finches at all .
But it was long after the Beagle 's return to England that he learned his birds were of widely different species and wondered how they came to be .
" One might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago , one species had been taken and modified for different ends , " he wrote in " The Voyage of the Beagle . "
Descent from common ancestors with modification are watchwords for scientists of all stripes today .
And Darwin saw more clearly than anyone that the pressure for modification came primarily through natural selection : Beasts or plants or microbes come from common ancestors .
They are modified to adapt best to an environment , and produce descendents ; those who are n't adapted die by the wayside - just as the Neanderthal people may have died away competing in vain with the first Homo sapiens , our direct ancestors .
That 's today 's version .
Species adaptation
" A steady thread of Darwin 's natural selection runs through all our work , " says David Mindell , dean of science and curator of ornithology at the California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park who studies the evolution of predatory birds - hawks , eagles , falcons and the like .
" Darwin has given us the way to see how species change over time , how new species arise - and that fact remains the real focus of all scientists who study evolution . "
The concepts of natural selection and Darwin 's later parallel discovery of sexual selection operate at all levels of life , and not just among vertebrate animals that reproduce sexually , Mindell says .
" You can put a culture of bacteria into a laboratory flask , and even though they reproduce by fission , you can see natural selection operating even there - new bacterial species will arise almost instantaneously , " he says .
Among his own birds of prey , as Mindell notes , Darwin 's concept of sexual selection operates clearly : A bird uses its plumage - or its chirps or raucous cries and whistles - to signal to a potential mate that it has the most desirable genes for producing the best descendants .
To Mindell , that means that studying " molecular systematics , " or the structure and sequences of genes in his birds , can lead to clues to the evolution of new species .
They are , Mindell says , " molecular clocks " for the history of speciation .
Intelligent design
Padian , the Berkeley biologist , testified as an expert witness during the famed 2005 trial in Dover , Pa. , over the school district 's decision to order the teaching of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in explaining the origin of life .
Intelligent design is based on the idea that living organisms are too complex to have evolved naturally , and must have required an intelligent designer to create them .
Like virtually all scientists today , Padian equates intelligent design with biblical creationism , a view held also by the judge in the Dover case who ruled that intelligent design " is a religious view , a mere re-labeling of creationism , and not a scientific theory . "
In Dover , evolution won .
Despite that ruling , efforts to promote intelligent design continue to roil school districts across America , and Darwin 's evolution - no more a theory than gravity or the round Earth - is still under legal assault .
Padian is a foremost expert on the evolution of dinosaurs , the creatures that ruled the earth for about 160 million years and whose mass extinction an estimated 65 million years ago has given rise to conflicting causes : a meteorite crashing onto Earth or Indian volcanoes erupting in catastrophe .
To Padian , however , the dinosaurs never really went extinct .
His studies , and those of many others , have provided overwhelming evidence that dinosaurs evolved in true Darwinian fashion to become today 's birds .
Some of the meat - eating fossil dinosaurs that Padian and other scientists have unearthed at ancient sites around the world bore fierce horns , while their more placid plant - eating relatives did not .
So Padian today is also studying the evolution of horns in modern animals .
" That 's why , " he said recently , " I studied a thousand skulls of different antelope species in South Africa - to see how they fit into Darwin 's tree of life . "

Obama Will Sign Stimulus Bill on Tuesday
Updated 5:50 p.m.
By Michael D. Shear
President Obama will sign the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan in Denver on Tuesday , the White House said today , as he continues his efforts to communicate directly to the American public about the economic crisis .
Obama had already announced a trip to Colorado and Arizona on Tuesday and Wednesday .
He plans to announce his latest plans for reducing the number of housing foreclosures on Wednesday in Phoenix .
Obama 's decision to sign the stimulus bill in Denver is a striking departure from his first few weeks in office , when he held several signing ceremonies in the East Room of the White House .
In the last week , however , Obama has spent less and less time in his new home .
Last week he traveled to Indiana , Florida and Illinois and headed home to Chicago for a four - day weekend .
He also announced his first foreign trip as president , a day trip to Canada next Thursday .

After the troubles with Mr. Daschle and other nominees , the White House has intensified its vetting to make sure it thoroughly scrubs its choices before Mr. Obama signs off .
Ms. Sebelius ’s family and her administration have both been notably bipartisan .
Her father was a Democratic governor of Ohio and her father - in - law was a longtime Republican member of Congress from Kansas .
She won her first term with a former Republican businessman as her running mate and a second term with the former Republican state party chairman on her ticket .
Ms. Sebelius became an early supporter of Mr. Obama by endorsing him in January 2008 and was mentioned as a possible vice - presidential nominee .
After the election , her name was floated for a variety of possible jobs , including secretary of labor , agriculture or education .
If she becomes health secretary , she will be the fourth woman in the 15 - member cabinet , overseeing 65,000 employees and a $ 700 billion budget .
But she is unlikely to also wear the second hat that Mr. Daschle negotiated for himself as White House health czar , a position that could be influential in setting health care policy .

Administration officials said that was a special arrangement for Mr. Daschle , adding that they were still considering what to do about that job .
Should Ms. Sebelius get the cabinet post , she would be replaced as governor by Lt. Gov. Mark Parkinson , the former Republican chairman who switched to the Democratic Party when he ran with Ms. Sebelius in 2006 .
Mr. Parkinson has said he will not run for governor in 2010 .
According to The Register Diane Feinstein is trying to add language to the stimulus bill to allow for ISP throttling .
Using the ' reasonable network management ' euphemism , she tried to attach this to the broadband section .
While this has been removed , she still plans to try to put her amendment back in committee .
Rep. Waxman is also listed as supporting the amendment .
" This is the most backdoor of all the backdoor ways of doing things , " Public Knowledge 's Art Brodsky told The Reg .
" Conference committees are notorious for being the most opaque of all legislative processes . "
It 's easy to find examples of patent abuse but its not often to find a company that uses patents that stifle a whole industry .
Such may be the case with the Apple iPhone .
I purchased an iPhone shortly after it came out , because I recognized that it was a revolutionary device .
It was not a case of superior specifications , as many devices have better hardware .
It did n't even run on the latest 3G network until the second generation .
Rather , it was a superior design , which featured an intuitive user interface that did not try to compete on the number of features but on usability .
Apple fully deserves the billions of dollars it has made and will go on to make from its device .
Yet something curious has happened .
When Apple introduced the iPhone , those who recognized its revolutionary potential expected the innovations and design concepts it introduced to percolate to the rest of the industry .
To an extent , that is happening , but key iPhone technologies - a capacitive touchscreen with multi- touch , a 3 - axis accelerometer , proximity sensors , graphics acceleration integrated into the UI , and a number of other key innovations have not been found in competing products .
Part of the reason for this has to do with the particular culture and expertise found at Apple , but its indisputable than the 200 + patents covering the iPhone have gone a long way to discouraging competitors , who offer alternatives lacking key features - until now .
Palm , the company who created the first popular PDA is coming out with the Palm Pre , the first device to brazenly infringe many of the key iPhone patents .
Apple is already making threatening gestures , so an apocalyptic legal battle is almost certain .
Palm is the first company to go against Apple head on because its status as the one - time leader in the PDA and mobile phone market makes it the only company capable of challenging Apple 's leadership .
While the Palm Pre clearly borrows ideas from the iPhone , the iPhone itself uses many of the innovations first patented by Palm as early as 1996 .
Today Palm is a marginalized has - been for whom the Pre is a desperate gamble to save to company , but it still has the patent portfolio of a market leader .
The question of who is the bigger infringer in this battle is besides the point .
The issue is that the patent system is limiting innovation to large companies who have established sufficiently large patent portfolios to pose a credible threat of retaliatory patent lawsuits .
The best that new competitors can hope for in this environment is to be aquired by the giants or to establish their own patent portfolios - rather than create products than people want to use .
Uh , guys -- you DEA guys .
Did n't the picture of a different man in the official frame where the President 's picture always goes give you a clue ?
Barack Obama is in , George Bush is out -- and out , too , it seems , the policy of raiding medical marijuana dispensaries .
Or did n't you hear ?
Apparently not .
In Los Angeles today , at least two Westside medical marijuana dispensaries were reportedly raided by agents , in spite of the fact that Obama said during the campaign that the use of medical marijuana can be '' appropriate . ''
A number of states agree , and have voted accordingly , including California .
As Obama told Oregon 's '' Mail Tribune ' ' newspaper , as president , '' I 'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue . ''
And yet we have today 's raids , where the DEA reportedly did not even bother to notify the LAPD about what it was doing , as is customary .
Just two days after Obama was sworn in , the DEA also raided a medical marijuana dispensary in South Lake Tahoe .
Reliving the good old days , boys ?
Or getting in a few last shots before the new attorney general gets his feet under the desk ?
Back in 2001 , barely six weeks after the attacks of 9/11 , when all of the nation 's intelligence and law enforcement resources were supposedly being thrown at terrorism , the Bush Administration nonetheless found the time and manpower to raid a medical marijuana dispensary in a West Hollywood church .
When the case came to a finale in court , I was there when federal judge A. Howard Matz handed down the lightest possible sentence he could to the dispensary operators -- one of them a cancer patient himself -- and said stingingly , “ I think this entire prosecution was badly misguided . ''
So here we go again .
Unregulated and poorly regulated dispensaries are a real problem , as the state of California knows and has been trying to do something about .
If that was the problem underlying today 's raids , at least the DEA could have let the local law know that it had a problem , and even brought the LAPD along on the raid .
But many of these dispensaries operate scrupulously , with the knowledge and blessing of city and county law enforcement officials -- and now with the tacit permission of the President of the United States , who said he 'll defer to state law .
And that , under Proposition 215 , makes medical pot legal in California .
Now if only someone will cc all of this to the DEA .
President Obama made a seven - hour pit stop in this snow - draped Canadian capital Thursday , an inaugural foreign trip as president in which he sought to reaffirm good - neighborly relations and encountered crowds almost giddy at his presence .
Obama used the short visit to reassure the United States ’ largest trading partner of his support for robust cross - border commerce , announce an agreement on a modest “ clean energy dialogue ” between the two governments , and praise the sacrifices of Canadian troops in Afghanistan .
If short on substance , the day marked a departure from the uncomfortable tone that characterized relations during George W. Bush ’s presidency , especially after Canada balked at joining its closest ally in the invasion of Iraq .
In contrast , the enthusiasm for Obama shown by those who turned out on Ottawa ’s slushy streets was a rare display of pro-American sentiment in Canada .
A crowd of several thousand greeted the president on the lawn of the Parliament complex , many having waited hours in a light snowfall .

As Obama ’s motorcade passed through downtown , supporters held up signs , including one that read “ Yes We CANada . ”
And one Ottawa bakery was serving commemorative “ Obama tails , ” a version of the local “ beaver tail ” fried - dough pastry , but with a maple syrup - flavored frosting in the shape of an Obama “ O . ”
Acknowledging his popularity in a country where polls show him with higher approval ratings than in the U.S. , Obama closed his news conference with Prime Minister Stephen Harper by saying : “ I want to also , by the way , thank some of the Canadians who came over the border to campaign for me during the election .
“ It was much appreciated , ” he said , drawing laughter .
In office for a month , Obama appeared to have completed his first official foreign visit smoothly , though he did lose his footing for a moment on an icy tarmac as he was walking back to Air Force One for departure .

At the news conference with Harper , Obama said he wanted to “ grow trade and not contract it , ” setting a considerably more enthusiastic tone than he had during the presidential campaign , when he had called for renegotiating the NAFTA treaty that governs U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico .
During a Democratic presidential debate on the eve of the Ohio primary , Obama had argued for threatening to withdraw from NAFTA as a “ hammer ” to force concessions on labor and environmental standards , causing jitters in Canada where , though his remarks were seen as election posturing , the economy remains hugely dependent on exports to the U.S .
But as president , Obama has signaled a wariness of the rising protectionist impulses around the globe that most fear could worsen the economic crisis .
“ Now is a time where we ’ve got to be very careful about any signals of protectionism , ” Obama said , “ because as the economy of the world contracts , I think there ’s going to be a strong impulse , on the part of constituencies in all countries , to see if they can engage in beggar - thy - neighbor policies . ”

Obama also made his first public comments on the increase in U.S. troops he ordered for Afghanistan this week , leaving open the possibility that he would add more troops after a strategic review is completed .
He said he did not want to “ prejudge ” the result of the ongoing Afghan review , which he said would be finished in two months .
He had ordered an increase of 17,000 troops , short of a request for 30,000 made by the U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
“ I ordered the additional troops there because I felt it was necessary to stabilize the situation , ” Obama said .
Canada has a contingent of 2,800 troops in Afghanistan , which is scheduled to depart by 2011 under a deadline set by the Canadian Parliament .
The mission is highly sensitive in a country that sees itself in a peacekeeping mold , and whose troops have taken heavy casualties in Afghan combat .

Obama noted that 108 Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan , and said he “ certainly did not press the prime minister ” for any commitment to extend the deadline .
“ All I did was to compliment Canada on the troops that are there , ” the president said .

I ’ve said before , when it comes to government , that they do n’t know what the hell they ’re doing .
Perhaps I was being generous , following Napoleon ’s quote : “ Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence . ”
Perhaps they know exactly what they ’re doing , and they just do n’t want to tell us :
Geithner ’s message was well received at the talks , known as the G - 7 , which gather the United States , Canada , Japan , and four major nations from Europe .
Russia and world financial organizations also attended .
Going into the meeting , Canadian Finance Minister James M. Flaherty called the U.S. financial rescue “ less than clear , ” echoing comments made by financial chiefs in France and Germany .
Afterward , many of the officials appeared reassured , saying that Geithner provided clear answers to their questions .
Several officials said Geithner was particularly helpful in explaining how the various elements of the administration ’s initiatives tie together as well as how he plans to combine public funds with private resources to get more bang out of every rescue dollar the governments spends .
Later in the article , Geithner claims that he just did n’t want to be too specific announcing his plans before they were firm .
I guess a lot of decisions must have been made between Tuesday and Saturday , huh ?
I do n’t see why he could n’t have held off his press conference a few days — rather than try to hide it behind the stimulus debate — if he was that close to a plan .
So what ’s the over / under on when the most transparent administration in history will tell the rest of us what they told the G7 ?
Will it be before or after they ’ve spent the money ?

Chomsky : Undermining Gaza
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Sameer Dossani
Foreign Policy in Focus , January 16 , 2009
DOSSANI : The Israeli government and many Israeli and U.S. officials claim that the current assault on Gaza is to put an end to the flow of Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel .
But many observers claim that if that were really the case , Israel would have made much more of an effort to renew the ceasefire agreement that expired in December , which had all but stopped the rocket fire .
In your opinion , what are the real motivations behind the current Israeli action ?
CHOMSKY : There ’s a theme that goes way back to the origins of Zionism .
And it ’s a very rational theme : “ Let ’s delay negotiations and diplomacy as long as possible , and meanwhile we ’ll ‘ build facts on the ground . ' ”
So Israel will create the basis for what some eventual agreement will ratify , but the more they create , the more they construct , the better the agreement will be for their purposes .
Those purposes are essentially to take over everything of value in the former Palestine and to undermine what ’s left of the indigenous population .
I think one of the reasons for popular support for this in the United States is that it resonates very well with American history .
How did the United States get established ?
The themes are similar .
There are many examples of this theme being played out throughout Israel ’s history , and the current situation is another case .
They have a very clear program .
Rational hawks like Ariel Sharon realized that it ’s crazy to keep 8,000 settlers using one - third of the land and much of the scarce supplies in Gaza , protected by a large part of the Israeli army while the rest of the society around them is just rotting .
So it ’s best to take them out and send them to the West Bank .
That ’s the place that they really care about and want .
What was called a “ disengagement ” in September 2005 was actually a transfer .
They were perfectly frank and open about it .
In fact , they extended settlement building programs in the West Bank at the very same time that they were withdrawing a few thousand people from Gaza .
So Gaza should be turned into a cage , a prison basically , with Israel attacking it at will , and meanwhile in the West Bank we ’ll take what we want .
There was nothing secret about it .
Ehud Olmert was in the United States in May 2006 a couple of months after the withdrawal .
He simply announced to a joint session of Congress and to rousing applause , that the historic right of Jews to the entire land of Israel is beyond question .
He announced what he called his convergence program , which is just a version of the traditional program ; it goes back to the Allon plan of 1967 .
Israel would essentially annex valuable land and resources near the green line ( the 1967 border ) .
That land is now behind the wall that Israel built in the West Bank , which is an annexation wall .
That means the arable land , the main water resources , the pleasant suburbs around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , and the hills and so on .
They ’ll take over the Jordan valley , which is about a third of the West Bank , where they ’ve been settling since the late 60s .
Then they ’ll drive a couple of super highways through the whole territory — there ’s one to the east of Jerusalem to the town of Ma’aleh Adumim which was built mostly in the 1990s , during the Oslo years .
It was built essentially to bisect the West Bank and are two others up north that includes Ariel and Kedumim and other towns which pretty much bisect what ’s left .
They ’ll set up check points and all sorts of means of harassment in the other areas and the population that ’s left will be essentially cantonized and unable to live a decent life and if they want to leave , great .
Or else they will be picturesque figures for tourists — you know somebody leading a goat up a hill in the distance — and meanwhile Israelis , including settlers , will drive around on “ Israeli only ” super highways .
Palestinians can make do with some little road somewhere where you ’re falling into a ditch if it ’s raining .
That ’s the goal .
And it ’s explicit .
You ca n’t accuse them of deception because it ’s explicit .
And it ’s cheered here .
DOSSANI : In terms of U.S. support , last week the UN Security Council adopted a resolution calling for a cease fire .
Is this a change , particularly in light of the fact that the U.S. did not veto the resolution , but rather abstained , allowing it to be passed ?
CHOMSKY : Right after the 1967 war , the Security Council had strong resolutions condemning Israel ’s move to expand and take over Jerusalem .
Israel just ignored them .
Because the U.S. pats them on the head and says “ go ahead and violate them . ”
There ’s a whole series of resolutions from then up until today , condemning the settlements , which as Israel knew and as everyone agreed were in violation of the Geneva conventions .
The United States either vetoes the resolutions or sometimes votes for them , but with a wink saying , “ go ahead anyway , and we ’ll pay for it and give you the military support for it . ”
It ’s a consistent pattern .
During the Oslo years , for example , settlement construction increased steadily , in violation of what the Oslo agreement was theoretically supposed to lead to .
In fact the peak year of settlement was Clinton ’s last year , 2000 .
And it continued again afterward .
It ’s open and explicit .
To get back to the question of motivation , they have sufficient military control over the West Bank to terrorize the population into passivity .
Now that control is enhanced by the collaborationist forces that the U.S. , Jordan , and Egypt have trained in order to subdue the population .
In fact if you take a look at the press the last couple of weeks , if there ’s a demonstration in the West Bank in support of Gaza , the Fatah security forces crush it .
That ’s what they ’re there for .
Fatah by now is more or less functioning as Israel ’s police force in the West Bank .
But the West Bank is only part of the occupied Palestinian territories .
The other part is Gaza , and no one doubts that they form a unit .
And there still is resistance in Gaza , those rockets .
So yes , they want to stamp that out too , then there will be no resistance at all and they can continue to do what they want to do without interference , meanwhile delaying diplomacy as much as possible and “ building the facts ” the way they want to .
Again this goes back to the origins of Zionism .
It varies of course depending on circumstances , but the fundamental policy is the same and perfectly understandable .
If you want to take over a country where the population does n’t want you , I mean , how else can you do it ?
How was this country conquered ?
DOSSANI : What you describe is a tragedy .
CHOMSKY : It ’s a tragedy which is made right here .
The press wo n’t talk about it and even scholarship , for the most part , wo n’t talk about it but the fact of the matter is that there has been a political settlement on the table , on the agenda for 30 years .
Namely a two - state settlement on the international borders with maybe some mutual modification of the border .
That ’s been there officially since 1976 when there was a Security Council resolution proposed by the major Arab states and supported by the ( Palestinan Liberation Organization ) PLO , pretty much in those terms .
The United States vetoed it so it ’s therefore out of history and it ’s continued almost without change since then .
There was in fact one significant modification .
In the last month of Clinton ’s term , January 2001 there were negotiations , which the U.S. authorized , but did n’t participate in , between Israel and the Palestinians and they came very close to agreement .
DOSSANI : The Taba negotiations ?
Yes , the Taba negotiations .
The two sides came very close to agreement .
They were called off by Israel .
But that was the one week in over 30 years when the United States and Israel abandoned their rejectionist position .
It ’s a real tribute to the media and other commentators that they can keep this quiet .
The U.S. and Israel are alone in this .
The international consensus includes virtually everyone .
It includes the Arab League which has gone beyond that position and called for the normalization of relations , it includes Hamas .
Every time you see Hamas in the newspapers , it says “ Iranian - backed Hamas which wants to destroy Israel . ”
Try to find a phrase that says “ democratically elected Hamas which is calling for a two - state settlement ” and has been for years .
Well , yeah , that ’s a good propaganda system .
Even in the U.S. press they ’ve occasionally allowed op - eds by Hamas leaders , Ismail Haniya and others saying , yes we want a two - state settlement on the international border like everyone else .
DOSSANI : When did Hamas adopt that position ?
CHOMSKY
That ’s their official position taken by Haniya , the elected leader , and Khalid Mesh ’al , their political leader who ’s in exile in Syria , he ’s written the same thing .
And it ’s over and over again .
There ’s no question about it but the West does n’t want to hear it .
So therefore it ’s Hamas which is committed to the destruction of Israel .
In a sense they are , but if you went to a Native American reservation in the United States , I ’m sure many would like to see the destruction of the United States .
If you went to Mexico and took a poll , I ’m sure they do n’t recognize the right of the United States to exist sitting on half of Mexico , land conquered in war .
And that ’s true all over the world .
But they ’re willing to accept a political settlement .
Israel is n’t willing to accept it and the United States is n’t willing to accept it .
And they ’re the lone hold - outs .
Since it ’s the United States that pretty much runs the world , it ’s blocked .
Here it ’s always presented as though the United States must become more engaged ; it ’s an honest broker ; Bush ’s problem was that he neglected the issue .
That ’s not the problem .
The problem is that the United States has been very much engaged , and engaged in blocking a political settlement and giving the material and ideological and diplomatic support for the expansion programs , which are just criminal programs .
The world court unanimously , including the American justice , agreed that any transfer of population into the Occupied Territories is a violation of a fundamental international law , the Geneva Conventions .
And Israel agrees .
In fact even their courts agree , they just sort of sneak around it in various devious ways .
So there ’s no question about this .
It ’s just sort of accepted in the United States that we ’re an outlaw state .
Law does n’t apply to us .
That ’s why it ’s never discussed .
There are some definite shifts to the left in Obama ’s governance , as well as some symbolic or even real gestures toward centrist pragmatism on issues like the environment and abortion .
But the general thrust can broadly be seen as hyper - interventionist .
Although some depredations under Obama have picked up their pace and some under Bush have been slightly curbed , there is also a staggering continuity from the Bush years in some areas where some voters might have not expected it .
The economic policy of borrowing / inflating and injecting a trillion dollars into the economy at a time is continuing , with new speed and a greater number of special interests on the dole .
The nationalizations and subsidies persist and the power continues to move toward central administration .
The medical marijuana raids Obama promised he ’d stop continue .
After giving no comment , the administration now says they will be stopped , so perhaps this is momentum from the last administration and there ’s at least the possibility the policy will end .
But I would n’t count on it .
Bush ’s “ faith - based ” initiatives , which drew sharp dissent from the left , will now be expanded and elevated by Obama ’s new “ Office of Faith - Based Initiatives , ” a new official council to the White House .
Under the new president , there are hints we might see more reliance on “ extraordinary renditioning , ” perhaps the most barbaric and troubling program in the Bush anti-terror detention policy .
The surveillance state built by Bush will remain and no one will be held accountable .
Obama ’s cabinet and advisers comprise establishment picks across the board .
A former high Fed official in charge of the Treasury .
A member of America ’s dynastic ruling elite in charge of the State Department .
The same Defense Secretary we had under Bush .
On Iran , the new administration is keeping all options on the table , just as Bush did :
Which means the U.S. is prepared to go to war with Iran with the supposed goal of protecting Israel .
On Afghanistan , Obama does not only want to expand Bush ’s first war and turn it into a nation - building project as ambitious as and more doomed to fail than Bush ’s Iraq enterprise , but Obama ’s short - term solution seems to be to just send tens of thousands more troops .
In Pakistan , Obama has continued the Bush policy of bombing people ( actually , a policy he supported before Bush began carrying it out in earnest ) .
Yes , for better and worse there are changes .
But I wonder how fitting it will be years from now to refer to these times as the Bush / Obama era .
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan ’s foreign minister has said he will try to allay U.S. fears about a pact with a group of Islamists in the troubled northwest , during a trip to Washington this week .
Under the pact , the provincial government has agreed to restore Islamic sharia law in the Swat valley to pacify a growing militancy , sparking concerns that authorities were giving in to Taliban hardliners .
“ God willing we will be able to allay the reservations they have expressed , ” Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters in comments broadcast by state - run Pakistan Television on Sunday .
“ When we will explain them the local situation and objectives for which we have taken this measure and put across our point of view , I think ... the confusion will be removed . ”
Qureshi will be visiting the United States this week to take part in a U.S. security policy review for the region .
U.S. envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , said on Thursday he called Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and expressed U.S. concern over the pact with the Islamists
Western officials fear the pact , like previous ones , will only encourage Islamist militancy in the region at a time when U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered an additional 17,000 troops to go to Afghanistan amid a spiraling Taliban insurgency in the border regions with Pakistan .
But Pakistani officials defend the pact as the best available option to stem the riding tide of militancy rolling from the wild tribal regions on the Afghan border to the cities and towns across the country , mainly in the northwest .
Obama , who has been in office for nearly a month , has made Afghanistan his top foreign policy priority and has ordered a policy review of the region to be completed before a NATO summit in April .
Afghanistan ’s foreign minister will be leading his side in the policy review discussions in Washington .
Pakistan ’s army chief , General Ashfaque Kayani is already on a week - long visit to the United States where he would meet U.S. government and military officials .
WEAKEN INSURGENCY
Analysts say Pakistani officials would share Pakistan ’s experience of engaging Islamists in talks in a bid to isolate the hardcore militants groups like al Qaeda and the Taliban and would urge Washington to reach out to moderate Taliban in a bid to weaken the insurgency .
“ I think Pakistan will encourage the U.S. to do the same in Afghanistan because these groups are not monolithic entities .
One has to look into their contradictions and see whether one can play on their divisions , ” security and political analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi said .
Maleeha Lodhi , Pakistan ’s former ambassador to the United States , in a recent newspaper article said Pakistan should also stress upon the United States to take into account Islamabad ’s security concerns with old rival India as its prepares to review its security policy .
India has established good relations with the Afghan government after the fall of Pakistan - backed Taliban in 2001 , rekindling old fears in Pakistan that the growing clout of its giant eastern neighbor , with which it has fought three wars , in Afghanistan is part of a strategy to encircle it .
Relations between nuclear - armed Pakistan and India strained after Mumbai attacks in November by Pakistan - based militants but fears of a conflict receded after Islamabad acknowledged this month that the assault was launched and partly planned from its soil and vowed action against perpetrators .
Qureshi is also expected to implead the U.S. administration to cease missile strikes by pilotless drones against militant targets on Pakistani soil and call for increased U.S. military as well as financial assistance to help it fight militancy and address it deep economic woes , analysts said .
The world 's first satellite designed to map concentrations of carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere will be launched by Nasa on Monday .
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory ( Oco ) will collect precise measurements of the greenhouse gas in the Earth 's atmosphere , identifying where it is coming from , where it is absorbed and what happens to it in between .
This improved tracking of CO2 will help scientists develop maps how the gas is concentrated around the world and give a better picture of how it affects the Earth 's climate .
Policymakers and governments will be able to use the data when setting and monitoring CO2 emissions targets designed to tackle climate change .
" It 's critical that we understand the processes controlling carbon dioxide in our atmosphere today so we can predict how fast it will build up in the future and how quickly we 'll have to adapt to climate change , " said David Crisp , principal investigator for the OCO , based at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
The Oco will blast off on a Taurus XL rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in the early hours of Monday morning ( watch the video here ) .
It will help scientists answer one of the biggest mysteries about the movement of CO2 in the Earth 's atmosphere .
Of all of the greenhouse gas emitted into the air since the industrial revolution in the 19th century , around 40 % has stayed thee .
Half of the remainder has been absorbed by the Earth 's oceans but the rest has not yet been be accounted for .
Scientists think the gas must have been absorbed on land but no one really knows where these missing carbon sinks are or what controls them .
" It 's important to make clear that the ' missing ' sinks are n't really missing , they are just poorly understood , " said Scott Denning , an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University .
" We know the ' missing ' sinks are terrestrial , land areas where forests , grasslands , crops and soil are absorbing carbon dioxide .
But finding these sinks is like finding a needle in a haystack .
It would be great if we could measure how much carbon every tree , shrub , peat bog or blade of grass takes in , but the world is too big and too diverse and is constantly changing , making such measurements virtually impossible .
The solution is not in measuring carbon in trees .
The solution is measuring carbon in the air . "
Previous Nasa missions , such as the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder , have also measured the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere but only at altitudes of 5 km to 10 km above the surface .
" Oco is the first Nasa mission that has been dedicated , and optimised to make precise measurements of carbon dioxide throughout the atmospheric column , between the surface and space , with the greatest sensitivity near the Earth 's surface , where most of the carbon dioxide sources and sinks are thought to be located , " said Crisp .
Oco will collect about 8 million measurements every 16 days for at least two years .
It will use three high - resolution spectrometers to split light into its various constituent colours .
By anlaysing this light to detect the unique signature of gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere , scientists will be able to determine their relative concentrations and identify sources and sinks of CO2 .
" Oco is primarily an exploratory science mission , whose objective is to test and validate a new technique for measuring carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere from space .
If we find that this approach works as well as we predict , it should provide scientists with the data that they need to produce the first global maps of carbon dioxide sources and sinks on regional scales , or spatial scales comparable to the size of Great Britain , " said Crisp .
Bjorgvin Sigurdsson , the Icelandic Minister of Commerce has stepped down .
The minister has decided to take responsibility for his part of the economic and political turmoil now enveloping Iceland , his last act as a minister was to fire the head of the Icelandic financial supervisory authority .
As he introduced this decision to the FSA chairman , Jon Sigurdsson , the chairman himself decided to resign .
Bjorgvin announced his decision in letter sent to the Prime Minister of Iceland , Geir H. Haarde , this morning .

How Jack Frost decorated my Rover ...
The amazing ice graffiti found after a freezing cold night
Jack Frost has a decidedly mischievous streak in his character , it seems .
For when Robert Baker went outside on Wednesday morning , he found his car had been sprayed with dramatic ice graffiti .
Frost had tagged the windscreen and roof with the characteristic fronds and swirls of fern frost , which forms during the coldest nights .
A touch of Jack Frost : Robert Baker was amazed to find his wife 's car covered in dramatic ice graffiti after a freezing night in the cold
Nice ice :
The frost patterns on Julie Baker 's car made beautiful patterns
' I could n't believe what I saw , ' said Mr Baker , 76 , who had intended to defrost his wife 's Rover 45 , in Folkestone , Kent .
' I called to my wife Julie to have a look . '
The pattern was one bit of graffiti he did n't mind seeing .
' Usually I would have defrosted the vehicle fairly quickly but the ice formations were stunning , ' he said .
' They did n't last long - they were gone as soon as the sun came out . '
Ice work : Stuart Dent 's car was also hit by the ice artists
It appears the ice artists were out in force .
In Oxfordshire , Stuart Dent found similar patterns on his Jaguar .
Car windows and paintwork are good heat conductors and water droplets often form in very cold weather .
Tiny imperfections such as scratches and dust influence their arrangement , so when they freeze , they form beautiful patterns .
I know from personal involvement that the devastating invasion of Gaza by Israel could easily have been avoided .
After visiting Sderot last April and seeing the serious psychological damage caused by the rockets that had fallen in that area , my wife , Rosalynn , and I declared their launching from Gaza to be inexcusable and an act of terrorism .
Although casualties were rare ( three deaths in seven years ) , the town was traumatized by the unpredictable explosions .
About 3,000 residents had moved to other communities , and the streets , playgrounds and shopping centers were almost empty .
Mayor Eli Moyal assembled a group of citizens in his office to meet us and complained that the government of Israel was not stopping the rockets , either through diplomacy or military action .
Knowing that we would soon be seeing Hamas leaders from Gaza and also in Damascus , we promised to assess prospects for a cease - fire .
From Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman , who was negotiating between the Israelis and Hamas , we learned that there was a fundamental difference between the two sides .
Hamas wanted a comprehensive cease - fire in both the West Bank and Gaza , and the Israelis refused to discuss anything other than Gaza .
We knew that the 1.5 million inhabitants of Gaza were being starved , as the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food had found that acute malnutrition in Gaza was on the same scale as in the poorest nations in the southern Sahara , with more than half of all Palestinian families eating only one meal a day .
Palestinian leaders from Gaza were noncommittal on all issues , claiming that rockets were the only way to respond to their imprisonment and to dramatize their humanitarian plight .
The top Hamas leaders in Damascus , however , agreed to consider a cease - fire in Gaza only , provided Israel would not attack Gaza and would permit normal humanitarian supplies to be delivered to Palestinian citizens .
After extended discussions with those from Gaza , these Hamas leaders also agreed to accept any peace agreement that might be negotiated between the Israelis and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , who also heads the PLO , provided it was approved by a majority vote of Palestinians in a referendum or by an elected unity government .
Since we were only observers , and not negotiators , we relayed this information to the Egyptians , and they pursued the cease - fire proposal .
After about a month , the Egyptians and Hamas informed us that all military action by both sides and all rocket firing would stop on June 19 , for a period of six months , and that humanitarian supplies would be restored to the normal level that had existed before Israel 's withdrawal in 2005 ( about 700 trucks daily ) .
We were unable to confirm this in Jerusalem because of Israel 's unwillingness to admit to any negotiations with Hamas , but rocket firing was soon stopped and there was an increase in supplies of food , water , medicine and fuel .
Yet the increase was to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels .
And this fragile truce was partially broken on Nov. 4 , when Israel launched an attack in Gaza to destroy a defensive tunnel being dug by Hamas inside the wall that encloses Gaza .
On another visit to Syria in mid-December , I made an effort for the impending six - month deadline to be extended .
It was clear that the preeminent issue was opening the crossings into Gaza .
Representatives from the Carter Center visited Jerusalem , met with Israeli officials and asked if this was possible in exchange for a cessation of rocket fire .
The Israeli government informally proposed that 15 percent of normal supplies might be possible if Hamas first stopped all rocket fire for 48 hours .
This was unacceptable to Hamas , and hostilities erupted .
After 12 days of " combat , " the Israeli Defense Forces reported that more than 1,000 targets were shelled or bombed .
During that time , Israel rejected international efforts to obtain a cease - fire , with full support from Washington .
Seventeen mosques , the American International School , many private homes and much of the basic infrastructure of the small but heavily populated area have been destroyed .
This includes the systems that provide water , electricity and sanitation .
Heavy civilian casualties are being reported by courageous medical volunteers from many nations , as the fortunate ones operate on the wounded by light from diesel - powered generators .
The hope is that when further hostilities are no longer productive , Israel , Hamas and the United States will accept another cease - fire , at which time the rockets will again stop and an adequate level of humanitarian supplies will be permitted to the surviving Palestinians , with the publicized agreement monitored by the international community .
The next possible step : a permanent and comprehensive peace .

The Save Our Cats and Kittens From Fishermen ( SOCKFF ) video has been making the rounds of the blogosphere for a while now , and still , not many people have called shenanigans on it .
That amazes me .
This video is obviously fake .
It has zero evidence of it ’s claim , it does n’t show any cats being eaten by sharks , it does n’t show any cats being pierced with hooks ( although a gloved man pretends to ) , it does n’t show anything really .
It only shows black cats supposedly dangling from a hook , and a gloved man pretending to hook a kitten but blocking the camera ’s view at the last second .
Take a look at the cat dangling frame :
If that cat were actually dangling from a hook that had been pierced through it ’s back skin , the skin would be stretched out far more than it is there .
In fact , it looks like the cat ’s actually hanging from some type of harness around it ’s midsection .
Take a good look .
This video is fake , and it ’s fairly obviously fake in my opinion .
The owner of the website , a guy by the name of Grady Warren apparently , is a genius .
He posts a video that pulls at the sad strings of animal lovers everywhere , then he sells t- shirts .
People think they ’re helping out the kitties , but all he does ( supposedly , he may not even do this ) is donate a portion of the proceeds to either the lunatic PETA cult , the SPCA , the World Wildlife Fund , or the Humane Society .
What percentage of the funds go to those charities ?
Who knows .
It could be as little as 1 cent per thousand dollars .
Warren does post this little disclaimer :
We are a for - profit Florida Corporation .
We are promoting awareness of animal abuse and our donations to these four established charities will be used as the individual organizations choose .
The really interesting thing about this whole SOCKFF affair is n’t that it exists , since this scam has been around for a long time ( it used to be dog ’s as bait ) .
The interesting thing is that so many people have been fooled by it .
Face it , very bizarre shit happens in the world , and the internet has video of a lot of it , so it stands to reason that something like this could be true .
That possibility is all he needs , the long tail of the internet does the rest .
If only a small number of the people who see that video end up buying a t - shirt , he ’s at least recouped the money he spent making the shirts .
Genius business plan if you ask me .
Well done , Grady Warren .
Is this the mysterious business genius , Grady Warren ?
The world may never know .
Brad Pitt Covers W Magazine February 2009 ( Photos )
appears on the February 2009 cover of W magazine , which hits newsstands on January 20 .
The actor follows closely in the footsteps of his partner , who caused a media stir when she appears on the cover of the November 2008 issue , and shared intimate breastfeeding photos for an article .
Pitt was photographed for the new W cover by photographic artist Chuck Close , who is known for his super detailed photos that show every furrow and flaw .
According to W , Brad insisted upon using Close .
In his sit down interview with W , Pitt was asked about a comment that his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston made during a recent Vogue magazine interview .
In an uncharacteristically candid moment , the actress called Angelina " uncool " for sharing details about her early romance with the still married Pitt .
He was surprisingly quick to jump to Jen 's defense :
" Listen man , Jen is a sweetheart .
I think she got dragged into that one .
And then there 's a second round to all of that Angie versus Jen .
It 's so created .
We still check in with each other .
She is a big part of my life and me hers .
I do n't see how there can not be that .
That 's life man , that 's life . "
The article accompanying Pitt 's photo shoot touts his critically acclaimed new film , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and insinuates that his personal life has almost singlehandedly kept the tabloids in business .
They follow that up by proclaiming that Brad Pitt has clearly mastered the art of superstardom .
Check out the entire interview here .
A federal judge on Monday denied prosecutors ' request to jail money manager Bernard Madoff for allegedly violating a court order by mailing more than $ 1 million worth of valuables to friends and family .
Instead , the judge ruled that Mr. Madoff , who is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that cost investors tens of billions of dollars , can remain free but must give the government an inventory of his transportable valuables and let a private security company regularly check that the items are still in his possession and search ...
So how do you add alternative text to background images ?
Wednesday , February 25th , 2009 at 11:44 pm
One thing that drives me up the wall is the inertia that happens in the accessibility world .
We do our best to keep the web development world aware of accessibility concerns but in the other direction I just do n’t see much drive to even understand the basic principles of web design .
My favourite example is the question that crops up almost every 3 weeks on different communication channels :
The WCAG guidelines state that every image needs alternative text but we are using CSS background images a lot [ Ed : sometimes this question is also about CSS sprites ] – how do you define alternative text for background images ?
OK , here is the scoop , people :
CSS background images which are by definition only of aesthetic value – not visual content of the document itself .
If you need to put an image in the page that has meaning then use an IMG element and give it an alternative text in the alt attribute .
You can also add a title attribute to add extra information that will be displayed to every user as a tooltip .
If your image has a lot of content ( for example a graph ) then consider using the longdesc attribute to link to a textual representation of the same data or display the same data for example as a data table in the same document .
That is it – images in CSS are only visual extras , not page content , hence they never need alternative text .
“ Rounded corner ” or “ blue - yellow gradient ” does not help anybody as alternative text – on the contrary , it annoys the end users .
It is not rocket science , really !

One of the current handicaps of cancer treatments is the difficulty of aiming these treatments at destroying malignant cells without killing healthy cells in the process .
But a new study by McMaster University researchers has provided insight into how scientists might develop therapies and drugs that more carefully target cancer , while sparing normal healthy cells .
Mick Bhatia , scientific director of the McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute in the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine , and his team of investigators have demonstrated – for the first time – the difference between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells in humans .
The discovery , published in the journal Nature Biotechnology January 4 , could eventually help with the further customization and targeting of cancer treatments for the individual patient .
It will immediately provide a model to discover drugs using robotic screening for available molecules that may have untapped potential to eradicate cancer .
“ Normal stem cells and cancer stem cells are hard to tell apart , and many have misconstrued really good stem cells for cancer stem cells that have gone bad - we now can tell the ones masquerading as normal stem cells from the bad , cancerous ones , ” said Bhatia .
“ This also allows us to compare normal versus cancer stem cells from humans in the laboratory - define the differences in terms of genes they express and drugs they respond to .
Essentially , we can now use this to find the “ magic bullet ” , a drug or set of drugs that kill cancer stem cells first , and spare the normal healthy ones , ” he said .
“ McMaster is uniquely positioned for this discovery platform , and this was the missing ingredient - we have one of the best screening / robotic platforms , chemical libraries and expertise in professors Eric Brown and Gerry Wright , who have discovered molecules to combat infectious disease .
Now we can combine it all .
This team now aims to kill cancer . ”

David Miliband was beginning to look as accident - prone as Mr Bean last night after yet another adventure backfired .
After ruining his chance of the Labour leadership by gurning at the cameras while brandishing a banana , the Foreign Secretary 's visit to India last week was labelled a " disaster " by the country 's leading politicians .
He was accused of being " aggressive in tone and manner " in a meeting with the Indian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister , and dismissed as a " young man " by senior officials .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Miliband was forced to defend his three - day tour of India and Pakistan last night , insisting he had been " open and honest " .
The visit had been billed as a " solidarity " trip over the terrorist attacks on Mumbai .
But the diplomatic row caused further embarrassment to Mr Miliband , just four months after the " banana incident " at Labour 's party conference in Manchester .
While out of the country last week , the Foreign Secretary was also under fire in the UK for writing an article in which he declared the " war on terror " had been a " mistake " .
The remarks , in the last days of George Bush 's presidency , were criticised for being ill - judged and ill - timed .
In the same article he linked the Mumbai sieges in November , which India blames on the Pakistani militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba , to the long - running dispute over Kashmir .
He said : " Resolution of the dispute over Kashmir would help deny extremists in the region one of their main calls to arms and allow Pakistani authorities to focus more effectively on tackling the threat on their western borders . "
Mr Miliband tried to appear at one with the Indian people by spending the night in a mud-floored hut – with a cow guarding the door – in rural Uttar Pradesh .
But clearly this was not enough to win over the Indian government .
Manish Tiwari , a spokesman for the ruling Congress Party , said : " There is no linkage between Kashmir and the terror India has been facing emanating from Pakistan ...
The bureaucracy in the British Foreign Office should have educated him a little bit on the facts . "
Arun Jaitley , spokesman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party , said : " In recent years , there has been no bigger disaster than David Miliband 's visit . "
A government source told AFP yesterday that Mr Miliband 's " aggressive style , the tone and manner in which he conducted himself during talks with the Prime Minister [ Manmohan Singh ] and the Foreign Minister [ Pranab Mukherjee ] were also upsetting " .
William Hague , the shadow Foreign Secretary , said : " Good relations with India are very important to Britain , and must be handled with care and consistency .
If these statements are representative of how David Miliband 's visit was received , then those relations will have been damaged . "
Mr Miliband is not the first Labour Foreign Secretary to ruffle diplomatic feathers over Kashmir .
In 1997 , Robin Cook was criticised by India for suggesting that the UK could mediate between New Delhi and Islamabad over the conflict .
A spokeswoman for Mr Miliband said : " The Foreign Secretary was very open and honest about his views , which are those of the British government .
He delivered the same message in New Delhi as he did in Islamabad . "
A Foreign Office official said : " The Foreign Secretary had a very good visit and what he took away to Pakistan was a very clear sense of anger felt about the Mumbai attacks and the need for decisive action by Pakistan , supported by the international community , to root out the terrorism that struck India with such devastating effect .

One of photography 's greatest strengths is the mystery of what is happening just out of the frame , and the moments in time either side of when the shutter is pressed .
Today thousands of digital frames languish on computers never to be seen but in the days of film , a contact sheet showing all the frames on a roll of film was the first stage from camera to publication .
These sheets can destroy the mystery and allure of the frozen moment , which is why many photographers keep theirs hidden .
Who wants to open themselves up in that way , to show the discarded frames ?
It has taken 50 years , but photographic students now have the chance to examine in detail every nuance of a book that holds an almost mythical place in the heart of many photographers .
The Americans by Robert Frank chronicles his 10,000 - mile journey across America at the height of the Cold War , and today , many of the 83 frames contained inside the covers are burned into the collective memory .
The Americans was first published in France and then in the US .
It was widely condemned by the critics , as it depicted a country sharply at odds with the America portrayed by Hollywood and the ad men .
Earl A Powell III , the director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington , says the book shows " a people plagued by racism , often ill - served by their politicians , intoxicated with the media and celebrities , and infatuated with speed , movement , and even the road itself " .
A contact sheet showing one of the rolls of film Frank shot during his trip
Enlarge Image
Since publication there have been a number of revisions of The Americans and plenty of attempts to dissect and analyse the work .
The latest is by Sarah Greenough whose book , Looking In : Robert Frank 's " The Americans " , accompanies a major exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington .
Greenough draws on vintage contact sheets , work prints , and letters that chart Frank 's journey around the US on a Guggenheim grant between 1955 and 1956 .
All of Frank 's contact sheets that contain at least one of the pictures he selected for The Americans is reproduced .
His raw outtakes lie alongside the fabled 83 photos .
These are not perfectly laid out sheets showing carefully presented negatives .
Instead they are shown in jumbled rows , with frames upside down and some poorly exposed .
And yet for all that they contain some of the most talked about frames in the history of photography .
To take just one example the contact sheet seen here contains two frames that made the final edit ( 13 and 16 ) as outlined in red .
Frank was shooting on a small 35 mm camera without a motor , so unlike today where you 'd find near identical frames sides by side , here we see how he has moved through the crowd , seizing moments of interest .
See frames 9 , 13 , 15 and 16
In pictures
The shot of the bus ( 16 ) with the white and black faces split between the front and rear of the bus is one of two , the second being blurred and overexposed and lacking the race split .
The selected frame is both a social document and an example of the decisive moment , a split second when everything falls into place around the camera .
Other frames on the contact sheet that did n't make the cut include some that warrant further examination .
For example the black family in frame nine seems to have caught Frank 's eye , and frame 15 is almost two pictures in one .
The three rather dour looking women to the front would not be out of place in the book , as would the family pointing behind them .
Ultimately though , The Americans is a book that flows from front to back , a visual poem where sequencing was all important , and these frames just do n't fit .
One that did - and a picture Frank has been known to describe as his favourite - is the crowd in frame 13 .
It could easily be overlooked as just a jumble of people , an easy shot .
Yet , next time you are out with a camera near a crowded street try taking a picture like this one .
Every face is separated from the others .
Almost no - one is looking at the camera .
This is life passing in a frame .
As Frank himself said of the picture , " the people walk this way and this way , they are young and they are old , they are fat and thin , everything Is there . "
Perhaps that is the key and why Frank 's work stands the test of time .
These frames all look so rushed , so haphazard .
And yet , they work so well , they have balance throughout each frame .
And this is the point - Frank had the desire and courage to throw away good frames .
He had something to say , and that 's the power of photography .
To have a point of view at the heart of the work is what projects this photographic document to the top of the heap , even 50 years on .

It 's a bit cliche , but the message still holds true : when the President of the United States speaks , the world listens .
Such was the case when President Obama laid out his recent economic stimulus plan with the desire to invest billions of dollars towards the expansion of broadband access across America .
Now , Britain is once again following in America 's footsteps , this time in the field of technology .
If all goes well , the government predicts that every home in Britain could have Internet access by 2012 .
( Source : nytimes.com )
The U.K. government wants to make broadband a universal signal , kind of like television , using a blend of fixed lines and wireless technologies .
It is estimated that about 60 percent of British households currently have Internet access in some capacity .
There is one foreseeable problem to issuing nation - wide broadband : more homes connected to the Internet means the greater chance for unethical behavior , including music and film piracy .
British to Crack Down on Broadband Piracy
In response to these concerns , the British government plans to crack down on all forms of online piracy with hefty sanctions against violators .
While the government has promised to establish new piracy laws , enforcing them is up to the various Internet service providers across Britain .
This means that persistent pirates will receive several warning letters , with extreme cases winding up in British courts .
Eircom , the leading provider of Internet access in Ireland , has agreed to abide by the proposed British laws .
Likewise , the French government is also in the process of passing legislation to crack down on online pirates across that country .
( Source : iht.com )
And yet , many music and film executives and industry pundits are concerned over the potential backlash of enraged listeners and viewers .
Expect much more jostling to establish compromises among the music , film and telecommunications industries before any legislation is actually passed in Britain .

That 's the best time .
If you do n't come , I 'll drive down here to see you .
I 'll pick you up outside the factory .
You 'll be my pickup .
Oh , we 'll arrange it somehow , whatever way we can .
We 'll have such wonderful times together , just the two of us .

Miss World finalist 2o year old Maria Bridi da Costa , had her hands and feet amputated after contracting a virus that could have been fatal .
Initially when she fell ill on December 30 , 2008 she was diagnosed with kidney stones .
However , she had an infection known as Septicamia set in her limbs which cut off her circulation thus resulting in amputation .
Maria ’s boyfriend Thiago Simones told sources
“ We are all absolutely distraught and are just praying now that she can pull through . ”
UPDATE : Officials say Brazilian model and former Miss World finalist , whose feet and hands were amputated because of an infection has died .
Officials said in a statement early Saturday that 20 - year - old Mariana Bridi ’s condition deteriorated overnight .
She died at 2:30 a.m .
The Espirito Santo State Health Secretariat said in the statement she died from complications related to a generalized infection .
It was caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which is known to be resistant to multiple kinds of antibiotics .
The beauty pageant contestant was suffering a generalized infection that forced the amputation of her hands and feet earlier this week because the flow of oxygen to her limbs was reduced .

Sepsis is a serious medical condition characterized by a half - body inflammatory state ( called a systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS ) caused by infection .
The body may develop this inflammatory response to microbes in the blood .
The related layman ’s term is blood poisoning .
Septicemia is an ill - defined term referring to the presence of bacteria or their toxins in the blood .
The term improperly mixes components of bacteremia and sepsis , and has been abandoned as a concept .
Sepsis is usually treated in the intensive care unit with intravenous fluids and antibiotics .
If fluid replacement is insufficient to maintain blood pressure , specific vasopressor drugs can be used .
Artificial ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys , respectively .
To guide therapy , a central venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be placed .
Sepsis patients require preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis , stress ulcers and pressure ulcers , unless other conditions prevent this .
Some patients might benefit from tight control of blood sugar levels with insulin ( targeting stress hyperglycemia ) , low - dose corticosteroids or activated drotrecogin alfa ( recombinant protein C ) .

The Texas authorities called in the FBI and SEC … which did nothing .
What you have here is a long running U.S. Intelligence operation that became so large and sloppy that it finally blew up .
Oh yeah , I wonder what went on in the Bogota , Colombia office …
Via : Houston Chronicle :
The SEC only has the authority to pursue civil actions , leaving the decision to pursue criminal charges to the Justice Department and FBI .
An SEC spokesman indicated that the FBI was examining documents and other materials seized in the SEC ’s fraud probe .
“ We are certainly in contact with the SEC and we are aware of their investigation but we are not going to discuss any ongoing matters , ” said FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap .
Stanford , a once high - flying businessman whose investment firm ’s affiliates stretch from Bogota , Colombia , to Quito , Ecuador , has denied having ties to foreign drug barons and never has been charged with a crime related to his banking .
In 1999 , Stanford willingly turned over the $ 3 million from his bank after federal agents found it had come from a drug cartel .
In fact , at the time , Stanford ’s cooperation won him praise from authorities who said he had not intentionally accepted drug money .
Around the same time , however , Texas securities regulators found evidence of potential money laundering involving Stanford , an official said Friday in Austin .
But , because the activity involved offshore banks , it was referred to the FBI and SEC .
“ Why it took 10 years for the feds to move on it , I cannot answer , ” Securities Commissioner Denise Voigt Crawford told the Senate Finance Committee in Austin .
Later , she added , “ We worked with the FBI and the SEC and basically gave them the case .
We told them what we ’d seen and they were going to run with it . ”
CHAPTER XVIX
MASONRY & THE MORMON
TEMPLE CEREMONY
Few Mormons realize that the LDS temple ceremony is not of ancient origin , nor of modern revelation .
Instead , the ceremony originated around 1790 when the Masons first conceived it for use in their secret society .
Until 1990 the Mormon Temple Ceremony closely resembled the Masonic Initiators Ceremony , signs , tokens and penalties included .
I never made the connection between Masonry and Mormonism until I began a serious study of the Mormon temple ceremony .
In 1827 Capt. W. M. Morgan , a disillusioned Mason , published a book entitled Freemasonry Exposed , which reveals a detailed description of their ceremonies in word and illustration .
Because of this expos� , Morgan was murdered three months later by members of his lodge .
After Morgan 's death , his widow , Lucinda Pendleton Morgan , a very pretty and intelligent woman married George W. Harris on January 12 , 1831 .
While married to Harris , Lucinda became one of the first plural wives of the prophet Joseph Smith in 1838 .
It seems likely that Smith married her while living at the Harris home .
This circumstance would seem to corroborate the story of Mrs. Sarah Pratt , who related in an interview with W. Wyl , " Mrs. Harris was a married lady , a very great friend of mine .
When Joseph made his dastardly attempt on me [ in 1842 ] , I went to Mrs. Harris to unbosom my grief to her .
To my utter astonishment , she said , laughing heartily : " How foolish you are !
Why , I am his mistress since four years . ' "
( No Man Knows My History by Fawn Brodie , p. 460 . )
Mormon leaders proclaim that the temple endowment was given to Joseph Smith by revelation , but after reading the book Freemasonry Exposed , I seriously questioned the validity of the Church 's claim .
After reading only a few pages of the book I could see the unmistakable similarities between the Masonic Initiation Ceremony and the Mormon Temple Ceremony .
Joseph Smith became a Mason on March 15 , 1842 and rose to the sublime degree the following day .
This initiation took place in his upper business office or Masonic lodge room ( History of the Church , vol. 4 , p. 550-551 ) .
Only a few weeks after Joseph 's initiation into Masonry , he taught the other LDS Church leaders in the same Masonic lodge room .
Joseph 's interest in Masonry became so infectious that many Mormon elders hastened to follow his lead , and within six months the lodge had 286 candidates .
He gave instructions on the principles and order of the Priesthood , attending to washings , anointing , endowments , and the communication of keys .
( Ibid . vol. 5 , p. 2 ) There is no doubt that Joseph 's primary interest in Masonry was because of its ritual .
Like Solomon , he became a temple builder .
Joseph Smith 's own temple records indicate his temple endowment took place on May 4 , 1842 , just seven weeks after his Masonic initiation .
In Smith 's own words he said : " In the evening I received the first degree in Freemasonry in the Nauvoo Lodge . "
The next day he stated : " I was with the Masonic Lodge and rose to the sublime degree . "
This qualified Joseph to be a Master Mason .
( Ibid . 1842 vol. 4 , p. 552 )
Joseph Smith Sr. , Joseph Smith Jr. , Hyrum Smith , Brigham Young , Heber C. Kimball , Newel K. Whitney , John C. Bennett , John Taylor , Sidney Rigdon , and other Mormons were Masons .
Shortly after their temple endowment ceremonies , Joseph Smith Jr. and other Mormons were expelled from the Masonic order for violating their oaths .
It was May 4 , 1842 that Joseph Smith introduced the Masonic Ceremony as the Mormon Temple Ceremony and declared that it was " received as a revelation from God . "
( History of the Church , vol. 5 , pp. 1 - 2 )
When Dr. Reed Durham , director of the LDS Institute of Religion , made this discovery in 1974 and gave a speech on the subject of the Mormon - Mason connection before the Utah History Association on April 20 , 1974 , he was highly criticized for making this matter public .
He also showed the Jupiter talisman during that speech , and explained that Joseph had carried it on his person since 1826 ( the same year he was convicted of money - digging charges and being a believer in magic ) , and that he had the Jupiter talisman on him at the time of his death .
The talisman contains symbols relating to astrology and magic , and there were other magical items discovered at the same time that belonged to Hyrum Smith .
Although most Mormon historians do not mention these facts in their church - authorized writings ( including Mormon deception , intimidation , repression , theft , and violence as well as other matters that might call into question the sacred nature and integrity of the Mormon experience ) , they have to admit that the endowment ceremony contains many details that are similar to the Masonic initiation rites of the 1800's , especially since Joseph became a Mason such a short time prior to the " revelation .

**********
It may seem surprising that Joseph Smith would incorporate so much Masonry into the endowment ceremony in the very weeks when all his leading men were being inducted into the Masonic lodge .
They would have been blind indeed not to see the parallelism between the costuming , the grips , passwords , keys , and oaths .
However , Smith covered his bases when he told the men that the endowment ceremony had to be restored to the original and pure form of Adam 's time .
According to Smith the Masons had corrupted the ceremony originated by God in Solomon 's time by removing and changing many parts .
Smith also made free use of other Masonic symbols -- the beehive , ( Utah is known by Mormons as the Beehive State ) the all - seeing eye ( which is still visible in the St. George , Utah Tabernacle ) , the clasped hands , and the point within the circle .
The Masonic square and compass are cut into the temple garment on the breast and a slash is made across the knee .
There is also a slash in the garment across the abdomen , symbolic of the disemboweling that would be the fate of anyone who reveals the sacred oaths .
Former BYU historian Michael Quinn has done extensive research on rites and ancient mysteries related to occultism .
Quinn states , " The following are ten essential characteristics common to both occult rituals and the Mormon Temple ceremony . "
1 ) They are revealed by God from the beginning , but distorted through apostasy .
2 ) They place an emphasis on the worthiness of initiates .
3 ) They include washings and anointing , a new name and garments .
4 ) They emphasize vows of non-disclosure .
5 ) There are both lesser and greater rituals .
6 ) They feature presentation of the ritual through drama .
7 ) They contain an oath of chastity requiring strict purity and virtue of the participants .
8 ) They feature prominent use of the sun , moon and stars as key symbols .
9 ) The purpose of the ritual is to assist the mortals to godhood .
10 ) They employ titles and offices of prophets , priests and kings to those in leadership .
Michael Quinn commented that the ancient occult mysteries and the Mormon endowment manifest both philosophical and structural kinship .
While Mormon apologists have a hard time explaining the fact that the Bible does not support the doctrine of baptism for the dead or temple marriage , they are faced with an even greater problem when they turn to The Book of Mormon .
Since
The Book of Mormon is supposed to contain the fullness of the gospel , why does n't it contain even one passage to support either of these two doctrines ?
It 's interesting to note that the same revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants that contains the information concerning Temple Marriage is also the revelation that contains the teaching of polygamy .
Therefore , ' polygamy ' and ' temple marriage ' must stand or fall together .
The Blacks ...
Until 1978 , persons with any known trace of black African ancestry were not permitted to enter a Mormon temple , even if they were otherwise worthy members of the Church .
Joseph Smith taught that Negroes ( blacks ) are the descendants of Cain . ( J. S. History , vol. 4 , p. 501 ) Brigham
Young was equally adamant about the status of the blacks .
Young said ; " Blacks are cursed with a flat nose and black skin " .
( Journal of Discourses , vol. 7 , pp. 290-291 ) " Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race ?
If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain , the penalty , under the law of God , is death on the spot .
This will always be so . "
Brigham
Young also said " �that if the priesthood was ever given to the Blacks , on that very day and hour , if we should do so , the priesthood will be taken from this church . "
( Brigham Young Addresses , p. 61 ) Pres. Joseph Fielding Smith said : " They are an inferior race , and their intelligence is stunted . "
Apostle Bruce McConkie said : " The Negroes were less valiant in the preexistence , and therefore spiritually restricted . "
In spite of earlier revelations concerning the blacks , in 1978 the leaders of the Mormon Church announced that they had received a revelation allowing all worthy male members to receive the Priesthood .
( D&C , p. 293 ) .
On June 13 , 1978 the Salt Lake Tribune reported that President Kimball refused to discuss the revelation that changed the Church 's 148 - year - old policy against ordination of blacks , saying it was a personal thing .
Kimball said : " The revelation came at this time because conditions and people have changed .
It 's a different world than it was 20 or 25 years ago .
The world is ready for it . "

Maddow : Obama 's Iraq plan ' more like a Bush plan ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday February 25 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama is expected to announce on Friday that he intends to withdraw roughly two - thirds of US troops from Iraq by August 2010 .
This anticipated 19 - month timetable falls well short of Obama 's campaign promise to have all troops out of Iraq by sixteen months after his inauguration .
MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow suggested on Tuesday that the administration was hoping for the Iraq news to be " sort of buried " in the excitement over Obama 's speech on economic issues before a joint session of Congress .
However , she did not believe this tactic would be successful .
" I do think they expect ... a little bit of heat from the left on this , from the anti-war majority in this country , " Maddow explained , " and I expect that the timing of this announcement will not be enough to dampen that criticism .
...
It looks very much more like a Bush plan than it did like a Barack - Obama - the - campaigner plan . "
The statement on Iraq at Obama 's campaign website reads :
" Immediately upon taking office , Obama will give his Secretary of Defense and military commanders a new mission in Iraq : ending the war .
The removal of our troops will be responsible and phased , directed by military commanders on the ground and done in consultation with the Iraqi government .
Military experts believe we can safely redeploy combat brigades from Iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months .
That would be the summer of 2010  more than 7 years after the war began .
" Under the Obama - Biden plan , a residual force will remain in Iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter - terrorism missions against al Qaeda in Iraq and to protect American diplomatic and civilian personnel .
They will not build permanent bases in Iraq , but will continue efforts to train and support the Iraqi security forces as long as Iraqi leaders move toward political reconciliation and away from sectarianism . "
The plan that is expected to be announced this week is being described as " a compromise between the 16 - month withdrawal timetable President Obama advocated during his campaign and the military 's proposal for a 23 - month time frame . "
General Ray Odiermo , the top US commander in Iraq , had pressed for the 23 - month plan in hopes of avoiding having to withdraw any US forces at all before next fall 's Iraqi elections but finally conceded to a 19 - month schedule .
" You do something like this when you do n't want this news to survive the very competitive news cycle to make it onto the front page of tomorrow 's papers , " Maddow commented .
" This is a really big , important announcement .
This is how the Iraq War ends , and it is essentially going to be buried by this speech tonight . "
In addition to extending the timetable , the latest plan also defines the ' residual force ' as consisting of up to 50,000 troops , who will remain in Iraq to perform training , logistics , and other non-combat roles .
Maddow was also skeptical of this apparent shift .
" I think they are going to try to minimize the importance of this , " she suggested , " and say , ' Oh , so we said that everybody but a residual force would be out by June of next year .
It turns out what we meant was that 50,000 Americans will still be there in August of next year .' ...
That does n't seem to be to be close at all . "
" If they do want to get subtle , " Maddow concluded , " and they do want to get honest and they do want to have high expectations for what we can understand about national security and war , they will talk about why 50,000 troops is a ' residual force ' -- why we need that many people there for that long and what our troops are actually going to be doing .

SOUTH HAMILTON -
While daydreaming in his high school chemistry class , hockey goaltender Trevor Leahy began to think about the opposing forwards who buzz around him when Pingree School hits the ice .
What are they looking for , he asked himself .
Open net .
But why does he wear dark blue pads that let shooters zero in on a target ?
Using computer skills he learned in a graphic design class at the private school in South Hamilton , Leahy sketched out new leg pads that blend into the goal netting behind him .
He wanted pads , a trapper , and a blocker that are white with a raised double - stitched design , just like the goal .
He applied for a design patent and had them custom - made by a Canada - based pad maker .
" When the shooter comes down and only has a split second to shoot the puck , they 're looking for net , " said Leahy , a senior from Hampton , N.H. , who grew up in Byfield .
" If you put the net on the pad , they 'll shoot at the pad instead of the goal . "
Since the days when Boston Bruins ' goaltender Gerry Cheevers started inking stitches onto his mask each time the equipment protected his face , many goalies have expressed their individuality with designs and paintings on their mask or other pieces of equipment .
But Leahy 's design - essentially a camouflage for a goal that is 4 feet high and 6 feet wide - has hockey players and coaches amazed and impressed .
Darren Stomp , the custom pad maker from Kingsville , Ontario , who designed Leahy 's equipment , has had other goaltenders ask him to add orange and black tiger stripes and other designs .
But those changes were cosmetic .
" It might be the most clever idea , " Stomp said .
" I do n't think there 's any question it will work , although to what degree depends on the shooter and the situation . "
So far , Leahy has logged two shutouts with the pads .
In practice , two of Pingree 's top scorers say , the illusion is particularly effective when there 's a scramble in front of the net and they need to shoot quickly .
" When you 're in close and you do n't have a lot of time to think , it does catch your eye , and you do shoot toward it sometimes , " said Matt MacDonald , a cocaptain from Byfield .
Both MacDonald and senior Tony Sardo of Gloucester say they have fired the puck directly into Leahy 's pads .
The illusion diminishes if they are farther from the net , with more time to shoot .
" I 've never seen anything like them , " Sardo said of the pads .
Not everyone is as sold on the theory .
In the locker room after a recent 4 - 3 overtime loss , players from Dexter School of Brookline said that they barely noticed the design on the pads and that it did n't attract their attention - or their shots .

Bi-Weekly Newsletter of Judaic Theocracy
Week of 22 Nissan , 5768 / April 27 , 2008
Editor : Boruch ( Bryan ) Ellison
NOTE : We must make this issue the last one for a few months .
It 's simply becoming too time - consuming to keep writing this informal newsletter , and that 's cutting into our work to prepare other publishing projects  such as the resumption of ATTAC Report  thereby creating intolerable delays .
So to give ourselves more time to invest in other projects , we 're suspending this newsletter for now .
Later this year , we can re-evaluate the situation and decide if it 's time to resume publication .
Until then , we hope to put out occasional updates , especially on the status of the PLO - defunding campaign .
Until we have more volunteer and financial support , there 's only so much we can do at any given time .
But by investing our time and effort now in bigger things , we 're creating the foundation for a more successful movement down the road .
In the meantime , there are 118 issues of this newsletter , packed with vital perspective and information , archived and available for study .

" Issues of World War III " Survey
" How should we deal with the crisis in Red Chinese - occupied Tibet ? "
Most responding readers did n't hold back ; they advocated declaring war on Red China to solve the problem once and for all .
But a minority did opt for economic sanctions as a means of toppling the regime .
No one seemed to trust , or at any rate prefer , allowing the Tibetan independence movement to lead the way in freeing Tibet .
Factual Background :
Over the last couple of months , western audiences have been inundated with stories and images of repression in remote Tibet , deep in the interior of Communist - occupied China , and of angry protesters attacking Olympic torch processions .
But there is good reason to be sure the entire display is simply a highly coordinated theatrical production , engineered by the Communists themselves , to pave the way for more spectacular disinformation .
A tremendous body of evidence  including the authoritative revelations of the highest - level Soviet defector of all time , KGB Major Anatoliy Golitsyn  proves decisively that the inner leadership of the Communist Bloc decided , at least as early as the mid-1950s , to stage a long - term deception that would lull non-Communist nations into a trap of disarmament and surrender .
The plan included a " final phase " during which Communist regimes would temporarily pretend to " collapse " ( while retaining full police - state power ) even as they quietly accelerated the world revolution , expanded espionage and subversion , and mobilized for war .
Golitsyn predicted , with stunning perfection , the " changes " in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union several years before they happened , in his 1984 book , New Lies for Old ( the manuscript having been written more than a decade earlier ) .
Although the first round of Communist renewal ( the so - called " collapse " in Eastern Europe ) did not achieve all the effects on western attitudes that the Communists had hoped , they are now preparing for a second major round of such deception in some of the remaining countries still widely recognized as being Communist .
In recent years , they have orchestrated re-renewals ( second " collapses " ) in Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan , Ukraine , and Georgia , and now appear to be setting the stage for extending the renewal to the following regimes , at minimum :
Zimbabwe : Having occupied the former Rhodesia since 1979 , the Communists have had plenty of time to bring the entire population under the tight control of the secret police and Communist network of cadre activists , so that no genuine opposition could possibly exist in that African nation .
The so - called " opposition , " the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and its leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , are simply an arm of the Communist apparatus that has been invented for the purpose of transferring power without weakening Communism in the slightest , as we documented in our August 5 , 2007 , issue of this newsletter .
Now the Communists have allowed the MDC to " win " an election , and are testing the waters to see if that " regime change " will be believed by the outside world .

Now the Communists have allowed the MDC to " win " an election , and are testing the waters to see if that " regime change " will be believed by the outside world .
Cuba :
The Communist police state has ruled that island nation with an iron fist since 1959 .
For many years now , the secret police have gradually built the illusion of an " opposition " for a phony transfer of power ; during the 1990s , the regime floated trial balloons to see if the timing was right for a renewal , but temporarily backed off .
Their reason may have had much to do with an October , 1994 article we published in a newsletter , which exposed the " opposition 's " ties to the regime and warned of the coming deception ; that article was re-published on ATTAC Report in 2005 , where it remains today .
We again warned of the imminent theatrical " regime change " in our August 27 , 2006 , issue of this newsletter .
The Cuban Communists are again feeding rumors of approaching " democratization " in the wake of Fidel Castro 's retirement .

Iran :
Also controlled by the Communists ( though not identifying themselves with the hammer - and - sickle emblem openly ) since 1979 , Iran now has a fabricated " opposition " that we exposed in our June 24 , 2007 , issue of this newsletter .
The regime periodically sends out feelers to see if that renewal would be believed , and you will probably hear more about it in the relatively near future .

Red China :
The 1989 massacre in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square was part of a sophisticated deception to pass off the phony " democratic opposition " as genuine in western eyes .
An article I wrote in the January 1 , 1991 , issue of The New American magazine exposed the " opposition " as being entirely a creation of the Chinese Communist apparatus , preparing the way for yet another bogus " regime change . "
That article , which was re-published in 2005 on ATTAC Report , received much public attention and undoubtedly played a major role in causing the Red Chinese regime to postpone its " democratic renewal . "
But now they 're once again testing public reaction to see if the time is right , using Tibetan " opposition " as the bait .
The Red Chinese regime has certainly ensured that no outsider can possibly check the authenticity of the alleged " uprising " in Tibet .
Foreign journalists have been blocked from entering the area , and all " information " comes only through testimony of Chinese and Tibetans , often on the Internet to which ordinary citizens do not have access , who are able to contact outsiders .
The Red regime , which has occupied China since 1949 and has genocidally exterminated at least 140 million Chinese while operating over 10,000 concentration camps , is well able to prevent any possibility of a genuine " opposition " with its millions of secret police agents , informants , and Communist Party cadre .
Thus the " testimony " can only be carefully crafted disinformation , delivered by agents of the regime posing as " dissidents . "
In all likelihood , there is no genuine rioting at all in Tibet .
Indeed , some of the Tibetan " opposition 's " key supporters are themselves agents of Communism :
The Red Chinese regime has gone out of its way to draw as much favorable attention as possible to the Dalai Lama , leader of Tibetan Buddhism in exile in India , by blaming him for the alleged " uprising . "
But while posing as a " dissident " himself , the Dalai Lama has a background as a top Communist in Red China ; in the 1950s , he was named vice chairman of the National People 's Congress , the highest legislative body of the Communist state , as well as a top leader of the Communist administration over Tibet .
It was Red Chinese dictator Mao tse - Tung who arranged these positions .
And despite later claiming to oppose the Red Chinese government , the Dalai Lama has emphatically made clear he admires Marxism and considers himself " half - Marxist , half - Buddhist " ( his own words ) ; he also pointedly opposes any move to overthrow Chinese Communism , or even Communism in Tibet , and even explicitly advocates making Chinese Communism more Marxist .
This gives some clearer notion of just what the Dalai Lama means by advocating a world government  presumably a Communist one .

A prominent advocate of the Tibetan " opposition " is Ruan Ming , former speechwriter for top Chinese Communist Hu Yaobang , the former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s .
Hu Yaobang played a major role in organizing the phony " democratic opposition " in China even while holding his post as a top Communist .
That places Ruan Ming as a key Communist in the Chinese " opposition , " and now in the Tibetan " opposition " as well .
( Interestingly , Ruan Ming recently admitted that the Chinese Communists , in his own words , " carefully staged the unrest in Tibet to deceive the world " ; apparently Ruan was responding to the suspicions of outsiders , trying to make sure that suspicion would not fall on him , but he quickly downplayed the significance of that deception and insisted that the Tibetan " opposition " was nevertheless real . )

Despite claiming to oppose the Sudanese dictatorship , the Coalition refuses to identify Sudan 's regime as being Communist ( which it has been since 1969 ) , and the Coalition 's primary objective is to have the Communist - controlled United Nations ( UN ) send in forces to restore order in Sudan 's Darfur region  in other words , to protect the Communists while they continue their genocide , rather than to stop the murder .
The Coalition includes such Communist - front groups as the NAACP , which has long tried to organize black revolution in the United States in conjunction with the Black Panthers and other terrorists ; the Arab - American Institute , a U.S. - based front for the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) ; the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , another front for PLO - affiliated groups ; the National Council of Churches ( NCC ) , a front for the Soviet KGB that seeks to transform Christianity into a Marxist revolutionary movement along the lines of " Liberation Theology " ; and many others .

A prominent spokesman on behalf of the Tibetan " opposition " at protest rallies has been South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , an explicitly Marxist proponent of " Liberation Theology " who is closely affiliated with the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) and the terrorist African National Congress ( ANC ) ( itself controlled by the SACP and logistically supported by the PLO ) .
Tutu has for many years favored speaking at Communist rallies in South Africa in front of large Soviet flags with the hammer - and - sickle emblem , and he is an overt anti-Semite who proudly supports the PLO revolution .

Leaders of the neo-Communist regimes in the Czech Republic , Soviet Estonia , and Poland have also spoken in support of the Tibetan " opposition . "
It is entirely possible that the Red Chinese regime is planning to orchestrate a phony " breakup " of Red China , similar to the illusory " breakup " of the Soviet Union in 1991 , which would involve Tibetan " independence " under a neo-Communist regime posing as being " democratic , " in parallel with a similar move in the rest of occupied China .
But nothing would change in reality , other than Red China 's acceleration of the revolution and preparations for war .
Relevant Torah Principles :
1 ) One of the 613 Torah commandments for Jews requires the absolute extermination of all members of the nation of Amalek , the central force in subversion and world revolution for thousands of years .
Not one member of Amalek , nor of the other people recruited to Amaleki revolution , may be left alive , for otherwise they would simply pick up the pieces and start the revolution all over again .
Anything less than total annihilation leaves the Amaleki world revolution intact .
2 ) The first task of Moshiach ( the Messianic king ) is to fulfill that commandment and lead the Jewish people in a war to finish off the last traces of Amalek and its revolution .
This must be completed before the third and permanent Temple can be built in Jerusalem .
Since Moshiach is coming in our generation , sometime in the next few years ( as confirmed by the fulfillment of all the prophetic signs in our times , and by the official proclamations of the Lubavitcher Rebbe and other leading rabbis of our generation ) , the annihilation of Amalek is rapidly approaching .
3 ) Although an offensive war to exterminate Amalek requires the Messianic king , a defensive war does not .
When Amalek has attacked first and launched a war of extermination against us , we are required to fight back even before Moshiach arrives .
And since Amalek can only be defeated through annihilation , we must fight in such a way as not just to defeat the enemy , but also to wipe them out entirely  or as much as possible prior to the leadership of the Messiah .
4 ) These rules now apply to gentiles as well , under the Noahide Law of establishing justice , which requires the victorious waging of war to protect one 's nation .
Thus gentiles , too , must drop all other concerns and turn their attention to the physical eradication of all Communists and their allies .
Analysis :
Communism does not simply vanish on its own , nor has it fallen from power until the Communists and their collaborators have been exterminated .
Given the current size of the Chinese Communist Party and its secret police apparatus , the Red regime could not possibly be overthrown until a minimum of some 50 million Chinese Communists have been killed .
Anything less than that would be just another illusion , a deception to fool outsiders into piecemeal surrender in carefully designed traps .
Sanctions are required , of course ; no financial or technological assistance may be given to the Communists .
But it will also be necessary to launch full war to exterminate the Communists in China themselves .
That , in turn , would remove one of the fundamental pillars of the world Communist revolution , undermining support to Marxist revolutionaries throughout the world and hastening the arrival of the Messiah , who will finish the cleanup process at that time .
Subversion Alert
This week : Rabbi Shear Yashuv Cohen , part 6
The " Sanhedrin , " formed about four years ago , tries to portray itself as the legitimate authority of orthodox Judaism and of right - wing Israeli Jews .
But as we have repeatedly exposed in this column over the last couple of years , the " Sanhedrin " is largely composed of , and entirely run by , subversive agents of the Kremlin in Moscow , rendering it an entirely illegitimate body that will be replaced by a genuine Sanhedrin in just a few years , when Moshiach ( the Messianic king ) arrives .
The bogus nature of the current " Sanhedrin " is underscored by its ties to interfaith subversion of Judaism , links that reveal the phony " Sanhedrin 's " own barely hidden ecumenical goals .
Among the top members of the Moscow - controlled " Sanhedrin " are several leaders of the Temple Mount movement , especially the Temple Institute , including Rabbi Yisrael ( Yaakov ) Ariel , a constant advocate of liberalizing Jewish religious standards and rules .
The Temple movement has been encouraging Jews to violate Torah Law by entering the holy Temple Mount and establishing worship there , which is forbidden until after Moshiach has annihilated the evil forces of the Amaleki underground and has established full Jewish control of the Temple area .
The bogus " Sanhedrin " is not only linked to the Temple Institute , it has openly worked with the organization to promote its agenda .
Among the supporters and proponents of the Temple Institute 's agenda is former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu , a close affiliate of the Communist - front , interfaith Root and Branch Association ( R & B ) and one of R & B's primary agents for subverting the movement to teach gentiles the Seven Noahide Laws .
Another Temple movement supporter is Rabbi Shear Yashuv Cohen , chief rabbi of Haifa , Israel  the very same Rabbi Cohen who , as we have shown in recent issues , has been for many years one of the biggest interfaith subverters of Judaism , hopping from one meeting to another with everyone from Christian to Muslim clerics ( most of them Communist agents , at that ! ) to the bizarre , " New Age " Oomoto cult of Kyoto , Japan .
Cohen wants to unite all these religions together with Judaism under one , international umbrella , which , of course , would be controlled by the Soviet Russian KGB .
In short , the phony " Sanhedrin " and its interlocking allies , R & B , the Temple Institute , and the New Jewish Congress , are working on behalf of Moscow to lure orthodox Jews into the interfaith agenda  by subtly twisting and subverting the Noahide campaign and the Israeli right wing .
Among other evidences of the " Sanhedrin 's " ecumenical agenda are the following :
The " Sanhedrin's " leader , Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz , openly participated in the KGB - run interfaith meeting in Moscow , Soviet Russia , in 2006 , which aimed to bring all world religions under Soviet control .
Steinsaltz himself has been heavily promoted by the KGB over the years , and has close ties to Fabian Socialist organizations and individuals .

Steinsaltz himself has been heavily promoted by the KGB over the years , and has close ties to Fabian Socialist organizations and individuals .
The second - in - command of the " Sanhedrin , " Rabbi Yoel Schwartz , made a public speech at an early " Sanhedrin " meeting advocating the key components of the interfaith agenda , even using ecumenical propaganda phrases that originated with the Communists .
Schwartz has long been an overt agent of R & B and a leader of subverting the Noahide teachings .

Schwartz has long been an overt agent of and a leader of subverting the Noahide teachings .
The " Sanhedrin " itself proposed organizing an international interfaith meeting in Jerusalem , even going so far as to announce it was planning to invite Communist Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( the notorious advocate of exterminating Israel and Jews ) !
To emphasize the subversive nature of the planned conference ( which never did take place , presumably because of orthodox backlash ) , " Sanhedrin " spokesman  and R & B member  Professor Hillel Weiss denounced the Jewish teachings of the Noahide Laws as being " primitive and racist , " an approach that would be altered by the " Sanhedrin 's " interfaith meeting .
The Communists can see that they wo n't be able to pull most orthodox
Jews into the interfaith merger of religions directly , using the front door .
So they must use the back door , disguising ecumenism behind other , carefully manipulated issues in order to pull religious Jews into an agenda they do n't perceive  until it 's too late .
The strategy includes twisting the teaching of the Noahide Laws , to turn them into an interfaith philosophy , and neutralizing the Israeli right wing from fighting PLO funding by diverting it into false debates over the Temple Mount .
This strategy is the very reason for the existence of R & B , the bogus " Sanhedrin , " and the Temple Institute .
And Rabbi Shear Yashuv
Cohen is one of the key links that reveals the underlying agenda .
When Moshiach comes in just the next few years , he and the authentic Sanhedrin will quickly move to prosecute and execute the members of the phony " Sanhedrin " for treason , as is required by Torah Law regarding mosrim ( spies amongst the Jewish people ) .

This Week 's Update at Hasidic University
The newest update of our sister site , Hasidic University , features 60 new profiles regarding the Noahide Laws :
Blasphemy : Two commandments newly listed .
Gentiles are able to sanctify substituted animals ( temurah ) , but theres a dispute as to whether thats by Torah Law or rabbinically .

Theft : Nineteen commandments newly listed .
There are a variety of theft - related offenses for which gentiles would face death penalty .
But they would not be held liable for most types of civil damages under Torah Law , nor would additional , court - mandated tort liabilities be nearly as extravagant as those practiced today in American courts .

Inapplicable : Thirty - four commandments newly listed .
Gentiles may not bring sacrificial offerings as atonement for sins , they do not have the ability to sanctify first - born or tithed animals , and the laws of ritual impurity  and purification  do not apply to them .
Nor may they establish their own cities of refuge .

Uncertain :
One commandment newly listed .
Theres a major dispute among the rabbinical sages as to whether gentiles may sacrifice animals as voluntary peace - offerings ; if so , the prohibition on switching a consecrated animal from a burnt offering to a peace - offering , or vice versa , would apply to them .
YOUR TIME IS NEEDED MORE BADLY THAN YOUR MONEY !
We need more volunteers , Israeli as much as American , to approach nervous , spineless " refusenik " rabbis to ask them why they refused , and to lobby them to change their mind .
With even just a little pressure , we can quickly turn many of them to endorse the PLO - defunding campaign .

Terrorism Update : Summary of PLO - related terror attacks these last three weeks , Wednesday , April 9 , through Tuesday , April 29 : Palestinian ( National ) Liberation Movement ( Fatah ) : The PLO 's largest group , under the command of the Soviet - trained Mahmoud Abbas , operated under a number of its subsidiary names  the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , the Al - Mujahideen Brigades , the Kamal Udwan Brigades , the Tanzim militia  in conducting terrorist attacks .
By using those front names , Fatah cashes Uncle Sam 's paychecks while relying on the left - wing news media and the Bush Administration to blame the attacks on those " other " groups ; the PLO is hoping the average American does n't realize that all those subsidiary militias are openly affiliated with Fatah .
Under whichever banners , Fatah members went on a terror spree .
They boasted of firing at least a dozen Qassam missiles at populated civilian areas , and on their own or together with the PFLP , the Islamic Jihad , and the PRC , they bombarded Israeli civilians and soldiers alike with mortar shells , assassinations , gun battles , at least one anti-tank missile , and one failed kidnapping attempt .
The casualties were n't just Israeli Jews .
On two occasions , Fatah members joined with their comrades in the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , many of whom are Fatah members themselves , in firing randomly on palestinian Arab bystanders in the West Bank .
At least half a dozen Arabs were wounded .
Fatah and the PA then cheekily passed off the attacks as if they were actually trying to shoot themselves and , while missing each other , just " happened " to hit the civilian Arabs with chilling precision .
The point is , of course , terrorism to intimidate the hapless palestinian Arab population into submission and support of the Communist revolution .
Because of tight , police - state controls in PLO - occupied zones , we can't be sure just how many Arabs they 're murdering ( though they 've certainly slaughtered thousands over the last twenty years ) , but at any rate it is a foretaste of the genocidal mass - murder they plan against palestinian Arabs once the PLO can seize full , uncontested power .

Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) :
The PFLP wears no mask to hide its Marxist - Leninist agenda of world revolution or its fanatical , homicidal atheism .
Its terror cells fired some two dozen Qassam missiles from the Gaza Strip , sending the explosive warheads directly at residential neighborhoods , and then proudly took credit for their heroic strikes against unarmed civilians .
They also launched at least 3 longer - range , Soviet Russian Grad Katyusha missiles at the coastal city of Ashkelon , and boasted of that , too .
Their thirst for blood not yet quenched , they joined with their comrades in Fatah in firing mortar shells at homes and heavy machine guns at medical rescue workers .
And yes , they gleefully took credit for those bold assaults , too .
Given the fact that they work so closely with Fatah , as well as being a full member group under the PLO umbrella , means you can be absolutely sure they 're sharing in your tax dollars .
That 's what makes it possible for them to afford the enormously expensive manufacture of missiles , the training of professional terrorists , the coordination of suicide bombings , and so forth .
But do n't think they 'll appreciate America for all the largesse ; they 'll use U.S. dollars to go after Americans , too .

But do n't think they 'll appreciate America for all the largesse ; they 'll use U.S. dollars to go after Americans , too .
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( DFLP ) :
An offshoot of the PFLP , the equally Marxist - Leninist DFLP has already used American dollars to murder Americans ; after all , they took credit for the 9/11 attacks on New York City and Washington , DC , and the hijackers on board at least two of the doomed flights were wearing red headbands , the trademark symbol of the DFLP ( and its parent PFLP ) .
As a member group of the PLO , the DFLP certainly covers its expenses with U.S. tax money .
On their own and together with the PFLP , the Democratic Front fired several Qassam missiles at residential areas and then publicly took credit .
Meanwhile , George Bush continues to protect the PLO and its DFLP , blaming Qassam missile firings on Hamas  very much like he blamed the DFLP 's 9/11 attacks on the phantom " Al Qaeda " menace and sent Americans off on a wild goose chase in Afghanistan .
All this deception allows Bush and the other Fabian Socialists in his administration to keep the river of money pouring into the PLO revolution .

All this deception allows Bush and the other Fabian Socialists in his administration to keep the river of money pouring into the PLO revolution .
Palestinian Authority ( PA ) : Most of America 's checks are made out in the name of the PA , which is a wholly owned and operated franchise of the PLO , especially Fatah .
That may account for why the PA had to invent stories about non-existent gun battles to cover its slaughter of palestinian Arab bystanders in the West Bank ( as mentioned above with Fatah ) .
Yet the PA does maintain a fairly open policy of terror against palestinian Arabs , while the Bush Administration looks the other way .
Another palestinian man who was kidnapped by PA forces last year was put on " trial " by PA " courts "  reminiscent of the kangaroo courts of Josef Stalin in the Soviet Union  in which the Arab was sentenced to death for refusing to show sufficient loyalty to the Communist revolution against Israel and other Arabs .
Thousands of palestinian Arabs , including women and children , have been brutally tortured and murdered under that charge , to create a terrifying example to other palestinians not to resist the revolution .
So American dollars do n't just pay for terrorism against Israelis , but also for tightening the iron grip of PLO control over defenseless Arab populations .

Islamic Jihad Movement :
As usual , the tiny Islamic Jihad took credit for firing dozens of Qassam missiles and at least one Soviet Russian Grad Katyusha missile , and for attacking with numerous anti-tank missiles , mortar shells , bombs , sniper attacks , and gunfire ambushes .
But the Jihad group has been under the operational control of Fatah commanders for some 25 years , and simultaneously continues to be a semi- formal member of the PLO with full representation on the PLO 's ruling council .
That , and the fact that many of its above - mentioned attacks were done jointly with Fatah and the PFLP , prove that the Islamic Jihad 's name is being used as cover for PLO attacks .
Because the Jihad is n't formally listed on the PLO roster , it serves to divert blame for attacks and thereby help protect U.S. funding from controversy in America .

Popular Resistance Committees ( PRC ) : Another Fatah front ( without formal membership in the PLO ) that serves to coordinate the activities of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas , the PRC took credit for a number of Qassam missiles , mortar shellings , and shooting attacks , on its own or together with its Fatah masters .
The PRC is just another diversionary name for PLO and Fatah terrorism , fully funded by America  through Fatah , which receives the American checks .

Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) :
The treasonous Bush Administration and Olmert government openly maintained their official policy of blaming Hamas for all terrorism emanating from the Gaza , regardless of which other groups actually did it .
Hamas played on that , using the Communist principle of telling whichever lies the victim wishes to hear , by claiming credit for several Qassam missiles , suicide bombings , other bombings , anti-tank missiles , and gunfire ambushes , plus dozens of mortar shellings .
In fact , Hamas again went overboard and claimed credit for dozens of additional mortar shells that neither they , nor anyone else , fired , judging by news media reports .
Hamas is actually quite a small group , much smaller than the PLO 's Fatah , but it is not ( yet ) an official PLO member .
So it serves well to act as a decoy , taking the blame for much PLO terrorism while pretending to be " independent " of the PLO .
Yet Hamas is heavily funded ( to the tune of millions of dollars each year ) by Fatah using American dollars , it is supplied tons of weapons ( many of them from America ) by Fatah , its membership ranks have recently become swollen with Fatah members in disguise , and its activities are coordinated by Fatah commanders through such fronts as the PRC .
The line between Hamas and Fatah is too blurred to distinguish Hamas terrorism from that of its Fatah masters .

International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) : This non-Arab , U.S. - based , openly Marxist - Leninist front , closely tied with the PLO organization but recruiting white , middle - class students on American college campuses , conducts acts of provocation and even outright violence in Israel in close coordination with its PLO supervisors .
About a week ago , " foreign " Leftists led the invasion of private Jewish property in the West Bank , tearing down an Israeli flag and replacing it with a PLO flag ; when Israeli police came to evict the trespassers , the Leftists rioted .
Those " Leftists " were almost certainly members of the ISM and affiliated groups , though the news media left those details out of its reporting .

Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) : Founded by the PLO rather than by Kurds , this Communist party of Turkish Kurds is now armed by Soviet Russia via Communist Iran and continues to work closely with its PLO sponsors .
It 's been busy trying to re-infiltrate Turkey from its protected bases in Iraq , to attack Turkish soldiers and civilians alike .
Recent gun battles with Turkish forces resulted in casualties on both sides .
The Bush Administration is not only restraining Turkey from wiping out PKK forces in Iraq  just like it restrains Israel from wiping out PLO forces  but has also been caught supplying guns to the PKK through the Communist - dominated " new " government of Iraq .
George Bush never met a Communist terrorist he did n't like .
The Bush Administration , dominated by the Fabian Socialist Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , is working with the Kremlin in Soviet Russia to pave the way for a second Holocaust against the Jewish people via the PLO and Soviet armies .
Yet there are still some orthodox rabbis refusing to endorse the PLO - defunding Proclamation .
Those rabbis must be confronted and pressured to get on board with their Torah obligations .

( CNN ) --
A commuter airliner that crashed Thursday in upstate New York , killing 50 people , underwent violent pitching and rolling seconds before impact , with passengers experiencing twice the normal force of gravity , a federal investigator said Sunday .
Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash .

The plane 's final 800 - foot fall took five seconds , Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said .
The aircraft crashed into a home in Clarence Center , New York , near Buffalo , on Thursday night , killing all 49 people aboard .
A 61 - year - old man in the house died also , but his wife and daughter survived .
Final motions of the aircraft were so drastic that the plane 's autopilot automatically disengaged and warnings sounded , Chealander said , citing information from the plane 's flight data and cockpit voice recorders .
Also , a " stick - shaker " device , which noisily vibrates an airplane 's controls to warn the pilot of imminent stall , kicked in , he said .
The flight crew of Continental Connection Flight 3407 , operated by Colgan Air , discussed " significant " ice buildup on the aircraft 's windshield and wings before the crash , and icing has become a focus as a possible cause .

Chealander said the plane 's de-icing system was turned on 11 minutes after the flight left Newark , New Jersey , for Buffalo , and remained on for the entire flight .
He said the pilots were told before departure from Newark that there was " light to moderate icing " in the Buffalo area but that no other pilots had reported problems with their landings at the Buffalo airport .
" It was really not a bad - weather day , and they chose to launch [ from Newark ] , " Chealander said of the pilot and the first officer .
The plane was on autopilot during its approach to the Buffalo airport , Chealander said .
As to questions about whether the autopilot should have been turned off , Chealander said using it even in bad weather situations " is normal . "
Watch Chealander discuss autopilot options »
" You 're encouraged to use the autopilot to help you with the workloads of these high intense weather situations that we fly into all the time , " he said .
He said the NTSB in the past has recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration , which oversees civil aviation including commercial airlines , that in severe icing conditions , " it might be best to disconnect autopilot so that the pilot might have a better feel " for the aircraft 's conditions .
However , severe icing is " not what we saw here , " Chealander said , adding that the FAA has no such disengagement rule in effect .
" To say that they should not have been flying on autopilot is not correct , " Chealander said .
The pilots ' recorded remarks about " significant " icing did not indicate " severe " icing , he said .
The NTSB has said problems for the 74 - seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 occurred when the pilots lowered the landing gear and tried to set the wing flaps to slow the aircraft for landing .
Offering more details , Chealander said Sunday that the plane 's nose pitched up 31 degrees , then down 45 degrees .
The aircraft rolled left 46 degrees then right 105 degrees , or past the 90 - degree vertical point , he said .
Inside the cabin , he said , conditions went from lower than normal gravitational force to twice the normal force as the plane rocked through the sky .

Chealander said the NTSB 's investigation of the crash site indicated that the two propellers on the turboprop aircraft were in place when the crash occurred .
" The airplane had n't lost anything prior to impact .
It came down intact , " he said .
Meanwhile , local authorities working to recover remains of the victims said Sunday that a federal team of more than 40 people using some $ 2.8 million worth of scientific equipment would begin on Monday to help establish positive identification of the victims .
But because of the intensity of the crash and a subsequent fire , " whether we can identify everybody or not remains to be seen , " Erie County Health Commission Anthony Billittier said .
Authorities had recovered 15 bodies as of Saturday night , but Billittier announced Sunday that numbers of recovered bodies will no longer be released " out of respect for the families . "
All About Buffalo ( New York ) • U.S. National Transportation Safety Board • Continental Airlines Inc. • Federal Aviation Administration
An American inventor who plans to live for ever has been appointed head of a new school for futurologists backed by Google and the US space agency Nasa .
Ray Kurzweil , who worked as a computer scientist before turning to future gazing in the late 1980s , will become chancellor of the Singularity University based at Nasa 's Silicon Valley campus in California .
The institution gains its name from a controversial 2005 book by Kurzweil , entitled The Singularity is Near .
In it , he argues that the exponential advance of technology is set to transform society by giving rise to computers that are more clever than humans .
The leap in computing power will drive rapid advances in other fields , he claims , that together could solve the problems of climate change , poverty , famine and disease .
In an earlier book , Kurzweil predicts the creation of " nanobots " that will patrol our bloodstreams , repairing wear and tear as they go , and keeping our bodies perpetually young .
" The law of accelerating returns means technology eventually will be a million more times powerful than it is today and cause profound transformation , " Kurzweil told Associated Press after his appointment was announced .
The new institute will offer courses on artificial intelligence , nanotechnology and biotechnology and is due to open its doors to its first class of 30 students this summer .
Kurzweil began discussing the concept for the school two years ago with Peter Diamandis , chairman of the X Prize Foundation , which offers multimillion dollar prizes for technological breakthroughs .
The school is backed by Diamandis and Google co-founder Larry Page .
Google has already contributed more than $ 1 million to the institution , and several other major companies are planning to contribute at least $ 250,000 , Diamandis said .
" One of the objectives of the university is to really dive in depth into these exponentially growing technologies , to create connections between them , and to apply these ideas to the great challenges [ facing humanity ] , " said Kurzweil .
Nasa has agreed that the school can use buildings at its Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field , which is near the offices of US tech giants Google , Yahoo ! , Intel Corp and Cisco Systems .
A nine - week course at Singularity University will cost $ 25,000 .
The first three weeks will be spent studying 10 different subjects , with the next three weeks focusing on one in detail .
The final three weeks will be taken up by a special project .
Details of the new institution , which despite its name is not an accredited university , are to be unveiled at the annual Technology , Entertainment and Design ( TED ) conference in Long Beach , California , today .
Kurzweil , who famously consumes more than 100 supplement pills a day and regularly checks around 50 health indicators , has been criticised by some experts who see his predictions as outlandish .
In a 2007 interview , Douglas Hofstadter , the Pulitzer prizewinning author and professor of cognitive science at Indiana University compared his ideas to a blend of very good food and " the craziest sort of dog excrement " .
In an earlier book , Fantastic Voyage : Live Long Enough to Live Forever , Kurzweil and co-author Terry Grossman lay out their vision of humans living radically longer lives within the next three decades or so .
The first step involves adopting a good enough diet and exercise regime to live long enough for biotechnology to unravel the ageing process and for nanotechnology to be capable of slowing it down and ultimately reversing it .
Among Kurzweil 's other predictions are a pill that lets you eat what you want without getting fat – which he believes could be available within ten years ; a world where all energy comes from renewable sources within 20 years ; and a life expectancy that increases at a rate faster than you age within 15 years .
Want to travel to the distant future , to a distant world , be able to live to see what happens to the great - grandchildren of your great - grandchildren 's great grandchildren ?
Would you like to be ageless , to take advantage of all the medical knowledge of the future , and perhaps even age backwards ?
Heck , I know I would !
But everlasting life is not for the faint of heart - there 's no going back , and there 's no guarantee that where ( and when ) you 're going to will be any better than here .
But it 's worth a shot , right ?
This is the realm of cryonics , or as it's more widely known , cryogenics ; freezing something ( organic or otherwise , ) to put it into what essentially is a state of suspended animation .
For most of us , Cryogenics sounds like something out of science fiction , something relegated to 20th Century Fox 's " Aliens " series , or something so obviously ludicrous ( at this point in time , anyway , ) that it 's nothing more than a money - trap for the rich and gullible .
Yellow journalism as well as the cartoons of such famous artists as Gary Larson have given cryogenics a bad name - not that some of that reputation is n't deserved .
In 1987 , only three of the several dozen pioneers , ( cryogenic guinea pigs , if you will , ) including the original " cryonaut " James Bedford , were still frozen - the rest had thawed , unlucky men and women whose cryogenic companies had folded or whose relatives had refused or been unable to pay for the storage of their dead forebears .
But , times change , as they always do , and cryogenics has become a very real , very safe scientific reality - though with one catch ;
We 're not too sure about the unfreezing process yet .
No one has been successfully " thawed " yet , but that 's not to say there were failures - quite the opposite , actually ; while no cryogenically frozen human beings have been awakened from their icy slumbers , test results on Animals ( though no mature , multicellular adult organisms have actually been deep frozen for a long period and thawed directly , per se , ) are promising .
But do n't let that dash your hopes - cryonists agree that it can be done , but has not for one simple reason ; all their patients are dead .
First off , it must be understood that in Counter - Strike : Source ( CS ) , there are several different map types .
These types are :
Bomb Map ( de )
The Terrorist goal in a bomb map is to run to a specific location ( marked on your map ) and plant an explosive .
The explosive is on a timer , so once it is planted , you must defend it until detonation .
The counter - terrorist goal on bomb maps is to prevent the terrorists from planting the bomb at all costs .
This can be done by eliminating all of the terrorists , defusing the planted bomb , or ( in some cases ) defending the bomb site until time runs out .
Hostage Rescue ( cs )
In hostage rescue maps , the primary goal for counter - terrorists is to rescue hostages captured and held by the Terrorists .
You can also win by eliminating the terrorist team .
The Terrorist goal is to simply prevent the counter - terrorists from rescuing the hostages by eliminating them , or maintaining Live sex chat control of the hostages until time runs out .
Bomb Maps - Counter - Terrorist
As a counter - terrorist on bomb maps , your best bet ( by far ) is to eliminate the terrorist team before they can plant the bomb .
Defusing the bomb makes you a sitting duck , and this is a situation you want to avoid .
Keeping the terrorists looking to plant the bomb means you get to stay on the defensive , which gives you an advantage .
Bomb Maps - Terrorist
As a terrorist , your only goal is to completely overrun a bomb site .
If you can not take control of a bomb site within the first 30 seconds , your team will likely lose the round .
The best strategy is to rush everyone on a team except for 2 or 3 ( tops ) to a single site .
The other few players will act as a distraction at the other site , so the counter - terrorists guarding it do not come in as re-enforcements .
Hostage Maps - Counter - Terrorist
I have found the best strategy to be spreading the team out and attacking from all angles .
Coordinate a simultaneous attack if possible , but be sure nobody just " runs in , guns blazing , " because that technique almost guarantees death in a hostage map .
If one side of the attack manages to punch through and get inside the area under Terrorist control , the rest of the team should move to that area in order to assist the attack .
Hostage Maps - Counter - Terrorist
As terrorist , your only strategy here should be to sit and wait .
Your goal is for them to come to you .
Sit , Wait , and SHOOT !
Generic Tricks
Fake Reload
Shoot a round out of your pistol at the beginning of the match .
When you think ( or hear ) an enemy nearby , switch to your pistol , press reload , and quickly switch back to your main rifle .
Most enemies will jump out and attack when they hear the reload sound , because they think you are defenseless .
Strafe - shooting
This has become a staple of counter - strike over the past years , but some players do not quite understand it .
If you are in a firefight at range , you can strafe - shoot to maintain accuracy but still make yourself a difficult target .
The way strafe - shooting is done is by pressing ( or tapping ) the strafe key to get your player moving and releasing it just as you begin to fire .
Your player will continue to move for another step , but your shots will be accurate .
The AWP No-Scope
Many people have had problems with this , and it is really so simple .
A No -Scope shot is when you shoot an opponent with a sniper rifle without using the scope .
For all sniper rifles , the cross - hairs have been removed when you are not using the scope , and the weapons are incredibly inaccurate .
This was done intentionally to force people to use the scopes on sniper rifles .
The problem with the scope is that it is difficult to make short - range shots , and your player moves very slowly while looking through it , so you become an easy target .
The solution to this is the No - Scope shot .
The No - Scope is done simply by pressing the right and left mouse buttons at the same time while your intended target is as close to the center of your aiming point as possible ( you have to estimate this ) .
The scope will pop up for a small fraction of a second , and your shot will be accurate .
Cornering
You will notice after playing Counter - Strike for a long time that most players follow very predictable patterns .
Ammunition is expendable , and any of the rifles ( AK - 47 , M4 , etc. ) will penetrate through about the first 3 inches of a corner .
When approaching corners that likely have opponents on the other side , shoot the corner .
You will often hit your enemies before they see you .
Iding Power ‘s new F460 GT is an Italian car with a Japanese touch very different than the Ferrari F430 super car .
The car tuners tried to boost this car ’s power and with even more aggressive aerodynamics this Ferrari will stand out from the crowd easily .
Many stock parts were replaced with carbon fiber and , as the name suggests , the F460GT increases the standard 4.3L displacement of the V8 engine from the F430 by 0.3L and now this ride has a 4.6L engine .
After they included some bolt on additions the car has 508 HP and 479 Nm of torque .
With this performance upgrade the F460GT can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds and it could run the standing kilometer in 20.9 seconds .
Iding Power declared that this car ’s top speed is above 320 km/h .
This Ferrari received a new full exhaust and a carbon fiber intake , unique springs , dampers and carbon - ceramic brake rotors .
The new body kit design by Iding Power is made from 12 aerodynamic elements and with new magnesium forged wheels the car gained is more aggressive than the stock F430 .
All cars will come with a unique identifier plate and serial number that will make them as part of a limited - edition conversion .
Customers could also buy a new navigation system , carbon fiber interior decorative elements and they could choose to install a cool RS - Style rear wing .
The tuning kit is really expensive but we think that anyone who could buy a new Ferrari F430 will have $ 181,700 to but this unique tuning kit from Iding Power .
Malta to Become First Smart Grid Island
February 5th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
PG&E may be installing millions of smart meters in Northern California , but the nation of Malta ( pop. 400,000 ) is about to become the world ’s first smart grid island .
IBM is building the island ’s national smart grid network , which will consist of 250,000 smart meters placed in homes around the country .
The network will allow Malta ’s national utilities to perform remote monitoring , meter - reading , and management of the network .
Utilities can then use information collected from these tools to adjust electricity pricing based on the time of day .
Island residents will also have the opportunity to track their energy usage online .
US citizens who want to get in on the community smart grid action can head over to Boulder , Colorado — the nation ’s first Smart Grid City .

As with medicine , the first rule of law making should be first , do no harm .
The “ stimulus ” bill fails this test spectacularly .
Among so many other reasons to tell your U.S. Representative and Senators in Washington to oppose the stimulus , the Top 10 are :
The Stimulus Will Not Work
Our history is replete with examples of “ stimulus ” spending failing to move our economy toward prosperity — Bush just tried it , Ford tried it .
Even Christina Romer , Obama ’s Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers agrees .
Romer wrote in a study , " Our estimates suggest that fiscal actions contributed only moderately to recoveries . "
The New Deal did n’t end the Great Depression and Obama ’s stimulus package wo n’t end this recession .
In fact , two UCLA economists published a study in 2004 finding FDR ’s similar New Deal policies prolonged the Great Depression by seven years .
It fails because you do n’t increase economic output by taking a dollar from one person and giving to another .
The idea of “ stimulus ” spending falls for the “ broken window fallacy ” — the allure of what is seen versus what is not seen .
We will see the jobs created by the government spending .
What we wo n’t see are the jobs lost because consumers have less money to spend because the government got the money its spending from us — the only place it can get money .
The Stimulus follows the same plan that ruined Japan ’s economy Japan , after a dramatic market crash and a drop in real estate prices responded with government spending not unlike what the US Congress is considering today .
In fact , they had 10 stimulus bills between 1992 and 2000 , spending billions on infrastructure construction , building bridges , roads , and airports as well as pouring money into biotech and telecommunications .
While many countries enjoyed booming economies and falling unemployment during this time , Japan had a lost decade , seeing its unemployment more than double .
They spent double the US level of GDP on infrastructure , and now have a lousy economy and have one of the highest national debts in the world .
After 10 stimulus packages , Japan has gone from having the second biggest economy in the world by a long shot , to being well behind the new number two , China , and is close to falling behind India .
We do not want to follow their lead .
The Stimulus is full of Wasteful Projects
While we were told the stimulus bill would focus on rebuilding America ’s infrastructure — mainly the roads and bridges — only 5 % of the current bill goes to such projects .
The rest of the bill goes to pet projects like : $ 400,000,000.00 for researching sexually transmitted diseases
$ 200,000,000.00 to force the military to buy environmentally - friendly electric cars
$ 34,000,000.00 to renovate the Department of Commerce headquarters
$ 75,000,000.00 for a program to end smoking which , if successful will bankrupt the State Children 's Health Program Democrats are about to pass ( SCHIP ) that is paid for by cigarette taxes
$ 650,000,000.00 for digital TV coupons
$ 50,000,000.00 for the National Endowment for the Arts These programs are just the 2008 version of the “ midnight basketball ” program that derailed Bill Clinton ’s attempt to ram through a “ stimulus ” bill in 1992 .
Despite that bill failing , the economy quickly recovered and the economic boom of the 1990s began .
The Government Ca n’t Afford the Stimulus President Bush pushed the government deep into a $ 1.2 trillion deficit this year , the third time he has set a record for biggest deficit ever , and President Obama ’s stimulus bill follows his lead , piling on more debt .
The deficit in 2008 amounted to about 8 percent of GDP .
The entire debt is about 35 percent of GDP .
Even for those who do still believe in Keynesianism , it is important to remember his theory did n’t start with the government already over a trillion dollars in the hole , he was generally operating from balanced budgets .
We Ca n’t afford the Stimulus How much is $ 825 billion ?
The Heritage Foundation has calculated that that comes to over $ 10,000 per American family .
To further put that in context , on average , families annually spend : $ 2,230 on apparel and services
$ 3,595 on health care
$ 4,322 on food at home
$ 11,657 on shelter
The Stimulus is Bigger Than the Economic Output of Most Countries
If this bill were a country , it ’d be the 15th largest country in world , ranking between Australia and Mexico .
It is bigger than the economies of Saudi Arabia and Iran combined .
In fact , the $ 875 billion it calls for is more than all the cash in the United States .
Central Planning like the Stimulus Does n’t Work , Ask the USSR If centrally planned government spending on a grand scale produced economic growth , the Soviet Union would have won the Cold War .
If government spending on a grand scale produced economic growth we would be in the middle of the Bush Boom right now .
It does n’t .
Working , saving , and investing leads to economic output and increases in productivity lead to growth .
As economics professor Steven Horwitz said , “ The stimulus plans assume consumption is the source of growth .
It is not .
It is the consequence of said growth . ”
Remember the $ 750 Billion Bailout from this Fall ?
It was just a couple months ago when we were told if we would just quickly hand over $ 750 billion to the Treasury Secretary to bailout his friends on Wall Street , he would make the economy all better .
That did n’t work , and neither will an additional $ 825 billion .
This Money Does n’t Grow on Trees
And this has nothing to do with paper money being made of cotton and linen .
The only way the government gets money is through taxing , borrowing , or printing — that is , it has to take it out of the economy in order to put it back into the economy .
If government borrows the money for the stimulus , then it will either have to print money later or raise taxes to pay it back .
If it raises taxes to pay for the stimulus , it will , in effect , be robbing Peter to pay Paul – probably with interest .
If it prints the money , inflation decreases the value of the dollar for every American – robbing Paul to pay Paul .
How To Upgrade A Debian Etch System ( Server & Desktop ) To Debian Lenny
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This article shows how you can upgrade a system running Debian Etch to Debian Lenny .
It is intended for both server and desktop systems .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note
You should take a backup of your Debian Etch system ( you can find some suitable tutorials for this in the Backup category ) , just in case something goes wrong ( but the upgrade worked fine for me ) .
Before we upgrade to Lenny , we install the latest updates for Etch .
Make sure that your /etc/apt/ sources.list uses etch , not stable ( because lenny is the new stable ) , e.g. as follows :
vi /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ etch main deb-src
http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ etch main deb
http://security.debian.org/
etch/updates main contrib deb-src
http://security.debian.org/
etch /updates main contrib
Then install the updates as follows :
aptitude update
aptitude upgrade
3 Modify /etc/apt/sources.list
To Use Lenny
After we have installed the latest Etch updates , we open /etc/apt/sources.list ...
vi /etc/apt/sources.list
... and replace all etch references with lenny :
deb http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ lenny main deb-src
http://ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/
lenny main deb
http://security.debian.org/
lenny / updates main contrib deb-src
http://security.debian.org/
lenny / updates main contrib
Then update the packages database :
aptitude update
4 Doing The Upgrade
Next we install the Lenny versions of dpkg , aptitude , and apt because their Etch versions are often unable to handle the upgrade to Lenny :
aptitude install dpkg aptitude apt
Then we do a minimal system upgrade ( because a full upgrade might cause some conflicts at this stage ) :
aptitude upgrade
---
If this is a desktop system , you should now check if the package libfam0c102 is installed :
dpkg -l libfam0c102 | grep ^ii
If it is , install its Lenny version now :
aptitude install libfam0
---AdvertisementAdvertisement
Afterwards , we can start the full distribution upgrade :
aptitude full - upgrade
( This command is the same as aptitude dist - upgrade . )
Afterwards , reboot the system :
reboot
After the reboot , check your new kernel :
uname -r
It should display Lenny 's 2.6.26 kernel , e.g.: Advertisement
server1 :~# uname -r
2.6.26-1-486
server1 :~#
And /etc / debian_version should now contain 5.0 :
cat /etc/debian_version
server1 :~# cat /etc/debian_version
5.0
server1 :~#
Do n’t call it schadenfreude .
That ’s the term for taking pleasure in the misfortune of others , and I ’m not guilty of that .
What I feel today , as I review the news that former Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio ’s conviction has been upheld , is n’t about pleasure in his mighty fall from power .
In fact , it ’s not “ pleasure ” at all .
Instead , tell me what the word is for “ taking satisfaction in justice served , ” because that ’s what I ’m guilty of .
Right now I ’m feeling powerfully and righteously satisfied that a man who caused so much misfortune is getting at least a small slice of what he deserves .
Sadly , there will never be full justice for the likes of Nacchio – and Lay and Skilling and Ebbers and Kozlowski and Rigas and Madoff – because our system of law simply does n’t allow for it .
Any punishment you could mete out that would legitimately count as justice for annihilating the lives of hard - working people the way these men did would run afoul of the 8th Amendment before it was 1 % administered .
It ’s a curious and unfortunate quirk of our legal system that one man can spend longer in jail – a real jail , not a federal country club – for selling comparatively harmless drugs to consenting adult customers than another man who destroys the life savings of hundreds and thousands of people who never did anything but show up every day and work their asses off in hopes that they could afford to retire one day .
If it seems like I ’m taking the Nacchio case personally , there ’s a reason .
While my case pales in comparison to those his actions harmed the worst , the arrogant bastard did me significant material damage , as well .
When Qwest ’s “ merger ” with US West was finalized in the summer of 2000 , I was one of the many USW employees shown the door .
Joe had a burr under his saddle where the USW PR group was concerned – we ’d worked pretty hard to protect our interests against what we saw coming , and he did n’t much like it – so when the deal was sealed a host of were kicked to the curb .
To be honest , Nacchio fired more talent than most companies will ever have .
Lean and mean , that was the mantra .
His favorite metric was “ revenue per employee , ” and if there was any question about somebody ’s ability to drag cash in the door , they were useless .
I ’d had the pleasure of working on some really interesting projects prior to my turfing .
I had been given the freedom to develop programs so innovative that , to the best of my knowledge , they had never been done before .
We had online PR successes doing things that many companies still , nine years later , think of as “ new . ”
We were in the process of rewriting the book on how PR was and could be done .
We were aligning these efforts directly with community concerns , and other parts of the business ( which also got axe - murdered on day one of Nacchio ’s reign ) were responsible for dramatic levels of corporate giving .
If I described the benefits that USW employees received you ’d think I was making it up , but rest assured that nobody today – nobody , short of very high - placed executives , gets anything like the benefit packages USW provided for its managers and workers .
It ’s true that a lot of our customers were n’t happy with us and rejoiced when the stake was driven through US West ’s heart , but I predicted – accurately – that the day would come when they ’d wish they had us back .
In other words , US West was a pretty good company , and I personally was doing some of the best work of my professional career .
I had unfinished business , and that gripes me to this day .
And financially I ’ve never quite recovered .
The fact that he damaged so many people so much worse than he did me is infuriating .
I ’m not the only one who has n’t recovered , either .
Neither has the company .
In the wake of the Nacchio debacle it has charted a course that frankly looks a lot more like US West than Qwest , but even though it has figured some important things out , the damage the man did was n’t of the sort that ’s going to get fixed in just a few years .
I can’t imagine a tool , a method or a metric that would allow us to fully asses the damage , the sheer unbridled havoc that Joe Nacchio has inflicted .
Even if there were , I ’d be afraid to see the results .
So while I ’m glad to see that he ’s going to jail , I lament , and will until the day I die , that he ’ll never see true justice .
But imprisonment is n’t the only way life punishes us , I guess , so maybe justice will visit Joe Nacchio in another guise .
Whatever the case , let it not be said that I ’m a malicious person .
I wish for Nacchio nothing more or less than the same thing I wish for every single human alive – that he gets precisely what he deserves .
Digital projectors are the best way to get the biggest possible image for a PowerPoint presentation or a movie .
But the projectors are often pretty big themselves , with even most " pocket projectors " too big to stuff into the typical pocket or laptop bag .
That is changing .
A new miniature - chip technology from Texas Instruments called pico is making digital projectors truly portable , instead of merely luggable .
For the past couple of weeks , I 've been using two of the first pico - based projectors on the market , Dell 's M109S and ...
An image board in which jaded and cynical internet users compete to see who can be the biggest asshole .
Imagery on 4 chan ranges from funny and clever , to " shocking " gore and morbid type imagery , to paedophile humour and other inanely retarted crap .
4 chan users have invented their own language in an attempt to create a psuedo - culture , much in the same vein as the emo , and the lolcats people .
You will typically see words like " Moar " and " newfag " plastered across the boards .
Whilst those of us looking objectively at 4 chan might think " Stop slaughtering the English language you illiterate fuckhole " , such words are apparently used to communicate within this E- community Many users of 4 chan are passionately defensive about the website , and often praise it as a tight knit global community and place for people to communicate whatever they want , uncensored .
Others see it as a chaotic cesspit where people with no personality or ideals can vent uncreative cynicism and pretend they 're clever .
MUMBAI : The VoIP ( Voice Over Internet Protocol ) calls made by the 26/11 terrorists to their handlers have been traced to a serving colonel of the Pakistani army , investigations have revealed .
( Watch )
Although the 11,509 - page chargesheet in the 26/11 case filed by the Mumbai police on Wednesday does not spell this out explicitly , it does name the officer as Colonel R Sadatullah from the SCO .
The SCO , army sources say , stands for Special Communications Organization , a telecommunications agency of the Pakistani government which is run by officers from the army 's signals corps and operates only in Pakistan - occupied Kashmir and the conflict - wracked Northern Areas .
During the 58 - hour siege of Mumbai , a total of 284 calls , running into 995 minutes , were made by the terrorists using mobile phones from the Taj Mahal hotel , Oberoi - Trident and Nariman House to their handlers in Pakistan .
They took the minutest of instructions from their handlers sitting in Pakistan .
The Pak - based co-conspirators also gave their agents in Mumbai pep talks to keep them going .
The chargesheet says that the calls which were made over VoIP ��� a cheap way of making international calls using the net ��� were traced back to an IP address created with Callphonex , a VoIP service provider based in New Jersey , USA .
The payments for this were made by opening an account in the name of Kharak Singh from India .
However , the payments to this account were made on two occasions by wire transfer through MoneyGram and Western Union Money Transfer by two Pakistani nationals , Javed Iqbal and Mohammed Ishtiaq .
These two , while communicating with Callphonex , used the e-mail id kharak_telco@yahoo.com .
This e-mail id was accessed from at least 10 IP addresses , says the chargesheet .
One of them , 118.107.140.138 , belongs to Col R Sadatullah whose official address is SCO , Qasim Rd , Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
Sadatullah 's official e-mail id is pmit@sco.gov.pk , which police say is the official e-mail service for all SCO officers .
One of the wanted accused is ` Major General sahab ' whose name crops up repeatedly in the taped conversation between the terrorists and their handlers .
Incidentally , the general manager of SCO happens to be Major General Muhammad Khalid Rao , who joined the Signals Corps in 1979 .
Asked about the involvement of the Pakistani army , joint commissioner ( crime ) Rakesh Maria said , ``We are looking into the involvement of two army personnel , who could be supposedly serving or retired . ''
The chargesheet is against 38 persons , 35 of them yet to be apprehended .
The three who are in police custody include the lone Pakistani terror operative caught alive , Ajmal Amir Kasab , and two Indians , Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ansari .
The 35 wanted accused include high - profile Lashkar - e - Taiba operatives .
Kasab was not brought to court because of security concerns .
Described as an LeT operative responsible for the conspiracy and the attack on Mumbai , he was charged under nine different laws , including waging war on the government of India under the Indian Penal Code .
The other charges are under the Foreigners '
Act , the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act , the Railways Protection Act , the Explosives Act , the Explosive Substances Act , the Arms Act , the Bombay Police Act and the Customs Act .

Played with by Humphrey Bogart , cuddled by Elizabeth Taylor and walked by Alfred Hitchcock in one of his own films , they were once more or less members of the Royal Family and among the most popular dogs on the planet .
But you 'll be lucky to catch sight of any Sealyham terriers today : the breed is declining so fast that extinction beckons .
More than 1,000 Sealyham puppies a year used to be registered with the Kennel Club but , in 2008 , there were just 43 .
Originally bred in Wales in the 19th century as a working terrier , the Sealyham appears to have become the victim of what propelled it to fame in the first place – fashion .
Between the wars , and up to the 1960s , it was almost a must - have accessory for your pooch - loving celeb , especially in the movie industry .
At the beginning of Hitchcock 's 1963 horror film The Birds , the director , in a typical cameo appearance , is seen walking his two Sealyham terriers Geoffrey and Stanley out of a shop as Tippi Hedren ( the star ) walks in .
Hitchcock also owned a third Sealyham , called Mr Jenkins .
Cary Grant owned one called Archie Leach ( his own real name ) and Princess Margaret had Pippin .
It was a dog to be seen with .
But fashions change .
" These days Hollywood stars like little continental dogs such as chihuahuas and shih - tzus in their handbags , " said Paul Keevil , formerly of the Kennel Club 's vulnerable breeds committee .
" This is one reason why their numbers are dwindling . "

Another is thought to be animal welfare legislation which has banned tail - docking of the animals – first bred by Captain John Edwardes between 1850 and 1891 at Sealyham House , his home in Pembrokeshire , to be working terriers able to hunt animals such as rats , foxes , badgers and rabbits .
" Traditionally , soon after Sealyhams were born , their tails were docked in half , " Mr Keevil said .
" That was because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes , and so they needed short , strong tails for the owner to pull them out .
" After the animal welfare legislation came into force , a lot of older breeders started to look at them differently . "
One of the few breeders left in Britain who is turning out pedigree Sealyhams is Kevin Holmes , 61 , from Ringwood , Hampshire , who has just bred the two pictured , Prinz and Passat .
" Sealyham terriers are full of character , very loving and very dedicated to their owners , " Mr Holmes said .
" They are also good with children .
" People who tend to have them get them because they can remember their grandparents having one .
But those sort of owners are becoming fewer and fewer as time moves on . "
That one word assessment of the Geithner plan , as previewed in the New York Times tonight , comes from reader Scott , and is good enough to print .
I am so disgusted with this entire proceeding that I am going to dispatch it quickly .
Let ’s start with the basics .
The US banking system is insolvent .
Got that ?
Insolvent .
That does not mean every bank in the US is toast , in fact quite a few are probably just fine , and another large group is no doubt hurting and undercapitalized , but a couple of years of not shooting themselves in the foot again would enable therm ( via earnings ) to rebuild their equity bases sufficiently to proceed more or less as normal .
The problem is that a significant portion of the very biggest banks are insolvent .
And on top of that , most of them have very large capital markets operations which have bean the nexus of credit intermediation .
The regulators spent the last decade plus being in studious ignorance of those businesses , at least the complicated ones where all the risk resided .
The SEC never was very interested in bonds , and the Fed took a hands - off , “ let a thousand flowers bloom ” approach to risk management , derivatives and what was called innovation .
Author and market observer Martin Mayer warned “ a lot of what is called innovative is simply a way to find new technology to do that which was forbidden with the old technology . ”
But the history of major banking crises unambiguously shows that insolvent financial institutions need to be resolved .
There are variations on the theme : the government can take them over and recapitalize them , clean them up and re-sell them , a la Sweden ; you can wipe out equity investors and bondholders ; you can try new twists , like various good bank proposals that have surfaced lately ( making new entities out of the deposits and good assets and leaving the dreck with the existing bond and shareholders ) .
While there would be many important details to be sorted out , this is not path breaking , except in the scale at which it needs to occur .
And now , having had four actute phases of a credit crunch , the Fed and other central banks have plenty of liquidity facilites ready to deal with any initial overreaction .
Rest assured , although radical measures would not be pleasant or easy , there are plenty of models and precedents .
But …here we have another scowling Treasury secretary , with a bit more hair than his predecessor , serving up the same fatally flawed approach as before : let ’s just throw money at the banks and hope they get better .
This is tantamount to using antibiotics to treat gangrene .
You waste good medicine and the progression of the rot threatens to kill the patient .
In fact , the state of affairs may be even worse that I thought .
I had grumbled about the fact that the earlier leaks of this plan , like the MLEC and the TARP , seemed little more than a sketch , when its success or failure founder on key details .
The elephant in the room is how do we solve the heretofore insurmountable problem that the market price of the bad assets is well below what the banks are willing to sell them for ?
Paulson was unable to find a way to finesse the problem to get private investors to pick up even a cherry - picked portion of the junk in the MLEC incarnation ; in TARP , he ( presumably ) planned to have Uncle Sam buy the paper at a price the banks would find acceptable but somehow camouflage the subsidy .
He abandoned that course of action quickly , perhaps because the magnitude of the payment over market prices would be so large as to be politically explosive were the bagholder taxpayer ever to find out .
There is no evidence in the various elements leaked that this impediment has been overcome , which raises the real possibility of a Paulson - like seemingly bold advance followed by an equally hasty retreat .
Inviting investors in with you on the buy side does not address the issue of the pricing gap , unless the deal with the investors is intended to help obfuscate the overpayment to the banks .
Note I have no objection to equity infusions if accompanied by sufficient ownership , controls , and a methodology for the goners , say taking over or putting into receivership .
No private equity investor would put 20 % into a company without getting lots of goodies , such as veto rights , antidilution provisions , a board seat , etc .
Now in fairness , Geithner may treat the banks more consistently than Paulson & Co. did .
But that is cold cheer if the basic approach is still fatally flawed .
In fact , the present course is the worst of all possible worlds .
AIG has demonstrated that a player deemed to by systemically important has a blank check .
Not only did they get additional dough with few questions asked , they got improved terms on their initial loans .
Let me stress , for those not familiar with the ways of deal - land : if you ask investors for money and maintain it is enough to achieve X ( get you to break even , get your first product launched ) and then come back not having done what you said you promised , the next round is on MUCH more punitive terms .
Having a party that badly underestimated its needs come back , get more dough , and get relief on its inital loan is from an alternative reality .
In addition , AIG had given large numbers of staff very large retention bonuses .
This is when the loans per employee are $ 1.4 million .
Now the retention bonuses may very selectively be warranted , but they have been handed out like candy , and AIG is know for generous pay , so even if extra comp might have been necessary , query whether at this level .
Given the less than rosy hiring conditions in the insurance industry , a lot of these payments appear flat out unnecessary and were thus effectively looting right under the government ’s nose .
Thus , the banks get funding on an open - ended basis , with no requirement to write down or sell the dreck .
And even if some miraculously does get unloaded via this process , we wonder how far it will get to really cleaning up the banks .
Ken Rogoff estimates US credit losses at $ 2.0 trillion ; this plan appears likely to fall far short of that , which means we still have a lot of sick banks , just somewhat less so .
( We ’ll need to wait to see how this unfolds , but since the banks have no reason to part with bad assets and take a writedown , this is the scenario they are trying to avoid , we still have crappy assets being funded at fictive prices , but this time by you and me rather than by Citigroup ) .
The failure to clean up the banks and write down bad assets was a big contributor to Japan ’s lost decade .
Now to get to the punch line , let us turn to the New York Times .
The headline “ Geithner Said to Have Prevailed on Bailout , ” is already bad news , since as we have discussed , Geithner is a living , breathing example of cognitive regulatory capture .
But here is the troubling bit :
In the end , Mr. Geithner largely prevailed in opposing tougher conditions on financial institutions that were sought by presidential aides , including David Axelrod , a senior adviser to the president , according to administration and Congressional officials .
Mr. Geithner , who will announce the broad outlines of the plan on Tuesday , successfully fought against more severe limits on executive pay for companies receiving government aid .
He resisted those who wanted to dictate how banks would spend their rescue money .
And he prevailed over top administration aides who wanted to replace bank executives and wipe out shareholders at institutions receiving aid .
Because of the internal debate , some of the most contentious issues remain unresolved .
In other words , Geithner followed the Paulson script of pushing hard to make the bailout industry friendly , to the extent of compromising the effort to get the plan fleshed out in adequate detail .
We ’ll see if the notion of a $ 500,000 salary cap survived .
Lucien Bebcuck , Harvard Law professor and corporate governance expert , pointed out that in fact , that provision is not terribly restrictive .
There are no limits on deferred pay , pensions , or incentive compensation in the form of equity .
And executives have often taken non-recourse loans secured by shares .
The plan is terribly sketchy .
Even the numbers have not been nailed down :
It intends to call for the creation of a joint Treasury and Federal Reserve program , at an initial cost of $ 250 billion to $ 500 billion , to encourage investors to acquire soured mortgage - related assets from banks .
The Fed will use its balance sheet to provide the financing , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation might provide guarantees to investors who participate in the program , which some people might call a “ bad bank . ”
A second component of the plan would broadly expand , to $ 500 billion to $ 1 trillion , an existing $ 200 billion program run by the Federal Reserve to try to unfreeze the market for commercial , student , auto and credit card loans .
A third component would involve a review of the capital levels of all banks , including projections of future losses , to determine how much additional capital each bank should receive .
The capital injections would come out of the remaining $ 350 billion in the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
A separate $ 50 billion initiative to enable millions of homeowners facing imminent foreclosure to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages is to be announced next week .
And my sense that Team Obama is making this up as they go was confirmed by an e-mail from Robert Radano :
Treasury briefed the Senate Banking Committee tonight regarding Geithner ’s plan to be announced , tomorrow … Tuesday .
There is no plan .
The Senate received no briefing , no documents .
Press reports , leaks mostly , are as accurate as anything the Admin. has discussed with the Hill .
There are only two conclusions to draw from this .
Either Treasury has not yet decided on a plan .
Or for some unknown reason has decided not to confide in the Senate Banking Committee .
The markets have anticipated both a stimulus bill and a comprehensive TARP 2 .
Instead , markets will get a stimulus bill with marginal value and a muddled TARP .
As one astute reader commented yesterday :
At least Paulson announced his plans .
Not that he ever did anything he announced , but that ’s a small technicality .
These guys ca n’t even make an announcement .
Let us not forget that Paulson did manage to dispense the better part of $ 350 billion in a blinding show of Mussolini - styled corporatism .
The new Treasury secretary exhibits similar Italian fascist tendencies , with even less ability to make the trains run on time .
You may have heard the word “ budget ” a thousand times .
It ’s a term that individuals , government , and organizations use now and then .
The only question many do n’t bother to ask is , what is the purpose of a budget when created ?
Does it have a positive impact , or it ’s just another exercise in futility ?
Anyway , if budgeting does n’t have any purpose , then governments or companies would n’t place any importance on it .
That brings us back to the question ;
What purpose does a budget serve ?
A budget serves numerous purposes .
It provides a financial structure that guides you during the decision - making process .
Budgeting also gives you complete control of your finances .
A well - planned budget can help you achieve your dreams and eliminate the stress that comes with handling issues related to finance .

What ’s The Meaning Of A Budget ?
A budget or budgeting is relevant to the success of any business .
When you plan , you will be able to tell how much it will cost to complete your project from start to finish .
But when you fail to create a plan or budget , you wo n’t know to what extent your finances can carry you .
By definition , a budget is a process by which an individual or government creates a plan on how to allocate or use resources ( money ) .
Parents can have a budget every year .
The reason is to ensure he or she can utilize the available resources to take care of the children without any shortcomings .
The budget might include their monthly feeding stipend , books , school fees , and other things .
The good thing about creating a budget is that it helps you to allocate your resources evenly .
Budgeting also helps you to prioritize .
It enables you to understand whether you have the financial power to handle any project you are embarking upon from start to finish .
Types Of Budget For Government And Businesses
The purpose that a budget serves is the same for the government , businesses , and household .
The primary objective is to ensure the resource is evenly distributed to cover each area of a project or projects .
Here are the different types of budgets in a government and business setting .
Government Budget : Types And Things You Need To Know
The government deploys three types of budgets .
These include balanced , surplus , and deficit budgets .
Government budgets are usually prepared annually .
The president prepares the budget and makes it available to the legislators for consideration .
Once the legislators finish acting on the submitted budget , the president signs it into law .
Passing a budget into law might take a while , but it is a necessary process the government cannot ignore .
Otherwise , the various agencies and arms of government will not be able to perform their duties .
The finances needed for them to operate can only be available once the budget submitted to the legislators is approved and signed into law .
So , what ’s a government budget ?
Well , this type of budget is n’t different from what you know about budget or budgeting .
It is a financial statement prepared annually , to outline the government ’s estimated expenditure and expected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year .
Here are explanations of the three types of government budget listed above ;
1. Balanced budget :
The first type of government budget on this list is the balanced budget .
It ’s a term you will come across often , with regards to budgets concerning the government .
Furthermore , when we say a government budget is balanced , what that implies is that expenditure and expected revenue is equal for that fiscal year .
This type of budget is popular among classical economists and emphasizes the need for one to live within his or her means .
Classical economists are also of the opinion that government expenditure should n’t be higher than the revenue it generates .
However , it is much easier to balance the expenditure estimated with the revenue anticipated when planning the budget .
It does look simple on paper , but the implementation has always been a major challenge .
Notwithstanding , if the government can implement it , a balanced budget could have a positive impact on the economy .
It can make economic stability attainable and prevent the government from funding expenditures not captured in the budget .
By and large , the balanced budget does have some drawbacks .
One of them is that the government cannot rely on it during an economic recession .
Plus , it will make it difficult for the government to spend heavily on public welfare .
Let ’s go over to the next government budget type , the surplus budget .
2. Surplus budget :
Surplus means having something in abundance .
In a government , the surplus budget is one whereby the expected revenue of the government is higher than the estimated expenditure for that fiscal year .
What this type of budget implies is that the revenue the government generates from taxpayers is higher than what is being spent on public welfare .
This budget , called the “ surplus budget , ” is deployed during inflation , and the main reason is to lower aggregate demand .
3. Deficit budget :
The word “ deficit ” is the same as you know it .
In monetary terms , it means the total money spent is way bigger than the amount received .
So , what does a deficit budget imply ?
It means the expenditure of the government far exceeds the revenue generated for that fiscal year .
The deficit budget is n’t typical in developed economies .
It is more prevalent among developing economies or countries of the world .
This type of government budget can prove helpful when such an economy is hit by a recession , too .
However , on the positive side , the deficit budget allows governments to spend the revenue generated or borrowed on the public .
That ’s one of the merits that sometimes make it a viable option .
Furthermore , there are also disadvantages of operating such a type of budget .
One of them is the increased debt profile on the government .
Another is that it encourages corruption , which is majorly the reason many of these developing countries are backward .
Business Budget Types
Next is the budget commonly used by different businesses , whether small or big .
It is essential to note that these budget types are entirely different from the ones deployed by the government .
Also , these business budgets can be applied by any organization or industry .
The only that some firms or organizations might choose to deploy the type that best suits their needs or the nature of their businesses .
So , below are the different types of budgets businesses use .
1. Operating budget :
This type of budget involves the analysis and forecasting of projected expenditure and income over a specific period .
It takes into account various factors .
These include labor costs , overhead manufacturing costs , production , sales , material costs , and administrative expenditures .
2 . Cash flow budget :
This helps companies to determine whether they are managing their finances appropriately or not .
It is used to project how and when cash flows into and leaves the firm .
3. Financial budget :
What you will find in such a budget is the company ’s strategy involving how to handle its asset income , expenses , including other financial aspects of the business .
4. Marketing budget :
The marketing department is the brain box of the business and does have a different budget .
The budget covers the promotional and other marketing activities the department would perform for that financial year .
And of course , a successful marketing campaign will help the company to generate more revenue and increase the customer base .
The Importance Of A Budget : Things You Need To Know
When most people hear the word “ budget , ” the first thing that strikes their minds is an elaborate financial plan .
Now hear this ; your budget does n’t have to be voluminous .
It does n’t have to .
You can make it as brief as possible and focus on highlighting the critical areas of the project or things your budget would cover .
It is essential to note that having a budget can help in several ways .
Since it gives you the power to draft a spending plan , it will help ensure that money is always available to get the things you desperately need .
Having a budget can prevent you from owning too much debt and eliminate lack at the same time .
And even if you ’re currently in debt , you will still benefit from drafting your budget plan .
It will help you to become debt - free .
Conclusion
There ’s no business or nation that does n’t place value or budgets .
They all do because of its importance .
Otherwise , it wo n’t take long before they hit rock bottom .
Budgeting also eliminates time - wasting when it comes to financial management , and the list goes on and on .
But the important thing is that a budget serves numerous purposes , which an organization , nation or individual can benefit from massively .

Now he 's not just a banty opportunist with limitless self - regard and the irritating tendency to speak of himself in the second first person plural ( " We are the senator . " ) , he 's also a victim — a victim of guilt - by - association and , some are muttering , a victim of racism .
By raging impotently about his appointment to Illinois ' vacant U.S. Senate seat , Democratic leaders , with an assist from the Republicans and the media , gave Burris a martyr complex to go along with his other traits .
A little more than a week ago , no one would have thought it possible to make the pompous , simpering Roland Burris any more insufferable .
Never mind that a scandal - plagued Gov. Rod Blagojevich appointed him as an act of defiance , not statesmanship .
Never mind that voters have repeatedly said " thanks , but no thanks " to Burris since 1994 .
Never mind that he was n't on anyone 's short list to replace Barack Obama until Blagojevich cast a devious eye upon him .
The Man does n't want to seat Roland Burris because he 's black .
Absurd ?
Yes .
All this talk about " plantation politics " and lynching and Sheriff Bull Connor is beyond daffy during the very week that an African - American man is leaving his home in Chicago to travel to Washington , where he will be sworn in as the next president of the United States .
But it resonates because there really is no good reason not to seat Burris .
Blagojevich is sleazy to the bone ?
That may be , but he 's still the governor , and the Burris appointment appears to be legal .
Burris is mediocre ?
If so , he 'll hardly be the first legislative lightweight in the upper chamber .
And , unlike some of his prospective Senate colleagues , his record is refreshingly clear of financial and sexual scandal .
The voters of Illinois ought to be the ones to fill such a lengthy vacancy in Washington ?
That 's a fine idea , Bunky , but it ai n't the law .
And we can't go back in time to change it .
All this was obvious from the moment rumors began flying last Tuesday morning that Blagojevich was preparing to stick a potato in the exhaust pipe of those demanding his resignation by appointing Burris .
Anyone able to see more than one move ahead on the chess board would have realized that an indignant and ultimately futile tizzy over the Burris appointment would divide Democrats along racial lines , distract from the serious business and the festivities in Washington , and boost Blagojevich 's popularity among African - Americans .
Look three or four moves ahead : Burris will be at least an OK U.S. senator , probably a decent one and maybe even a good one .
He 's annoying , but he 's not a nitwit , a kook or a criminal .
And he 'll almost certainly be a reliable Democratic vote , but not one that stands to tip the balance either way .
It 's not too late for Democratic leaders to reverse their magic trick .
They need to laugh this one off .
Score one for G - Rod.
Let Burris have the seat , deny him his martyr 's robe and move on , already .
The 2010 campaign , when he 'll have to stand for re-election , will begin in the next few months anyway .
Voters will have their say soon enough .
UPDATE ;
Here is my take on Burris ' appearance at the Capitol Tuesday morning .
The deluge of articles analyzing the causes , impact and remedies of the deepening economic crisis that has a vise - like grip on the nation overlook the fundamental flaw in the doctrine that drives economic policy .
Since World War II , ever - increasing consumption has become the unquestioned , singular force driving economic policy , reaching its apogee in hedonistic , Epicurean solipsism , the prevailing value in North American culture .
To date , ever - increasing consumerism postulates unsustainable economic growth , which has become a background assumption or axiom which almost never surfaces as an issue for critical analysis .
Surprisingly , the crypto-crisis of economic growth was recognized in 1972 by a group of scientists who formed an organization called “ The Club of Rome ” who concluded that “ The short doubling time [ of exponential growth ] of many of man ’s activities … will bring us closer to the limits of growth …
The crux of the matter is not only whether the human species will survive , but even more whether it can survive without falling into a state of worthless existence . ”
Growth has been deeply rooted in our economic zeitgeist since the early 1950s and has been considered so essential to prosperity and job creation that every president since the early 1950s has emphasized its crucial determinacy to the health of the nation in their State of the Union Addresses .
In 1955 , Eisenhower reassured Congress that “ There are solid grounds for confidence that economic growth will be resumed without an extended interruption . ”
Kennedy affirmed in 1963 that “ Programs for full utilization of existing resources are the indispensable first step in a positive policy for economic growth . ”
Johnson stated that “ Our basic task is threefold : First to keep our economy growing … ” Then Carter warned that “ The economy must keep on expanding to produce new jobs and better income ” in 1978 .
Next , Reagan explained in 1984 that “ The key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth , our first great goal . ”
Clinton boasted that “ Over the last 4 years , we have brought new economic growth ” in 1997 .
In 2002 , George W. Bush noted that “ The way out of this recession , the way to create jobs , is to grow the economy . ”
Governments around the world have adopted the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) as the decisive and foremost measure of economic importance , but it camouflages the disastrous consequences of unsustainable growth .
It may be the ideal measurement for those who benefit from this type of growth , but it does not reflect the well - being of the overwhelming majority of people .
GDP is so rife with critical flaws , such as negative counting , an absence of quality of life components , wealth distribution ( per capita is misleading ) and environmental concerns as to render it completely useless as an economic indicator .
Growing the economy without consideration for the impact on resource depletion , the environment , waste , human rights and sustainability has become antediluvian .
There are many alternatives for job creation , sustainability and increasing everyone ’s standard of living .
America lags behind most European nations in developing alternative forms of energy and can generate jobs and save resources by investing much greater sums of money in wind power , solar energy and conservation techniques , rather than treating it as a token investment in a project that lacks urgency .
Another method for creating jobs and increasing prosperity is the development of programs to share aggregate working hours by shortening the workweek , lengthening vacations , sabbaticals for upgrading job skills , lengthy paid maternity and paternity leaves and less overtime .
Americans work longer than most workers around the world despite the fact that the U.S. has the highest productivity .
Working fewer hours would create many more new jobs , increase the productivity of labor , free workers to devote more time to family and leisure and alleviate the burden of people who are now forced to work part - time or more than one job .
Treating unsustainable growth as the apotheosis of economic theory was not the choice of the masses but of voracious corporations with an insatiable appetite for profits .
Corporate power resulting in an endangered planet can no longer frame public policy to serve their interests .
For President Obama to establish himself as a truly progressive and innovative President , he must wrestle the public agenda away from the clutches of corporations and redefine it to serve the interests of the American people .
State of Darkness : US Complicity in Genocide since 1945
In his first budget , President Obama apparently plans to keep his campaign promise to let the Bush tax cuts expire for Americans making over $ 250,000 a year .
And just as during the election , Republican leaders are falsely claiming that Obama 's proposal constitutes a tax hike on small business owners .
This time , it is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoing John McCain and Joe the Plumber in spreading the lie .
McConnell 's myth - making came during an appearance Sunday on CNN's " State of the Union . " ( Download and Download videos here . )
There , he fired the first salvo against President Obama 's plan to end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans who need it least .
Claiming that " a vast majority of American small businesses pay taxes as individual taxpayers , " McConnell thundered :
" I do n't think raising taxes is a great idea , and when our good friends on the other side of the aisle say raising the taxes on the wealthy , what they are really talking about is small business . "
Of course , they 're not talking about small business .
As CNN concluded in October , " fewer than 2 % of small business owners would pay more under Obama 's plan . "
As it turns out , McConnell is merely parroting the same fraud now that John McCain tried to perpetrate then .
Last fall , then Republican presidential candidate McCain attacked Obama , wrongly asserting , " The small businesses that we 're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now . "
As it turned out , McCain 's human shield and faux small business owner Joe " the Plumber " Wurzelbacher will receive a tax cut , and not an increase , under the just passed Obama stimulus package .
But in case there was any doubt the Republicans ' deception on the point , the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center quickly put it to rest .
As the Obama campaign correctly claimed , 98 % would see their taxes decline or remain the same :
Even using the broad definition of small business that McCain likes , very few owners would see their own taxes rise .
That 's because the lion 's share of taxable income comes from a small number of wealthy businesses .
Out of 34.7 million filers with business income on Schedules C , E or F , 479,000 filers fall into the top two brackets , according to an analysis of projected 2009 filings by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center .
The other 34.3 million - or 98.6 % - would be unaffected by Obama 's proposed rate hike .
Of course , the complete falsehood of a statement is no barrier to Republicans uttering it .
Now as in 2001 , Republicans wrongly claimed that the estate tax led to the loss of family farms .
When President Bush blasted opponents who say " the death tax does n't cause people to sell their farms " with a mocking " do n't know who they 're talking to in Iowa , " neither Hawkeye State farmers nor researchers could name one .
As the New York Times concluded eight years ago , " Almost no working farmers do , according to data from an Internal Revenue Service analysis of 1999 returns that has not yet been published . "
But just because it's a lie , does n't mean Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party wo n't keep saying it .

What was fire in the Texas sky ?
A metallic meteorite Metallic meteorite likely sent fireball across Texas sky
Sunday ’s great Texas fireball was – probably – just a meteor .
Officials with the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Strategic Command said the bright lights witnessed over Texas skies were almost certainly not linked to last week ’s collision between an American commercial satellite and a Russian government communications satellite .
“ Our indication is this was a natural phenomenon , perhaps something like a meteor , ” said Air Force Maj .
Regina Winchester , a spokeswoman for the Space Surveillance Network , part of the Pentagon ’s Strategic Command arm that tracks space debris .
The brightness of the object and the fact that it seemed to generate a sonic boom led some astronomers to speculate about the meteor ’s size .
“ There are lots of variables , but we do have some clues , ” said Anita Cochran , assistant director of The University of Texas at Austin ’s McDonald Observatory .
The most common type of meteors are porous , nonmetallic and tend to fall apart quickly .
Yet to generate a sonic boom , a meteor must reach Earth ’s stratosphere , about 30 miles above the planet ’s surface , before burning up , Cochran said .
That implies the meteor seen above Texas was probably a metallic - type , which , although rarer , are more durable during the fiery entry into Earth ’s atmosphere .
Metallic meteorites are the type most commonly found on Earth because of their durability .
Images of the meteor suggest it appeared brighter than a daytime Venus , Cochran said , but not quite as bright as a daytime moon .
A metallic meteorite of this brightness in the stratosphere probably would be about the size of a basketball , or smaller , she said .
And that ’s just about how large it would have to be for any fragment to reach the ground .
There have been no reports of a discovery yet .
Cochran said it ’s almost impossible to triangulate the location of a meteorite from observations of its flight .
Most discoveries happen by dumb luck , and they ’re usually made in the world ’s least populous continent – Antarctica .
“ It ’s just because black rock is easy to spot against white ice , ” she said .
“ And if you see a rock there , chances are it came from space . ”

A WAR , a riot , a terrorist attack or a row over blasphemy : not long ago , Britain 's government knew exactly what to do when a crisis loomed in relations with the country 's Muslims .
As recently as July 2005 , after bombs in London killed 56 people , Tony Blair was confident that he could avoid a total breakdown of trust between Muslim Britons and their compatriots .
Using an old formula , the prime minister called in some Islamic worthies and suggested they form a task force on extremism .
Then , hours before the worthies were due to reconvene and mull their response , Mr Blair breezily announced that a task - force of top Muslims had just been created .
They moaned , but dutifully went to work .
That system of trade - offs , the equivalent of the “ beer and sandwiches ” once used to woo trade unionists , had some big drawbacks .
It gave hardline Muslims — generally male , old and new to Britain — disproportionate sway .
It also led to some dubious bargains ; for example , Muslim resentment of British foreign policy was parried by , in part , huge generosity towards the cultural demands of some Muslims — such as the right to establish schools where the curriculum bears scant relation to the lessons other young Britons get .
But in its own odd terms , the old system “ worked ” .
Messages could be relayed between the corridors of power and the angriest and poorest parts of the Muslim street ; and Muslim leaders could be induced to expend personal and political capital urging their flock to co-operate with the police and provide useful information .
Now that system , and its unspoken compromises , lies in ruins .
It was jettisoned in the autumn of 2006 , when the government downgraded existing ties with the Muslim Council of Britain ( in which movements close to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamists of Pakistan were strongly represented ) and tried to find different interlocutors .
But attempts to define a new policy towards Islam in Britain have been floundering since then .
The Muslim population is in many ways diverging still more from the mainstream .
With its large , young families , it is also growing much faster ( see chart ) : there are 2.4 m Muslims today , according to the Labour Force Survey ; the census of 2001 , a rather different measure , put it at 1.6 m .
The government is under fire from the political centre - right for being too soft on radical or reactionary Muslim groups who stop just short of endorsing violence .
It is also attacked from the left ( Muslim or otherwise ) for using the fight against terrorism as an excuse for a general assault on Muslims and their cultural rights .
Hazel Blears , the communities secretary , sought to clarify official thinking in a speech on February 25th , after a stream of reports that the government was about to launch an ideological war against illiberal or extremist ways of thinking , even if they were not directly associated with violence .
The government , she said , would reserve the right to deal with people whose ideas were unpleasant through a “ spectrum of engagement , carefully calibrated to deal with individual circumstances ” .
With groups that have “ an equivocal attitude to core values such as democracy , freedom of speech or respect towards women ” there might be “ some scope for limited engagement ” , the minister carefully added .
But on certain forms of “ absolutely unacceptable behaviour ” — such as homophobia , forced marriage or female genital mutilation — the government would firmly enforce the law with no regard for a cultural “ oversensitivity ” that had gone too far .
Her speech suggests that a debate within the cabinet on which war to prioritise — the one over ideas and values or the one against terrorism — is unresolved .
The government wants to keep its options open .
But the failure of current policies aimed at fostering moderate Islam can hardly be overstated .
After spending lavishly on a strategy called Prevent that was supposed to empower moderates — at least £ 80 m ( $ 116 m ) will have been dished out on such efforts by 2011 — the very word “ prevent ” has become discredited in the strongholds of British Islam , which include east London , Birmingham and a string of northern industrial towns .
At the Muslim grass roots , there is a sense that any group or person who enjoys official favour is a stooge .
Many in the government , meanwhile , think their partners are not delivering value for money .
The whole relationship has deteriorated since August 2006 .
After a foiled plot to blow up transatlantic flights , and amid huge ire over the war in Lebanon , a group of prominent Muslims , including two now in government , signed an open letter arguing that British foreign policy in general , and its softness towards Israel in particular , was an important factor behind a surge in extremist sentiment .
Tripping up
Nearly three years on , the government 's biggest problem is that it is struggling with two big questions at once .
One is the set of problems described under the catch - all term of “ cohesion ” — narrowing the social , economic and cultural gap between Muslims ( especially in some poor urban areas of northern Britain ) and the rest of society .
The second is countering the threat from groups preparing to commit violence in Britain or elsewhere in the name of Islam .
The government says the two problems are related : poor , frustrated and mainly self - segregated groups are more likely to produce terrorists .
Muslims as a group lag behind other Britons in qualifications , employment , housing and income ( see chart ) .
But in fact the overlap between exclusion and extremism is messy .
And attempts to fight terrorism through tougher policing , which can alienate whole communities , make boosting cohesion harder .
Among those who claim to speak for disadvantaged Muslims and articulate their grievances , there has been an outpouring of indignation over the government 's stated aim of “ preventing violent extremism ” by making Muslim communities more “ resilient ” and better at dealing with hotheads .
The idea seems to stigmatise all Muslims , many complain , while the violent extremism of , for example , the white far right is ignored .
Another gripe is that the Prevent programme has poisoned relations between central government and the city councils through which the money is channelled .
Some say councils are being strong - armed into carrying out “ community ” programmes that are really thinly disguised police and intelligence work .
In Birmingham the council 's loudest activist , Salma Yaqoob , complains that Prevent money goes only to those who avoid suggesting that British foreign policy helps to foment extremism , even though the link obviously exists .
( Indeed , a government security minister , Lord West , admitted in January that to deny it was “ clearly bollocks ” . )
Resentment of the gag was exacerbated by the recent Israeli assault on Gaza .
Many Muslims followed it on Middle East - based media that presented an even gorier picture of Palestinian suffering than other British viewers saw .
The Gaza crisis also triggered a round of name - calling within the world of British Islam that has laid bare a rapid diminution of the middle ground on which emollient types hope to stand .
Senior Muslims at the Quilliam Foundation , a “ counter - terrorism think - tank ” which has received nearly £ 1 m in funding from the home and foreign offices , issued in January a denunciation of Israeli actions that was mocked as faint - hearted by more radical Muslims , while voices on the political right questioned whether the government 's “ investment ” in this body was paying off .
Torn between remaking the Muslim community — a task that turns out to be much harder than the designers of the Prevent strategy ever imagined — and simply fighting terrorism , the government , understandably , feels it can hardly be expected to abandon the latter .
Probing and pre-empting attacks by Muslim extremists is now understood to occupy about 75 % of the energy of the British security services , who claim to have had some success in reducing the number of terrorist plots that are stopped only at the last minute .
Another less obvious factor in British thinking is strong American concern over the risk that a British - born Muslim could enter the United States and commit a terrorist spectacular there .
A healthy slug of America 's anti-terrorism spending goes to forestall just such a possibility .
Meanwhile a string of high - profile court cases involving terrorist conspiracies has served to increase the emotional chasm between Muslim Britons and their compatriots .
As an example of two worlds diverging , take reactions to the plight of Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian who sought asylum in Britain and was later incarcerated in Guantánamo Bay .
He says he was tortured by his American captors , with help from the British secret services .
Mr Mohamed returned to Britain on February 23rd , to mixed reviews .
For Muslims ( and human - rights campaigners on the secular left ) his saga is a tale of American brutality and British collusion .
In the rambunctious popular press , however , he is portrayed as a nuisance whose presence in Britain will burden the taxpayer and waste the security services ' valuable time in surveillance .
A way forward
For all the problems besetting British Islam , however , there are plenty of individuals who exemplify at least part of the solution .
Among them — at least until the recession makes it harder for strivers to climb out of poverty — are successful young professionals and entrepreneurs , often women , who have managed to fly high in business , medicine , accountancy or the media .
“ We have prevailed in a two - fronted struggle ” against social conservatism and discrimination , says Saeeda Ahmed , the founder of a social - affairs consultancy in the north ( to hear an interview with Miss Ahmed , see article ) .
But successful British Muslims as well as poor ones resent the fact that the rest of society often sees them mainly as potential extremists .
Sarah Joseph , a convert to Islam who edits the glossy monthly Emel , says Muslims are fed up with being asked if they are against violence ; they want people to know what they are for , such as social justice .
The sad fact , in a country that has come to live in fear of terrorism , is that many Britons are indeed more interested in assessing Muslims ' potential for violence than in anything else about them .
Anita Bartholomew looks at the War on Drugs price tag - and what we could better spend it on in the current economic crisis :
As long as marijuana is illegal , we ’ll still be directing billions to enforcement , prosecution and incarceration .
And we still wo n’t realize the revenues that regulation and taxation can bring .
We could use those lost billions right now .
Estimates of the combined savings from legalizing marijuana , and revenues from taxing it like alcohol or tobacco , range from $ 13.94 to $ 41.8 billion per year .
That ’s enough to pay for all or most of President - elect Obama ’s proposed ten - year , $ 150 billion alternative energy investment .
Or it could contribute roughly one - fifth to one - half of the $ 75 billion per year estimated cost of Obama ’s proposal to extend health insurance to all .
( CNN ) --
The new district attorney of Boulder County , Colorado , said he plans to take a fresh look at the investigation into the 1996 slaying of JonBenet Ramsey .
The DA 's office assumed responsibility for the investigation in 2002 .
But District Attorney Stan Garnett told CNN that he wants to decide during his first 30 days in office whether the case should be returned to Boulder police .
" I 'm trying to determine whether it 's efficient to have the ongoing investigation handled by my office or somebody else , " said Garnett , who was sworn in as district attorney January 13 .
The DA 's office is relatively small , he said , with 27 lawyers and six investigators handling between 2,000 and 2,500 felony cases a year .
Although the Ramsey case has not generated news since last year , tips and information regularly come in to authorities .
Whoever is handling the investigation is charged with checking them out and deciding whether they are worth pursuing , Garnett said .
He said reports that he is considering reopening the case are inaccurate .
" It 's not closed .
It has n't been solved , and it 's been open the whole time . "
The case is one of the nation 's most famous unsolved murders .
On December 26 , 1996 , John Ramsey discovered the body of his 6 - year - old daughter , JonBenet , in the basement of the family 's Boulder home .
The girl had been strangled and beaten .
A ransom note was found on the stairs of the home , demanding $ 118,000 .
Early in the case , Boulder police said JonBenet 's parents , John and Patsy Ramsey , were under " an umbrella of suspicion " in her death .
But they were never formally named as suspects , and a grand jury refused to indict them .
Patsy Ramsey died in 2006 after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer .
In July , Garnett 's predecessor , Mary Lacy , issued a public apology for the suspicion surrounding the Ramsey family after a DNA test performed using new technology showed that DNA found on JonBenet 's underwear and under her fingernails belonged to an unidentified man .
The test results , Lacy said , were " powerful evidence " that allows investigators to think the Ramsey family were victims , not suspects .
That same third - party DNA exonerated John Mark Karr , a one - time teacher , after he was arrested in Thailand and brought to Colorado .
Authorities said Karr told a University of Colorado professor in e-mails that he was involved in JonBenet 's death .
He told reporters after his arrest that he was with the child when she died , although he called her death an accident and said he loved her .
Lacy was widely criticized , including by then - Gov. Bill Owens , for the handling of Karr 's arrest .
Boulder police also have long faced criticism over their handling of the investigation .
But , Garnett said Friday , " I 've been very impressed by the Boulder P.D .
They are a fine department now and have handled a number of cases very well .
...
They 've done a very nice job . "
The department has 24 investigators , four times as many as the DA 's staff , he said .
Garnett was elected DA in November to replace Lacy , who could not run again because of term limits .
Before he was elected , he served as a trial lawyer for 22 years , according to the DA 's Web site .

Operation Migration relies exclusively on such hospitality .
The organization , a nonprofit on an unforgiving $ 700,000 budget , gets almost no government money and so is left to scrape up the majority of its financing from individual donors .
A cult of these so - called Craniacs now reads the crew ’s daily journal religiously at OperationMigration.org , following the team and its numbered cranes like the cast of a reality show .
( After Condie ’s announcement , one woman explained to me that 827 is known for being “ very independent . ” )
Along the route , well - wishers also bring the crew comfort food : very heavy hams , pots of chili .
Already that morning , Condie was handed three batches of homemade fudge , several dozen donuts and a carrot cake .
“ Everybody puts on 10 pounds on migration , ” she said later with a laugh .
No one ever thinks to bring them a big salad .
The early - morning flyovers are the only opportunity for the Craniacs to even see the birds .
The cranes must be moved from the refuge in Wisconsin to two refuges in Florida as furtively as fine art is moved between museums .
From the time they land at each stopover to the time they can take off again , the cranes are stashed in a camouflage pen , tucked out of view and ringed by two electric fences .
Costumed workers feed them twice a day , but otherwise the area is off - limits and resolutely guarded from trespassers , hunters , journalists and dogs .
Martha ( Operation Migration asked that I not disclose her full name ) was sworn to secrecy , but it did n’t take .
“ This has been wonderful , ” she loudly told acquaintances outside the chapel .
“ The best week of my life . ”
Condie kept fielding questions from the crowd .
“ You only have to show the birds the way once , ” she explained .
After following the trikes their first year , the cranes continue migrating back and forth on their own each spring and fall .
That very morning , in fact , graduates of the team ’s seven previous ultralight - led migrations — 73 cranes in all — were scattered up and down the eastern flyway , at various points on their passage to Florida .
Also scattered up and down the flyway were biologists — lots of biologists — from Operation Migration ’s many partner organizations , tracking the radio signals emitted from those birds ’ leg bands .
And now that Operation Migration ’s current class of cranes were airborne , its crew would hit the road , too , chasing the migration to its next stop in two motor homes , two pickups towing campers , and two vans , one towing a 50 - foot supply trailer with a spare aircraft .
All told , seven state and federal agencies and two nonprofits with an annual collective budget of $ 1.7 million in public and private funds were hard at work , fulfilling humankind ’s responsibility to a bird that we ’ve defibrillated out of near - certain extinction and gotten breathing again , if not yet absolutely saved .
The whooping crane , David S. Wilcove , a Princeton ecologist , told me recently , “ is just about the most charismatic endangered species in America . ”
By 1941 , only 21 wild ones remained .
Today there are 381 , enough to make it one of the most uplifting success stories in a field where the bar is admittedly sinking rather low .
By now , one biologist told me , “ work on any endangered species is certainly a very severe , rear - guard effort . ”
Twelve percent of the world ’s bird species are threatened with extinction , according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature — so are a fifth of all mammals , and almost a third of all amphibians .
In other words , we ’ve backed ourselves into a corner , and sustaining the world ’s wildlife will require progressively more systemic interventions from here on out .
“ Many of those species , probably most of them , ” Wilcove said , “ are in a certain sense wards of the state .
Now and for the foreseeable future , they will be dependent on humans for their survival . ”
Operation Migration exemplifies the kind of ingenious , unwavering work that needs to be done — and that we ’ll need to keep doing , maybe forever , even as the strenuous administrative challenge of micromanaging so much of the natural world begins to blur the line between conservation and domestication .
Already , it has come to this on planet Earth : men dressed like birds , teaching birds to fly .
3 .
The hum of the trike engines swelled into a buzz .
Then the lead pilot , Chris Gullikson , reappeared in the sky , drawing a lopsided V of tremendous white shapes behind his wingtips .
As the parade of birds and machines coasted over the chapel and the three large wooden crosses driven into the ground beside it , people raised their binoculars and cameras to their faces and tilted back their heads .
“ It looks like a revival from up here , Liz , ” a voice quipped in Condie ’s radio .
It was Jack Wrighter , one of the retired commercial pilots who flies top cover for the migration in his Cessna 172 .

“ There ’s not a biologist among us , ” Joe Duff told me later .
( There is , however , a metal sculptor , a former butterfly breeder and Gullikson , who splits the rest of his year between leading adventure tourists into tornadoes and designing English - style riding saddles . )
Duff , who is now 59 , was a photographer in Toronto when , in 1993 , he helped another ultralight hobbyist and artist named William Lishman — the first person to fly with birds — lead 18 Canada geese on a migration from Ontario to Virginia .
“ The whole idea was to use this technique for endangered species , ” Duff told me .
Soon the two men started practicing by costume - rearing nonendangered sandhill cranes and then migrating with them .
well , it 's basically a test against the barricade walls they use in Iraq and such .
As reported in my last memo , a huge American military base is nearing completion in Israel .
Reportedly , it has holding facilities for as many as 18,000 protesters .
After visiting it yesterday , I 'd say way more .
This base is massive .
I counted ten enormous US Army issue prefab warehouses and more were going up .
At the base guard post , the American flag is waving in the wind .
A sign proclaims that the project manager is one Jerry Ray .
I start taking photos of the base with a cheap camera .
The guard asked what I was doing .
I replied , " I 'm a journalist proving that a huge American military base is being constructed on Israeli soil . "
" What 's wrong with that ? " he asked .
" Who else will protect us from the Palestinians ? "
" Where are the Americans ? , " I probed .
" What do you mean , they 're everywhere here .
Everyone in charge is American . "
We drove away .
My friend at the wheel was even more depressed than me .
" It 's a concentration camp , " he said .
To witness Israel 's loss of sovereignty , take Route 443 to the Rosh Haayin junction .
Drive ten minutes until you see Rantis Junction .
The sign points to Beit Arye , and Halamish .
Turn right .
The base is a mile away on the left side .
To salute the American flag , turn left at the entrance road .
The base is located ten minutes from Ben Gurion Airport .
Luckily , a new terminal opened last year , so the Americans have the spacious old terminal to store and move whatever they 're planning to import once Gush Katif and the rest of the settler vermin are rid of .
The article prompted a reporter from a large American radio network to call me .
He wanted to see the base and photograph it .
I met him an hour later and off we went .
First stop , the base gate .
The reporter is amazed to see the American flag waving and to read on a sign that the contractor for the base is an Arab named Mustafa .
He notes what a huge security fiasco hiring an Arab contractor to build an IDF base would be .
Then we see busloads of Arab workers leaving the base by bus .
We continue down the road and photograph the massive buildings and underground digging .
Then we reach the checkpoint at the border of the Green Line .
The base stops precisely there , the border the Americans have planned for us .
We turn into the dirt road to the left and start following the circumference of the base .
The base is enormous , far huger than any other base in the country .
We estimate that several tens of billions of dollars are going into the base itself but the new road surrounding the complex currently being blasted out of the rock has to add another billion dollars to the pricetag .
As for the value of 50 square miles of prime Israeli real estate : more billions .
Neither of us knows what the base will be used for so I suggest , " Let 's go inside and ask someone .
We reach the entrance where two guards are seated .
I ask one if we can speak to someone in charge of the project and photograph inside .
The guards agree to call headquarters and see .
One guard calls , the other points to a path to the right and says , " Let 's see if they 'll let you photograph up there .
You 've never seen so many computers and cameras in your life . "
The base construction manager agrees to talk to us .
We are escorted to his trailer / office where he is sitting with three other sub-managers .
The radio reporter wastes no time askiing , " Are those buildings going to be used to hold evacuated settlers and protesters ? "
The project manager laughs .
I agree .
That is not the purpose of this base .
Next question : " What is this base going to be used for ? " " A storage facility for the IDF . "
I respond : " Suddenly the IDF is suffering a huge lack of warehouse space ?
I mean , how big is this base ? "
" It will be half the area of all Tel Aviv . "
" For storage ?
What is the American role then in this base ? "
" They are building it for us .
All the supervisors are American . "
" What are those underground tunnels for ? " " No tunnels .
It just looks that way because of the topography .
Look , you came to the wrong person .
I 'm a simple builder from Rosh Haayin .
What do I know ? "
We did n't know either .
We now knew the US was building this complex with an Arab chief contractor .
It will not likely or primarily be for IDF use .
One guess was that it will replace all the vital IDF bases in Yesha after a pullout but that was n't satisfying .
Nothing could replace men overlooking the enemy .
I received the reporter 's permission to distribute the photos , six hours before I was to do a 2 hour interview of the Jeff Rense radio program .
I sent him the photos and then chose a select few experts to tell me what they were of .
My first two replies were : Barry , I have seen these kind of installations when I was in the military for years I was stationed at a base where a major part of it was like this .
These are not barracks of any kind .
The metal facilities built up on the rocks are huge electronic facilities probably filled with CIA and extensive phone and other electronic monitoring stuff .
The bunker is one just like the ones I was around at the base I was at here in California .
It is a missile launch bunker .
Somewhere within a mile to 5 miles are silos with the missiles in them , This kind of a facility has minimal personal but filled with covered electronics that can even be monitored from the US itself .
Not one of those large buildings is for people to live in or even really work in .
and This is exactly what I was told in 2001 , and I quote : " It is the intention of the U.S. administration , to ultimately turn over to the United Nations , the military base that is being considered for construction in the heart of Israel .
It is the leaders of the NWO / Illuminati who will decide the appropriate time when all that will occur .
The U.S. is to build the military base within Israel under the guise that it is for the use of the U.S. military .
It is not .
It is to be turned over to the United Nations at the appropriate time .
The sole purpose of this base is for the United Nations use , not the U.S. , and not Israel .
This base will be a disaster to the best interests of Israel .
It will be used against Israelis . "

Just as Sarah Palin was preparing to speak at the Republican convention in St. Paul ( more on that momentarily ) , word bubbled up that the National Enquirer alleged in its print edition that John McCain 's running mate had an affair with a business partner to her husband .
With the sensational charge , the supermarket tabloid is gambling the measure of respect it has earned from more buttoned - down media in the wake of its reporting on John Edwards 's affair with a campaign staffer , which was partially admitted to be true by Edwards himself .
And early signs are that it may lose that gamble :
The Enquirer issued a wishy - washy statement to the Huffington Post addressing its charges only in the context of other allegations , rather than backing them head - on :
" The National Enquirer 's coverage of a vicious war within Sarah Palin 's extended family includes several newsworthy revelations , including the resulting incredible charge of an affair plus details of family strife when the Governor 's daughter revealed her pregnancy .
Following our John Edwards ' exclusives , our political reporting has obviously proven to be more detail - oriented than the McCain campaign 's vetting process . "
The McCain camp issued a full - throated denial and threatened to sue , though it 's worth noting that Edwards at first outright denied the Enquirer 's affair charges in late 2007 .
The Enquirer promises a fuller report next week .
Will the traditional press discuss the story in the meantime ?
Probably not .
Though some publications seemed to regret their silence during the Enquirer 's reporting on the Edwards affair , the tabloid had more evidence then on Edwards than it does now on Palin .
Edwards was seen going into a hotel where his mistress was staying , and ran from reporters when he was confronted hours later as he tried to leave .
And he failed to reiterate a real denial of the charges .
Hopefully some enterprising news outlets will at least attempt to investigate the Enquirer 's allegations , however .
Now 's your chance to shine .

Not so fast on Afghanistan , top Democrat warns John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 18 , 2009
Print This Email This Conventional wisdom appears to be that sending more troops to Afghanistan is a good idea -- and that President George W. Bush 's decision to divert troops from Afghanistan to Iraq was bad .
But a progressive Senate Democrat is n't so sure .
In a subtle rebuke to President Barack Obama 's decision yesterday to deploy 17,000 more US troops to the war - torn country , Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) questioned whether an increased US presence was a good idea .
" After years of a failed foreign policy which distracted us from our top national security priority of defeating al Qaeda and its affiliates , I am encouraged by President Obama 's focus on Afghanistan where the 9/11 attacks originated , " Feingold said in a statement that received little to no attention Tuesday .
" But we need to make sure we have a strategy in place for Afghanistan that will actually work before we commit thousands more U.S. troops .
A military escalation without a strategy to address the complex problems facing Afghanistan and the region could alienate the Afghan people and make it much more difficult to achieve our top national security goal of defeating al Qaeda . "
Feingold has n't made a secret of his skepticism of augmenting US troops in the country the Soviet Union once tried to hold .
" If the devastating policies of the [ Bush ] administration have proved anything , it 's that we need to ask tough questions before deploying our brave service members â and that we need to be suspicious of Washington ' group think , ' " he wrote in a Christian Science Monitor editorial last October .
" Otherwise , we are setting ourselves up for failure . "
He suggested that sending more US troops made more sense in 2006 than it does today .
" Sending more US troops made sense in , say , 2006 , and it may still make sense today , " he wrote .
" The situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated badly over the past year , however , despite a larger US and coalition military presence .
" We need to ask : After seven years of war , will more troops help us achieve our strategic goals in Afghanistan ? " he continued .
" How many troops would be needed and for how long ?
Is there a danger that a heavier military footprint will further alienate the population , and , if so , what are the alternatives ?
And â with the lessons of Iraq in mind â will this approach advance our top national security priority , namely defeating Al Qaeda ? "
" We must target Al Qaeda aggressively , and we cannot allow Afghanistan to be used again as a launching pad for attacks on America , " he added .
" It is far from clear , however , that a larger military presence there would advance these goals . "
Feingold is n't the only skeptic .
In a piece that made the cover of Newsweek last month , veteran war correspondent John Barry and Evan Thomas questioned whether a decision to up troops in Afghanistan could turn the mountainous region into a flaming 1965 jungle .
" A wave of reports , official and unofficial , from American and foreign ( including Afghan ) diplomats and soldiers , present and former , all seem to agree : the situation in Afghanistan is bad and getting worse , " Thomas and Barry wrote .
" Some four decades ago , American presidents became accustomed to hearing gloomy reports like that from Vietnam , although the public pronouncements were usually rosier .
John F. Kennedy worried to his dying day about getting stuck in a land war in Asia ; LBJ was haunted by nightmares about " Uncle Ho . "
In the military , now as then , there are a growing number of doubters .
But the default switch for senior officers in the U.S. military is " can do , sir ! " and that seems to be the light blinking now .
In Afghanistan , as in Vietnam , when in doubt , escalate .
There are now about 30,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
The outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration appear to agree that the number should be twice that a year or so from now . "

Do n't sneeze and drive Having a bad cold or the flu can significantly affect a driver 's responses , insurers have claimed .
One hundred drivers with a range of conditions including colds , stress and headaches and 50 who were healthy were put through a hazard simulator test .
The research , for Lloyds TSB Insurance , found that drivers with colds scored , on average , 11 % worse - equivalent to the effect of a double whisky .
Experts said being ill could affect driving ability .
A point may be reached when it is unwise to drive
Duncan Vernon ,
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
The study , carried out by PCP research agency , looked at 60 people with colds and flu as well as 40 with other conditions including premenstrual syndrome .
They said that applying the 11 % effect to reaction times would add 1 m ( 3.3 ft ) to stopping distance if travelling at 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) - on top of a normal distance of 12 m ( 40 ft ) .
It would add 2.3 m ( 7.5 ft ) onto the normal stopping distance of 96 m ( 315 ft ) if travelling at 70 mph ( 113 km / h ) .
' Avoid driving '
In a separate YouGov poll of 4,000 people carried out for the insurers , 22 people had had an accident while having a bad cold and five while they had flu .
The company estimated that , as 33.5 million adults drive in Britain drive , extrapolating out the YouGov figures would equate to 125,000 accidents caused last year by motorists with colds and flu .
It warned that being unwell at the wheel , particularly when combined with medication , fatigue or a small amount of alcohol , could all have a significant impact on driving ability .
Paula Llewellyn , a spokesperson for the company , said : " Getting behind the wheel when ill causes thousands of accidents every year .
" Try to avoid driving if you 're suffering from cold or flu . "
Dr Dawn Harper , who is supporting the campaign , added : " Safe driving requires concentration and good reactions , both of which are significantly reduced , even by just a mild cold .
" I would advise drivers suffering from these conditions to avoid getting behind the wheel until they are better . "
' Common sense approach ' Duncan Vernon , road safety manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ( RoSPA ) , said : " If you are not well enough to undertake a journey , it could be dangerous for yourself and other road users .
" Severe bouts of common conditions , such as colds , flu , migraine , stomach upsets , infections and hay fever , can affect a driver 's ability to drive safely .
" A heavy cold , for example , can have symptoms that include a headache , blocked sinuses , sneezing and tiredness , and these can impair a driver 's mood , concentration , reactions and judgement . "
He added : " It is important that , when you are ill , you weigh up how necessary journeys are and whether alternative arrangements can be made .
" A common sense approach is needed as it is possible to drive safely when feeling ' slightly under the weather ' , but a point may be reached when it is unwise to drive .
" People need to be honest with themselves about their ability to drive safely . "

16:2 And it was told the Gazites , saying , Samson is come hither .
And they compassed him in , and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city , and were quiet all the night , saying , In the morning , when it is day , we shall kill him .
When the Gazites heard that Samson was coming , they planned to kill him .
16:3 And Samson lay till midnight , and arose at midnight , and took the doors of the gate of the city , and the two posts , and went away with them , bar and all , and put them upon his shoulders , and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron .
At midnight , Samson ripped out the doors and gate posts of the city and carried them to the top of a hill .
Samson and Delilah
16:4-20 16:4-20
16:4
And it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
Then Samson loved a woman named Delilah .
16:5
And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her , and said unto her , Entice him , and see wherein his great strength lieth , and by what means we may prevail against him , that we may bind him to afflict him ; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver .
Find out what makes Samson so strong and we 'll each give you 1100 pieces of silver . [ 1 ]
The Philistines came to Delilah and said to her ,
16:6 And Delilah said to Samson , Tell me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
What makes you so strong ?
How could you be tied up ?
Delilah said to Samson ,
16:7 And Samson said unto her ,
If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
If they tied me with seven new bowstrings that have never been dried , I 'd be as weak as any other man .
Samson said ,
16:8
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
So the Philistines brought Delilah seven new undried bowstrings , and she tied Samson with them .
16:9
Now there were men lying in wait , abiding with her in the chamber .
And she said unto him , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
And he brake the withs , as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire .
So his strength was not known .
Hey Samson , the Philistines are coming !
But he broke the bowstrings as though they were burnt strings .
While several Philistines hid nearby , Delilah said to Samson , But he broke the bowstrings as though they were burnt strings .
16:10 And Delilah said unto Samson , Behold , thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : now tell me , I pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound .
You lied to me before .
Do n't lie to me again .
Tell me how you can be tied up .
Then Delilah said to Samson ,
16:11 And he said unto her , If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
If they tied me with new ropes , I 'd be as weak as any other man .
Samson said ,
16:12 Delilah therefore took new ropes , and bound him therewith , and said unto him , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber .
And he brake them from off his arms like a thread .
So she tied him with ropes and then shouted , Hey Samson , the Philistines are coming !
But he broke the ropes like they were threads .
16:13 And Delilah said unto Samson , Hitherto thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound .
And he said unto her , If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web .
You lied to me again .
Tell me the truth this time .
How you can be tied up ?
Samson said , Weave my braids into the loom .
Delilah said again to Samson , Samson said ,
16:14 And she fastened it with the pin , and said unto him , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
And he awaked out of his sleep , and went away with the pin of the beam , and with the web .
So Delilah wove his seven hair braids into a loom , nailed the whole mess to the wall , and said to him , Hey Samson , the Philistines are coming !
Samson woke up and pulled the loom from the wall .
Samson woke up and pulled the loom from the wall .
16:15 And she said unto him , How canst thou say , I love thee , when thine heart is not with me ?
thou hast mocked me these three times , and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth .
Delilah said to Samson , How can you say you love me when you have lied to me three times when I asked you how come you are so strong .
16:16 And it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
When she kept asking him each day the same question , Samson thought he was going to die .
16:17 That he told her all his heart , and said unto her , There hath not come a razor upon mine head ; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother 's womb : if I be shaven , then my strength will go from me , and I shall become weak , and be like any other man .
If you shave my hair off , I will be as weak as any man .
So finally he told her the truth , saying ,
16:18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines , saying , Come up this once , for he hath shewed me all his heart .
Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her , and brought money in their hand .
Delilah thought that this time he was telling her the truth , so she told the Philistines to come pay her the money that they 'd promised to give her .
16:19 And she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
She made him fall asleep on her knees , and had a man shave off Samson 's seven braids .
And Samson lost his strength .
16:20 And she said , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
And he awoke out of his sleep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself .
And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him .
Hey Samson , the Philistines are coming !
And Samson woke up and said , " I 'll break loose like I always do , " not knowing that the Lord [ Then Delilah said one more time to Samson , And Samson woke up and said , " I 'll break loose like I always do , " not knowing that the Lord [ 2 ] had left him .

16:21 But the Philistines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grind in the prison house .
Then the Philistines captured Samson , gouged out his eyes , and put him in prison .
16:22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
But Samson 's hair begain to grow .
16:23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand .
16:24 And when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
Our god has delivered Samson into our hand .
The Philistines rejoiced and sacrificed to Dagon their god , and said ,
16:25 And it came to pass , when their hearts were merry , that they said , Call for Samson , that he may make us sport .
And they called for Samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
16:26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand , Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth , that I may lean upon them .
While the Philistines ' hearts were merry , they brought in Samson to entertain them .
16:27 Now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that beheld while Samson made sport .
The house was full of about 3000 men and women .
16:28 And Samson called unto the LORD , and said , O Lord God , remember me , I pray thee , and strengthen me , I pray thee , only this once , O God , that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes .
Make me strong so I can get revenge on the Philistines for gouging out my eyes .
Samson called out to God , saying ,
16:29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
16:30 And Samson said , Let me die with the Philistines .
And he bowed himself with all his might ; and the house fell upon the lords , and upon all the people that were therein .
So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life .
Let me die with the Philistines .
And the house fell upon the people , killing them all .
Samson grabbed the pillars and said , And the house fell upon the people , killing them all .
So Samson killed more while dying than he killed in his life . [ 3 ]
16:31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father .
And he judged Israel twenty years .
The world ’s first “ clean coal ” power plant fired up in September in the eastern German city of Spremberg .
Traditional coal - fired power plants , which produce 36 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions in the United States , are the fastest - growing source of energy — and air pollution — around the world .
Clean coal technology does not release carbon dioxide into the air , instead using carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) to collect the gas , concentrate it , and pump it deep underground for permanent storage in natural geologic formations .
At least that is the concept ; there has never been an operational CCS system at a coal - fired power plant , until now .
The pilot plant in Spremberg , built by the Swedish utility Vattenfall , focuses on the carbon capture part of the equation .
First coal is burned , boiling water and producing steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity .
Then the resulting waste gas , largely carbon dioxide and water , is cycled back into a boiler in a process that concentrates the carbon dioxide .
The concentrated gas is “ scrubbed ” by sulfur - absorbent materials to remove the compounds that cause acid rain .
The CO 2 that remains is condensed , compressed to a liquid under high pressure , and cooled to – 18 degrees Fahrenheit , where it remains in liquid form .
Vattenfall soon plans to begin trucking the liquid carbon dioxide more than 100 miles to a depleted natural gas field , where it will be pumped some 3,000 feet underground for storage .
Vattenfall has high hopes for clean coal , but the company regards this process as a bridge to renewable - energy technologies rather than a permanent solution to climate change .
“ Sooner or later we have to find something else , ” says Vattenfall ’s Staffan Görtz .
“ Using this technology will buy us time . ”
U.S. auto sales tumbled again in December , capping one of the worst years for the industry in decades and solidifying the view that more turmoil lies ahead in 2009 .
For the month , sales of cars and light trucks fell 36 % to 896,124 vehicles , according to Autodata Corp , a Woodcliff Lake , N.J. , research firm .
That is an improvement over both November and October ; still , it was the fourth month in a row that sales failed to exceed one million vehicles .

Fifteen Illinois law enforcement officers were charged Tuesday in an F.B.I. sting on counts that included accepting cash in exchange for providing armed protection for drug dealing operations in south suburban Chicago .
Patrick J. Fitzgerald , United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , who described the charges as “ particularly shocking , ” said two of the officers helped an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agent unload and deliver duffel bags stuffed with drugs that had been flown in on a private plane .
“ Ideally , it should be hard to find one corrupt officer , ” Mr. Fitzgerald said in a written statement , “ and it should never be easy to find 15 who allegedly used their guns and badges to protect people they believed were dealing drugs , instead of arresting them . ”
The defendants were charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and / or heroin in drug dealing operations that played out in parking lots at suburban shopping centers and hotels .
They include 10 Cook County sheriff ’s correctional officers , two of whom are on active duty with the National Guard in Afghanistan ; four officers with the suburban Harvey Police Department ; and one Chicago police officer .
Two other men who were not affiliated with the law enforcement agencies were charged as well .

Random and often meaningless utterances from an American studying in the Netherlands
When discussions of ZFS on Linux ( for real , as more than a user - level filesystem ) come up , the usual issue that gets brought up is the licensing problem ;
Sun 's CDDL is incompatible with the kernel 's GPL requirement .
But Sun could always change that if they wanted to , and I think there 's another , more serious problem .
To put it simply , my impression is that the Linux kernel people are generally strongly opposed to what I could call ' code drops ' , where foreign code is parachuted into the Linux kernel .
They want code in the Linux kernel to be real Linux kernel code , in other words to look like it was actually written for the Linux kernel , to be in the same style and use the same idioms as other Linux kernel code .
They do not want compatibility layers , a completely different style than the rest of the kernel , and so on .
( The reasons for this are very sensible ; ' foreign ' code imposes a maintenance cost on everyone who has to deal with it , and if it is in the Linux kernel that potentially means every kernel developer . )
An approach where the hypothetical ZFS in Linux code was basically the Solaris ZFS code base with a compatibility layer to provide Solaris kernel APIs and suchlike on Linux would be unlikely to be accepted by the kernel developers ; from their perspective , the long term costs imposed by such an approach are n't worth the gains .
To get ZFS into Linux , it would almost certainly need to be significantly modified in order to fit into the rest of the Linux kernel code .
( This is n't just a matter of reformatting the code and calling different functions for things like memory allocation .
How the Linux kernel likes to do things is almost certainly significantly different from how the Solaris kernel works , so the code would probably require significant structural modifications to work the Linux way . )
This has two problems .
The lesser one is that it 's a lot of work , much of it grindingly picky and uninteresting , that needs to be done by someone with enough Linux kernel experience to write code that fits nicely into the Linux kernel .
The bigger one is that such a code divergence between ' Solaris ZFS ' and ' Linux ZFS ' would make it hard to keep the Linux code up to date ( or to adopt fixes from Linux back in to the main code base ) , which implies a lot of work on an ongoing basis ( and creates practical concerns for people thinking of using Linux ZFS ) .
( The one example of something similar to this being tried is SGI 's work to get XFS into the kernel .
In the end I believe that it took years of significant work on SGI 's part , and that it did indeed require restructuring how the code worked .
I do n't know if SGI was able to maintain much commonality between the Irix XFS code and the Linux XFS code , or if they basically forked once and stayed diverged . )
Beginning sometime next month , hard core heroin users in Denmark will be able to receive two doses of heroin a day , courtesy of the Danish health system .
They will have to go to one of five drug clinics established around the country , where they will be able to inject pharmaceutical grade heroin under a doctor 's supervision .
downtown Copenhagen
The heroin maintenance initiative was approved a year ago by an overwhelming consensus in the Danish parliament .
Only one small far - left party opposed it , and not on principle , but because of funding issues .
It even won the support of the rightist Danish People 's Party , not normally a bastion of progressive ideas .
Denmark thus joins a small but growing number of European countries , including Switzerland , the Netherlands , and Great Britain that have heroin maintenance programs .
The goal is harm reduction .
" The aim is to improve their state of health , help them avoid committing crimes and stabilize their lives , " Dr. Anne Mette Doms of the Danish Board of Health told the British newspaper The Guardian .
" Quitting altogether is not a realistic option for most of these patients .
For them , this will be a chronic treatment , as if you were treating a chronic disease . "
Support for such programs is a welcome change , said Preben Brandt , chairman of the Council for Socially Marginalized People .
" Five years ago I decided I would not participate in yet another debate on drugs , " he told the Guardian .
" It was too emotional , with different groups being very aggressive .
The counter - argument was always ' you kill people by giving heroin ' or ' with this initiative , you are telling people that taking heroin is OK ' , " he said .
" It is very difficult to have a rational debate when you are arguing against beliefs . "
But successes in other European countries experimenting with heroin maintenance helped change the atmosphere , said Mads Uffe Pedersen , head of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Research at the University of Aarhus .
" The politicians became convinced that it could help those with the most severe drug problems , " he said .
" You could not argue against the ( positive ) findings . "
" The debate became more practical , " agreed Brandt .
" It was about what policies worked and which ones did not .
It was no longer about morality . "
And changing attitudes toward drug users also helped , Brandt said .
" Drug addicts in Denmark are less stigmatized .
They are no longer perceived as criminals who are a danger to society .
They 're seen as patients who have a disease they need help with .
The new scapegoats in Denmark are the foreigners . "
__1770 : __Ludwig van Beethoven is born to a family of musicians in Bonn , Germany .
His Ninth Symphony will play a role in determining the length of the music CD .
Exactly how big a role is a matter of debate .
Had it not been for his untimely death in 1827 , the immortal Ludwig van would today have been 238 years old and likely immortal in more ways than one .
No record has been found listing Beethoven 's exact birth date .
What we know is that he was baptized Dec. 17 in a time and place when infants were usually baptized the day after their birth .
Beethoven revolutionized orchestral music , leading it out of the Classical and into the Romantic era .
His stormy personality molded much of his music , as did his progressive , democratic politics and his personal triumph over the deafness that struck him in midlife .
Among such career - crowning masterpieces as the Missa Solemnis and the late string quartets , Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony ( " Choral " ) with its famous " Ode to Joy " finale has also achieved widespread popularity .
And therein hangs a tale .
The Ninth Symphony runs over an hour , even when performed at breakneck tempo .
In the era of LP records , it generally took three sides – and hence had to be coupled with one of Beethoven 's shorter symphonies , like the Eighth , to complete a two - disc set .
When Sony and Philips were negotiating a single industry standard for the audio compact disc in 1979 and 1980 , the story is that one of four people ( or some combination of them ) insisted that a single CD be able to hold all of the Ninth Symphony .
The four were the wife of Sony chairman Akio Morita , speaking up for her favorite piece of music ; Sony VP Norio Ohga ( the company 's point man on the CD ) , recalling his studies at the Berlin Conservatory ; Mrs. Ohga ( her favorite piece , too ) ; and conductor Herbert von Karajan , who recorded for Philips subsidiary Polygram and whose Berlin Philharmonic recording of the Ninth clocked in at 66 minutes .
Further research to find the longest recorded performance came up with a mono recording conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler at the Bayreuth Festival in 1951 .
That playing went a languorous 74 minutes .
But Philips engineer Kees A. Schouhamer Immink , who participated in the technical negotiations between his firm and Sony , says that 's only part of the story .
Writing in the December 2007 issue of the IEEE Information Theory Newsletter , he notes that , yes , there was pressure from execs to fit the Ninth on a single CD , but commercial and technical considerations played a bigger part .
For one thing , Sony knew that Philips already had a factory capable of producing 115 mm CDs and Sony wanted to change to a 120 mm standard to erase Philips ' headstart in manufacturing .
Also , as negotiations neared an end , Philips engineers made a technical breakthrough that , at the data compression then planned , would have allowed 97 minutes of music to fit on a 120 mm CD , or 75 minutes on a smaller disc .
That , Immink writes , was never seriously considered , because the higher - ups had already decided on 120 mm , for reasons perhaps competitive and perhaps Beethovenian .
Instead , engineers increased the track pitch from 1.45 µm to 1.6 µm , and the bit length from 0.5 to 0.6 µm .
The 30 percent lower information density made production easier and playback more reliable .
Maximum playing length was set at 74 minutes , 33 seconds .
That was theoretically long enough for Furtwängler 's Ninth , but in reality it was n't .
The real limit for CDs started at 72 minutes , the maximum length of the U - Matic videotapes then used for audio masters .
So the Furtwängler performance could n't be released on a single CD until new digital audio technology made that possible in 1997 .
Links to the simplified Philips version that is often cited for the Beethoven story go to a Not Found message : " We are sorry , the page you are looking for has a new URL or is no longer available . "
That , despite the fact that the Philips website 's own search function gives the same URL with this tantalizing summary :
Optical Recording - Beethoven more important than technology
It was not always the technical arguments that won when choices had to be made .
For example , the playing time of the CD was determined posthumously by Ludwig van Beethoven .
The Philips PR department in the Netherlands did n't answer our e-mail query on whether the page has been made unavailable because it 's perhaps only corporate lore or urban legend .
The rumor busters and urban - legend experts at Snopes.com call the Beethoven CD story neither true nor false , but " undetermined . "
So , there 's a hole in our story , just like the hole in the middle of the CD .
The diameter of that hole , the Philips website takes the trouble to point out , matches the size of an old Dutch coin .
So , even if the Japanese prevailed on the diameter of the disc , the Dutch called the shots on the hole .
In any event : Happy Birthday , Ludwig .
And to his fans everywhere , be sure to take time to listen to some of his music today , whether it's on CD , an old LP , an even older 78 , FM , satellite radio , all - Beethoven web radio or an MP3 - loaded iPod .
The flame still shines .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Tuesday ’s collision of two satellites in space may not be the last unless big changes are made in the way government and commercial satellite operators share data , an expert on satellite orbits warned on Friday .
“ Just because it took 50 years for it to happen does n’t mean it ’s going to be 50 years before the next one , ” said retired U.S. Air Force Colonel T.S. Kelso , who was the first director of the Air Force Space Command Space Analysis Centre and is advising Iridium Satellite LLC , whose communications satellite was destroyed in the crash .
Kelso runs a website dedicated to tracking satellites and debris for the private Centre for Space Standards & Innovation and has developed a sophisticated computer program that provides regular information when satellites are going to be passing close by each other or space debris .
The model projected 151 other objects had been more likely to collide on Tuesday than the defunct Russian military satellite and the Iridium satellite , Kelso said .
The closest approach was expected to be about 74 metres ( 243 feet ) between another Russian satellite and debris from a second Russian satellite .
Iridium 33 , the satellite that crashed , was due to pass within 527 metres ( 1,729 feet ) of another object , even closer than the projected pass by the Russian satellite , Kelso said .
“ The process is only as good as the data .
If we do n’t all share the best data we have , we ’re going to have more collisions , ” said Kelso , who added he had been urging the Air Force for years to adopt use of the computer - based system and disclose fully all its orbital data .
He said U.S. officials needed to work more closely with commercial and civilian satellite operators and share data to avert future collisions .
“ There ’s absolutely no reason for anybody to be withholding data that could have been used to avoid collisions like the one on Tuesday . ”
The U.S. Defence Department has said it did not predict the collision and Iridium has said it had no warning before the collision , which created two big clouds of debris , containing at least 500 to 600 identifiable pieces .
Some space experts question if the Air Force had better classified data in its possession than it makes public , as officials have sometimes suggested .
If so , it may have simply not focussed on the Iridium satellite .
“ There ’s plenty of blame to go around , ” said one expert who asked not to be identified .
“ I do n’t know if you can talk about incompetence , but it ’s pretty borderline . ”
Bryan Whitman , a Pentagon spokesman , said on Thursday it was not possible for the U.S. military to track and predict the movements of all 18,000 objects in space all the time .
The Air Force and Defence Department historically have resisted disclosing what they consider classified data to satellite operators , but experts and several nongovernmental organizations have warned for years that failure to share data could eventually result in a collision .
Space has become increasingly crowded due to more nations launching satellites and growing numbers of dead satellites still in orbit but no longer controllable , including a new U.S. missile - warning satellite that failed in September .
Marine Corps General James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former head of the command that runs U.S. military space operations , said on Thursday he would like to see more information - sharing on debris avoidance with Russia , China , France and other countries using space .
GATINEAU , Que. - Canadian actors made a case for new media funding at a hearing today before the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
The performers helped kick off the first day of hearings on regulating online content by urging the CRTC to make Internet service providers follow the same rules as television and radio broadcasters and protect Canadian content online .
" This is a battle for the future .
What we want is a place for Canadian storytellers and our stories , " said Richard Hardacre national president of ACTRA , the union representing 21,000 English - speaking artists across all media platforms .
" We want to share our talents with Canadians and with global audiences .
We need to get it right now .
Tomorrow is too late . "
The CRTC first looked into licensing new media in 1999 but with few households at the time having access to high - speed Internet it decided that licensing would not contribute to its development and that exempting it would not make it difficult for licensed broadcasters to follow the rules .
With 93 per cent of Canadian households having broadband access and anyone being able to watch videos and television shows , play games and listen to music online , the CRTC has decided to revisit the issue .
The ACTRA representatives highlighted that point in their presentations and said licensing new media will provide needed funding and protection of Canadian content .
Comedian Colin Mochrie , of This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Whose Line Is It Anyway ?
said Canadians can easily view clips and entire episodes of his shows on YouTube and can also post their own cell - phone video recordings of his stand - up appearances to the video - sharing site .
" This is now the norm .
People are watching original programs online or on their iPods .
You see , just like television , new media is just another platform for viewing and distributing programming content , " Mochrie said in his presentation , where he argued new media should follow the same rules .
" The space for content is practically endless ; however , being endless , content can get easily lost .
So how do we make sure Canadians can find their own content ? ...
When I star in a movie or a TV show , I do it because I want to work , I want people to see the show , to experience it .
They can't do that if they are n't given the choice . "
Charlotte Arnold , an actress in Degrassi : The Next Generation , said exclusive online content helps promote her show but also means the regulated broadcaster that airs it has to compete with the unregulated side of its business .
" Because of the new media exemption orders , we have a situation where broadcasters are competing with their own unregulated selves , " Arnold said .
" And the broadcasters have already signaled to you in their interventions that as their audiences move to the Internet , they will seek relief from their existing regulations .
This is absolutely the wrong approach .
We say , regulate broadcasting on the Internet , because it 's just another platform . "
Bruce Dinsmore , who provides the English voice on popular Quebec online series Tetes a Claques , said only new funding will ensure professional - quality Canadian content can survive online .

" While there is no question amateur videos can entertain and inform us , they alone cannot be relied upon to share the important stories that Canadians want to share and tell .
For that we need high - quality , professionally produced content , including scripted drama , " Dinsmore said .
" If we want a wide array of content produced we need new sources of funding . "
The ISPs are arguing for the status quo , saying any licensing costs and taxes will be transferred to the consumers .
After a 30 - year run , the owner of the Sacred Grounds Coffee House in San Francisco has shut down the Thursday night open mics .
Mamma Llama , a small coffeehouse in Weaverville , Calif. , no longer features musicians from near and far .
Open mics at the Ragged Edge Coffee House in Gettysburg , Pa. , are down from 50 to 60 audience members to no more than 15 these days .
These grass - roots music events , spawning grounds for the next generation of musical talent , have come up against the demands of US copyright law , as enforced by a handful of companies who act as collection agents for songwriters and composers .
The law states that no performer in a public venue can present someone else 's copyrighted music without their permission and , usually , without compensating them .
A number of agencies , chief among them Broadcast Music , Inc. ( BMI ) and the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) , charge music venues an annual copyright " license fee " ranging from $ 300 to nearly $ 10,000 for the privilege of presenting someone else 's music .
Much of the music at those Ragged Edge open mics was written by the performers , but there was also cover music from the likes of Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead .
ASCAP wanted a license fee of $ 900 a year from Ragged Edge owner Jake Schindel .
He paid up and , to recoup that expense , started charging a cover fee , which caused attendance to dwindle .
He was losing money , stopped paying the fee , and has cut back his musical offerings to unadvertised – and often poorly attended – events .
Bruce Schrader , who owns the Sacred Grounds Coffee House , tried to keep his open mics going by having his performers sign waivers stating they were playing only their original songs .
Nevertheless , he was faced with demands for $ 6,000 in license fees from the agencies and had to shut down the weekly event last year .
" Their argument , " Mr. Schrader said , " was that I could n't possibly know whether the performers were singing any of the millions of copyrighted songs they represent , so I 'd better get a license if I did n't want to get sued . "
As soon as Mamma Llama owner Steve Friedman agreed to pay ASCAP an $ 800 annual fee , two other agencies demanded license fees .
So he just stopped offering live music .
" It was impossible to have the music without getting continuous calls and e-mails from these guys demanding payment , " he recalls .
Smaller music venues around the country are struggling to pay these licensing fees .
Many simply get worn down by repeated demands from the agencies for payment and threats of costly lawsuits and simply drop live music offerings altogether .
" It 's killing the local music scene , " laments folk musician Spook Handy , who 's seen performance venues in his hometown of New Brunswick , N.J. , drop from around 40 in the mid-1980s to half a dozen now .
" We 're not bringing up a new generation of musicians .
They just do n't have places to play . "
There 's general agreement in the music industry that the number of small venues offering live music is declining , although it 's not clear how much of this is due to enforcement of copyright law .
Vince Candilora , ASCAP 's vice president for licensing , says the fees are set at a " very good rate , " adding , " What gives anyone the right to use someone else 's property , even though they 're not making money on it ?
I can guarantee you the phone company 's going to charge you whether you 're making money or not . "
Despite this tough talk , there has been a softening in fees : ASCAP lowered its rates for the smallest venues last January , down from around $ 1,000 a year to $ 350 , closely matching BMI 's current rates .
And there 's the possibility of more reductions :
The Memphis - based Folk Alliance , an advocate for up - and - coming artists , is negotiating with BMI to cut fees even further .
BMI is receptive to the idea , according to Alliance negotiator Renee Bodie , and she hopes new rates will be in place in the next six months and that ASCAP will match any new BMI fees .
" We 're discussing ways to give these smaller places a break , " acknowledges BMI spokesman Jerry Bailey .
" We realize they 're helping to support the next generation of performers . "
If that 's the case , BMI has some fence - mending to do .
Coffeehouse owners complain of intimidation tactics .
Bailey says lawsuits are threatened , and sometimes pursued , only when BMI has proof that violations of copyright law have occurred .
One southern California coffeehouse owner , who asked to remain anonymous , said he was able to get his total annual fees down to $ 1,000 from three agencies by telling them he would n't open unless he got rock - bottom rates .
That was 10 years ago .
He 's still in business , but not happy about having to pay even those fees : " We 're the people who give performers their start , and we have to pay for the privilege . "
Jackie Chan would play Mr Miyagi in the film
Jackie Chan is in negotiations to star in the remake of 1984 hit movie The Karate Kid , according to reports .
The martial arts star would take on the role of mentor Mr Miyagi , industry newspaper Hollywood Reporter says .
The character was made famous by Pat Morita in the original film franchise and earned him an Oscar nomination .
Jaden Smith , the son of Hollywood actor Will Smith , has already been cast as the boy to be mentored by the martial arts expert .
Like the original film , the movie will tell the story of a boy who is picked on by bullies who learns to stand up for himself with the help of Mr Miyagi .
Ralph Macchio starred in three Karate Kid films , while Oscar - winning actress Hilary Swank took over the main role in The Next Karate Kid in 1994 .
Filming for the new movie will begin next year in Beijing .
The unexpected victory of British National Party candidate Paul Golding in a Sevenoaks by - election is the first council seat won by the party outside London and south of the Thames .
Widespread anger , following the economic downturn and continuing rows about jobs for indigenous workers , have delivered the victory .
But , while the BNP has no chance of taking power in Kent , this is no excuse for complacency .
The party ’s foothold in the North West of England , where party leader Nick Griffin is standing , grows stronger .
There , the BNP requires just a 2 per cent swing in the polls to win a seat in the European Parliament .
In that eventuality , the party will gain access to as much as £ 250,000 in public resources to continue its campaign .
To stop this , voters resist any illusion that the BNP could create jobs in Britain .
Its twisted worldview would only achieve the reverse , isolating us in Europe while dividing our nation .
A question mark remains , however , over whether our mainstream politicians can communicate this message .
So far Gordon Brown has done the reverse .
Indeed , his only resonant soundbite – “ British jobs for British workers ” – is now trumpeted on the BNP website .
The Prime Minister should never have used this right - wing dog- whistle phrase .
Each repetition gives succour to the BNP ’s sinister platform , though it makes little sense in this globalised world .
What precisely are “ British jobs ” in a country where more than 300 of the top 800 companies are foreign owned ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And if this is one example of a communication failure by politicians , there are others .
The BNP ’s strength comes from a sense of disenchantment felt by many poor , white communities in Britain whose concerns – not least regarding job stability , inflexible council housing lists , and crime – seem to be ignored by a distant Westminster elite that seems to speak a different language .
The tragedy of this is , of course , that while the growing support for the BNP is a manifestation of broad frustration rather than aggressive racism in Britain , every ballot cast for them strains race relations in Britain a little further .
It falls to the media and mainstream politicians to expose their lies and distortions .
To send these racists to Europe would shame our nation .
BBC spends £ 200,000 of licence fees on legal fight to suppress report on anti-Israeli ' bias '
A campaigner trying to force the BBC to publish an internal report on alleged bias in its Middle East coverage won the latest round of a legal battle yesterday .
The Law Lords held by a 3 - 2 majority that a case brought by London lawyer Steven Sugar under the Freedom of Information
Act was wrongly blocked by legal rulings at earlier hearings .
The BBC is understood to have spent £ 200,000 on the case which has been through the Information Tribunal , the High Court and the Court of Appeal .
It now returns to the High Court for further argument .
BBC 's Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen
Mr Sugar insists that a 20,000 - word report by BBC executive Malcolm Balen should be published as part of a debate about alleged anti-Israeli bias .
The BBC contends that , under the Freedom of Information Act , it is exempt from disclosing information held for the purposes of ' journalism , art or literature ' .
Mr Sugar said yesterday : ' I hope the BBC will now stop the legal argument and publish the report . '
If not , I am confident that my superb legal team will win the whole case in the end .
' The Balen report remains of great public interest .
It has recently been claimed that the report concluded that its Middle - East coverage had been biased against Israel and that the BBC decision not to broadcast the charity aid appeal for Gaza was influenced by this . '
Mr Sugar has previously said he is prepared to take the case all the way to Europe .
A BBC spokesman said the Law Lords had merely clarified the law around the jurisdiction of the Information Tribunal and it was now a matter for the High Court .
Over the years BBC bosses have faced repeated claims that their reporting of the Arab - Israeli conflict has been skewed .
One particularly controversial incident came when Middle East correspondent Barbara Plett revealed she had cried as Yasser Arafat was close to death .
In 2004 the Israeli government wrote to the BBC accusing reporter Orla Guerin of anti-Semitism and identifying with Palestinian terror groups .
It has been suggested the BBC 's recent refusal to show a charity appeal for Gaza , sparking thousands of complaints , was a reaction to these accusations .
Politicians have previously branded the corporation 's refusal to reveal the report as ' absolutely indefensible ' as it is in the public interest .
The corporation has also employed top barristers to fight its case over the years that the legal battle has rumbled on .
Intelligent design -- long promoted by people who want to see it replace evolution in science textbooks and classrooms -- has been added to the agenda for a Vatican conference in March marking the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species .
But ID , which posits that a higher power must have guided the evolution of species across time , will not be presented as " science . "
Instead , a zoologist at the University of Rome who is a conference organizer , told The Associated Press ,
The committee agreed to consider ID as a phenomenon of an ideological and cultural nature , thus worthy of a historic examination , but certainly not to be discussed on scientific , philosophical or theological grounds .
So here will be the Vatican , where the official position is that science and faith are compatible , sharing the international spotlight with with those discount Darwin 's game - changing work on natural selection , unguided by God or a higher power .
( Remember , we 're not even touching on what kicked off " life " to begin with , just on what happened next ) .
Do you think ID belongs on the Darwin conference stage -- culturally or scientifically ?

9 Of The Most Entertaining Cameos In Movie History !
What ’s more fun than a well - placed cameo ?
Those brief appearances by a well - known actor or character that has relations to the title their appearing in can really brighten a movie and excite the fans who are n’t expecting them .
In honor of the cameo , I ’ve decided to compile a list of cameos that just flat have entertained me over the years .
Keep in mind , these are n’t necessarily the best cameos ever done ; I know there ’s some crazy good ones like the Stooges in It ’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and so on .
No , these are some of the most amusing cameos that brought a little smile to my ( and surely many others ) face or made people keel over laughing .
Some are just classic and some are complete nostalgia , but one thing is for sure … all are a damn good time .
Oh , and I do n’t want to hear anything about Neil Patrick Harris from Harold & Kumar .
While hilarious , he was playing himself as a full character .
You ca n’t cameo as one of the main parts in TWO movies , even if you are playing yourself .
In some cases there ’s a little video included to remind yourself how good these are , so if you enjoy a good cameo like we do , please continue reading to check out 9 of the Most Entertaining Cameos in Movie History !
The Wedding Singer — Billy Idol
An 80 ’s rock star in your 1998 movie that takes place in the 80’s who ’s playing himself ?
How could that possibly fail ?
It ca n ’t .
The best part about this cameo is that it ’s moderately funny when Billy Idol shows up swigging from a bottle on a first class plane ride to Vegas ; but when he gets in on the last leg of the movie , it actually becomes a very funny and memorable cameo appearance .
I know , this is a really cheesy movie to include , but I happen to like it , so you ’ll all just have to bite down .
I did place it in the number 9 position .
At least I did n’t do like , Adam Sandler ‘s cameo in The Hot Chick .
Honorable guilty - by - association mention goes to Quentin Tarantino ‘s cameo in Little Nicky — a cameo that was supposed to be returned by Sandler in Inglourious Basterds , but that sadly did n’t work out .
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II : The Secret of the Ooze — Vanilla Ice
OK , I know , it ’s Vanilla Ice and that ’s silly of me to include here .
But think back to that time in 1991 when you finally got your second dose of Turtle butt - kicking magic .
I was 10 years old and some of the top rapping talents at the time were names like Kris Kross ( remember them ?
They ’ll make you jump , jump ! ) and Mr. Ice , so when he showed up , it was a most entertaining moment .
Many years later , I received word that a friend of mine ’s buddy was playing in Vanilla Ice ’s rock band and they were playing at a bar in Massachusetts .
Naturally this was something that could absolutely not be passed up and the night ended with my very own live viewing of “ Ninja Rap ” being performed .
It ’s this kind of nostalgia that gives Vanilla Ice the 8 - spot .
Scream 3 — Jay & Silent Bob
We all know that Scream 3 was just terrible as a movie , but that does n’t mean that this cameo is n’t brilliant .
As Courteney Cox ’s Gail Weathers leaves a movie set , everyone ’s favorite stoner pals Jay and Silent Bob walk along while on one of the studio tours .
They quickly identify the reporter as Connie Chung and kindly ask how Maury Povich is doing .
It ’s short , completely random , and incredibly damn funny if you ask me .
The only way the movie would have been better is if they ended up being the killers at the end .
This cameo was eventually traded for a Wes Craven cameo in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .
If you have n’t seen Scream 3 , then it ’s a little tough because you would have to sit through the whole movie to get to this one little itty - bitty part that just might be the only good thing in there , so I ’ve included the clip below .
Tropic Thunder — Tom Cruise
In one of the most talked about cameos in recent memory , Tom Cruise appears in Tropic Thunder as Les Grossman , a 100 % completely insane studio executive who ’s financing the film being made within the film .
If you need any proof as to why this cameo is on the list — it may just be the only cameo nominated for a damn Golden Globe .
Along with this one cameo , Tropic
Thunder itself deserves to be on the list just for it ’s massive amounts of celebrity face - peeks .
Hot Fuzz — Peter Jackson , Cate Blanchett
Easily the smallest cameo on our list .
In fact , you may not even be aware of these two having been in Hot Fuzz at all .
But it ’s the hilarious subtly that wins my heart here .
Peter Jackson , the man behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy , shows up in a split - second flashback as a drunken mall Santa who stabs Simon Pegg ‘s Nicolas Angel in the hand .
Cate Blanchett ‘s cameo is a little bit more visible … sorta .
She plays Angel ’s girlfriend - in - disguise as he tries to find her among the identically dressed forensic people at the scene of a crime .
Both appear pretty much right at the start of the movie , but I was oblivious to both until months after I had seen it !
Austin Powers in Goldmember — Kevin Spacey , Danny DeVito , Gwyneth Paltrow , Tom Cruise , Steven Spielberg
At current time , Austin Powers is n’t loved quite like it was at the peak of its popularity .
Most of its fan base has grown up and the many one - liners were so incredibly over - used that people developed some disdain for the movies — similar to something like Napoleon Dynamite and how un-funny that movie was after its barrage of fan -quoting .
But if you go back to when Austin Powers WAS at the peak of its popularity , it ’s very hard to beat the reaction that it received for its star - studded opening sequence of Austin Powers in Goldmember .
Unfortunately Britney Spears shows up at the end and ruined the mood a bit , but then her head explodes , so everyone wins , folks !
Personally , I ’d rather see more Austin Powers movies than something like The Love Guru .
Re-quench your memory with the clip below !
Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy — Ben Stiller , Luke Wilson , Tim Robbins
When it comes to the Judd Apatow universe , it ’s hard to choose cameos because all of those guys just hang out together on the set of whoever is making a movie at that particular time .
Sometimes you wonder if they ’re even supposed to be in these movies or if they just showed up and stepped in during a take .
But one cameo in particular was just too good to leave off the list .
During Anchorman , a massive battle among rival news teams breaks out behind a building .
While the various news teams run to join the fight which already includes Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn ‘s respective teams , we see the likes of Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins show up , as well as Ben Stiller as the head of the Spanish news team .
Robbins and Wilson show up again a little later in the movie , but I still consider it a cameo and a high one on my list !
Honorable mention to a burrito - hating , dog- punting Jack Black .
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back — Matt Damon , Ben Affleck , and Gus Van Sant
Some people just ca n’t stand Kevin Smith movies , and I feel sad for those people .
Also , I know that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck has their start as part of Smith ’s gang , so their showing up in one of his movies is no big deal .
But seriously , I have to look beyond all of that and see this simply as one of the most genius cameos of all time .
Affleck and Damon appear on one of the many sets that Jay & Silent Bob are running around , and they ’re filming their brand new movie Good Will Hunting 2 : Hunting Season .
For them to take the highly - praised drama from director Gus Van Sant ( who ’s sitting nearby in this scene , counting money ) and turn it into a parody of itself and Hollywood ’s over - need for sequels , it was just too perfect .
Not to mention the fact that they even went and got the random extra dude from the original movie to use in the cameo spoof !
The Princess Bride — Billy Crystal , Carol Kane
My number one favorite cameo goes without any question .
It ’s simple , it ’s old school , and it ’s undeniably good .
The movie is The Princess Bride and it ’s one of my favorites of all time ; the scene is after our hero Westley ( Cary Elwes ) is killed .
In a last ditch effort to bring him back to life , Fezzik ( Andre the Giant ) and Inigo Montoya ( Mandy Patinkin ) bring him to the retired Miracle Max for a miracle remedy .
The scene is but a few minutes long , but Crystal is in prime form as the miracle worker who looks like he ’s about 254 years old .
The banter between him and his taunting wife ( Carol Kane ) is perfect and many quotes came from this one scene , including one of the great quotes , “ Bye , bye , boys ! ” – “ Have fun storming the castle ! ”

The City Council on Wednesday agreed to pay nearly $ 13 million to people injured or mistreated in a May Day melee in MacArthur Park , bringing to more than $ 30 million the money spent over the last two weeks to settle lawsuits alleging LAPD misconduct .
The action served as a reminder of the Los Angeles Police Department ’s troubled past and its continuing path toward regaining the trust of some city residents and elected officials .
For the LAPD , Wednesday ’s $ 12.85 - million payout -- covering most of the claims by immigration demonstrators and bystanders injured May 1 , 2007 , in MacArthur Park -- has a few strings attached .
Under the settlement , the department must submit to court oversight of its crowd control procedures -- another layer of federal involvement that comes as LAPD leaders are impatient to be free of a long - standing and more onerous monitoring program imposed after the Rampart Division corruption scandal .

The May Day settlement , approved unanimously by the council , comes a week after members agreed to pay $ 20.5 million to settle civil rights lawsuits filed by four current and former LAPD officers , three of whom were awarded $ 15 million by a federal jury after claiming to have been falsely arrested and maliciously prosecuted during the Rampart probe .
That sum was on top of more than $ 75 million the city has paid to civilians affected by the 1999 scandal .
“ Over $ 32 million in these last two weeks on Police Department litigation cases -- that ’s a tremendous amount of money , ” Councilman Dennis Zine said after the 11 - 0 public vote .
“ My concern is that the Police Department needs to be held accountable and responsible .
. . .
There are still other cases pending .
This is n’t the end . ”
He added , “ While crime ’s down , we respect that , the conduct of the officers is important , and the management of the department is ultimately responsible for that . ”
Council President Eric Garcetti noted that the cost of the May Day agreement was enough to hire almost 130 police officers .
“ It underscores why police reform is as important as police hiring , ” Garcetti said .
“ A handful of officers can cost the city millions of dollars .
We saw that in Rampart ; we ’re seeing that here -- more than a handful here . ”

The settlement approved Wednesday will resolve a class action lawsuit and more than half a dozen individual lawsuits in federal court .
It accounts for a large portion of the more than 300 May Day claims against the city .
The allegations of police mistreatment and excessive force resulted from clashes in MacArthur Park as an immigration march wound down .
Officers from the LAPD ’s elite Metro Division used batons and fired rubber bullets to disperse what was a predominantly peaceful gathering .
Officials said the confrontations were prompted by a group of agitators who threw bottles and other objects at police .
Dozens of people , including a number of journalists and police officers , were injured .
“ Our clients are really very happy with this , ” said Carol Sobel , a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs , after the agreement was announced .
“ What it stands for is recognition that the police were wrong . ”
Councilman Ed Reyes , who represents the MacArthur Park area west of downtown , said the settlement was part of a community healing process .
Advertisement
“ This was very , very critical , ” he said .
“ Now we can say we acknowledge our mistakes ; we are making every effort to address the weaknesses in our process , in our implementation as a Police Department , and more importantly recognizing that the community does matter .
We ’re giving them the value they deserve in terms of reaching a settlement and helping those who are hurt . ”
Two other May Day cases are pending in federal court , and there are 15 in state court , said a spokesman for the city attorney .
Only one related case , involving a broken camera , was settled before this week .
Nick Velasquez , a spokesman for City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo , declined to estimate the expected cost of the remaining litigation .
But he said the settlement covered more than 90 % of the cases filed in federal court by demonstrators .
The agreement covers costs and legal fees , and preempts any of the 5,000 people who had gathered in the park from filing a class - action case in the future , Velasquez said .
With graphic images of the violent chaos recorded by photographers and television crews in the park , the melee gained immediate worldwide attention .
It dealt a serious public relations blow to a Police Department that under Chief William J. Bratton has made a deliberate effort to shake a reputation for brutality that stemmed from the 1991 Rodney G. King beating , the Rampart scandal and other incidents .
Advertisement
In the immediate aftermath , Bratton removed two command - level officers from their posts and created the Critical Incident Management Bureau , which oversees the department ’s handling of major events and protests .
In September , after a long internal investigation that detailed the breakdown in command that led to the melee , Bratton announced plans to suspend 11 lower - ranking officers and called for the termination of four others for excessive use of force , failing to rein in other officers or lying to investigators during the inquiry .
Under the terms of the agreement approved Wednesday , the way the LAPD responds to large crowds is cemented in writing .
It leaves the department considerable discretion , but nonetheless places limits on when police can break up a gathering and when they can use force on crowds .
Batons , for example , can be used to push -- but not strike -- protesters who refuse a police order to disperse .
Less - lethal projectiles , such as rubber bullets and bean bags , ca n’t be used on a peaceful crowd that ’s retreating , and police helicopters must not disrupt speeches and marches by flying too low .
For at least the next four years the judge who has overseen the May Day settlement negotiations will also watch the department ’s handling of future protests to ensure that it abides by the agreement .
A more sweeping oversight stemming from Rampart has also followed the department for the last several years .
Advertisement
Sobel acknowledged the LAPD has made improvements since 2007 , but said the agreement was a needed safeguard .
The department , she stressed , made similar promises when the city settled claims after the 2000 Democratic National Convention , where police clashed with protesters .
“ The key question with the LAPD has always been , ‘ How do you move from an agreement on paper to real institutional change ?
How do you change the culture ? ’ ” she said .
“ There have been really good signs , but every once and a while they slip back . ”
Although several council members praised Bratton ’s response to the melee and the LAPD ’s retraining efforts , they added that the department ’s internal report on the incident made it difficult for the city to defend the lawsuits in court .
“ They brought officers up on charges ; they admitted errors .
So when you admit errors , then what are you going to do for a defense ? ”
Zine said , adding that city lawyers advised council members that going to trial would be “ extremely expensive . ”
Advertisement
Garcetti said he was satisfied with the department ’s reforms , which he said “ brought back what should have been common sense training . ”
“ To say that we are 100 % of the way there -- I do n’t believe that we are , ” he said , “ but the way in which the department responded was a sea change from the past in taking immediate responsibility , not just along the rank - and - file level , but up the chain of command . ”

( CNN ) -- Tim Masters squarely blames Fort Collins , Colorado , police and prosecutors for his inability to land gainful employment and for his not having a wife and kids at this stage in his life .
Tim Masters , left , stands with attorney David Wymore , right , before Masters ' release from prison last year .

In 1987 , Masters became the prime suspect in the slaying of Peggy Hettrick , a 37 - year - old found in a field near his house .
Among the reasons police said they focused on Masters was that he failed to report the body after he found it and his childhood drawings and stories suggested he was fixated on death .
Masters was convicted of murder in 1999 , but a judge last year threw out the conviction and released him from prison , citing new evidence that did not implicate Masters .
Masters now has a lawsuit pending against several police officers , ex-prosecutors and the city .
The city of Fort Collins has asked a federal judge to dismiss the case .
Now 37 , Masters sat down for a phone interview with a CNN reporter who covered his case and subsequent release .
He said he still holds a grudge against the police and prosecutors who put him behind bars .
Watch Masters the day after his 2008 release »
He 's living in Greeley , Colorado , and does n't get back to Fort Collins much , but he does love traveling .
Most notably , he 's traveled to Amsterdam , Netherlands , to appear on a talk show with Richard and Selma Eikelenboom , the Dutch forensic scientists who discovered the DNA evidence that ultimately freed Masters .
Things can be tough sometimes , but anything is better than prison , Masters said of his first year as a free man since being imprisoned .
CNN : How have things been in the year since your release ?
Masters :
It 's a struggle to earn enough money to pay my bills and everything , make a living .
Other than that , life is good .
CNN : Do you have a job ?
Masters : I buy stuff at auction and I sell it on eBay .
Case History
In 1987 , a bicyclist found the maimed body of Peggy Hettrick , 37 , near the home of Tim Masters .
Masters , then 15 , quickly became the top suspect in the slaying , but it was not until 1999 that police and prosecutors saw Masters convicted .
He was sentenced to life in prison .
In hearings that began in September 2007 , Masters ' new defense team alleged police and prosecutorial misconduct in the investigation and trial .
In January 2008 , a judge threw out the conviction and freed Masters after DNA evidence pointed to someone else .
Masters ' attorneys last year filed a lawsuit against several Fort Collins , Colorado , police and former prosecutors , alleging malicious prosecution , attorney Maria Liu says .
The suit is in its pre-discovery phase .
CNN : Do you have trouble finding a job because of your time in jail ?
Masters :
Yeah , I think that has a lot to do with it .

CNN : How else have you been keeping yourself busy ?
Masters : Pretty much work .
That 's it .
CNN : Describe a typical day .
Masters :
The big challenge is , first of all , you 've got to find out where the auctions are .
Once you get that down , then you go to the auctions .
Another disadvantage I have is I 'm a little outdated on the prices of things , so I 'm thinking things are worth a lot less than what they 're going for .
So I have to learn what things are worth now .
I go to the auction , and I bid on stuff .
I try and buy it cheap enough that I can make a profit on it , load it into the truck , bring it back to the house .
I have shelves all in my basement full of just odds and ends .
I put it all on the shelves .
I do research on the computer and find out which ones I can actually make a profit on , and I list those .
You list the item on eBay and let it run its course through the auction for usually seven days .
If it sells , you pack it and ship it off .
If it does n't sell , you can either re-list it as an auction item , re-list it as a store item or throw it in the trash .
CNN : What kind of money do you make in a typical week ?
Masters :
Not enough .
CNN : What do you enjoy doing most that you were n't able to do in prison ?
Masters : Travel .
I 've been to see my sister about four times since I 've been out .
She 's in California .
I have an uncle in Arizona .
This goes along with the eBay business .
I go down there every once in a while .
He has a warehouse full of used restaurant equipment , and I go down there every so often .
I go through his warehouse , take pictures of all the new stuff he 's got in and I list it on eBay for him .
Sometimes it sells , sometimes it does n't .
In April , a TV station over in Amsterdam paid to fly me over there to be on a talk show with Richard and Selma [ Eikelenboom ] from the DNA lab .
That was cool .
Watch a prosecutor explain why Masters ' conviction was reversed »
CNN : What did you have the hardest time getting used to after being in prison so long ?
Masters : Maybe cell phones ?
Cell phones are everywhere now .
They did n't used to be so common .
I had a cell phone before I was arrested , but the last year before I was arrested , I did n't even keep service on it .
Now , I do n't know what I 'd do if I did n't have a cell phone .
It has my calendar , my address book , everything on it .
CNN : You spent some prime years of your life -- late 20s , early 30s -- in jail for a crime you did n't commit .
What do you think you missed most by not being a free man in those years ?
Masters :
There 's so much .
Right off the top , I 'd say having a family .
I think they 're very much responsible for me not having a family right now , a wife and kids .
But it goes back further than just them arresting me .
It goes all the way back to my high school days when they labeled me a murder suspect among all my peers and my teachers and everything .
It goes back a long time .
Watch police interrogate a 15 - year - old Masters »
CNN : They did the same thing when you were in the military , too , right ?
Masters : Yeah , in '92 .
CNN : You said last year that you were staying away from alcohol because you were uncertain what emotions it might stir up .
Are you still staying away from booze ?
Masters :
Yeah , that went to hell when I went to Europe .
I had a couple beers over in Europe .
I did n't get drunk , but we'd have a few beers .
CNN : Are you still cautious with your use of alcohol ?
Masters : Yeah , I think I am .
CNN : Why ?
Masters : No. 1 , I do n't want a hangover [ laughing ] .
I have a lot of repressed anger from all those years , but I do n't think it 's going to snap on anybody when I have a couple of beers though .
CNN : Any hard feelings toward the Fort Collins Police Department or the prosecutors in the case ?
Masters : Oh , absolutely .
They locked me up for a decade for something I did n't do .
Read how DNA pointed to a new killer
CNN : If you could talk to the prosecutors or police who handled your case , what would you say to them ?
Masters : I do n't want to talk to them at all .
CNN : Talk about your lawsuit against the prosecutors and police .
Who does it target ?
Masters : Mainly , [ former prosecutors , now Judges ] Jolene Blair and Terri Gilmore and [ Fort Collins police Lt. ]
Jim Broderick , but there are a few other defendants involved and the city , but in my mind those are the big three .
Key players in the case »
CNN : Tell me about the suit , what it alleges .
Masters :
You 'd probably be better to talk to the lawyers about that .
CNN : What would you say to the Hettrick family , which is now left to wonder what happened to their daughter ?
Masters : I do n't know what I 'd say to them .
It 's a damned shame that [ the police ] did this to them , too , telling them they got the guy when they did n't have the right person .
I do n't know what I 'd say to them .
That 's a tough question .
CNN : Do you get back to Fort Collins much ?
Masters : I try to stay away from Fort Collins .
I still have family over there though , so I 'm over there every once in a while .
CNN : Does going there bring back bad memories ?
Masters : Yeah , and every time I go over there I feel like I 'm on the defensive , every time I see a police car with someone pulled over or something -- well , let me give you an example .
One day , my aunt and I were coming back from having lunch , and we were about to make a left and the road kept going straight .
On the other side of the street , they had the yellow police tape up , and this is only two blocks from my aunt 's house .
I 'm thinking , " Oh great , I wonder when they 're going to come interrogate me for something that happened over here . "
It turns out the yellow tape was up because there was a telephone pole that was leaning over , but it looked like crime scene tape .
I did n't know .
But I can't live like that , wondering when they are going to harass me for something that I did n't have anything to do with .
They did it to me before .
CNN : So you 're keeping a low profile ?
Masters : Yeah , pretty much .
All About Tim Masters • Fort Collins
This morning I read in the Code Project newsletter about Synergy , an open source software package that allows you to share a single keyboard and mouse between multiple workstations ( each with their own monitor ( s ) ) .
Since I regularly work on three different systems in any given day , and I often find myself using the wrong keyboard while staring at the screen and wondering why no text is showing up , this looked like just the thing for me .
Synergy lets you configure one of the systems as a server ( the one to which the keyboard and mouse that you want to share are connected ) , and any number of other systems as clients .
On the server , you describe where each screen is in relation to all of its neighbors .
Then , as you move the mouse to the edge of one monitor that borders another , focus shifts to that monitor ( and the system attached to it ) .
Here ’s the main configuration panel on Windows :
You install Synergy on every computer involved , and then use this panel to designate the server ( as shown above ) or client .
On the server , you then click the “ Configure … ” button :
This dialog is somewhat counter - intuitive .
The first thing you must do is add “ Screens ” by pressing the “ + ” button under that listbox .
You must add the server ’s name and all of the clients here .
Then , in the bottom section , you start by entering the data in the “ 0 to 100 % ” line of edit boxes .
They do n’t explain what some of this means : the percentages refer to how much of that border is adjacent to the other monitor ( which allows you to have , for instance , one large monitor with two smaller ones stacked vertically beside it — each might use 50 % of the larger screen ’s border ) .
The first dropdown indicates which side ( left , right , top , or bottom ) of the system selected in the next dropdown is adjacent to the system selected in the last dropdown .
Once you ’re done figuring that out , do n’t forget to press the “ + ” sign below it , or it wo n’t be saved !
Design note : save everything I type when I press OK — unless I delete it , please .
Notice how you have to define both relationships for every pair of adjacent monitors : “ ninkasi is to the right of enlil ” , and “ enlil is to the left of ninkasi . ”
This lets you specify varying percentages — but if you forget to define both directions , your focus will get trapped in one of the sessions .
Fortunately , all you need to do is terminate that session to restore focus to the server .
Once you have all of the relationships set up , press “ Test ” .
Then go to each client , run Synergy , enter the server ( first time only ) and press “ Test ” .
If you encounter no errors , you ’ll be able to move the mouse all the away across all of your monitors .
Try typing into applications on each one — you can even copy / paste between them !
Text or graphics !
Synergy uses TCP / IP to transfer the clipboard , as well as mouse and keyboard events .
I was impressed that this seems to work well on Vista x64 , even though it ’s a 32 - bit executable .
It seamlessly ties my 64 - bit systems together with an old 32 - bit XP system as well .
It ’s supposed to work with OS / X and Unix systems , too — but I have n’t tried those out yet .
Synergy nicely handled the dual monitor configuration on my server system , detecting the right edge as being the right side of my laptop monitor , even though my second monitor is on the left and is configured as primary .
I tried setting up hot keys so I could switch monitors without using the mouse , but this seemed to work very sporadically .
After playing around with it for a while , I managed to render my right parenthesis unusable .
Shift+0 was just a dead key .
Rebooting sorted that , though .
Oh well , reaching for the mouse is still easier than reaching for a different keyboard .
To run for real , press “ Start ” , which removes the UI and shows a taskbar icon instead .
You can also configure AutoStart from the button on the main panel .
Starting on login worked well for me , but starting on system startup did n’t seem to take ( on Vista x64 ) .
That means , of course , that I still have to keep my other keyboards handy in order to login .
I also had trouble connecting a client that had the Cisco VPN client running , even though I could map shared drives on that system .
In fact , if the workstation with the active VPN had any drive on another workstation mapped , I could n’t connect that workstation , either .
However , if I got all systems connected before starting the VPN client , all worked well .
So , my daily routine will be to login to the server system first , then login to each of my clients , then start the VPN , then play Evil Genius all day .
MUWAHAHAHA !

I just got off the phone with Terry Carter from the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force .
Carter contacted me regarding my run in with Securitas security guards ( pictured to the left ) down in Carson at the BP Refinery month before last .
The call was friendly enough .
Carter assured me that his call was a courtesy call and that I was not in any sort of trouble .
His main concern was asking to make sure that I harbored no ill will towards the United States Government .
I assured Carter that I harbored no ill will towards the U.S. Government that I was a proud American , etc .
We talked for about 15 minutes over the incident .
Carter said that Securitas reported that they asked me and a friend not to take photographs and we ran away from them and jumped into a black SUV .
I explained to Carter that this was not how the incident went down , that we spent a good 15 or 20 minutes talking to the security guard , but insisting on our rights to photograph the refinery .
And only left after that .
I gave Carter my blog address which he asked for .
I suspect I wo n’t be hearing from the FBI again over the incident .
Update : Apparently I got the agent ’s name wrong .
It ’s Terry Carter , not Chris Carter as originally reported , my wife just called me from home and told me that he ’d stopped by the house earlier today and left his business card asking me to call him .
A forced 3 week vacation at work during Christmas and new years made us plan a holiday back in September .
Due to visa conditions , holiday period bookings and time restriction we had to plan our itinerary in September itself .
I wanted to visit New Zealand for its natural beauty , it being an underrated travel destination and the fact that I live in Melbourne which is closer to NZ than India is .
Tickets to Christchurch
With so much competition between the airlines and the absence of need of food in a 3 hour flight the tickets were cheap .
$ 400 AUD return was a bargain , if I waited a couple of weeks it would 've been cheaper .
If there are flights from Queenstown to Australia , it would 've been better as one need n't drive back to Christchurch .
Car hire
We hired a car as opposed to hiring a campervan or trailer as the requirements were to have a private toilet and cheap at the same time .
Campervan's are not economical for a short trip as the cost of hiring a car and living in motels / bed and breakfasts is cheaper than hiring a campervan .
Besides campervans need maintenance .
Melbourne to Christchurch
We took the low budget airline Pacific Blue to Christchurch and lost two hours by the time we landed in NZ .
The South Island of NZ has a population of 800,000 only of which Christchurch is the largest city , so not much traffic on the roads .
Except , of course , tourists like us .
Driving in NZ is the same as Australia , but the first thing I noticed is that when turning left at traffic lights one should give way to on coming traffic from the opposite direction , where as in Australia when turning left at the traffic lights you have right of way after the pedestrians if they are crossing .
Christchurch
Our primary reason to travel to NZ was sightseeing and Christchurch does n't offer much for our requirement , so after checking in to Base Christchurch ( Backpackers accomodation with hostel type and hotel type rooms ) we drove to Akaroa .
As we started off at 5.30 PM and were in a hurry we could not carry our cameras and missed taking pictures of this wonderful harbour town .
You can look at Flickr pics of Akaroa here .
Akaroa is about an hour 's drive from Christchurch .
By the time we were back to our hotel it was 8.30 PM and still light .
Christchurch to Hanmer Springs and then to Oamaru
Brochures are a traveller 's friend .
But not all brochures say the truth .
One such not - so - true brochure was the Hanmer Springs one .
We thought that the hot springs of Hanmer Springs were natural springs , but were wrong .
So an hour plus drive and about $ 15 entrance to the Springs we were greeted with artificial pools with different temperatures and mineral quality waters in each pool .
After spending an hour there we started off to Oamaru .
On the road to Hanmer Springs there is river with jade coloured waters , somehow we missed the road to get closer to this place .
Oamaru is a quiet town on the coast overlooking the Pacific Ocean , the main attraction of this town are the two Penguin settlements , one of Yellow Eyed Penguins ( only about 20 nest on the beach ) and one of the smaller Blue Penguins ( hundreds of these ) .
The Yellow Eyed Penguins on the Bushy beach were too far to take pictures of but a group called New Friends of Bushy Beach left two pairs of binoculars for viewing pleasure .
Bushy beach Oamaru :
Blue Penguin Colony is about 10 minute drive from Bushy beach .
The penguins come back to their nests here after dawn starting at around 9 PM during summer .
For $ 20 per adult head one can sit in a viewing platform and watch the penguins coming back to their nests .
Photography is not allowed here in case the automatic flash of cameras startle the penguins .
Oamaru to Queenstown
A three hour drive from Oamaru will lead one to Queenstown , the adventure capital of the world .
The journey itself was delightful with lakes , historic paintings , dinosaur remains finds on the way .
On the way to Queenstown from Oamaru :
But the destination was something we did n't quite expect .
Situated on Lake Wakatipu , this picturesque town is the stuff made of material for computer wall papers and scenic calendars .
The only adventure activity we did in Queenstown was ride the jet boat .
For about $ 75 - $ 90 one can get a ride on this boat which goes at high speeds and takes 360 degree turns .
Queenstown ( not just good for Adventure sports ) :
Queenstown to Te Anau
We ventured into Fiordland part of NZ to visit Milford Sound .
While Queenstown to Te Anau in itself is picturesque the drive from Te Anau to Milford ( about an hour 's drive ) takes ones breath away .
The combination of snow capped mountains with clouds foraging in between them , rainbows , colourful flowers make the sights overwhelming , there is not enough space in camera memory cards to capture all the beauty .
On road to Milford Sound :

A new plugin from Google allows Frontrow users to stream Hulu and Netflix videos straight to their computer .
The plugin is called ‘ Understudy ’ and is hosted over at Google Code .
Once the plugin is installed , users can select from a number of feeds to add to their Frontrow page .
For example , you can add a feed for Hulu ’s most popular videos of the week and even for Hulu ’s most recently uploaded movies .
Our initial impressions ?
It ’s a winner .
Browsing through Hulu ’s video library has never been smoother or more convenient , and in over 2 days of use , we ’ve yet to run into any bugs .
We mention this because Google notes that the plugin is still a “ work in progress ” and that there are some kinks still being worked out .
The only feature conspicuously absent from ‘ Understudy ’ is the ability to move forward and backwards once a stream has begun .
In other words , you ca n’t jump ahead 20 minutes if you ’re watching a 2 hour long movie .
That gripe aside , Understudy is definitely worth checking out and can be downloaded over here .
Hopefully , Apple will introduce similar Hulu and Netflix integration into the next update for Apple TV .
Lastly , Frontrow does n’t typically show up by default in the dock , so for users who do n’t even know what Frontrow is , press command - escape in order to launch it .

BEIJING , Feb. 18 ( Xinhua ) --
A meteorological official said Wednesday that the persistent drought has almost ended in Beijing as snow , assisted by artificial means , continues to fall in the city .
Zhang Qiang , deputy director of the Beijing Weather Modification Command Center , said the center had used artificial means since Tuesday to increase the snow in order to ease the drought .
" More than 500 cigarette - size sticks of silver iodide were seeded into clouds from 28 weather rocket - launch bases in the city , " Zhang said .
" It [ relief from drought ] is also as a result of a rainfall last week , which dampened the dry soil greatly , " said Guo Wenli , head of the Climate Center with the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau .
The Chinese capital had not seen precipitation for 110 days before the rainfall on Feb. 12 .
Beijing welcomed a snowfall Tuesday , the first since last winter .
It continued to snow Wednesday morning .
" The snowy weather has further brought moisture to the soil .
The drought has almost ended , " Guo said .
The meteorological bureau said the Fenghuangling Mountain to the northwest of the city received the biggest precipitation of 6 mm from 8 a.m. Tuesday to 8 a.m. Wednesday .
The average precipitation from the snowfall in the downtown area was 1 mm .
The bureau forecast that snow will fall again tonight .
Three sections of highways leading to northeastern suburbs of the city were closed on Wednesday .
But traffic on major highways in downtown Beijing , including the airport expressway , remained smooth , according to the city 's transport bureau .
More than 6,000 policemen were on the roads to monitor traffic on Wednesday , as transport authorities launched a third - degree alarm to cope with the traffic in snowy weather .
Meteorological bureau chief Guo Hu said the snow on Wednesday coincided with " Rain Water , " one of the 24 solar divisions on the ancient Chinese lunar - solar calendar when it normally rains .
He said Beijing 's first snow normally fell in mid-December .
However , the capital had been enduring the longest drought in 38 years , according to the bureau 's records .
The city had not seen rain or snow since Oct. 24 .
Ford Motor Co. , which scored a consumer hit with its
Sync voice - activated , in - car entertainment and communications system , said it is boosting the system 's features as it looks to develop the technology and stay ahead of the competition .
Real - time traffic , turn - by - turn directions , personalized sports and weather reports will be added to Sync and will be available later this year on all 2010 Ford models .
The options are free for the first three years of ownership .

Guided by a helical path winding its way up the mountain , this amazing 2008 home renovation by architects Jose Ulloa Davet and Delphine Ding is as breathtaking as its awe - inspiring view !
Aptly dubbed “ Metamorfosis , ” this modern timber house in Tunquen , Casablanca , Chile was transformed from standard to stunning through the extension of an existing deck , the addition of a new room , and a new , raw timber skin that unifies the home ’s various elements while blending it with the gorgeous rocky landscape .
From below , the path makes its way up the hillside , and connects to a walkway leading from the house main entrance , around the house exterior , and up to the spacious rooftop patio .
Inside , timber too is a major player , bringing the same “ raw ” element from the outdoors , but with an added sense of sophistication .
A vast picture window frames the stunning scenery .

Several news sources and blogs have recently reported on a study looking into the benefit of transcendental meditation ( TM ) in children diagnosed with ADHD .
A January 5th report from Reuters Health , a news service which claims to be “ internationally recognized as unbiased , authoritative , timely and dependable , with the reputation for quality that one expects from a Reuters company “ , actually serves as a perfect example of how not to cover science or health news .
With a skeptical mindset , a few minutes of spare time and an internet connection , I was easily able to discover the dubious reality behind this “ landmark ” research .
The study , led by “ cognitive learning specialist ” Sarina J. Grosswald , involved the instruction in TM techniques of 10 students previously diagnosed with ADHD and enrolled in a private school for children with learning disabilities .
These students were followed over three months , at the end of which they were evaluated for improvement in a number of areas .
According to the Reuters ’ piece ,
“ After three months , Grosswald and her colleagues found , the students reported lower stress and anxiety levels , while their ADHD symptoms also improved , based on questionnaires given to teachers and parents . ”
Impressive .
For those who are confused , TM is a form of meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the 1950 ’s which involves the repetition of a meaningless sound , or mantra , while sitting quietly with eyes shut .
This allows the practitioner to quiet the mind and discover the “ source of thought ” .
The mind and body are then able to achieve a state of calm and , according to proponents , reap myriad medical benefits far beyond that of simply increased peace of mind .
Believers in TM have also been known to claim that an extension of the technique can lead to fighting crime with their minds and flying .
I ’m not kidding .
This is a pilot study published in a online education journal edited by graduate students , something which does no inspire confidence in me .
I do not think that a reputable peer - reviewed medical journal would have accpeted it .
At least the authors do admit in the discussion section that it would be inappropriate to make claims regarding a cause and effect relationship between TM and any improvement in ADHD symptoms based on these results .
That does n’t stop them from making bold statements regarding the benefit of TM , however , as I will soon get to .
The flaws in this study are numerous .
The number of subjects is too small , there is no control group and it is n’t blinded .
The study reveals that some of the children are on medication but it does not take into account the possibility of recent changes in medical therapy , or improved compliance while on the study .
It is based purely on self - report and subjective questionairres and there is very high liklihood that a placebo effect could have been the sole responsible factor in the subjects ’ apparent improvements .
The authors then call for larger and better designed studies , something which I do n’t think is justified for these reasons , but my problem with this study , and concerns regarding the credulous take by the media , go much deeper than what I ’ve already explained .
What led me to dig deeper after reading the Reuters ’ report was the following quote :
“ The effect was much greater than we expected , ” lead researcher Sarina J. Grosswald , a cognitive learning specialist in Arlington , Virginia , said in a written statement . ”
I wondered why the researcher had expected an effect and hypothesized that there may be a connection between the researchers and TM more significant than academic curiosity .
I was quickly able to discover that Grosswald is a hardcore believer in TM .
Just read this quote by Grosswald from a website called Ask The Doctors , which provides a forum for specialists to answer questions related to TM and health :
“ The TM technique is the exact opposite of harmful .
It reduces your risk of getting serious chronic health problems like hypertension , diabetes , and heart disease .
In fact , research on the Transcendental Meditation program shows that people who practice it go to the doctor about 50 % less than the general population .
And if they are in the hospital for some reason , their hospital stay is 50 % shorter , on average .
For some conditions , the need for medical care is as much as 87 % less for TM meditators .
Practicing the Transcendental Meditation technique is one of the best things you can do for your health . ”
She clearly does not come across as an unbiased investigator .
In reading her other responses on the “ Ask The Doctors ” website , and especially after listening to a 16 - minute talk she gave in 2005 , when this research actually took place , which is posted on a Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation sponsored website that focuses on “ ADHD , the Mind and the Transcendental Meditation technique ” called Insights in Health , it is obvious that she is a true believer .
That does n’t prove the research is bogus by itself , but it is a red flag .
A more concerning red flag , and one which was also discovered in the talk given by Grosswald , is the fact that the 10 children involved in the study may have been coached .
In the last few minutes of the presentation , Grosswald presents clips of the children meeting with the TM proponents prior to the initiation of the study , where it appears that they are told what the expected outcome of the trial is , that their symptoms will improve with TM .
Not only are these kids aged 11 to 14 being told what the expected outcome of the study is by study investigators , the headmaster of the school , Linda Handy , can be seen at the very end of the video discussing how amazing the technique is and how it will change the students ’ futures for the better .
I am forced to question whether the teachers , whose evaluations of the study subjects ’ behavior and performance are an integral component of the study conclusions of positive effect , might have been hesitant to give a negative evaluation when their boss is clearly also a true believer .
In the acknowledgments section , The authors thank the Abramson Family Foundation for funding and the Institute for Community Enrichment for support .
The Abramson Family Foundation is an organization which believes that TM can help students achieve the full potential of their brain .
“ The Abramson Family Foundation has been funding research on Transcendental Meditation and providing scholarships for students to learn the technique for the past 20 years .
This has been a rewarding investment in the youth of our nation .
Here is a common sense approach — a sound and scientific way — of fulfilling the purpose of education , which is to create intelligent , dynamic , happy , healthy and successful human beings . ”
Of note , Grosswald sits on the Board of Advisors for the foundation .
Joining her on the Board is none other than the school headmaster Linda Handy .
Whatever doubt I had in my lack of enthusiasm for this study fell by the wayside upon that discovery .
While it may not have been intentional on the part of the study authors , the school headmaster , or the pro-TM funding organizations , this study was designed in a way that coulnd’t possibly yield anything other than a positive result .
And calls for further study , especially with public funds in addition to the over twenty million already spent by the NIH on TM , are unwarranted .
It was n’t difficult to look at this study and see that the claims being made by TM supporters are n’t valid .
It was n’t even that hard to uncover the connections between the investigators , the school where the study was conducted and pro-TM organizations .
Yet I was unable to find one news report that displayed even the slightest amount of critical thinking , instead reading like press releases from TM believers .
The current state of science and health reporting is rather depressing , and I do n’t see things improving any time soon as more and more dedicated science writers are falling prey to the poor economy .
The Difficulty of Being an Informed American DON'T TRUST U.S. MAINSTREAM NEWS : The Difficulty of Being an Informed American by Paul Craig Roberts Thursday , 8 January 2009
The function of the “ mainstream media ” is to sell products and to brainwash the audience for the government and interest groups .
By subscribing to it , Americans support their own brainwashing .
T he American print and TV media have never been very good .
These days they are horrible .
If people intend to be informed , they must turn to foreign news broadcasts , to Internet sites , to foreign newspapers available on the Internet , or to alternative newspapers that are springing up in various cities .
A person who sits in front of Murdoch ’s Fox “ News ” or CNN or who reads the New York Times is simply being brainwashed with propaganda .
Before conservatives nod their heads in agreement , I ’m not referring to “ the liberal media . ”
I mean the propaganda that issues from the US government and the Israel Lobby .
It was neoconservative Bush regime propaganda fed to America through Judith Miller and the New York Times and through Murdoch ’s Fox “ News ” that convinced Americans that they were in danger from a small secular Arab country half way around the globe called Iraq .
It was the American media that convinced Americans that getting rid of dangerous “ weapons of mass destruction , ” weapons that did not exist in Iraq , would be a cakewalk paid for by Iraqi oil revenues .
It is the same propagandistic American print and TV media that have rationalized Bush ’s illegal invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan based on seven years of lies and deception .
It is the same media that today provids only Israeli propaganda as “ coverage ” of the Israeli war crimes in Gaza .
It was the New York Times that spiked for one year the leaked information from the National Security Agency that the Bush regime , in violation of US law , was illegally spying on Americans without warrants .
The “ liberal ” New York Times agreed to suppress the story so that Bush would not face reelection under the cloud of his outlaw behavior .
Conservatives think the Washington Post is “ liberal media ” despite the fact that the editorial and commentary pages are controlled by neocons and their sympathizers .
During the run up to wars and during wars , the American press has always been a propagandist for the government .
The only exceptions occurred during the later phases of the Vietnam war and the Contra - Sandinista conflict in Central America .
Karen de Young and some others tried to honestly cover the Contras and Sandinistas and were demonized by “ patriots ” taken in by the government ’s lies .
Conservatives still blame the “ liberal ” media for losing the Vietnam war , when in fact all the media did was to provide some truthful reports that opened some American eyes .
When the truth cuts against the position of the US government , conservatives see it as “ liberal . ”
When propaganda supports the government ’s lies , conservatives see it as “ patriotic . ”
However , any resemblance to independent reporting disappeared from the American media when the Democratic regime of President Clinton allowed Murdoch and a small handful of moguls to concentrate the American media in a few corporate hands .
That was the end of American reporting .
Journalists disappeared from media management and were replaced by corporate advertising executives with an eye not to offend any source of advertising revenue , and certainly not to offend the government , which controls the broadcast licenses that comprise the value of the mega - companies .
Today reporters write the stories that their masters want to hear , or they are out .
The function of editors is to make certain that no uncomfortable information reaches the public .
The public is slowly catching on , and the print media is dying .
The New York Times , Chicago Tribune , and Los Angeles Times are all on the ropes .
Americans are still subjected to Fox “ News ” and CNN propaganda piped into airport waiting rooms , doctors ’ offices , and exercise centers People ask me where they can get reliable information .
I tell them that their goal cannot be reached without their commitment of time .
People who have access to television services that provide English language foreign broadcasts , such as Iran ’s Press TV , Russia Today , or Al Jazeera , can get get news and insights from those parts of the world demonized by the US media .
The BBC World Service still reports facts while covering itself by providing the views of the US , UK , and Israeli governments .
Both the Asia Times and Israeli newspapers , such as Haaretz can be read online in English .
There are other such newspapers , and all of them provide information that Americans will never see in their own media .
Any American newspaper that was as truthful about the Israeli government as Haaretz would be closed down .
The only US print source with which I am familiar in which some honest reporting can be found on a regular basis is the McClatchy papers .
Americans addicted to print media must turn to alternative newspapers , which tend to be weekly or bi-weekly .
However , the news and commentary provided are often superb ..
Alternative newspapers are often the children of people motivated by a sense of justice and the love of truth .
Such people have become an endangered species in the American “ mainstream media . ”
The free press Americans have today is online and in the alternative media .
The function of the “ mainstream media ” is to sell products and to brainwash the audience for the government and interest groups .
By subscribing to it , Americans support their own brainwashing .

SOCIAL NETWORKS AND HAPPINESS
Happiness is a fundamental object of human existence .
To the extent that it is synonymous with pleasure , it could even be said to be one of the " two sovereign masters " that , Jeremy Bentham argued , govern our lives .
The other master , lest we forget , is pain .
Our happiness is determined by a complex set of voluntary and involuntary factors , ranging from our genes to our health to our wealth .
Alas , one determinant of our own happiness that has not received the attention it deserves is the happiness of others .
Yet we know that emotions can spread over short periods of time from person to person , in a process known as " emotional contagion . "
If someone smiles at you , it is instinctive to smile back .
If your partner or roommate is depressed , it is common for you to become depressed .
But might emotions spread more widely than this in social networks — from person to person to person , and beyond ?
Might an individual 's location within a social network influence their future happiness ?
And might social network processes — by a diverse set of mechanisms — influence happiness not just fleetingly , but also over longer periods of time ?
We recently published a paper in the British Medical Journal that addressed these questions .
We studied 4,739 people followed from 1983 to 2003 as part of the famous Framingham Heart Study .
These individuals were embedded in a larger network of 12,067 people ; they had an average of 11 connections to others in the social network ( including to friends , family , co-workers , and neighbors ) ; and their happiness was assessed every few years using a standard measure .
We found that social networks have clusters of happy and unhappy people within them that reach out to three degrees of separation .
A person 's happiness is related to the happiness of their friends , their friends ' friends , and their friends ' friends ' friends — that is , to people well beyond their social horizon .
We found that happy people tend to be located in the center of their social networks and to be located in large clusters of other happy people .
And we found that each additional happy friend increases a person 's probability of being happy by about 9 % .
For comparison , having an extra $ 5,000 in income ( in 1984 dollars ) increased the probability of being happy by about 2 % .
Happiness , in short , is not merely a function of personal experience , but also is a property of groups .
Emotions are a collective phenomenon .
To follow up this study , we have also been examining online social networks .
Emotional clustering and contagion are so fundamentally rooted in our ancient evolutionary psychology that — we believe — they should carry over to the very modern online world of email , blogs , and social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook .
One of our efforts has involved the examination of a group of 1,700 college students who are interconnected in Facebook .
We examined these students ' online profiles .
We noted who their friends were and we also studied their photographs .
The photographs were valuable in two ways .
First , we coded who appeared in photographs with whom .
People who take the trouble to be in the same place , take a photograph together , upload the photograph , and label ( " tag " ) it , almost certainly have a closer relationship with one another than the usual " friends " people indicate in online social networking sites .
In fact , while the average student in our data had over 110 friends on Facebook , they had an average of only six " picture friends " ( i.e. , people close enough that they tagged the student ) .
Second , we coded whether the students were smiling in their profile photographs , and we mapped the network of students and their picture friends , making note of who was smiling and who was not .
In a way , this is the online analogue of the research we did with happiness in the Framingham social network , though smiling is , of course , different than happiness .
The figure below is a map of part of this Facebook network in 2007 .
It contains 353 students , each represented by a node ; each line between two nodes indicates that the connected individuals were tagged in a photo together .
Students who are smiling ( and who are immediately surrounded by smiling people in their network ) are colored yellow .
Students who are frowning ( and who are immediately surrounded by such serious looks ) are colored blue .
Shades of green indicate a mix of smiling and non-smiling friends .
Notice how strongly the blue nodes and the yellow nodes cluster together , indicating large - scale structure of smiling in the online network .
Moreover , people who do not smile seem to be located more peripherally in the network .
In fact , statistical analysis of the network shows that people who smile tend to have more friends ( smiling gets you an average of one extra friend , which is pretty good considering that people only have about six close friends ) .
Not only that , but the statistical analyses confirm that those who smile are measurably more central to the network compared to those who do not smile .
That is , if you smile , you are less likely to be on the periphery of the online world .
It thus seems to be the case , online as well as offline , that when you smile , the world smiles with you .

JOHANNESBURG , South Africa ( CNN ) --
The political crisis that has gripped Zimbabwe for nearly a year may be drawing to an end , but a deadly cholera outbreak there is only getting worse .
Zimbabweans walk through mounds of garbage .
Lack of sanitation and clean water make cholera spread .
The newly formed cabinet of Zimbabwe 's unity government met for the first time Tuesday , the same day that Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) released a report warning that the epidemic shows no signs of slowing .
The outbreak -- one of the world 's largest , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) -- is only getting worse , and could be a stepping - stone to other epidemics and health crises , international agencies say .
Since August , at least 3,623 people have died and 76,127 people have been infected by cholera , a preventable water - borne bacterial illness that causes severe diarrhea , vomiting and dehydration and can lead to death in a matter of days if not treated .
According to a report released Tuesday by Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) , new cholera patients were being registered at a rate of one every minute at the beginning of February in Zimbabwe .
Unless urgent action is taken , the aid group said , the country could see a worsening of the " massive medical emergency that is spiraling out of control , " MSF President Dr. Christophe Fournier told CNN Tuesday after his latest visit to Zimbabwe .
MSF says the response from the international community to the crisis has been slow and inadequate , and it called on donors to put aside politics and send help immediately .
The cholera epidemic has been left to fester as the Zimbabwean government grappled with questionable elections , opposition charges of fraud , power - sharing talks and the creation of a unity government in the last year .
During that time , the country 's economy and infrastructure imploded , with sanitation systems and garbage collection becoming virtually non-existent .
" The reasons for the ( cholera ) outbreak are clear : lack of access to clean water , burst and blocked sewage systems , and uncollected refuse overflowing in the streets , all clear symptoms of the breakdown in infrastructure resulting from Zimbabwe 's political and economic meltdown , " the MSF report said .
The disease is contracted " by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium , " the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said on its Web site .
" In an epidemic , the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person , " the CDC said .
" The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water . "
Making matters worse , flooding from the rainy season -- which began in November -- is spreading the bacteria through swollen streams and rivers .
Cholera cases have now been reported in all of the country 's provinces , the MSF report said .
Exacerbating the epidemic is the current economic crisis , which has caused the health care system to nearly grind to a halt .
" I 've seen many health services being down like this in my life as an MSF doctor , but only in this country have I seen this kind of collapse of the public health care system in the absence of any conflict , " Fournier said .
He said most of the country 's public hospitals or clinics are either closed or empty , and the ones that are open face critical shortages of drugs and medical equipment .
" A huge part of the medical staff is not showing up because they are unpaid and on top of that , the patients , when finally accessing one opened facility , are asked for totally indecent amounts of money only to be seen and then an extra amount of money for their treatment , " Fournier added .
Many patients can't afford to pay and do n't even bother to seek treatment , he said .
MSF believes cholera may be just the beginning of a nightmare health crisis in the southern African country .
" The current food shortages make us fear of further malnutrition among the most vulnerable , starting with the under ( age ) five children , where any kind of infectious epidemic can start at any moment after this current cholera epidemic , " Fournier explained .
MSF currently has more than 500 staff members working in Zimbabwe to battle the outbreak .
The organization is calling on the government to remove barriers that are slowing the MSF response to the crisis .
" Despite the glaring humanitarian needs , the government of Zimbabwe continues to exert rigid control over aid organizations .
MSF faces restrictions in implementing medical assessments and interventions , " the group 's report said .
" The Zimbabwean government must facilitate independent assessments of need , guarantee that aid agencies can work wherever needs are identified and ease bureaucratic restrictions so that programs can be staffed properly and drugs procured quickly , " the report said .
Manuel Lopez , the chief of MSF 's mission in Zimbabwe , said the cost of importing medicine is often higher than the cost of the drugs themselves .
High fees for visas and work permits for staff are also impeding operations , he said .
And it often takes months to get permission for MSF specialists to operate inside the country , Lopez explained , with some eventually being turned down .

New research from the University of California , Berkeley shows that the brains of high - income children function differently compared to brains of low - income children .
This is your kid's brain
The study of normal 9 - and 10 - year - olds , who differed only in socioeconomic status , showed " detectable differences " in their prefrontal cortex .
That is the part of the brain responsible for so - called executive functions , like personality , decision making and social behavior .
Half of the children were from families with low incomes -- with mean household income of $ 27,192 -- and half from families with high incomes , with mean of $ 96,157 .
For each child , the researchers measured brain activity while he or she was engaged in a simple task : watching a sequence of triangles projected on a screen .
The subjects were instructed to click a button when a slightly skewed triangle flashed on the screen .
Costa Rica Earthquake Measures 6.2 Magnitude
seismologist points to a graphic showing an earthquake in the photo above .
A strong earthquake shook Costa Rica Thursday , shattering window , cracking walls and sending San Jose residents running into the streets of the capital city .
The U.S. Geological Survey said that the 6.2 magnitude quake , which occurred at 1:19 p.m. was centered 22 miles northwest of San Jose , near the Poas Volcano national park .
The depth of the quake was measured at 28 miles .
The city of Alajuela , north of the capital suffered structural damage as shown on local TV station Teletica .
The shockwave was felt strongly throughout the area , triggering small landslides outside the capital .
Cell phone service was interrupted briefly .
Structural damage was reported by Costa Rican Electricity Institute ( ICE ) on Avenida 2 and Calle 1 .
Six houses reportedly collapsed and were destroyed near the quake 's epicenter .
Students from the University of Costa Rica were evacuated shortly after the quake hit .
There are reportedly 1,000 tourists stranded in Vera Blanca , a small town at the base of Poas Volcano .
Four aftershocks have been reported so far with reports out of San Jose indicate that two girls , age 7 and 9 , were buried by a landslide and died .
News broadcasts in San Jose are warning residents in the Central Valley area to be on 'red alert ' for continued aftershocks .
This is the second jolt in the past two days .
Tico
Times daily news in San Jose reported yesterday that they had felt the first tremors of the 2009 earthquake season .
The tremor started at 10:00 a.m. and lasted about three minutes and measured 4.0 magnitude .
It was followed by 55 aftershocks , with no injuries or damage reported .
Last year there were 4,746 quakes , but only 60 of them were felt - the strongest hitting 6.2 on November 19 , 2008 .

Way back in 7th grade social studies class , I still remember one of the first assignments we had from Mr. Kemp ( I think that was his name ... ) was to make a suggestion for a way to change or improve the way government functions .
My suggestion was that in addition to the two legislative branches ( the House of Representatives and the Senate ) , we could add a third branch for direct citizen voting on bills .
I think I called it the Peoplocracy or something .
Whenever it was time to vote on various bills , the information would be broadcast via TV , and individuals could call a phone number and " vote " one way or the other .
I remember that I got a bad grade on the paper , as the teacher told me such an idea made no sense : our elected officials in Congress where there to represent the will of the people , and direct voting on bills by citizens was entirely redundant and unnecessary .
To this day , I still feel the teacher dismissed the idea too quickly ... but that does n't mean it 's necessarily a good idea .
Since the election there have been a bunch of stories about how President - elect Obama has built up this huge direct line of communication to a huge , passionate and committed group of citizens and supporters via the internet , and there 's plenty of speculation about how he intends to use that connection to help push his legislative agenda forward .
In many ways , this is quite exciting , and I 'm curious to see how it works -- and hoping for the best .
After all , a huge problem with our elected officials in the past is that they were so far disconnected from the citizens they were supposed to represent that their policy choices were often backwards .
Instead , it was often the powerful lobbyists who got through and were able to fashion laws to support their positions , rather than the overall well - being of the citizenry .
Anything that gives the actual people a bigger voice and a better ability to communicate and connect with the President or other elected officials seems like a great idea -- and we 're already seeing some of that in action with the Obama 's impressive Change.gov operation , which , among other things allows people to submit policy ideas and allows others to vote on them , in a Digg - like fashion .
The possibilities for such a program are potentially limitless and incredibly powerful .
And yet ...
I 'm still left wondering if there is n't a huge risk as well .
As we 've seen time and time again , powerful technologies do n't discriminate .
They can be used for very good purposes and they can be used for very bad purposes as well .
I 'm very excited about the good possibilities , but I 'm wondering how much thought is being given to limiting the downside possibilities .
There is , of course , the risk of " mob rule " - type decision making at times .
While majority rules is the foundation of democracy , there are times when a simple majority can end up taking away the rights of a minority or put in place a dreadful and dangerous policy .
This can happen especially after emotionally - charged incidents , where " mob rule " and thoughts of revenge or punishment overrule the rational parts of many people .
Also , with any such system , there is the risk of gaming .
As we 've unfortunately seen with Digg over the past year or so , a small group of individuals have figured out how to effectively control the system , almost entirely stomping out the voices of others .
I do n't think this is where things are headed , and I 'm not saying that the technology or embracing a direct connection to people is a bad thing .
I think just the opposite is true .
I 'm really excited to see where all of this leads , and the fact that there 's at leastindication that we 're not dealing with politics as usual is great .
But ... in seeing everyone talk up how wonderful this is , I worry about what 's being done to at least guard against the worst abuses that occur when a direct connection to the people turns from rational into irrational mob rule out for blood .

Why we feel insecure
In our mind we develop images of who we are .
Our imagination develops a story of our self and we imagine our self in different roles .
Those images and story roles in our imagination can be of a success , or of failure and rejection .
It is through imagining our self in various stories that we create emotions of insecurity .
Some of images and stories can be created when we are young , but we can create them as adults as well .
One of the most powerful elements in creating emotions through our mind this way has to do with point of view .
Imagination gives us the ability to shift our point of view to the character , or image in our mind .
When this happens we view our self , and other people through the interpretation of the image we have imagined .
Adopting the point of view , or perspective , of this distorted image in our imagination is the cause of many emotions , including insecurity .
If we are imagining that we are a success , a winner , or that people love us , we view our self from this perspective .
Not only do we believe our self to be that image of a success , but we look at our self from that point of view .
We could call this having positive self esteem .
The perspective that we adopt has as much , or more to do with feeling confident than the image we have of our self .
However , both are part of creating the feeling and emotions of confidence .
If we have an image in our mind of being a failure , loser , or that nobody loves us , and believe that this negative image us is , then we will feel the corresponding emotions .
Belief in that negative self image will cause us to shift our viewpoint to the perspective of a loser , or failure .
The result is that our beliefs , perspective , and emotions become congruent and we really appear to our self as a failure that nobody loves .
We can call this having negative self esteem .
Feeling insecure is not just based on a mental image in the mind .
Creating the feelings of insecurity , or confidence , is a combination of self image , belief in that image , and your point of view .
Just changing your self image will do little to overcome your insecurity if you do not change your beliefs , and your point of view as well .
Why it is difficult to get rid of feelings of insecurity
First there is an image in our mind of who we are .
When we believe that the image is actually us , we meld our point of view to that perspective in our imagination .
When our perspective is shifted to this negative self image it is difficult to see , or believe , anything positive about our self .
When people attempt to get rid of their feelings of insecurity , they try building in their mind a positive a self image .
This approach will likely fail or be difficult at best for two reasons .
First , it will be difficult to believe in that positive self image while you are in a negative self image point of view .
Second , as long as you still have belief that the negative self image is you , that belief will continue to pull you towards that perspective of your self .
The belief ( faith ) you have in the negative self image acts as an anchor weighing you down until you dissolve this belief .
Changing this false belief about your self is critical to dissolving feelings of insecurity .
Recovering your faith from this false belief about your self will keep you from creating feelings of insecurity .
It is also a key to shifting your point of view about your self .
Building a positive self image does not do anything to dissolve the existing negative self image that is creating the feelings of insecurity .
Creating , and believing in a positive self image can help you feel better , but it will be limited .
Without dissolving the belief in the negative image feeling confident will be limited .
It can also create a conflict in your mind .
Confusion about Self Esteem
What is self esteem ?
“ Esteem ” means high regard or opinion .
Self esteem is having an opinion of high regard for your self .
You could also call it self respect .
The imagination is an extraordinary mechanism that allows for may possibilities .
We can have negative and positive images of our self , and we can believe in both .
We can also perceive our self and our beliefs from different viewpoints .
This makes it possible to feel very confident in one moment , and feel very insecure in the next .
A shift in our point of view can change depending on who we are talking with , or as fast as the topic we are discussing .
We can feel confident in one area of discussion , and insecure about something else .
It is also possible to feel both positive and negative self esteem at the same time .
This happens because we can simultaneously hold conflicting beliefs about our self .
An example of this might be when you have to give a talk or presentation .
Intellectually , you consciously know you are prepared and trust that it will go fine .
However you might still have feelings of worry and nervousness .
This is because elsewhere within your belief system remains some faith in a failed outcome stemming from a negative self image story .
If you do n’t understand how your mind can run multiple stories , has beliefs based on different self images , and how different points of view affects your emotions , it can be very confusing as to why you feel different emotions about the same thing .
Attempting to shed feelings of nervousness by telling your self positive thoughts can help some , but probably is n’t going to do the full trick .
Thoughts are not nearly as powerful as beliefs in the negative images or ideas of failure .
Beliefs have a lot more power than thoughts because they contain the power of your faith that you invested in them .
Good Self Esteem vs. Bad Self Esteem
Odd feelings can happen when we attempt to make our self feel better by enhancing our positive self esteem , or self image .
If we attempt boosting our confidence with tools like affirmations , we can create a conflict in the mind .
We envision a positive image of our self and attempt to put faith in the idea that that image is us .
The problem we run into is that we might be looking at that image from the point of view of a failure with the feelings of low self worth .
When doing this practice from a negative image point of view we can feel like a fraud .
From the negative image point of view we do n’t really believe that the positive image is us .
If we have awareness we will also know that the image we are projecting is false .
It is a good positive image , but still not what we really are .
The voices in our head can engage in self judgement over this disparity and possibly push our self esteem lower .
As a result we end up feeling worse about our self than before we started trying to improve it .
The Third Option to Overcoming Insecurity
The beliefs that we developed about our self essentially fall into two categories .
They have to do with the negative self images we have created in our mind , and the positive self images we have created .
When feeling insecure we are in the point of view of the negative self images .
From this perspective it appears that the solution is to build positive self images for more positive self esteem and confidence .
This is just an appearance from a limited point of view .
This approach will help us feel better , but it has problems .
The essential problem is that we are not the image we have in our mind .
No matter how wonderful and terrific that image is … it is still just an image in our imagination .
The beliefs we have of our self are based on a mental construct we call a self image .
They are not based on what we really are , therefore it is not a solid base of confidence .
These images exist only as construct in our imagination .
Supported by our belief ( or faith ) in them , they can seem real .
However , our self images in the mind are not real .
They are not who or what we are .
Basing our emotions , self love , behavior , actions , and self worth , on a mental image in our mind also causes us to be false .
When we pretend to be that image in our mind , even a very positive one , we are not in our integrity .
We are not genuine or authentic .
Having a positive self image , one that you put a lot of faith in , will help you to feel more confident .
However , those feelings will be built on a shaky foundation of an abstract mental picture of your self .
Anytime your opinion of your self is altered , or your point of view wanders from that perspective , your emotions will follow .
Having a solid base of confidence in which to live your life involves having faith in your Self , , , not in an image of your self .
To accomplish this you will have to take your faith out of the beliefs in both the negative and positive self images .
This will not only free up your emotions from insecurity , but will allow you to put that faith in your authentic Self .
This is a much stronger foundation for confidence than an image in your mind .
It will require that you first gain some awareness and control over what is going on in your mind , including your point of view .
However , once you do this you discover some pretty interesting things .
One of the things that you discover as you gain control over your beliefs and imagination is that you are not what , or who , you believe you were .
You were not those images in the stories that ran around in your imagination .
You discover that you can decide story you will create in your imagination and what you are going to believe about your self .
With awareness you also learn what perspective you will adopt in any moment about any situation .
This will allow you to decide how you will feel emotionally about your self , people , or events in your life .
When we do n’t have awareness we developed stories and beliefs about our self and learned to live in emotional reaction to those beliefs .
When you learn to change and control your beliefs , you are n’t subject to emotional reactions any more .
Learning to control your point of view gives you control over your beliefs , and control over what you believe gives you mastery over your emotions .
This takes a little more work than just building a positive self image , but the benefits are bigger , and last you for your life .
Practical exercises in awareness for dissolving false self images , beliefs , and changing your point of view can be found in the Self Mastery Course .
The first 4 sessions are free for you to sample .

Former UFC heavyweight contender and professed anarchist Jeff Monson remains incarcerated at the Davies County Detention Center on Wednesday , after he was arrested Monday night on domestic violence and property damage charges in Advance , N.C. Authorities were called to the residence of Stephanie Trapani , 30 , and detained Monson for “ assault to a female ” and “ damage to property ” following an alleged domestic dispute , said Capt .
Hartman of Davies County Sheriff ’s Office .
Trapani and Monson had a “ dating relationship , ” said Hartman .
Trapani was also arrested for damage to Monson ’s property .
The Olympian reported Monday that Trapani had discarded Monson ’s cell phone after finding out he was involved in romantic relationships with other women .
On the fighter ’s voicemail message , a female ’s voice notified callers that Monson had “ lost ” his cell phone and to leave detailed contact information .
Capt .
Hartman said Trapani posted bail on Monday and has obtained a 50B contact order , denying the fighter “ any contact whatsoever ” with Trapani .
“ He destroyed my house , " Trapani told The Olympian on Monday .
" He started just bashing holes in the walls and the columns .
" Trapani said Monson also grabbed her during the argument .
Monson ’s bail has been set at $ 22,000 , though Davies County Sheriff ’s Office said a magistrate or judge could decide to hold the fighter further for extradition after they were contacted by Washington officials on a separate charge .
A warrant for Monson ’s arrest remains active in Washington , where the fighter has been charged with first - degree malicious mischief for spray - painting the peace sign , the anarchy symbol , and the phrases “ No war ” and “ No poverty ” on the state ’s capital building on Nov. 26.
ESPN
The Magazine documented Monson ’s protest while trailing the politically minded fighter for a feature that ran in its Dec. 29 issue .
Monson was documented defacing the monument in one of the article ’s accompanying photographs , which led Washington officials to the suspect .
The act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine .
Monson ( 27 - 8 ) told Sherdog.com last Thursday that he had n’t regretted his protest and that he ’d intended to turn himself in to authorities before his separate arrest Monday .
The decorated world grappling champion said he did n’t believe his pending arrest for vandalism would taint his career and that he ’d planned to fight next for World Victory Road ’s “ Sengoku ” promotion this March in Japan .
The Pentagon has decided that PTSD is not worthy of a Purple Heart , saying it was not intentionally caused by an " outside force or agent . "
According to Stars and Stripes , which reported some of the story in May , a military spokesperson explained that the Purple Heart
has never been awarded for mental disorders or psychological conditions resulting from witnessing or experiencing traumatic combat events ( e.g. , combat stress reaction , shell - shock , combat stress fatigue , acute stress disorder , or PTSD ) .
The Purple Heart has long been symbolic of injuries resulting from combat injury or death .
It has been estimated that roughly 20 percent -- about 300,000 -- of Iraq vets are returning with post - traumatic stress .
Their service - related needs , stemming from multiple deployments , combat , traumatic brain injury , have become the topic of widespread concern and loss of respect for the military .
Lawsuit over PTSD
A class -action law suit was filed in federal court in December charging the military had denied legal benefits for PTSD , according to the Philadelphia Inquirer .
The law suit , filed on behalf of five soldiers who were discharged because of PTSD , was brought by the non-profit National Veterans Legal Services Program .
It charged defense department ratings fell short of the 50 % disabiity to which these vets are legally entitled .
Lux Interior , lead singer of influential garage - punk act the Cramps , died Wednesday morning ( February 4 ) due to an existing heart condition , according to a statement from the band 's publicist .
He was 62 .
Born Erick Lee Purkhiser , Interior started the Cramps in 1972 with guitarist Poison Ivy ( born Kristy Wallace , later his wife ) — whom , as legend has it , he picked up as a hitchhiker in California .
By 1975 , they had moved to New York , where they became an integral part of the burgeoning punk scene surrounding CBGBs .
Their music differed from most of the scene 's other acts in that it was heavily steeped in camp , with Interior 's lyrics frequently drawing from schlocky B - movies , sexual kink and deceptively clever puns .
( J.H. Sasfy 's liner notes to their debut EP memorably noted : " The Cramps do n't pummel and you wo n't pogo .
They ooze ; you 'll throb . " )
Sonically , the band drew from blues and rockabilly , and a key element of their sound was the trashy , dueling guitars of Poison Ivy and Bryan Gregory ( and later Kid Congo Powers ) , played with maximal scuzz and minimal drumming .
Because of that — not to mention Interior 's deranged , Iggy Pop - inspired onstage antics and deep , sexualized singing voice ( which one reviewer described as " the psychosexual werewolf / Elvis hybrid from hell " ) — the Cramps are often cited as pioneers of " psychobilly " and " horror rock , " and can count bands like the Black Lips , the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion , the Reverend Horton Heat , the Horrors and even the White Stripes as their musical progeny .
Over the course of more than 30 years , the Interior and Ivy surrounded themselves with an ever - changing lineup of drummers , guitarists and bassists , and released 13 studio albums ( the last being 2003 's Fiends of Dope Island ) .
They also famously performed a concert for patients at the Napa State Mental Hospital in 1978 ( which was recorded on grainy VHS and has since become a cult classic ) and appeared on a Halloween episode of " Beverly Hills , 90210 . "
Their video for the song " Bikini Girls With Machine Guns " also drew rave reviews from Beavis and Butt - head on a memorable episode of the show .
Despite the band 's long history , fans generally agree that the group 's peak was in the early ' 80s , with the albums Songs the Lord Taught Us and Psychedelic Jungle .
Many clips of the Cramps ' chaotic live shows from the era can be found online ; look for their version of " Tear It Up " from the 1980 film " URGH ! A Music War . "
One memorable ( and typical ) show in Boston in 1986 found Interior , clad only in leopard - skin briefs , drinking red wine from an audience member 's shoe , and ended with him French - kissing a woman ( who was n't his wife ) for 10 full minutes with his microphone in their mouths .
Due to their imagery , obsession with kitsch and dogged dedication to touring — they wrapped up their latest jaunt across Europe and the U.S. this past November — the Cramps commanded a loyal fanbase , and even earned a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , in the form of a shattered bass drum that Interior had shoved his head through .
The growing diplomatic row between India and Pakistan reached new heights this week , with India 's prime minister formally accusing the Pakistani state of involvement in the deadly attacks in Mumbai ( formerly Bombay ) , which left 172 dead .
" Official agencies " in Pakistan supported the militants who attacked Mumbai in November , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said , making India 's sharpest accusation yet that Pakistan 's government was involved , " Bloomberg reports .
The accusation comes after India on Monday handed over a trove of alleged evidence to Pakistan and demanded that it act , according to the Pakistani English - language newspaper Dawn .
Pakistan has so far responded with skepticism , according to The News , a popular English daily in Pakistan .
US officials this week echoed the statements coming out of India , says The Daily Times , another leading English - language newspaper in Pakistan .
In a different article , The Daily Times adds that India has begun a new diplomatic push to bring attention to the new evidence :
As elections loom in India in May , Prime Minister Singh 's government is under increasing pressure to clamp down on terrorism , according to Bloomberg .
But India must tread a careful line in its response to the Mumbai attacks , Bloomberg adds .
It is more challenging than ever to compete in the area of eCommerce successfully .
You …
One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial : there are finite research dollars , positions , and students to work with , implying a zero- sum game between different participants .
This is not a viewpoint that I want to promote , as I consider it flawed .
However , I know several people believe strongly in this viewpoint , and I have found it to have substantial explanatory power .
For example :
It explains why your paper was rejected based on poor logic .
The reviewer was n’t concerned with research quality , but rather with rejecting a competitor .
It explains why professors rarely work together .
The goal of a non-tenured professor ( at least ) is to get tenure , and a case for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours .
It explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted .
Adopting a competitor ’s program is impossible , if your career is based on the competitor being wrong .
Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint in different degrees .
In my experience , NIPS is the worst .
It is bad enough that the probability of a paper being accepted at NIPS is monotonically decreasing in it ’s quality .
This is more than just my personal experience over a number of years , as it ’s corroborated by others who have told me the same .
ICML ( run by IMLS ) used to have less of a problem , but since it has become more like NIPS over time , it has inherited this problem .
COLT has not suffered from this problem as much in my experience , although it had other problems related to the focus being defined too narrowly .
I do not have enough experience with UAI or KDD to comment there .
There are substantial flaws in the adversarial viewpoint .
The adversarial viewpoint makes you stupid .
When viewed adversarially , any idea has crippling disadvantages and no advantages .
Contorting your viewpoint enough to make this true damages your ability to conduct research .
In short , it promotes poor mental hygiene .
Many activities become impossible .
Doing research is in general extremely hard , so there are many instances where working with other people can allow you to do things which are otherwise impossible .
The previous two disadvantages apply even more strongly for a community — good ideas are more likely to be missed , change comes slowly , and often with steps backward .
At it ’s most basic level , the assumption that research is zero - sum is flawed , because the process of research is not done in a closed system .
If the rest of society at large discovers that research is valuable , then the budget increases .
Despite these disadvantages , there is a substantial advantage as well : you can materially protect and aid your career by rejecting papers , preventing grants , and generally discriminating against key people doing interesting but competitive work .
The adversarial viewpoint has a validity in proportion to the number of people subscribing to it .
For those of us who would like to deemphasize the adversarial viewpoint , what ’s unclear is : how ?
One concrete thing is : use Arxiv .
For a long time , physicists have adopted an Arxiv - first philosophy , which I ’ve come to respect .
Arxiv functions as a universal timestamp which decreases the power of an adversarial reviewer .
Essentially , you avoid giving away the power to muddy the track of invention .
I ’m expecting to use Arxiv for essentially all my past - but - unpublished and future papers .
It is plausible that limiting the scope of bidding , as Andrew McCallum suggested at the last ICML , and as is effectively implemented at this ICML , will help .
The system of review at journals might also help for the same reason .
In my experience as an author , if an anonymous reviewer wants to kill a paper they usually succeed .
Most area chairs or program chairs are more interested in avoiding conflict with the reviewer ( who they picked and may consider a friend ) than reading the paper to determine the illogic of the review ( which is a difficult task that simply cannot be done for all papers ) .
NIPS experimented with a reputation system for reviewers last year , but I ’m unclear on how well it worked , as an author ’s score for a review and a reviewer ’s score for the paper may be deeply correlated , revealing little additional information .
Public discussion of research can help with this , because very poor logic simply does n’t stand up under public scrutiny .
While I hope to nudge people in this direction , it ’s clear that most people are n’t yet comfortable with public discussion .
The Linux Community is having an on - again off - again love affair with Dell .
It 's been a rocky affair since Dell decided it would bump the positive side of their ledger by offering the Linux Operating System on their products .
There have been some embarrassing public displays of affection and there have been equally public spats , with a few pots and pans thrown ...
So it goes with passionate couples .
A word of advice is always welcome though and I might offer one of the afore - mentioned parties a bit of it now ...
Duck .
" Linux - We do n't recommend it . "
Those were the words spoken to a fellow I work with .
The person uttering those words is a Dell Customer Service Representative , one of those that helps you " build " your computer as you speak to them over the phone .
Gary is typical of the baby boomers who sit down behind a computer .
He does n't use a computer as much as he uses a small handful of applications on it .
Kind of like a refrigerator .
It sits there day in and day out waiting to do it 's job in the event someone wants to eventually come by and grab something cold out of it .
He has no real idea of the raw power at his fingertips ... and he does n't want to .
He simply needs something to check his email , read some news on a couple of websites and provide a home for his anti-virus software .
Gary , when it's all said and thought about , is afraid of his computer .
His few forays into the internet jungle have given him a nasty case of DTD's ( digitally transmitted diseases ) from time to time and pain is a good teacher .
He just does n't use it much anymore because of the nasty experiences .
That 's when I found out Gary is n't as technically - challenged as I thought him to be .
He came to me and asked me if I 'd look at his less - than - one - year - old Dell computer and take some of the garbage off of it .
Seems Gary is victim to the Antivirus 2009 malware and it's variants that so many Windows Users fall prey to .
I asked him if he would consider putting Linux on it .
He just shrugged .
" I tried to have it put on there when I ordered the computer ... they said they could but they did n't recommend it . "
It took me about 5 minutes to start making the phone calls .
I started with the proper protocol and called their complaint line .
Not much luck there ... the people in Malaysa could n't care less .
I decided to target my query a bit closer to home ... like in Round Rock .
A twelve minute drive from my house .
That did n't work out so well either .
I 'm still waiting for a call - back .
Note to self ... don't tell people why you are really calling .
It just tips them off that you 're not a happy customer and the chances of getting a call back are as remote as a viral infection on a Linux computer .
Gary is digging around at home for the information on his purchase .
We 're going to try to find out who the actual order taker was and from there , we 're going to try to climb the ladder and find out just why Linux is n't recommended .
I have developed a fairly good relationship with just one such representative and we 'll try to lay hands on some of their internal memos which may dictate policy on this matter ... time will tell how good of a relationship this is .
We 've known for a long time that Dell is beholden to Microsoft ... and we 've known that Microsoft is putting pressure on it's hardware partners to kick Linux to the curb .
It 's not something that can be disputed .
What should be talked about though is Dell 's open verbalization that Linux is n't as good as Windows .
Gary said so himself ... he wishes he had asked the question .
When the service rep told him that they did n't recommend Linux he should have asked him .
" Then why do you offer it ? "
Indeed .
Of course , with current stories like this , one might understand Dell 's hesitancy to " recommend " Linux .
They have to believe at times that they are in a no -win situation .
people have been given nothing but Windows for over a decade .
The woman noted in the linked article is a good example of just how indoctrinated people have become .... and how lazy they 've become as well .
We 'll leave it at lazy , although other descriptors jump to mind immediately .
I 'm not saying that Dell 's position is n't appreciated ... but when we 've tried to steer people to Dell / Linux machines in the past , they 've been so buried on Dell 's website that it damn near took a paid detective to find it .
And when it WAS found , we ran into things like this
Let me save you a click if you like .
Top right hand corner ... above the ad for a Linux - based laptop .
" Dell recommends Windows for everyday comuputing " .
A Linux - based computer ad recommending Windows ...
Yeah , it 's old news ... we 've posted it before but it bears posting again to make the point .
That new love interest might drive a shiny new car and be a good - looking devil ... one might even be vain enough to just want to be seen in the same company with them ... but that does n't change the fact .
When you get home and you are alone together , you have to ask yourself ...
Is getting slapped around and mistreated worth it ?
All - Righty

Pictured : The ' egg - stra special ' electric car that could be the future of motoring
By Daily Mail Reporter
Thousands of miles west of Detroit , a California start - up hopes to find a market for a three - wheeled , ultra - efficient , downright odd - looking car among consumers sick of spending their hard - earned cash at the petrol pumps .
The Aptera is an egg - shaped two - seater often likened to a space - age car from the futuristic 1960s cartoon ' The Jetsons . '
Looking more like an aircraft than a road vehicle , it is a far cry from the hybrid saloons and electric sports cars being produced by conventional automakers .
Futuristic : The Aptera 2e electric vehicle is seen at an assembly line at the company 's new facilities in Vista , California
Riding in the all - electric version of the Aptera feels similar to a regular car , although its roof - attached doors make getting in and out a challenge .
Its long shape provides extra legroom and the car runs with a tinny , high - pitched hum .
To the executives behind the vehicle , its aerodynamic design and 100 miles per gallon ( 42 km per litre ) range points the way to the future .
And , with 4,000 customer orders already , they believe they have the early following to back up that confidence .
' We have a breakthrough level of energy efficiency which really means you are going to save so much money on operating costs , ' Aptera Chief Executive Paul Wilbur said in an interview at the company 's headquarters and vehicle assembly facility in Vista , California .
Crowd - pleaser : People stop to look at the Aptera parked outside a Starbucks outlet in Carlsbad , California
Like Tesla Motors , Fisker Automotive and ZAP , Aptera is one of a handful of young , West Coast - based companies making cars that , unlike the sport utility vehicles that have been integral to the U.S. auto market in recent years , save oetrol and global warming emissions .
Automakers , however , have a track record of overpromising and underdelivering when it comes to new technology .
Tesla , for instance , ran into a series of cost overruns and delays rolling out its electric Roadster .
General Motors Corp , meanwhile has said that its highly - anticipated Volt plug - in will be a low - volume money - loser when it comes to market in late 2010 .
Fuel efficiency is harder to sell than it was last summer when gas prices hit records .
As gasoline prices have fallen , so have sales of premium - priced fuel efficient cars such as Toyota Motor Corp 's Prius hybrid .
High hopes : Aptera co-founders Steve Fambro ( left ) and Chris Anthony pose with their baby .
The vehicle has been compared to the Jetsons ' cartoon flying car
Aptera 's makers are still shopping the car as a money saver despite an initial price tag of between £ 18,000 and £ 28,000 , depending on whether buyers want an electric , hybrid or traditional powertrain .
' It does n't matter if gasoline is $ 2 or $ 4 a gallon , you are still going to be buying a lot less when you buy our vehicle , ' Wilbur said .
Aptera will begin shipping its all - electric vehicles to customers in the fourth quarter of this year .
The electric version has a 100 mile range per charge and can be recharged by plugging into a regular electric outlet .
The company plans to make about 10,000 cars a year initially , increasing to 100,000 in the next few years .
Ultimately , it will employ several thousand people at its facility just north of San Diego , Wilbur said .
Roomy : Aptera programmer Robert Fleury writes code for the company 's vehicle at their assembly facility
Consumer research Aptera performed at the end of last year led the company to believe it will be able to sell many more cars than it originally thought .
' We walked in with one mentality about our what our volume estimates might be , and quite frankly were very happy and surprised and even a little overwhelmed by how positive the reaction was , ' Wilbur said .
To fund the production rampup , Aptera is actively seeking new investors .
The company 's early investors include company incubator Idealab , Google Inc 's philanthropic arm and Esenjay Petroleum , and Wilbur said the company has more than enough money to meet its fourth - quarter production target .
Forward thinking : The interior of the Aptera .
It is an egg - shaped two - seater often likened to a space - age car from the futuristic 1960s cartoon The Jetsons
A monitor inside the Aptera 2e electric vehicle displays battery information .
Looking more like an aircraft than a road vehicle , it is a far cry from the hybrid saloons and electric sports cars being produced
But the U.S. federal government declined to invest .
Because of its three - wheeled design , Aptera was excluded from participation in a Department of Energy program that extends low - interest loans to manufacturers of fuel efficient cars .
Disappointed company officials said they were producing exactly the kind of car President Barack Obama advocated .
' This is Obama 's poster car for everything he is talking about , ' Wilbur said .
' We are the most efficient vehicle in the world .
Sometimes it 's good to be innovative but in this case it 's bad to be innovative . '
Kendra Wilkinson Talks Wedding and Babies
The time is getting closer for former Girls Next Door starand her Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver and fianceto walk down the aisle .
That is apparently not the only thing on their minds .
According to Wilkinson , babies are just as important to the couple .
Just because the happy couple will be saying their vows at the Playboy mansion does n't mean it will be a Hollywood star studded bashes .
Kendra is looking for a classic modern fairytale .
Hugh Hefner was rumored to be giving the bride away but that is not the case .
Kendra 's brother will be taking that honor .
We would not have guessed that Kendra would rush into parenthood but she and Hank can't wait and have even gone as far as to come up with some baby names .
Their favorite girl name is Kaleigh and without question they will name their first boy Hank Baskett IV .
Wilkinson , who considers herself " old fashioned " in many ways , will take her husband 's last name .
The economic collapse due to financial speculation and greed has hit everyone hard .
Unemployment is at an all - time high , investment at an all - time low .
It ’s a bad time to be looking for a job or selling a house .
But there ’s one good thing to come out of it .
I now have a new excuse to use in every aspect of my life .
Whenever someone asks me to do something that I do n’t want to do , I just grimace and say “ Not in this economy . ”
At work , my supervisor told me that we needed to redesign some web pages in order to try to improve our conversion rate .
This is a long and arduous process that involves revamping copy , making new graphics , designing the page , and tweaking miles of CSS and HTML to implement all the changes .
Work that would easily take me tens of hours to do .
And I just did n’t feel like doing it .
So I said – I ’d love to redesign our webpages .
But I ca n’t justify that work in this economy .
My boss nodded and said I brought up a good point .
My parents wanted me to come to Florida to visit them and my grandparents .
I had the money .
And I could take time off from work .
But I just did n’t want to .
So I called up mom and dad and said – “ I ’d really love to see you and Nana and Grandma .
But I ca n’t justify the cost of a plane ticket in this economy .
I love you very much and hope things change soon so that I can see you all . ”
My mom and dad told me they loved me and sent me a check for $ 100 .
I was having sex with my girlfriend when I got a little wound up and shot my load just as she was about to come .
After I caught my breath , she looked up at me and asked if I could go down on her so she could have an orgasm .
I gritted my teeth and said “ I ’d really love to pleasure you orally right now .
But in this new economic reality , I do n’t think it ’s going to be feasible . ”
She nodded sadly .
Then I turned over and went to sleep while she finished off the job with a brand new $ 200 vibrator .
I guess the economy has n’t hit her that hard .
Hot damn .
It is HOT .
Hot enough to sneak into this cinderblock haven and look for relief !
[ Koala makes ' ehn ! ' sounds ]
WAIT A MIN ! [ sploosh sploosh ]
WHAT'S THEES !?
[ Test Slurpitty test slurpitty ]
Yes .
Yes , this will do .
[ Sizzling Koala sounds ]
According to Sender - Inner Kathy M. , " A guy at work 's wife sent him these photos of a little Koala who just walked into the back porch looking for a bit of heat relief .
She filled up a bucket and this is what happened ! "
OMG PONIES !
( I ’ve been thinking about the implications of women performing oral sex on men for a while .
I began writing this as a feature , but thought it would be more interesting to open it up for discussion as a shorter version here . )
Fellatio is rarely discussed as an expression of female sexual empowerment , but rather as a form of male dominance .
Taking a man ’s penis in our mouths is traditionally seen as an act of submission ; it is assumed we do it against our will .
This makes it a feminist issue .
Maybe the slang terminology used to describe oral sex is responsible ?
We “ give head , ” implying that in doing so we lose something , gaining nothing in return .
That the process of blowing is described as a “ job ” suggests it is hard work , the antithesis of enjoyment ; a necessity to survive ; an act requiring such effort that the “ giver ” should receive some form of remuneration .
This probably has its genesis in the historical stereotyping of women who fellate .
It was an act performed by prostitutes in brothels .
It was done in darkened alleys and kept secret by “ morally corrupt sluts . ”
A married woman who was so bold as to take her husbands cock in her mouth was later called a “ whore , ” but that she would do it was unlikely .
Anne Boleyn was said to have “ bewitched ” Henry VIII with this “ whore trick ” cultivated during her time in France .
It is claimed she blew herself all the way from social mediocrity to the throne ( although her transgressions later catapulted her to the gallows ) .
Likewise , mainstream pornography has defined the “ blow - job ” as sexually degrading for women .
It is a sex act performed by a woman on a man for his pleasure alone .
It is a sex act performed by a woman on a man to sate the longing of horny male voyeurs , eager to see their masturbatory fantasies fulfilled in celluloid if not in reality .
In 1972 the infamous American porn film Deep Throat was banned in some countries and became the subject of obscenity trials , with Linda Lovelace ( pseudonym of Linda Susan Boreman ) hitting the headlines for her ability to take an erect penis completely into her mouth and throat .
This was a variation on what was commonly understood to constitute a “ blow - job ” at the time .
Boreman ( who became acquainted with anti-porn activist Andrea Dworkin ) later claimed that she did not consent to many of the explicit sexual scenes , and that she had been forced to do this at gun-point by her abusive husband .
In 1986 she said that “ virtually every time someone watches that movie , they ’re watching me being raped , ” with the 2005 documentary about the film ( Inside Deep Throat ) , exposing the extent to which Boreman had been savagely exploited sexually , physically , emotionally and financially .
This has all fed into our perception of oral sex as a tool of masculine control , designed to humiliate women for the excitement of men , but is this argument too reductive ?
Can fellating a man , in a mutually consenting situation , be liberating for a woman ?
Is it an empowered female action , rather than the epitome of misogynistic control ?
And can we just enjoy it ?
Err , I ’d say yes to all of the above .
A woman can enjoy “ giving head ” and still proudly self - define as a feminist without having betrayed her belief systems .
I view the “ blow - job ” as a form of male surrender , something requiring a mutual degree of trust and self - restraint .
I have never considered it to be anything but empowering for a woman when all involved are amenable .
There does n’t have to be an emotional connection between participants for fellatio to be pleasurable , of course , as the power shift can itself be arousing , and I can understand why some women genuinely want to “ give head . ”
In some instances I believe it can be a more intensely intimate experience than coitus , simply because of the rescinding and reclaiming of control involved .
It is one of the only times when a man is completely physically vulnerable , allowing his female partner to have autonomous control over his pleasure and orgasm by manipulating his most sensitive organ ( the organ that defines his gender and can offer him mortality through reproduction ) using one of her most powerful organs ; her mouth .
Our enjoyment emanates from the realisation that we can easily control a man ’s ecstasy .
The mouth can be an aggressive part of our anatomy , and at the same time as offering gratification by mimicking the vagina we know that it could induce severe pain , placing the male receiver completely at the mercy of the female giver ( and her back molars ) .
This has a historical precedent .
The vagina dentata ( latin for toothed vagina ) myth was initially coined to discourage men from having sex with “ strange women . ”
This was explored in the 2007 film Teeth , during which the virgin heroine discovers she has a toothed vagina following her attempted rape ( the attacker dies , as do subsequent men who try to rape her ) .
Unlike the original myth , the message is not simply to encourage men to take recourse to sexual self - preservation , but is rather a celebration of female sexuality and sexual power .
The toothed vagina enables the female protagonist to protect her chastity , with the knowledge of her unique physical attribute making her grow in confidence from a quiet and meek girl , to a headstrong young woman .
Does fellatio not work on the same principle ?
While men may attempt to verbally denigrate women who perform the act by casting aspersions on their sexual behaviour and morality , is this nothing more than a knee - jerk reaction to the subconscious realisation that we have taken charge ?
And therefore , is “ giving head ” just another feminist step along the road to our complete sexual liberation ?
It 's the " other " ivory .
And this week , conservationists in London stepped in to stop its sale .
It might not be as well known as the stuff that comes from elephants , but the ivory from the narwhal , the tusked whale of the northern seas , is just as much in demand – and with that demand comes a threat just as severe as the one elephants face .
Not only is the narwhal 's single spear - like tusk ( which can be 8ft long ) an object of great beauty , it is the object of myth and legend – in the Middle Ages it was considered to come from the unicorn – and so is highly prized by collectors .
The demand for tusks is increasing and , as a result , so is hunting in the narwhal 's core area of northern Canada and Greenland .
Campaigners from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) believe the rising hunting rate is a threat to the animal and so when seven narwhal tusks were entered into a major antiques sale at Bonhams , the London auction house , this week – where they were expected to fetch up to £ 10,000 each – they pressed for them to be withdrawn .
The company agreed to do so ; now the campaigners are calling on Bonhams to exclude narwhal tusks permanently , although the auction house confined itself to saying the tusks were withdrawn from the sale " for procedural reasons " and gave no indication about future policy .

" We welcome Bonhams ' decision to remove the narwhal tusks from sale , and we hope that the company will extend this decision to future sales both at its UK auction houses and overseas salerooms , " said Chris Butler - Stroud , the WDCS chief executive .
The tusks were entered in The Gentleman 's Library Sale , an annual auction bringing together natural history curiosities of the sort that might have adorned the library or the smoking room of a wealthy Victorian ; when it took place on Wednesday , the full sale of more than 1,000 items – featuring items from antique globes to antlered deer heads – raised nearly £ 900,000 .
WDCS believes that the seven tusks originally listed for auction would have represented the largest single offering of narwhal ivory in the UK since the European Union banned its import from Canada in 1984 and limited imports from Greenland to personal effects only ( ie , not for resale ) in 2004 .
Although elephant ivory is banned from general sale , apart from in specially licensed auctions – one such took place last year – the sale of narwhal ivory is still legal , although the trade has to be monitored .
But the WDCS believes that demand is steadily growing , with prices rising accordingly , and that this is pushing native peoples in artic Canada and Greenland to hunt more and more of the animals .
One of the main narwhal populations in Greenland has been listed as critically endangered on Greenland 's Red List of Species , and in 2008 , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , cited over - hunting as the major threat and warned that the species as a whole could become " endangered " or " critically endangered " within five years .
The society has also contacted Bonhams ' US branch , Bonhams and Butterfields , with its concerns , as it has sold at least four narwhal tusks at its Los Angeles salesroom in the past two years , for prices ranging from $ 11,000 ( £ 8,000 ) to $ 20,400 for a single tusk .
" The publicity surrounding sales such as these , and the high prices fetched by the tusks , adds to the motivation for hunters to take as many narwhals as possible , and for management agencies to set quotas way above sustainable levels , " Mr Butler - Stroud said .
Kate O'Connell , a WDCS researcher in the United States , said : " I think most people would find it abhorrent that such a trade should impact on such a beautiful animal . "
Narwhals :
The facts
The narwhal ( Monodon monoceros ) is a toothed whale closely related to the all - white beluga .
Its single tusk is an elongated incisor tooth that in fully - grown males ranges from 7ft to 10 ft long .
An exclusively arctic species , it is hunted only in Canada and Greenland , where between 300 and 500 animals are taken annually by native people .
However , last November , hundreds of narwhals were trapped in the ice on the northern coast of Baffin Island , perhaps because the ice - formation regime in the arctic is being altered by climate change .
Eventually all 629 were killed by Inuit hunters .
According to the constitution of the World Jewish Congress , the association 's purpose is to " foster the unity , and represent the interests , of the Jewish people " ; a weighty mantle to assume , especially given the sheer diversity of the various strands of world Jewry .
Despite all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the WJC's 13th Plenary Assembly in Jerusalem , it was clear that the body had no chance of living up to such lofty expectations , precisely because of the make - up of the delegates and their failure to adhere to their own code of practice .
Instead of staying " politically non-partisan and represent[ing ] the plurality of the Jewish people " , the gathering was simply an opportunity for out - and - out posturing , from the top down .
Ron Lauder , scion of the cosmetics family and WJC president , made it his mission from the off to express unambiguous support for the Israeli government , an example repeatedly followed by the rest of the delegates .
While the WJC is a fairly toothless and unrepresentative organisation , the high profile of its leadership means it has the pulling power to attract guests from the uppermost echelons of Israeli politics .
Thus , in the space of eight hours , delegates were treated to live performances by the cream of Israeli politics : Shimon Peres , Bibi Netanyahu , Ehud Barak and Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat , all appearing before an adoring crowd of disciples .
The overriding message from the stage was that Israel had conducted an incredibly moral and well - behaved war in Gaza ; the overwhelming response from the audience was that they agreed entirely .
It was painful to witness the way in which the various government ministers were resoundingly applauded for Cast Lead .
The more I 've learned about the devastation wreaked by the IDF on Gaza , the more contrite I 've become about my initial support for such an attack on Hamas .
However , I was in a tiny minority at the WJC , and forced to listen to delegate after delegate standing up to congratulate Peres , Barak and Isaac Herzog for their roles in the operation .
" The spokesman 's English was flawless , which really helped get Israel 's point of view across , " kvelled one eager attendee .
" We all thought your PR campaign was brilliant this time round . "
Perhaps , but what about the savage bombing campaign in the first place ?
English - speaking apologists for the mass - killing of civilians are all well and good for an Israel - right - or - wrong audience in Anglophone countries , yet not so effective with Pakistani and Indonesian viewers who do n't understand English , but who comprehend entirely pictures and video of dead women and children .
Barak asserted that " he found the support on the [ Israeli ] street heartwarming , with people proud of the IDF … and their attempts to minimise civilian casualties , " a statement cueing yet more sycophantic applause from the audience , and a delegate responding : " We are very impressed by the way you handled this terrible war . "
Peres maintained that objecting voices in Britain should be ignored , asking : " Did they protest the bombing of Israelis in the 90s ? "
He then chose to belittle the British activists and the BBC in one fell swoop : " With respect , the world is a bit wider than [ just them ] – they do n't criticise us in India , and the majority of the US population understands what we 're doing too . "
Minister Herzog also mentioned the BBC in passing , noting that their decision not to air the DEC appeal " shows that people understand that there are two sides to every story " , the implication being that any money donated to destitute and suffering Gazans will , by definition , be turned into weapons by Hamas ( despite DEC assurances to the contrary ) .
Instead of adhering to the millennia - old Jewish tradition of healthy discourse and heated debate , as witnessed in every stage of the oral law 's dissemination , the new way of thinking appears to be to show a constantly united front , particularly when it comes to Israel .
As one prominent delegate told me chidingly , " It 's better to stay silent than to criticise Israel , especially at the moment . "
The " Keep it in the family " rhetoric was nothing new , but made all the more chilling precisely because if that 's the way the leadership of the WJC try to " foster the unity of the Jewish people " , they 're getting into a dangerous game .
Not least because they are playing right into the hands of those who would paint all Jews as ardent Zionists , and all Zionists as apologists for Israel 's misdemeanours .
Just as numerous Jews routinely distance themselves from Israel 's actions by declaring " not in my name " , they should do likewise with regard to the WJC .
Because , for all the self - important cheerleading going on inside the halls of the Inbal Hotel , the WJC represents only itself and its cosy group of acolytes .
Shimon Peres is not the president of the Jewish people ; nor is Ron Lauder .
And the more Jews speak out against the manipulative stances of both men , the better for the real interests of world Jewry – such as security , integrity and communal continuity .
Israel 's treatment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip was today compared to the Nazis ' creation of the Warsaw ghetto by MPs who recently returned from the region .
The controversial comparison , drawn by Oona King and Jenny Tonge , will anger the pro-Israel lobby and the visiting Israeli finance minister , Benyamin Netanyahu , who met Tony Blair at Downing Street this morning .
Labour MP
Ms King , who is Jewish , said Gaza was " the same in nature " as the infamous Polish ghetto .
" No government should be behaving like that - least of all a Jewish government , " the Bethnal Green and Bow MP said .
Ms King and Liberal Democrat MP
Dr Tonge were holding a Westminster press conference today following their fact - finding trip .
The pair were caught up in the aftermath of the Israeli gunship assassination attack on a leading Palestinian extremist .
A building they were in just minutes earlier was hit in retaliation .
The MPs were also confronted by an Israeli soldier armed with a grenade as they tried to leave the strip .
Speaking ahead of the press conference , Ms King said the visit , organised by Christian Aid , had opened her eyes .
The MP , a member of the Jewish Council for Racial Equality , said : " I recognise the terror many Israelis live with as a matter of their daily lives .
" I was more surprised perhaps by the everyday terror that Palestinians live , the detail and nature of which I had not understood .
" We must support the moderate voices as opposed to strengthening extremists . "
Referring to Warsaw , scene of the historic uprising by its Jewish inhabitants , Ms King said : " It is the same in nature but not extent . "
She stressed the " very , very big difference " between Gaza and the infamous ghetto established by the Nazis in Poland 's capital .
" Palestinians are not being rounded up and put in gas chambers , " she said .
But the MP said : " What makes it similar is what happened to the Jewish people in that time which was the seizing of land , being forced from property , torture and bureaucracy - control used in a demeaning way over the smallest task .
" On top of that building a wall around them - and that is precisely what the Israeli government is doing .
In doing so it is building a political ghetto .
I do n't think it can escape that conclusion . "
Ms King also said : " As a Jewish person , I hoped I would never live to see the day I was ashamed of the actions of the Jewish state . "
The situation had worsened considerably since she last visited with pressure group Labour Friends of Israel in 1998 , she added .
Ms Tonge agreed : " You are almost getting a situation like the Warsaw ghetto - people can't get in or out .
They can't work , they can't sell anything .
There is this gradual squeeze . "
However , the Richmond Park MP also offered a comparison of her own .
" I feel it was an apartheid system and it is certainly getting worse - the area where the Palestinians live is getting smaller . "
Ms Tonge wants to see economic sanctions against Israel unless the situation improves and says EU or UN troops should be sent in to keep the peace .
" Israel says everything it does is for security but they are not addressing the cause of terrorism , only terrorism itself , " she added .
At their meeting this morning , Mr Blair and Mr Netanyahu discussed the Middle East peace process .
Mr Blair 's official spokesman said : " The Prime Minister reiterated his commitment to see the road map implemented and his willingness to do everything that he and the British government can to help . "
Later , a spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy said : " It is a terrible shame that a British MP could make this comparison .
We were shocked by the ignorance of comparing Gaza to the Warsaw ghetto .
" Such views only encourage extremists elements to become involved in terror against Israel as we recently faced in the suicide bomb in Tel Aviv . "

So you ’ve started writing your first program — great stuff !
The software development can be very tricky , especially if you are not absolutely sure what you are doing .
In this blog we are exploring different software development methodologies .
Here are a few tips and traps to watch out for along the way .
Long periods of time when your program does n’t compile and / or run at all
You enthusiastically start work on some big changes ( e.g. re-architecting your application ) , but stop because you hit a brick wall , or do n’t have the time to finish it .
The source code is left in a crippled and unfinished state .
You ca n’t do anything with any of your code until this is fixed , and the longer you leave it , the more you ’ll forget and the harder it will be to get started again .
In Continuous Integration this is called a broken build , and is a big no - no because it impacts other peoples ability to work .
Without the pressure of a team environment pushing you forward , having a roadblock like this in your path makes it very easy to lose faith and motivation .
Make massive changes on a whim without revision control or a backup
There ’s nothing worse than changing your mind about the design of something after you ’ve already thrown away the old one .
When you do something that involves changing or deleting existing code , be sure to make some sort of backup in case things do n’t work out .
If you have n’t taken the plunge with revision control yet , I highly recommend looking at some of the free SVN or GIT hosting services out there — once you get into it , you ’ll never look back .
Ignore the YAGNI principle and focus on the fun / easy bits
Focusing on things like validation , eye candy or even general purpose ‘ utility ’ functions is a great way to build up a large complex code base that does n’t do anything useful yet .
Focus on the core functionality of your software first — your main features should be complete before you start thinking about nice - to - haves .
Throw your code away and start from scratch
As Netscape famously discovered a few years ago , throwing away existing code to start afresh is almost never a good idea .
Resist the urge and make a series of small , manageable code refactorings instead .
Start programming before you have a clear goal in mind
Instead of a command line tool , maybe my application would be better as a simple GUI application ?
Or , I was originally writing my homebrew game for my old Xbox360 , but now that we ’ve bought a Wii , I ’ll port it to that instead !
What are you actually trying to achieve ?
Spend some time with a pen and some paper coming up with a really clear vision of what you ’re trying to create — e.g. screen mock - ups .
If you do n’t know what you ’re writing from the start , the goal posts will keep moving as you change your mind , and you ’ll have no chance of finishing it .
Get carried away with project hype before you ’ve actually got anything to show for yourself
Spending hours trying to think of the perfect name for your software , designing an icon , choosing the perfect open - source license and making a website wo n’t get you any closer to having a working application .
Get something up and running first , and worry about telling people about it later .
Start a million new features and do n’t finish any of them
Jumping from one idea to another without finishing anything is like spinning a car ’s wheels and not going anywhere .
Make a list of features your program should have , and put them in order of most - to - least important .
Work on them , one - at - a - time , in that order .

A new service set for launch Tuesday allows cellphone users to unmask the Caller ID on blocked incoming calls , obtaining the phone number , and in some cases the name and address , of the no-longer - anonymous caller .
The service , called TrapCall , is offered by New Jersey 's TelTech systems , the company behind the controversial SpoofCard Caller ID spoofing service .
The new service is likely to be even more controversial — and popular .
" What ’s really interesting is that they ’ve totally taken the privacy out of Caller ID , " says former hacker Kevin Mitnick , who alpha - tested the service .
TrapCall 's basic unmasking service is free , and includes the option of blacklisting unwanted callers by phone number .
It also allows you to listen to your voicemail over the web .
It 's currently available to AT&T and T - Mobile subscribers , with support for the other major carriers due within weeks , says TelTech president Meir Cohen .
" It ’s not meant for spies , it ’s not meant for geeks , it ’s not meant for any specific target audience , ” Cohen says .
" Everybody hates getting blocked calls , and in this day and age they want to know who ’s calling , and they want the option of taking the call or not . "
Consumers have had the option of shielding their number from display since Caller ID was introduced in the early 1990s , either by dialing *- 6 - 7 before placing a call , or asking their carrier for blanket anonymity for their line .
But TrapCall takes advantage of a loophole in Caller ID blocking that ’s long benefited corporate phone customers :
Namely , calls to toll - free numbers are not blocked , because those calls are paid for by the recipient .
TrapCall instructs new customers to reprogram their cellphones to send all rejected , missed and unanswered calls to TrapCall ’s own toll - free number .
If the user sees an incoming call with Caller ID blocked , he just presses the button on the phone that would normally send it to voicemail .
The call invisibly loops through TelTech ’s system , then back to the user ’s phone , this time with the caller ’s number displayed as the Caller ID .
The caller hears only ringing during this rerouting , which took about six seconds in Wired.com 's test with an iPhone on AT&T .
Rejecting the call a second time , or failing to answer it , sends it to the user ’s standard voicemail .
The service comes as bad news to advocates for domestic violence victims , who fought hard to make free blocking an option in the early days of Caller ID .
" I have huge concerns about that , ” says Cindy Southworth , director of technology at the National Network to End Domestic Violence , in Washington , D.C. Southworth fears that abusers will use the new service to locate partners fleeing a violent relationship .
In a notable case in 1995 , a Texas man named Kevin Roberson shot his ex-girlfriend to death after locating her through the Caller ID device on her roommate 's phone line .
The problem is serious , because domestic violence victims who 've fled an abusive relationship often have to stay in contact with their abuser by phone , particularly in situations where the former couple share custody of their children , ” Southworth says .
" The judge will require that the victim contact the offender to discuss where they ’re dropping the children off , for example , " says Southworth .
" And there ’s often court - mandated phone contact between the abusive partner and the victim . "
In those cases the victims often rely on Caller ID blocking to keep their former partner from knowing where they ’re living .
Cohen dismisses that concern , arguing that Caller ID blocking was never secure to begin with .
" It ’s very simple for somebody to forward a phone to an 800 number in their office , and right there , they ’re picking up the phone number of the person who is calling , " he says .
At least now the false illusion of Caller ID privacy will be dispelled by TrapCall , he adds .
In addition to the free service , branded Fly Trap , a $ 10 - per- month upgrade called Mouse Trap provides human - created transcripts of voicemail messages , and in some cases uses text messaging to send you the name of the caller — information not normally available to wireless customers .
Mouse Trap will also send you text messages with the numbers of people who call while your phone was powered off , even if they do n’t leave a message .
With the $ 25 - a- month Bear Trap upgrade , you can also automatically record your incoming calls , and get text messages with the billing name and street address of some of your callers , which TelTech says is derived from commercial databases .
TelTech is no stranger to controversy .
Its Spoofcard product lets customers send any phone number they want as their Caller ID .
Among other things , the spoofing service has been used by thieves to activate stolen credit cards , by hackers to access celebrities ’ voicemail boxes , and by telephone hoaxsters to stage a dangerous prank called " swatting , " in which they spoof an enemy ’s phone number while calling the police with a fake hostage situation .
The goal of swatting — realized in hundreds of cases around the country — is to send armed cops bursting into the victim 's home .
Cohen ’s company has cooperated in law enforcement investigations of Spoofcard abuse , which have led to several prosecutions and convictions .
Despite the spoofing - linked crimes , he insists that most Spoofcard users are just privacy - conscious consumers , including celebrities , government officials , private investigators and even spousal abuse victims and shelters .
He also expects his new business will be good for his old one .
“ The only way to block your number after this is released is to use Spoofcard , ” he says with a laugh .

It 's green , about 300,000 miles wide and some 38 million miles away , and tonight a comet called Lulin could be visible to the naked eye .
At around midnight , UK space scientists and amateur stargazers will be looking due south for a glimpse of the unusual celestial body as it reaches its nearest point to Earth .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Discovered only a year ago , the comet gets its green colour from a poisonous , cyanide - like gas in its atmosphere .
It will appear close to Saturn in the sky during its first visit to the Earth 's inner solar system and University of Leicester experts hope the close encounter will give them a valuable insight into the comet .
They are using Nasa 's Swift satellite to monitor Lulin as it nears Earth - the spacecraft has recorded simultaneous ultraviolet and X - ray images of the comet .
To the naked eye , it will appear like a small green cloud creeping across the night sky .
University of Leicester researcher Jenny Carter said : " The closest it will be is tonight when it moves close to Saturn in the sky , around half - past midnight .
It 's almost due south at that time .
" It will be better , obviously , if you have binoculars or a telescope and find a clear , dark sky . "
A comet is a clump of frozen gases mixed with dust .
These " dirty snowballs " cast off gas and dust whenever they venture near the sun .
Formally known as C/2007 N3 , Comet Lulin was discovered last year by astronomers at Taiwan 's Lulin Observatory .
Miss Carter added : " It is important to carry out these observations as they give us clues about the origin of comets and the solar system . "
Stefanie Wolter ’s wrecking yard is one of the largest in the northern part of Hesse , Germany .
On an average day , they used to receive one or two cars to be euthanized .
Now , suddenly , it ’s ten .
Clunkers are lining up , and the yard ca n’t kill them as fast as they come in .
It ’s a common sight in Germany .
Wrecking yards are getting crushed under the load of cars to be crushed , Automobilwoche [ sub ] reports .
The attack of the aging automobiles is caused by the Abwrackprämie ( cash for clunkers program ) paid for by the German government .
Since January 14th , 2009 , owners of cars nine years or older can collect € 2.5 K if they put the pile of rust out of its misery , and buy a new one .
In the beginning , the program was ridiculed .
It ’s not going to work , said many , owners of clunkers wo n’t buy new .
The Green Party said it ’s “ a joke . ”
Quickly , the mood changed .
Polk Germany prognosticated that the program would result in seven percent more sales than in 2008 — that ’s 200 K units .
A few days later , a new study said 1.2 m people would buy a new car because of the Abwrackprämie .
Too good to be true , given that barely 3 m new cars were sold in 2008 , with gruesome losses in Q4 08 and an awful January .
Then , dealers reported unusual sightings : Buyers in showrooms .
Suddenly , rumors and news articles spread that the € 1.5 b , enough for 600 K cars , would n’t last long .
Which caused an even bigger run on the showrooms .
The naysayers complained that only cheap imports would profit from the bounty on dead clunkers .
On short notice , the market proved them wrong .
Ford reported four times higher sales for its Fiesta , Ka , and Fusion models .
Volkswagen uttered a long forgotten word : “ Lieferzeiten ” — waiting times for new cars .
Buyers of small cars like Fox and Polo , but also of the lower middle class of VeeDub ’s portfolio have to wait up to four weeks until they get their new ride .
Even GM ’s
Opel , pronounced to be near dead , suddenly jumped off the gurney , shouted “ I can walk ! ” and reported 70 percent higher sales of the Corsa and 30 percent higher sales of the Astra .
Assembly lines in Eisenach , planned to be shut down in March , will be cranking out cars .
Cars like Renault ’s Dacia are flying out of the door and are in short supply .
And the program is just a few weeks old .
The German government apparently pulled off a rare feat : A program that works .
€ 2.5 K has enough oomph to make people sit up and think : “ Maybe I buy a new car . ”
Some folks at wrecking yards are even crushed by the thought that they have to kill cars which still have a good life in them .
Off they go .
Poor people suddenly feel rich :
They bought a 12 year old clunker four years ago for € 1.5 K , now they see its value increase by a thousand Euro .
And then , there is the most unusual sight : Smiles on the faces of car dealers .
Next week , Detroit will come begging again .
Send them home empty handed .
Give a $ 5000 check to each American who sacrifices his old clunker for a new one .
At 790 cars per 1000 people , there should be not shortage of candidates .
Representatives for a gallery in Gateshead appeared in court yesterday charged with outraging public decency , after featuring a statue of Jesus with an erection .
The artwork was part of the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art's September 2007 - January 2008 exhibition Gone , Yet Still , by the controversial Chinese artist Terence Koh , which featured dozens of plaster figures including Mickey Mouse and ET - all in some state of arousal .
Lawyers for Emily Mapfuwa , a 40 - year - old Christian who was offended by the artwork , launched a private prosecution against the gallery for outraging public decency and causing harassment , alarm and distress to the public .
Mapfuwa , of Brentwood , Essex , argues the Baltic would not have dared depict the prophet Muhammad in such a way .
She complained in writing to Northumbria police earlier this year , asking for an investigation , and was informed in May that there was no case to answer .
But the Christian Legal Centre - an organisation that aims to " promote and protect the biblical freedoms of Christian believers in the United Kingdom " - agreed to pay her legal costs .
The CLC also funded the case brought by Stephen Green against the BBC over Jerry Springer - The Opera .
A CLC spokesman said Mapfuwa believed in freedom of expression , but " this statue served no other purpose than to offend Christians and to denigrate Christ " .
At Gateshead magistrates court yesterday , a solicitor for The Baltic Flour Mills Visual Arts Trust , the charitable body which runs the Baltic , indicated a plea of not guilty .
The case was adjourned until September 23 .
Mapfuwa intends to cite a case from 1990 in which an artist and shop owner in London were convicted of outraging public decency over showing a sculpture made of foetuses .

A new digital plague has hit the Internet , infecting millions of personal and business computers in what seems to be the first step of a multistage attack .
The world ’s leading computer security experts do not yet know who programmed the infection , or what the next stage will be .
In recent weeks a worm , a malicious software program , has swept through corporate , educational and public computer networks around the world .
Known as Conficker or Downadup , it is spread by a recently discovered Microsoft Windows vulnerability , by guessing network passwords and by hand - carried consumer gadgets like USB keys .
Experts say it is the worst infection since the Slammer worm exploded through the Internet in January 2003 , and it may have infected as many as nine million personal computers around the world .
Worms like Conficker not only ricochet around the Internet at lightning speed , they harness infected computers into unified systems called botnets , which can then accept programming instructions from their clandestine masters .
“ If you ’re looking for a digital Pearl Harbor , we now have the Japanese ships steaming toward us on the horizon , ” said Rick Wesson , chief executive of Support Intelligence , a computer security consulting firm based in San Francisco .
The Israeli Embassy in Greece , in the name of Ambassador Ali Yahya , sent three bottles of wine as a holiday gift to Theodoros Pangalos .
Pangalos returned the gift , thanking the ambassador in the following letter .
Dear Mr. Ambassador ,
Thank you for the three bottles of wine that you sent me as a holiday gift .
I wish you , your family , and everybody in the embassy a happy new year .
Good health and progress to all of you .
Unfortunately , I have noticed that the wine you sent me was made in the Golan Heights .
Since my childhood , I have been taught to neither steal nor accept the proceeds of theft .
Therefore , I cannot possibly accept this gift and must return it to you .
As you know , your country illegally occupies the Golan Heights , which belongs to Syria according to international law and numerous decisions of the international community .
I wish to take this occasion to express my hope that Israel will achieve security within its internationally recognized borders and terrorist activities against Israeli territory by Hamas or anybody else will be contained and cease permanently , but I also hope that your government will stop practicing the policy of collective punishment , which was applied on a massive scale by Hitler and his army .
Such acts as those of the Israel military in Gaza these days remind us of the holocausts of Greeks in Kalavrita or Doxato or Distomo and certainly also that of the Warsaw ghetto .
With these thoughts , allow me to express my best wishes to you , the Israeli people , and all peoples of our region of the world .
Theodoros Pangalos of PASOK ( Panhellenic Socialist Movement ) is a Member of Parliament in Greece .
The original Greek text of Pangalos ’s letter , with an English translation , was published on his Web site on 30 December 2008 : < www.pangalos.gr/releasesgr/2008/December08/Gramma301208.htm>.
The letter has also been translated into French , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , German , Russian , and Arabic by Tlaxcala .
The rat population has reached plague - like levels in Bangladesh
A farmer from north Bangladesh has been named the country 's top rat killer after disposing of 39,650 rodents over the course of a year .
Binoy Kumar Karmakar , 40 , won a 14in ( 36 cm ) colour TV in the government - backed competition to find the most prolific rat killer .
He used traps , poison and flooding to kill his quarry .
He collected their tails as proof of his prowess .
His kill - rate was equivalent to one every 13 minutes , officials say .
The competition was part of a nationwide drive to stop food supplies from being eaten up by rats .
Plague
" During the year , our farmers killed around 25 million rats , " agriculture department spokesman Abdul Halim told Agence France - Presse news agency .
" Binoy Kumar Karmakar has been declared the champion for killing 39,650 . "
Officials estimate that up to 10 % of Bangladesh 's crops - including rice , wheat and potato - is devoured by rats every year .
Last year a plague of rats destroyed the crops of tens of thousands of people living in the remote south - eastern Chittagong Hill Tracts .
Aid workers warned that the destruction left people in a " near - famine situation " .
The UN's World Food Programme distributed food aid to 120,000 people for four months after last year 's infestation .
The rat population soared because the rodents were feeding off the region 's bamboo forests , which were blossoming for the first time in decades .
Neighbouring states in India suffered from the same problem .
( CNN ) --
Food kits recently distributed as part of a disaster relief effort in Kentucky and Arkansas may contain peanut butter contaminated with salmonella linked to a nationwide outbreak , the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday .
People who received the food kits should throw away the peanut butter packets , FEMA says .
" Commercial meals kits manufactured by Red Cloud Food Services Inc. , under the Standing Rock label , have been provided to disaster survivors in impacted communities , and these kits may contain peanut butter which is part of the precautionary national recall underway in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , " FEMA said in a written statement .
Though the kits do not all contain the same main course , they do contain packets of peanut butter , the agency said .
" People who have received commercial meal kits are asked to inspect the kits in their possession and immediately dispose of any peanut butter packets , " it said .
Jay Blanton , spokesman for Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear , said late Wednesday : " We just received this information from FEMA .
Tonight , out of an abundance of caution , we are in the process of finding alternative sources of food for people in shelters .
The Kentucky National Guard is starting to notify people who 've already received the ( meal kits ) or might be getting one . "
Blanton estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 people remained in shelters , primarily in western Kentucky .
Of officials ' reactions to the salmonella warning , he said : " We 're pretty resilient .
We 've had a lot thrown in our way and we 're coming through it .
FEMA has been working closely with us , and they assure us this is a precautionary measure . "
The meals were sent in the wake of President Barack Obama 's federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and Arkansas after they were hammered last week with rain , ice and snow .
No one at Red Cloud Food Services , based in South Elgin , Illinois , responded immediately to e-mails .
The meals were sent in the wake of President Barack Obama 's federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and Arkansas after they were hammered last week with rain , ice and snow .
Last month , the Food and Drug Administration linked a nationwide outbreak of salmonella poisoning that has sickened more than 500 people and may have killed eight others to peanut butter and peanut paste produced by the Peanut Corporation of America at its plant in Blakely , Georgia .
FDA said PCA could have distributed contaminated product to more than 100 companies for use as an ingredient in hundreds of products , including cookies , crackers , cereal , candy and ice cream .
Federal authorities have initiated a criminal investigation into the company .
In a written statement , PCA said Wednesday that federal and state regulators took part last year in " regular visits and inspections of the Blakely facility . "
" Independent audit and food safety firms also conducted customary unannounced inspections of the Blakely facility in 2008 , " it said .
" One gave the plant an overall ' superior ' rating , and the other rated the plant as ' Meet or Exceeds audit expectations ( Acceptable - Excellent ) ' ratings .
Unfortunately , due to the nature of the ongoing investigations , we will not be able to comment further about the facts related to this matter at this time . "
All About Peanut Corporation of America • Food and Drug Administration
Is there intelligent life in Washington , DC ?
Not a speck of it .
The US economy is imploding , and Obama is being led by his government of neoconservatives and Israeli agents into a quagmire in Afghanistan that will bring the US into confrontation with Russia , and possibly China , American 's largest creditor .
The January payroll job figures reveal that last month 20,000 Americans lost their jobs every day .
In addition , December 's job losses were revised up by 53,000 jobs from 524,000 to 577,000 .
The revision brings the two - month job loss to 1,175,000 .
If this keeps up , Obama 's promised three million new jobs will be wiped out by job losses .
Statistician John Williams ( shadowstats.com ) reports that this huge number is an understatement .
Williams notes that built - in biases in seasonal adjustment factors caused a 118,000 understatement of January job losses , bringing the actual January job loss to 716,000 jobs .
The payroll survey counts the number of jobs , not the number of employed as some people have more than one job .
The Household Survey counts the number of people who have jobs .
The Household Survey shows that 832,000 people lost their jobs in January and 806,000 in December , for a two month reduction of Americans with jobs of 1,638,000 .
The unemployment rate reported in the US media is a fabrication .
Williams reports that " during the Clinton Administration , ' discouraged workers ' those who had given up looking for a job because there were no jobs to be had -- were redefined so as to be counted only if they had been ' discouraged ' for less than a year .
This time qualification defined away the bulk of the discouraged workers .
Adding them back into the total unemployed , actual unemployment , [ according to the unemployment rate methodology used in 1980 ] rose to 18 % in January , from 17.5 % in December . "
In other words , without all the manipulations of the data from a government that lies to us every time it opens its mouth , the US unemployment rate is already at depression levels .
How could it be otherwise given the enormous job loss from off - shored jobs ?
It is impossible for a country to create jobs when its corporations are moving production for the American consumer market offshore .
When they move the production offshore , they shift US GDP to other countries .
The US trade deficit over the past decade has reduced US GDP by $ 1.5 trillion dollars .
That is a lot of jobs .
Why bail out GM and Citibank when the firms are moving as many operations offshore as they possibly can ?
I have been reporting for years that American university graduates have had to take jobs as waitresses and bartenders .
As over - indebted American consumers lose their jobs , they will visit restaurants and bars less frequently .
Consequently , Americans with university degrees will not even have jobs waiting on tables and mixing drinks .
US policymakers have ignored the fact that consumer demand in the 21st century has been driven , not by increases in real income , but by increased consumer indebtedness .
This fact makes it pointless to try to stimulate the economy by bailing out banks so that they can lend more to consumers .
The American consumers have no more capacity to borrow .
With the decline in the values of their principal assets -- their homes -- with the destruction of half of their pension assets , and with joblessness facing them , Americans cannot and will not spend .
Much of US infrastructure is in poor shape and needs renewing .
However , infrastructure jobs do not produce goods and services that can be sold abroad .
The massive commitment to infrastructure does nothing to help the US reduce its massive trade deficit , the financing of which is becoming a major problem .
Moreover , when the infrastructure projects are completed , so are the jobs .
At best , assuming Mexicans do not get most of the construction jobs , all Obama 's stimulus program can do is to reduce the number of unemployed temporarily .
Unless US corporations can be required to use American labor to produce the goods and services that they sell in American markets , there is no hope for the US economy .
No one in the Obama administration has the wits to address this problem .
Thus , the economy will continue to implode .

The call came at 11 pm on a Saturday .
Yitzchak Ben Mocha 's mobile flashed up " unidentified number " but he knew who it was .
A recorded voice ordered him to report for duty at eight the next morning .
As he packed his uniform he wondered if he was heading to prison .
The 25 - year - old paratrooper was about to tell his commanders that not only would he refuse to join Israel 's war in Gaza but would not serve in any capacity that helped perpetuate the conflict .
He reported for duty and was ordered to erect tents for combat soldiers .
" I told my officer , I am not going to do this .
The next morning I was sent home .
They told me they 'd call me again if there was need .
They have not called yet .
In the past the army used to put refuseniks in jail for weeks .
When they were released , sometimes they would be arrested again and this would go on for months .
" But now it seems the army does n't want to admit publicly there are refuseniks .
[ It ] is embarrassed .
It would go against the image of the whole army and country united behind this war . "
The Israeli military has told the press there is so much support for the assault on Gaza that more soldiers have turned up to fight than have been called up for what the local media is characterising as a " righteous war " .
Ben Mocha says that obscures the increasing number of Israeli men of fighting age , almost all of whom are military reservists , who are refusing to serve the occupation .
One resisters ' organisation , Courage to Refuse , published a newspaper advert condemning the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians and calling on soldiers to refuse to fight in Gaza .
" The brutal , unprecedented violence in Gaza is shocking .
The false hope that this kind of violence will bring security to Israelis is all the more dangerous .
We cannot stand aside while hundreds of civilians are being butchered by the IDF [ Israel Defence Force ] , " it said .
But it is not clear how many have refused to go to Gaza , because the army is sending people home , quietly .
So far , only one reservist has been jailed for refusing to fight .
No'em Levna , a first lieutenant in the Israeli army , was sent to a military prison for 14 days .
" Killing innocent civilians cannot be justified , " he said .
" Nothing justifies this kind of killing .
It is Israeli arrogance based on logic .
It 's saying , ' if we hit more , everything will be okay ' .
But the hatred and anger we are planting in Gaza will rebound on us . "
Ben Mocha is hardly a pacifist or anti-Israeli .
He grew up in a Jewish orthodox family , attended a religious school , and served full - time in one of Israel 's elite combat parachute units .
He says he joined the Israeli army believing he would be fighting " terror organisations " .
He found himself suppressing Palestinian aspirations for freedom and putting down protests of Palestinian farmers " against the incontinent theft of their lands " .
He also saw abuses , such as Israeli troops sending Palestinian women and children into houses to ensure they were not booby - trapped , and using civilians as human shields .
" I am not a pacifist .
I recognise the necessity of Israel to have a strong defensive army but I 'm no longer going to play a part in 40 years of occupation .
I told the army I will report for training so that I can always be ready to defend Israel , but attacking Gaza and perpetuating occupation is not defending Israel . "
That is not a popular view in a country where worship of the military begins in school and many political leaders are former generals .
But the war is likely to strengthen the resisters once Israelis can reflect on the scale of the killing .
In 2003 , the army sent Yoni Ben Artzi to prison for 18 months for declaring himself a conscientious objector .
Ben Artzi , the nephew of Binyamin Netanyahu , the former prime minister favoured to return to power in the next general election , was called before a " conscience committee " , made up just of military officers .
It said he was not a pacifist - on the remarkable grounds that his persistent resistance to the army was evidence of the qualities of a soldier .
He spent longer in jail than any other refusenik , but recently the military has preferred to pretend simply that dissenters do n't exist - as hundreds of soldiers and reservists signed petitions refusing to enforce the occupation .
The government was particularly embarrassed when 27 pilots said they would no longer carry out killings of Palestinian leaders in Gaza , and when a group of elite commandos refused to serve in the occupied territories .
Still that remains a minority view .
" Some of my comrades from the army do n't like what I 'm thinking .
Some said they do n't agree but they support my right to say it .
But now , with the war , they say I 'm giving my unit a bad reputation , " said Ben Mocha .
He is disturbed that most of the Israeli public and much of the media is blind to the fact that hundreds of Palestinians have been cut to pieces by Israeli fire power .
" In the long run , it 's not a war of defence .
We are creating a thousand suicide bombers for the future from the brothers of the dead , the sons of the dead ... in the long term , we are creating more terror .
You ca n't separate the war in Gaza from the fact that the Palestinian nation is under occupation for more than 40 years .
I 'm not justifying Hamas firing rockets but we Israelis should first look at what we are doing . "
While W. and Dick conjured an alternative reality about Iraq , our avaricious bankers created an alternative reality about our financial system .
Now our busted trust is not so easily fixed .

In an Associated Press article headlined “ Obama Plans Eclipsing New Deal Spending , ” the Rutgers University political science professor Ross Baker notes , “ Not surprisingly , people are wary of some very expensive proposals with no guarantee of success or even a high probability of how well they ’ll work . ”
In The Times , Eric Dash reported that Wall Street is losing confidence in Washington ’s vague and shifting plans , sending shares of bank companies plunging to new lows on Friday .
President Obama disdains sound bites , and he does not have Bill Clinton ’s talent for reducing the abstruse to aperçus .
We wanted someone smart to gather a bunch of smart people around him to get us out of this fix .
But Mr. Obama ’s egghead manner has failed to soothe a nation with the jits .
Maybe he has been so intent on avoiding the stereotype of the Angry Black Man , as he wrote in his memoir , that it ’s hard for him to connect with and articulate public anger about our diminishment .
Though he demonstrated in the campaign that he has a rare gift for inspiring the country with new belief in itself , Mr. Obama has not yet captured either the grit the moment requires or the fury it provokes .
He has not explained in a compelling way why Americans who followed the rules need to sacrifice more to help those who flouted the rules .
That is why the CNBC reporter Rick Santelli struck a populist nerve with his screed about the unfairness of responsible homeowners picking up the tab for irresponsible homeowners  following the unfairness of taxpayers who are losing jobs , homes and savings propping up the exact same bankers and carmakers whose greed and myopia caused the economy to crash .
This Hub is in response to a question that was posted on the Hub - " Mormonism , Missionaries And A Message ... "
I felt that the this question that was asked was of such importance , as it is a question that is asked of Mormons frequently .
Therefore , I am responding to the question in the form of this Hub .
Y - Question : sdorrian
I was in Salt Lake City recently and took a tour of the Temple grounds .
We were not allowed to go into the actual Temple and were told that nobody who is not Mormon was allowed to attend services there .
Do you know why that is ?
M - Answer : LdsNana - AskMormon
Hi sdorrian , and thank you once again for asking about the Mormon temples and the reason not just anyone may enter .
This is a subject of solemn and sacred doctrine , of which are deeply personal to many members of the LDS faith .
LDS temples are dedicated unto the Lord , and set apart from the world , as they were in ancient times .
Temples are sacred , in that only those who meet a particular code of righteous living , are then eligible to enter .
The highest sacraments of the Mormon faith , such as eternal marriage sealings are performed in our temples .
These sacred ordinances are holy and performed only in houses dedicated to the Lord -- temples .
Mormons believe that these sacred and eternal marriages that are performed only in the temple are for time and all eternity .
Three years ago , I promoted and appeared in the atheist documentary “ The God Who Was n’t There , ” dedicated to the proposition that Jesus never existed .
TODAY I DEDICATE THIS SITE AND MY LIFE TO THE WORSHIP AND SERVICE OF OUR LORD AND SAVI O R , JESUS CHRI S T .
I believe in God , the Father almighty , creator of heaven and earth
I believe in Jesus Christ , his only Son , our Lord ,
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit ,
born of the Virgin Mary ,
suffered under Pontius Pilate ,
was crucified , died , and was buried
he descended to the dead .
On the third day he rose again
he ascended into heaven ,
he is seated at the right hand of the Father ,
and he will come to judge the living and the dead .
I believe in the Holy Spirit ,
the holy Catholic Church ,
the communion of saints ,
the forgiveness of sins ,
the resurrection of the body ,
and the life everlasting .
Amen .
For four years , Premier Dalton McGuinty fought a lonely campaign for " fairness " for Ontario within Confederation .
McGuinty had the nerve to point out that taxpayers in this province send billions more to other provinces ( through Ottawa ) than they receive back and that many federal programs blatantly discriminate against Ontario .
While he had the facts and some business leaders on his side , McGuinty was mostly castigated for his temerity – by much of the media , other premiers ( one called him " anti-Canadian " ) , opposition leaders at Queen 's Park , and federal politicians .
A federal Liberal minister from Ontario sniffed that McGuinty 's concerns were " of very little interest to the average citizen . "
A federal Conservative minister from Ontario called McGuinty " the small man of Confederation . "
But bit by bit , McGuinty gained ground .
He won equity in funding for immigration and training programs , social transfers ( other than health ) , and infrastructure projects .
Then in last week 's federal budget , Ontario gained equal funding for health transfers ( an $ 878 million windfall for the province ) and creation of a regional development agency for southern Ontario ( the only part of Canada without one ) .
The budget also included a promise of a national securities commission .
And earlier , the Conservative government in Ottawa signalled it would introduce legislation giving Ontario its fair share of seats in the House of Commons .
Both initiatives would meet long - standing demands by this province .
There are reasons other than McGuinty 's powers of persuasion for these federal concessions , of course .
For one thing , the political ground is shifting in Ottawa from Quebec ( which the Conservatives mistakenly saw as the path to a majority ) to Ontario ( now the chosen path ) .
But McGuinty 's persistence was surely a factor as well , and it has been rewarded .
( CNN ) -- Editta Sherman has celebrated more than half a century 's worth of new years in her palatial studio apartment above New York 's Carnegie Hall .
But it 's unlikely the celebrated portrait photographer will be raising her glass there next year .
Editta Sherman has lived above Carnegie Hall for more than 50 years .
Known as the Duchess of Carnegie , the 96 - year - old came home a few days ago to find an eviction notice on her door .
" I thought , oh , what is this ?
Are you kidding me that they are really going to send a woman like me down the street just like that ?
Have me scurry away without a fight , " she said , delivering a whooping cackle , punctuated with a grandmother 's tsk tsk .
" Oh , no , that 's not what I am going to do .
They 'll have to take me out of here with their bare hands . "
The city of New York wants to renovate the space above Carnegie Hall , where Marlon Brando once lived and where Sherman and five other renters , including iconic New York Times ' photographer Bill Cunningham , have enjoyed rent - stabilized bliss since Frank Sinatra cut his first demo .
Sherman pays $ 650 a month for her studio , a drool - inducing space basked in natural light with floor - to - ceiling windows .
An enormous skylight hangs over bold , black - and - white tiled floors ; a cast - iron circular staircase leads to a loft stuffed with props .
Since last year when Carnegie Hall announced its facelift , 43 residents have lost their battle to stay , and one rent - controlled tenant has vacated , according to Hall spokeswoman Synneve Carlino .
The push to renovate came from the Hall 's chairman Sanford Weill who wants to expand the education classrooms for more than 115,000 music and art students .
Weill 's son - in - law , Natan Bibliowicz , has been hired to design the studio spaces above the hall in a $ 150 million expansion , and taxpayers will reportedly foot part of the bill because New York state granted $ 5 million to cover design and planning costs , according to the New York Times .
Carnegie Hall has offered to pay for the rent - control tenants ' relocation expenses and move them to apartments which are " equivalent or better " in the neighborhood .
The Hall also is offering to pay the difference in rent to each of those tenants for the rest of their lives .
" We have asked Editta to come and look at spaces with us , " Carlino told CNN .
But Sherman and her like - minded neighbors are not budging .
There is only one scenario that might work , the grandmother of 25 said .
" They can pay me $ 10 million .
I 'm part of history , " she said .
" You want to tell me they do n't have enough rooms ?
They have a building of rooms .
This place is history , and I think Carnegie , the people running it , I do n't think they think about that . "
Dressed in a purple zebra-cuffed shirt and black jumpsuit , Sherman ambles around her enormous studio with the sprightliness of a woman half her age .
She holds up a photograph of herself with Salvador Dali , her aubergine - painted eyebrows animated as she tells stories about the famous faces who have dropped by over the years -- Andy Warhol , Henry Fonda , Eva Gabor , Tyrone Power , Carl Sandburg , Paul Newman .
" With Salvador , he had an exhibit nearby , you know , and I went there to meet him and we just hit it off .
So he came back to my place and I took some pictures , " she said .
" He wanted to buy my ( stair ) railing which was pure bronze then , with some engravings from Paramount .
I told him it was quite expensive and he said he'd have to think about it . "
Yul Brenner brought Marlene Dietrich by once in the 1950s during a time when the two Hollywood stars were reportedly having an affair , Sherman said .
" They were just so sweet , " she said .
" Yul was playful , and she was quiet . "
In true Warhol style , Sherman photographed the pop genius as he was photographing her .
Warhol 's portrait sits next to the hundreds of other portraits piled up in rows in her studio .
Sherman has hundreds of letters from Cary Grant -- a long correspondence of them trying , in vain , to get together for a portrait session .
" I never thought that taking photos would be valuable , " she said .
" I did it to earn a living and because I liked it . "
Sherman 's career took off when she got a job in New York casinos which hosted welcome home parties for World War II soldiers .
Her husband , Harold Sherman , who was an inventor and proprietor of photographic technology , convinced the management of the casinos to let his wife take photos of the celebrities who entertained there , she said .
Sherman had a way of putting celebrities at ease when they posed for her , a gift she picked up from her father who was a photographer .
And soon word of her work buzzed among New York 's jet set .
The Shermans and their five children decided they needed a place to live in New York .
While many were running for the tranquil promise of the suburbs , she wanted to be in the middle of it all .
She spied a full page ad in the New York Times in 1947 .
It read : " Live and work in Carnegie Hall . "
Rent was $ 225 a month .
" It was n't a big deal at the time , and when I saw the place I thought that it would be big enough for me and five children , " she recalled .
But the studio was much larger and more ideal for photography than she ever imagined .
Vogue magazine used to borrow it for shoots .
In the 1960s , Sherman shot many images of the supermodel Veruschka , a Prussian emigre whose father , a German count , was executed for trying to assassinate Hitler .
A celebrated muse of Dali , Veruschka was a pleasure to photograph , Sherman said .
" She had such a beauty , " Sherman said .
" I believe youth and beauty are all in how you live . "
Sherman has space to live , at least for now .
She occupies an entire floor .
Her children are all grown and long moved out .
Her husband died in his 50s from diabetes .
She spends most days shooting photos and jumping rope to stay fit .
" I feel lost sometimes that I 'm the only one on this floor now , " she said .
" But , you see , people get tired of fighting .
They lived here , and they could live somewhere else , so they did .
" But I am different .
I have this business here , " Sherman said .
" This is who I am , where I live , and I wo n't let someone change that . "
All About Carnegie Hall
For our entire lives , most of us have depended on highly centralized systems .
Our food comes from a thousand or more miles away .
Our savings is shipped into distant financial centers and invested by strangers in enterprises run by strangers .
We watch highly scripted news that serves the same spin no matter how many channels we try .
We bank at impersonal global banks with criminal records that would make a felon blush and have no idea where our money goes , just that the government guarantees that we will get it back .
Within this centralized system , diversification means having your financial assets deposited into a “ one - stop - shop ” brokerage account invested in securities representing different global industries , the idea being when one industry is doing poorly , another “ countercyclical ” industry would be doing well .
But suddenly , we find that we may not be able to trust these centralized systems .
Suddenly , traditional portfolio theory no longer addresses our anxiety .
This is because we need to shift from diversification within a centralized system to real diversification in a decentralized , possibly “ out of control ” world .
If you study the investment patterns of families and wealth that has survived through the generations , including through periods of lawlessness and warfare , you come to understand that for those who want to thrive in all economic and political scenarios , diversification has had a far deeper meaning than what is commonly understood in the financial markets today .
For the astute strategist , it means not putting all your eggs in one basket in every important aspect of your life .
Given what is happening in our world and economy , it ’s time to revisit the deeper meaning of diversification .
Diversification means that our assets are invested such that an economic , political , or natural event — particularly a catastrophic event — cannot wipe us out .
So , for example , we do n’t invest all of our savings in a single financial institution or fund .
Investors who lost their life savings in the Madoff scandal were not practicing even the most basic form of financial diversification .
Diversification also means having multiple types of assets and custodians in multiple places .
Custodians ( i.e. , those who hold our assets for us ) might be brokerage firms , banks , depositories or our own safe .
Diversification by place means locating our assets in states or countries subject to different legal and political risks .
It means denominating our assets in currencies of multiple countries .
It means selecting assets subject to different risks of loss due to climate change , weather conditions , social conditions and other uniquely local vicissitudes .
Local investment is a great idea , but the people who lived through Katrina can tell you why having all of your eggs in one local basket may not be the best idea .
Diversification means that we do n’t have all of our savings in just one type of asset .
So we do n’t invest in securities only — we also invest in tangibles .
If possible , we buy a house without debt , or with debt that can be serviced by one family member ’s income , or invest in our home to lower energy and food costs permanently .
We also maintain a sufficient inventory of household goods .
And it ’s a good idea to invest in disaster preparedness if we live in an area that experiences earthquakes , floods , hurricanes , or tornadoes or is prone to power outages .
Having all your money in one currency or one country is pretty risky – a risk many in the US tend to take .
Ask your Jewish friends whose parents got out of Germany in time because they had gold coins or family and assets abroad .
Gold coins may hold their value if the dollar collapses , but they can also disappear in a burglary or if you forget where you put them .
Digital gold may be a great thing , but if the Internet is not reliable where you are , cold cash may be a good thing .
Or if your cash is worthless , a stockpile of food , vitamins and liquor can be priceless .
However , food , vitamins and liquor are only good when you are bartering with someone who wants them or is close by .
Which takes us back to gold coins or digital gold or some other currencies .
So you see , there is no magic bullet – just diversification .
Diversification of life risks is an integral part of all matters related to financial capital .
Living things are the source of all wealth .
That includes you and me .
Diversification means that we invest in our physical and mental well - being .
We invest our time in understanding the toxic chemicals , drugs and other influences that increasingly contribute to poor health and cause us to need so much more funding for more drugs and medical treatments to cure what ails us .
One of the greatest – and growing — threats to our financial health is physical illness .
The notion that corporate stock investments will create security while one saves money eating unhealthy food is contradictory to the principles of building real wealth .
Diversification means that we invest not just in our own human capital but also in the human capital of other members of our family and those around us .
In this way , we are not betting on financial assets alone to see us through .
We are investing in each other because it is family , friends and communities that help see us through .
An active network of mutually - supportive friends and colleagues is important .
For those with sufficient capital and skills , financing the farmers and companies we depend on for our daily bread may not provide much of a return — it may , however , ensure that we have healthy , safe food .
Diversification also applies to the work we do .
For most people , our labor is our most important source of financial assets .
Skill diversity can mean , for example , that you have a number of skills .
If one skill goes out of favor , another will give you the ability to be economically useful .
If you have a business that fails , you have the ability to start a new business because you have the experience and diversity of skills to make a business run .
The ability to generate income through your own business or practice is invaluable , particularly when the economic environment makes “ W - 2 ” employment more difficult to find .
If you are an employee and your company closes , if you have taken care to broaden your skill base , your skills can be valuable commodities for other , different types of employers or employers in other industries or places less affected by a downturn .
Better yet , you know how to do many things for yourself , thus offsetting lost income with lower expenses .
Look at those who are successful in the current environment : what most of them share is a commitment to life - long learning that translates into a multitude of personal and professional skills .
Diversification is not always easy to achieve .
The more resources we have , the easier it is to diversify .
The fewer resources we have , the more our diversification focuses on building our human capital and community .
Interestingly enough , many of the best opportunities before us are those that can happen when people who have a lot of money and people who do n’t have money but have a lot of skills become allies in building greater diversification together .
Isolation shrinks our options .
Opportunities expand as we organize and collaborate effectively .
Hence , it is critical to not assume financial capital can provide sufficient diversification alone and remain isolated from our neighbors and family .
One of my goals for the Solari Report is to explore options we have to strengthen and diversify our human and financial capital and to introduce you to leaders who are taking action to help us do so .
This week , I will be reviewing recent financial events and discussing indications that more and more people are concerned about a financial coup d’etat .
UPDATE : UFO Not Responsible for UK Wind Turbine Wreckage
February 11th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
In a news update that should surprise no one , officials now say that the destruction of a £ 1 million wind turbine in the UK last month was not caused by a UFO .
Despite local reports of a “ massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground ” , the turbine ’s manufacturer believes that material fatigue is responsible for a 65 foot blade flying off the device .
According to Ecotricity ’s website , the “ interim report has concluded that bolts securing the blade to the hub of the turbine failed due to ‘ material fatigue ’ .
The bolts used to attached the blade to the hub of the turbine exhibited classic signs of fatigue failure . ”
Ecotricity owns the turbine farm in question .
The company plans on releasing the entire manufacturer ’s report in a few weeks , at which point all conspiracy theories may or may not be put to rest .

In Oslo , air pollution from public and private transport has increased by approximately 10 % since 2000 , contributing to more than 50 % of total CO2 emissions in the city .
With Norway 's ambitious target of being carbon neutral by 2050 Oslo City Council began investigating alternatives to fossil fuel - powered public transport and decided on biomethane .
Biomethane is a by - product of treated sewage .
Microbes break down the raw material and release the gas , which can then be used in slightly modified engines .
Previously at one of the sewage plants in the city half of the gas was flared off , emitting 17,00 tonnes of CO2 .
From September 2009 , this gas will be trapped and converted into biomethane to run 200 of the city 's public buses .
Project leader , Ole Jakob Johansen said : " The city of Oslo has great visions for Oslo as a green capital .
Oslo aims to be one of the most environmentally sustainable capitals of the world .
Using biomethane makes sense .
Not only would the biomethane otherwise be wasted , but the reduction in emissions per bus will go a long way to achieving our carbon - neutral target .
What 's more , aside from the intial set - up costs , we expect to see an average saving of € 0.40 per litre of fuel ( based on an average diesel price of € 0.67 per litre compared with biomethane at € 0.27 per litre ) " .
The city 's diesel public buses will only require minor modifications to their engines to run on methane , which is stored on tanks on top of the vehicles .
The only noticeable difference will be how quietly they drive .
" Biogas is popular in Sweden , but they have very few vehicles powered by biomethane .
We chose to focus on biomethane as this emits less carbon and is easier and cheaper to produce , " said Johansen .
The net emissions from a biomethane operated bus are zero , because the carbon originally came from the atmosphere rather than fossil fuels , but electricity is used at the sewage plant to convert the gas from the waste into fuel for the buses .
Oslo city council is taking the electricity used to generate the fuel into consideration and calculate that carbon emissions per bus are 18 tonnes per year , a saving of 44 tonnes of C02 per bus per year .
The city 's two sewage plants have enough biomethane to provide fuel for the 80 buses , but if the trial is successful Oslo city council plans to convert all 400 of the public buses to run on biogas .
The biogas will be created from a mixture of biomethane and biogas from the incineration of kitchen waste from the capital 's restaurants and domestic kitchens .
Eventually , the council hopes that cars will also be able to run on biogas sourced locally from biomethane and converted kitchen waste .
What do you think ?
Should this be deployed more widely ?
なんかもうタイトルだけで十分という気になってきましたが、一応説明も。
毎年参加しながら、まともに会話もできず発表もせずという状態では、何しに行っているのか分からないというか、なんで自分はこんなことしてるんだろうと異国の空の下で思ったりしないでもないRubyConfなので、今年はLTをやるという話を聞いて何か話をしないと、と思ってました。が、実のところ自分のプロダクトがあるわけでもなく、また日本の状況の紹介をしても受けないらしい（正直みんな興味ない、というのが２年前の発表で判明した）ので、話す内容に悩んでいました。
が、ふと 「
日本には興味なくても、自分が使ってるプロダクトの作者が日本人なら、そのひとへの興味はあるはず」と思いつきました。とはいえ、よくRubyConfに来ている人はさておき、たとえ日本では有名でも海外ではそれほど、という人は紹介しても仕方なさそうです。そこで考えた結果、Yuguiさんを思いつきました。なんせそれまで海外にはさほどアピールしてなかった人が、突然Ruby 1.9のリリースマネージャになったわけですから、「 Yuguiさんはやばい、じゃなくてちゃんとリリースマネジメントできるひとだよ！」というのを伝えておくのはよさそうです。
しかも運の良いことに、RubyConfの直前にRHGの逆襲企画があり、そこでYuguiさんに会えそうということだったので、よかったら動画でも撮らせてもらってRubyConfで発表したいなと思ってました。だがしかし。残念なことにYuguiさんはRHG逆襲は欠席だったので、やむなくジュンク堂のトークセッションの動画（の冒頭の一瞬だけ）を持って行ってみました。
でも、本当はその前にもう一人、紹介しておきたい人がいました。
今回のRubyConf2008では、Guy Decouxの追悼企画をやるらしいという話が出てました。それを聞き、すぐに思ったのはitojunさんのことでした。ちょうど訃報を聞いたのがRubyConfに行く直前だったので、ほぼ１年たったことになります。そのことを思い出して、しんみりしたのも覚えています。
itojunさんのことは 、Guy Decouxほどではないかもしれませんが、Rubyistだったら知っていて欲しい人です。おそらくBSD界やネットワーク界（？）の中には、まつもとさんよりもitojunさんのことがよく知られているコミュニティもあるでしょう。しかし、海外のRubyistsのコミュニティでは、ほぼ無名の人に違いありません。それはやはり、いくらなんでも、としか。
ところが。いざスライドを作ろうとすると、もう泣けて大変でした。比喩的な意味ではなくて、ほとんど滂沱というかなんというか、文章考えても涙が止まらないわ、youtubeの動画をkeynote用に変換するのでも涙が止まらないわ、keynoteのスライドをいじってても涙が止まらないわ、ほとんど情緒不安定みたいでだいじょうぶですかこのひとは状態になっていたので、まともに話せるかどうか怪しくて、日和ろうかと思ったことは一度や二度ではありません。が、ちょうど１年というこのタイミングを逃すともっと発表しづらいだろうし、他にやってくれそうな人も思い当たらなかったので、万が一途中で行き詰まってもYuguiさんの紹介はできるはずだからそれでも価値あるかなどと考え、僭越ながら発表してみました。案の定、話しながら途中で泣いて詰まってすごいことになってしまいましたが、それでも無事（なのか？）に発表でき、また拍手もいただけて良かったです。
動画は恥ずかしいので公開されても見なくていいです。
なんかちょっとほめすぎなのかなあ、と思いつつも、私は直接の面識がないので、よいところしか知らないため、素朴に書くとこんな感じになるのです。ある意味、親しくなかった人の方が、屈託なく話せていいのではないのかな、と思ったりします（言い訳でもありますけど）。というか、今見返してもやっぱり涙が出てきた。
ちなみに今回は初めて のMacでのプレゼンで、初めてKeynoteを使ってみました。確かに２画面使ったプレゼンは便利なんだけど、しかしこの設定は難しすぎる。道理でMacのひとの発表準備は手間取るわけだよ。そうそう慣れても一発ではなかなかできないんじゃないかなあ、と思いました（今回はきわめてゆるい感じのLTだったので、調整に時間をかけても文句言われなかった）。
最後に、直前 にMacでのプレゼンの仕方を説明してくれたレオさん、セットアップを手伝ってくれた角谷さん、そしてMacbook Air用のバッテリを売っていただいたshachiさん（これがなかったらAirでの行動は辛かった）、どうもありがとうございました（ちなみにRubyConf2008全般でお世話になったひとはもっとたくさんいます。みなさまもろもろありがとうございます）。
Israel ’s enduring use of Palestinian collaborators to entrench the occupation and destroy Palestinian resistance was once the great unmentionable of the Middle East conflict .
When the subject was dealt with by the international and local media , it was solely in the context of the failings of the Palestinian legal system , which allowed the summary execution of collaborators by lynch mobs and kangaroo courts .
That is beginning to change with a trickle of reports indicating the extent of Israel ’s use of collaborators and the unwholesome techniques it uses to recruit them .
" Cooperation , " it has become clearer , is the very backbone of Israel ’s success in maintaining its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Collaboration comes in various guises , including land dealers , who buy Palestinian - owned land to sell it to settlers or the Israeli government ; armed agents who assist Israeli soldiers in raids ; and infiltrators into the national organizations and their armed wings who foil resistance operations .
But the foundation of the collaboration system is the low - level informant , who passes on the tidbits of information about neighbors and community leaders on which Israel ’s system of control depends .
Recent reports in the Israeli media , for example , suggest that the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza , far from reducing the opportunities for collaboration , may actually have increased them .
The current siege of the Strip  in which Israel effectively governs all movement in and out of Gaza  has provided an ideal point of leverage for encouraging collusion .
Masterminding this strategy is the Israeli secret police , the Shin Bet , which has recently turned its attention to sick Gazans and their relatives who need to leave the Strip .
With hospitals and medicines in short supply , some patients have little hope of recovery without treatment abroad or in Israel .
According to the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights , the Shin Bet is exploiting the distress of these families to pressure them to agree to collaborate in return for an exit permit .
Last month , the group released details of 32 cases in which sick Gazans admitted they were denied permits after refusing to become informants .
One is Shaban Abu Obeid , 38 , whose pacemaker was installed at an Israeli hospital and needs intermittent maintenance by Israeli doctors .
Another , Bassam Waheidi , 28 , has gone blind in one eye after he refused to cooperate and was denied a permit .
But these cases are only the tip of an enormous iceberg .
Those Palestinians who refuse to collaborate have every interest in making their problems public .
By contrast , those who agree to turn informant have no such interest .
As with other occupation regimes , Israel has long relied on the most traditional way of recruiting collaborators : torture .
While a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1999 banned torture , the evidence suggests the Shin Bet simply ignored the ruling .
Two Israeli human rights groups , B’Tselem and Hamoked , found last year that seven " special " interrogation methods amounting to torture are still being regularly employed , including beatings , painful binding , back bending , body stretching and prolonged sleep deprivation .
Detention provides other opportunities for recruitment .
In the past 17 years alone , 150,000 Palestinians have been prosecuted by the military regime .
According to the Israeli group Yesh Din , 95 percent of these trials end in plea bargains , offering yet another chance to persuade a detainee to turn informant in return for a reduced sentence .
Cell - sharing in Israel ’s prison system , as Salah Abdel Jawwad , a Ramallah - based political scientist , has observed , is also the perfect environment in which the Shin Bet can collect data not only about the detainee but also about the wider society from which he or she is drawn .
With hundreds of thousands of Palestinians having passed through its prisons since 1967 , Israel has been able " to control the population from an early stage , " Mr. Abdel Jawwad said , " particularly because it is able to identify those who are the potential future leaders of the society . "
An example of the use of pressure during detention emerged last week when a gag order was lifted on the case of Hamed Keshta , 33 , from Gaza .
A translator for news agencies and the European Union , he was arrested in July when he tried to use a permit to cross the border into Israel for a meeting with his EU employers .
Mr. Keshta said he was taken into detention and offered the chance to turn collaborator .
When he refused , interrogations by the Shin Bet " began in earnest , " the Haaretz newspaper reported .
He was held for a month , accused of serious charges including " security violations " and conspiring to commit " a crime against state security . "
" I assume that it is the standard interrogation that thousands of other Palestinians undergo , " he noted after his release .
" They did not hit me , but I was placed in restraints and forced to sit on a chair , " he said referring to the infamous " shabah " stress position that becomes unbearably painful after a short period .
Keshta also had medication withheld .
For decades , the occupation has imposed a system of absolute control on the lives of Palestinians that requires them to apply for permits either from the military regime ruling over them , known misleadingly as the Civil Administration , or from the Shin Bet .
Most Palestinians need a permit to carry out such essential daily tasks as building or altering a home ; passing through a checkpoint to visit a relative or reach a hospital ; passing through a gate in Israel ’s separation wall to farm their land ; driving a taxi ; receiving import or export licenses ; leaving the occupied territories , including for business ; visiting a relative in prison ; winning residence for a loved one ; and so on .
There are few Palestinians who have not needed such a " favor " from the military authorities at some point , either for themselves or someone they know .
And it is at this point that pressure can be exerted .
In her book Sharon and My Mother - in - Law , Suad Amiry describes this process eloquently .
In return for help or a permit , a small favor is given by the occupation regime .
Once taken , the recipient ’s integrity is compromised and slowly greater demands are made .
It is this gentle ensnaring of large sections of the Palestinian population  together with open threats of physical violence to smaller sections of the population  that ensure collaboration with the occupation is endemic .
This , as Israel well understands , creates an environment that frustrates successful resistance , which requires organization , cooperation and intelligence - sharing between armed factions .
As soon as the circle widens beyond a few individuals , one of them is likely to be an informant .
The result can be seen in the dismal failure of most armed acts of resistance , as well as the ease with which Israel picks off Palestinian leaders it " targets " for execution .
Mr. Abdel Jawwad calls this approach " psychological warfare " against Palestinians , who are made to believe that their society is " weak , sickly and composed of untrustworthy characters . "
In short , it encourages social fragmentation in which Palestinians come to believe that it is better to stab their neighbor in the back before they get stabbed themselves .
This article originally appeared in The National , published in Abu Dhabi .
New York – A little more than a year after the Kindle made its debut , Amazon announced a new , updated version of its popular e-book reader Monday with a big endorsement from Stephen King .
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos demonstrated the features of the new device , called Kindle 2 , at a crowded press event at the Morgan Library and Museum in New York .
He stressed the need for the Kindle to " disappear " so the reader can focus on the text .
Bezos himself then disappeared , welcoming novelist Stephen King to the stage to give his take and announce a Kindle - only novella he wrote specifically for Amazon .
As predicted in leaked photos , the new Kindle 2 has a much slimmer profile than the original ( .36 ” thick compared to the first version 's 0.7 " thick ) , is slightly lighter ( 10.2 ounces versus the original 10.3 ounces ) , has curved edges , and includes a sleeker , unified keyboard with a 5 - way joystick instead of the original device 's scroll wheel .
And the navigation buttons have been pushed down for tighter control ( and to avoid the accidental page - turning that many users complained about ) .
Kindle 2 has a 25 percent longer battery life , Bezos claimed , and contains 2GB of memory that can hold more than 1,500 books .
There is also a new iPod - like metal back plate and a set of stereo speakers along the bottom , which enable a new feature :
The Kindle 2 can convert any text to audio , so it can " read " books to you in a somewhat robotic , artificial - sounding voice .
( King jokingly called this a " GPS voice " ) .
( See how the Kindle 2 and the Sony Reader stack up , feature - wise . )
Another major update is a new Whispersync service which makes it easier for original Kindle owners to transfer e-books they 've already purchased to the new device .
Whispersync will eventually work on a number of mobile devices as well , enabling Kindle owners to read their books on other devices .
The Kindle 's screen has been improved , too :
The E - Ink technology , already easier on the eyes than a computer screen or standard LCD screen , has been updated to 16 shades of gray , up from the current model 's 4 levels of gray .
It also turns pages 20 percent faster on average than the previous model , Bezos said .
Unfortunately the design is all that has changed , as Amazon is standing by the $ 359 price tag .
It ’s available for pre-sale now , and original Kindle owners jump to the front of the queue if they order by midnight Tuesday .
Kindle 2 will start shipping February 24 , 2009 , Bezos indicated .
There is also still no Wi -Fi access , but , as with the first version , with its 3G cellular radio ( supplied by Sprint ) Kindle owners can purchase any of Amazon ’s 230,000 titles anywhere where there is a signal from Sprint 's data network .
And the Kindle 's limitations on file formats remain unchanged .
It still cannot easily display standard PDF ( Acrobat ) files , nor can it utilize e-book formats other than Amazon's .
King read a passage at the press event from the novella entitled " Ur , " which he wrote this January , that includes direct references and discussion about the Kindle and the Amazon bookstore .
But he says the Kindle in his story does more than Kindle 2 , like accessing information from other worlds .
While he obviously loves the Kindle , King says print books will always be around .
Instead , he sees e-books and print books as complementary .
“ They 're like peanut butter and chocolate , when you put them together you ’ve got a whole new taste treat , ” he said .
It has been quite a year for the Kindle , with ever growing popularity due in no small part to an Oprah endorsement in November that included special guest Bezos .
Oprah called the device her " new favorite thing in the world . "
Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney also called it the " ipod of the book world " last fall , predicting sales for the year of around 240,000 .
And just this month , however , he upped the number again to about half a million , using estimates based on Sprint service , and that it will become a $ 1.2 billion business by 2010 .
" We 've been selling e-books for years and guess what , it did n’t work … until 14 months ago , " said Bezos on Monday .
He says more than 10 percent of e-book units sold now are Kindle books .
Amazon itself has yet nor is it likely to release any specific numbers , but e-book ’s are certainly growing in popularity and hype , and the device was sold out on Amazon throughout the holiday season .
Many other companies are planning on releasing e-book readers this year including Plastic Logic with its paper thin device that was unveiled at last year ’s DEMO , and Foxit Software whose reader will be much cheaper than its competitors at around $ 250 .
And Sony beat Kindle to an update a few months ago , with a touch screen reader that has features , like note taking , which seem to be targeting the college crowd .
And while Sony promises to add wireless access in the next update , Kindle 's got it beat on one major front with its free Whispersync access to purchase books on - the - go .
Amazon also said this week that it is planning on releasing Kindle titles on mobile devices besides the Kindle very soon , and it is likely to inolve the new Whispersync feature .
" We are excited to make Kindle books available on a range of mobile phones , " said Drew Herdener , a spokesman for Amazon .
" We are working on that now . "
Others are turning to mobile devices like the iPhone as an e-reader , through various applications like Classics , Stanza , and ScrollMotion 's Iceberg apps .
Google gave this medium a big boost last week when it optimized about 1.5 million titles in its public domain Book Search library for iPhones and T - Mobile 's Android powered G1 .

Online retail giant Amazon has yanked from its virtual shelves a Japanese computer game that lets players simulate raping girls .
A " Rapelay " videogame being hawked on Amazon by a third - party merchant was deemed inappropriate and the product 's page taken down after it was brought to the California Internet firm 's attention Wednesday night .
" We determined that we did not want to be selling this particular item , " Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith said Friday of the computer game .
The " Rapelay " game was created exclusively for the Japanese market but a couple of " like new " copies were being offered on Amazon by a U.S. seller specializing in animated Japanese pornography .
The computer game maker , Illusion studio based in Japan , posts a notice on its website that its products are specifically for domestic users .
" As we say on the website , we do n't sell the products overseas because of the rating problem , and I cannot possibly comment on the report from San Francisco , " said a spokesman for the company in Yokohama .
" We believe there is no problem with the software , which has cleared the domestic ratings of an ethics watchdog body , " he said .
The game was released in 2006 .
Other titles from the studio include " Battle Raper " and " Artificial Girl . "

Change , what change ?
By Steve Kubby
High Times interviewed me in their October 2008 issue and I predicted that whether McCain or Obama won , it would n’t make much difference in policy .
Sadly , people are beginning to realize that Obama ’s call for change , indeed his own web site ’s call for legalization , does not include backing off from the war on weed .
While we can expect no help or relief from Obama , I also believe , as do many of my fellow activists to whom I have spoken recently , that now is the time for us to press forward for real Change .
We even have a name for it : “ Change you can smoke . ”
The best way I know to fight is to use our Constitutional right to a jury trial .
In my case , I fought a 19 count indictment that promised 40 years to life .
I fought back by forcing Placer County to try me with three different juries and seven different judges , spanning a six year period .
Although the jury sided with me on the marijuana charges , I was convicted for some peyote buttons found in my guest bedroom .
The judge acted like he was doing me a favor to only sentence me to probation and 90 days electronic monitoring , but I refused probation and told the court to either jail me or release me to Canada .
The judge released me to Canada , but his fellow judges changed my appeal status and I found myself reading in the newspaper that I had become a “ felony fugitive . ”
I refused to return without a court fight in Canada first .
None of these decisions were easy , but I ’ve found that standing up to these drug thugs means you get the worst up front , but then things just get better and better after that .
In my case , the court ended up dismissing the conviction and expunging my record .
Furthermore , my case was a career ender for nearly everyone who touched me .
The DA and prosecutor never advanced after this , forced to watch their fellow prosecutors become judges and pass them by .
The head of the Tahoe Narcotics Task Force who busted me , saw the Task Force dissolved and was reduced down to working 7 - 11s with teens to discourage alcohol buys .
If his teens talked an adult into a buy , the deputy was allowed only to give them a warning letter , no arrests were allowed .
Many of the expert witnesses in my case were so thoroughly discredited that they never testified again .
Today , if someone were to call me a felon or discriminate in any way against me , I have the legal right to sue them into oblivion , which I certainly wo n’t hesitate to do .
Meanwhile the cops avoid me like the plague , because they ’ve heard the stories from their fellow narcs , about the way my defense team humiliated their guys .
Seriously , my friends and I have seen cops approaching , then pause as they talk on their radios or phones , then turn away .
Even in Canada , I saw this behavior pattern by police .
Once I was toking up some particularly stinky cannabis , in the garage of a high security Canadian federal building when I saw , in the rearview mirror , two angry cops on bikes who were furiously peddling right for me , only to stop , talk on their radio , and then turn away .
Overall , I have found that the tougher you are with standing up for what you truly believe , the more the cops and prosecutors respect you .
Two sheriffs and three district attorney have personally apologized to me and my family for what was done to us .
One sheriff even wrote a letter on my behalf to the Canadian government to help me return to Canada .
Right now , 3 % of medical marijuana cases are heard by jury and that is considered to be a very high percentage and a significant financial impact on the court system .
As most attorneys and prosecutors will tell you , the drug war would end in a few months if just half the people who are arrested insisted on their right to a jury trial .
So , please , think about these things is you are arrested and some public serpent slithers up to you and offers you a plea “ bargain . ”
First , it will never end up to be a bargain and second we need you to help in the fight .
I receive requests several times a week from defendants who suddenly find themselves forced to defend their lives , their right to use medical cannabis and even the Bill of Rights .
Like you , each defendant is suddenly forced to cope with a predatory criminal justice system that judges them guilty , until proved innocent .
This advice is intended to help provide you with the necessary tactics to succeed against the terrifying challenge you now face .
Here are the key concepts you must master to win :
1. NON - COOPERATION WITH TYRANNY IS A DUTY .
America was founded on the premise that we have inalienable rights that cannot be separated from us by any law or government .
The Drug War is unconstitutional , immoral , and no longer supported by voters or juries .
Your non-cooperation with this corrupt war on American citizens is the surest way our Constitution and Bill of Rights can be restored .
2. NONVIOLENCE –
We do n’t want to kill our enemies , only expose their lies and their greed for power over others .
Any form of anger on your part must be left at the door , or it will make you no better than your adversaries and bring failure to your efforts .
Only when others sense your commitment to the high road , will the justice you seek become possible .
Those who attended my trial saw that I always wore a suit and showed respect .
I even held doors open for my prosecutors , so they could push in their huge cart filled with 4,000 pages of lies against me .
My polite behavior only made their accusations look more wild and ridiculous .
3. — USE THE MEDIA – Most courts will not allow you to tell your story and you must depend upon the media to get the truth out .
Focus on winning in the court of public opinion and your victory with the jury will be assured .
4. NEVER PLEA BARGAIN – This is a slippery slope .
It might look like a great idea to begin with , but in the end , you lose , everyday for the rest of your life .
You wo n’t get what you were promised and you ’ll only endanger others by cooperating with government terrorists .
5. GO ALL OUT ON THE PRELIMINARY HEARING – Winning your Preliminary Hearing means the judge will dismiss the case and your troubles are over .
Most defense attorneys will advise you to do little in your Preliminary Hearing , so they can see what the prosecution ’s case is about and then prepare a defense .
That is definitely the wrong tactic in a bona fide medical marijuana case .
You want an attorney who will fight with everything you have to win your case in the Prelim , regardless of the costs or time involved .
Top medical marijuana attorney J. David
Nick once took a Prelim on for 18 months , until the prosecutor gave up in desperation .
6. INSIST ON A JURY TRIAL – Less than 3 % of defendants exercise their right to a jury trial and yet the court system is in near gridlock .
Refusing to cooperate and demanding a trial places a significant load on the criminal justice system and is the surest way to end this phony drug war .
Nearly all medical marijuana trials end in acquittals or hung juries , so take your case directly to your fellow citizens and trust them to see through the prosecutor ’s lies .
7. REF– USE TO WAIVE TIME –
You have the Constitutional right to a speedy trial and yet virtually every defendant is told by their attorneys to waive their right .
What few attorneys ever tell their clients is that if they refuse to waive time , they must be tried within 60 days or the case must be dismissed .
In the real world , few prosecutors can prepare a case in 60 days and few courts can organize a jury trial in that time either .
8. TARGET POLICY MAKERS – ignore the police and prosecutors and target their superiors .
It is Sheriffs and D.A.s who are the generals in the Drug War and they are the ones who are responsible for your current grief .
Organize a recall election against your D.A .
Your recall will probably fail miserably , but your D.A. will back off prosecuting other medical cannabis patients , once you put a little heat to their feet .
9. SEEK CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES –
Use the courts and your local grand jury to obtain indictments and convictions against rogue officials , since this is the ONLY thing sheriffs , police chiefs and district attorneys understand or respect .
Never forget what was done to you until EVERY rogue sheriff , district attorney , police chief , and judge has been brought to justice .
We owe it to all who have died and suffered horribly in this war to dedicate the rest of our lives to bringing these drug war criminals to justice .
10 . REF– USE PROBATION – Probation is no different than plea bargaining , because you are trading away your rights for a deal that will never work in your favor .
You are better off to take jail over probation , because probation nearly always leads to further violations and trouble with the law .
11 . DOCUMENT AB– USES – It ’s your job to document and prove abuse .
Sooner or later , a reform - minded administration will be elected and they will want to investigate your charges and seek justice .
You are now a professional defendant .
Your life will be your trial .
Do what you can to survive and remain true to the belief that YOU ARE INNOCENT .
A law was passed five years ago that gives you the RIGHT to use , grow and possess this medicine .
Do n’t be afraid to stand up for what you believe .
Good luck and remember to focus on the positive .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke this evening with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and thanked him for his decision to transfer NIS 175 million ( $ 43 million ) in cash to the Gaza Strip .
Olmert 's office said Clinton praised the decision , despite the domestic opposition he faced , and said move would strengthen Palestinian moderates .
Both Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni contested the move , announced by the prime minister on Thursday afternoon .
Money Troubles Fayyad slams Israeli cash blockade in Gaza Infolive.tv
Palestinian prime minister bemoans situation of Palestinian Authority employees in Gaza Strip who are unable to collect salaries due to Israel 's block of cash flow to Hamas - ruled enclave .
Israel rejects criticism , says terror groups to blame Fayyad slams Israeli cash blockade in Gaza
The funds , to be transferred immediately , are intended to be pay the salaries of Palestinian Authority workers in the Gaza Strip .
However , since the region is controlled by Hamas , political and security forces believe that it is likely the funds will end up in the hands of Hamas or other terror organizations .
The Palestinian Authority has bank accounts in Israel , whose contents are generated from taxes .
Employees – identified by name , identity number and bank account – are paid from these sums .
Due to the situation in Gaza , PA workers have not been able to cash their salaries in Gaza and , thus , requested a transfer of funds in cash , from Israel .
Livni and Barak , during a three - way meeting with Olmert , expressed their disapproval for his decision .
The two noted that while the Israel - PLO Economic Agreement , signed in Paris in 1994 , requires Israel to transfer tax - generated funds to the PA , it is not the appropriate time to transfer money to workers in Gaza because of the likelihood of a Hamas appropriation .
" This is ( the PA's ) money and they have the right to decide how to spend it .
The money belongs to ( Palestinian Prime Minister Salam ) Fayyad and his employees in Gaza , " read a statement from the Prime Minister 's Office .
" The Palestinians have also appealed to the United States and they have international backing for their request , because it is anchored in accords , " the statement continued .
A senior political source in the PMO told Ynet : " Because the funds are transferred to people on a name basis , and only to Fatah employees in Gaza , this actually promotes Israel 's policy of strengthening ( Fatah ) sources relative to Hamas sources . "
" We ’re doing what Israel must do based on agreements and working to strengthen moderates , " he added .
Two months ago , Barak garnered criticism for transferring NIS 100 million ( about $ 25 million ) from West Bank banks to Gaza banks , at Fayyad 's request , due to the fact that banks were closing in the Gaza Strip .
The funds went to pay the salaries of some 70,000 PA workers .
Fayyad said at the time that the funds transferred were insufficient , because " it 's a very small sum that does not cover the salaries . "
He said that a sum of NIS 100 million was necessary every month in order to cover PA salaries .
Clinton , Kouchner discuss Hamas
Earlier in the day Clinton met with French counterpart Bernard Kouchner in Washington , and discussed recent developments in the Middle East .
Kouchner presented a decidedly less stringent position than Clinton 's regarding the conditions under which his country would talk to Hamas .
Speaking at a press conference held after the meeting , Kouchner said he would sit down with Hamas when they themselves sat down with the PLO , accepted the peace process and acknowledged the accords between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and the terms of the Arab peace initiative .
Kouchner 's statements follow a similar stance voiced by Quartet envoy , former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , who emphasized the necessity of Palestinian unity as the basis for any genuine peace process with Israel .
Clinton however reiterated Washington 's far less lenient stance , saying the US would not talk with , or recognize , Hamas until it renounced violence , recognized Israel and agreed to adhere to previous accords .
The secretary is in no rush to conduct her first visit to the Middle East , and today announced she will soon embark on a ten - day trip to Japan , Indonesia , South Korea and China .
Her main goal will be to reach a series of understandings with Beijing , including its position on the Iranian nuclear threat , as well as discussions surrounding the threat of North Korea .

They formed The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust and after nineteen years of incredible effort that locomotive , No. 60163 Tornado , moved under its own power for the first time in 2008 .
This website tells the story of Tornado ’s construction , an amazing tale of cooperation , skill and sheer hard graft which defied the critics who said it could never be done .
The A1 Trust has over 2500 regular supporters ( covenantors ) who have all played some part , small or large , in guaranteeing that we have steam on the main line in the 21st Century .
Tornado is now fulfilling the dream , hauling specials on the mainline and giving joy to thousands of passengers and linesiders who want to witness the legend in action .
You can be part of this by travelling with us or by becoming a covenantor , helping us to raise the funds to keep the dream alive .
At least 47 people were killed and another 93 were injured in a restaurant explosion in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk on Thursday , the last day of the Muslim holiday of the Feast of Sacrifice .
Customer : “ I want a free rental on my account for this movie ! ”
Me : “ Was the movie damaged ?
Did it skip or something ? ”
Customer : “ No , it sucked .
I do n’t want to pay for a bad movie . ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry , ma’am .
But we do n’t give free rentals on account of bad movies . ”
Customer : “ But you people should have told me it was bad ! ”
Me : “ Well , I ’m sorry .
But we do n’t get to see all the movies we have here . ”
Customer : “ I do n’t give a f***.
This does n’t change the fact I want a free movie ! ”
Me : “ Like I said before , we do n’t give free rentals based on bad movies … ” * looks at movie* “… or bad taste . ”
Customer : “ Huh ?
What do you mean ? ”
Me : “ You rented Ninja Cheerleaders .
This would be like me going to a restaurant , ordering a rat on a stick , eating it , and then asking to get the meal free . ”
We conclude , therefore , that , to the extent that gay persons possess some political power , it does not disqualify them from recognition as a quasi - suspect class under the state constitution in view of the pervasive and invidious discrimination to which they historically have been subjected due to an innate personal characteristic that has absolutely no bearing on their ability to perform in or contribute to society .
In sum , the relatively modest political influence that gay persons possess is insufficient to rectify the invidious discrimination to which they have been subjected for so long .
Like the political gains that women had made prior to their recognition as a quasi - suspect class , the political advances that gay persons have attained afford them inadequate protection , standing alone , in view of the deep - seated and pernicious nature of the prejudice and antipathy that they continue to face .
Today , moreover , women have far greater political power than gay persons , yet they continue to be accorded status as a quasi - suspect class . [...]
I 'm also hearing that Connecticut does n't have one of those laws that requires people to be a resident of that state to marry there , meaning that anyone can go there to get married .
Also , Connecticut does n't have a ballot initiative process , meaning that this would have to be turned over at a constitutional convention , which can only happen every 20 years in Connecticut .
Guess when that 20 years comes up ?
Yup , this November , Nutmeggers are going to be asked if they want to have a constitutional convention .
I do n't know how that 's polling now , but I 'll find out .
Update II : A couple more highlights from the decision itself .
The important part :
We conclude that , in light of the history of pernicious discrimination faced by
gay men and lesbians , and because the institution of marriage carries with it a status and significance that the newly created classification of civil unions does not embody , the segregation of heterosexual and homosexual couples into separate institutions constitutes a cognizable harm .
Here 's the court 's analysis of immutability , which is required under CT law to prove that a group is a suspect class :
A number of courts that have considered this factor have rejected the claim that sexual orientation is an immutable characteristic .
28
Other courts , however , as well as many , if not most , scholarly commentators , have reached a contrary conclusion .
29 Although we do not doubt that sexual orientation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- is highly resistant to change , it is not necessary for us to decide whether sexual orientation is immutable in the same way and to the same extent that race , national origin and gender are immutable , because , even if it is not , the plaintiffs nonetheless have established that they fully satisfy this consideration .
Sexual intimacy is ''a sensitive , key relationship of human existence , central to . . . the development of
human personality . . . .''

Theatre I v. Slaton , 413 U.S. 49 , 63 , 93 S. Ct. 2628 , 37 L. Ed. 2d 446 ( 1973 ) .
Thus , the United States Supreme Court has recognized that , because '' the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate , consensual conduct . . . [ represents ] an integral part of human freedom ' ' ; Lawrence v. Texas , supra , 539 U.S. 576-77 ; individual decisions by consenting adults concerning the intimacies of their physical relationships are entitled to constitutional protection .
See id. , 578 .
Indeed , it is indisputable that sexual orientation '' forms a significant part of a person 's identity . ''
Able v. United States , 968 F. Sup. 850 , 863 ( E.D.N.Y. 1997 ) , rev'd on other grounds , 155 F.3d 628 ( 2d Cir. 1998 ) ; see also L. Tribe , supra , § 16 - 33 , p. 1616 ( sexual orientation , whether homosexual or heterosexual , is central to personality of individual ) .
It is equally apparent that , '' [ b ] ecause a person 's sexual orientation is so integral an aspect of one 's identity , it is not appropriate to require a person to repudiate or change his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid discriminatory treatment . ''
In re Marriage Cases , supra , 43 Cal. 4th 842 ; see also Hernandez - Montiel v. Immigration & Naturalization Service , 225 F.3d 1084 , 1093 ( 9th Cir. 2000 ) ( '' [s ] exual orientation and sexual identity . . . are so fundamental to one 's identity that a person should not be required to abandon them ' ' ) ;
Watkins v. United States Army , supra , 875 F.2d 726 ( Norris , J. , concurring in the judgment ) ( '' Scientific proof aside , it [ also ] seems appropriate to ask whether heterosexuals feel capable of changing their sexual orientation .
Would heterosexuals living in a city that passed an ordinance burdening those who engaged in or desired to engage in sex with persons of the opposite sex find it easy not only to abstain from heterosexual activity but also to
shift the object of their sexual desires to persons of the same sex ? . . .
[ T ]he possibility of such a difficult and traumatic change does not make sexual orientation ' mutable ' for equal protection purposes . ''
[ Citations omitted ; emphasis in original . ] ) ; Jantz v. Muci , supra , 759 F. Sup. 1548 ( '' to discriminate against individuals who accept their given sexual orientation and refuse to alter that orientation to conform to societal norms does significant violence to a central and defining character of those individuals ' ' ) .[...]
In other words , gay persons , because they are characterized by a ' ' central , defining [ trait ] of personhood , which may be altered [ if at all ] only at the expense of significant damage to the individual 's sense of self ' ' ; Jantz v. Muci , supra , 759 F. Sup. 1548 ; are no less entitled to consideration as a suspect or quasi - suspect class than any other group that has been deemed to exhibit an immutable characteristic .
See id . ; see also note , supra , 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1303 ( sexual orientation , like race and sex , is '' one of only a handful of characteristics that ha[s ] such a pervasive and profound impact on the [ relevant ] aspects of personhood '' ) .
To decide otherwise
would be to penalize someone for being unable or unwilling to '' change . . . a central aspect of individual and group identity ' ' ; Watkins v. United States Army , supra , 726 ( Norris , J. , concurring in the judgment ) ; a result repugnant '' to the values animating the constitutional
ideal of equal protection of the laws . ''
On the effectiveness of the " traditional marriage " argument :
A classification , however , cannot be maintained merely ' for its own sake ' [ Romer v. Evans , supra , 517 U.S. 635 ] .
Instead , the classification ( [ that is ] , the exclusion of gay [ persons ] from civil marriage ) must advance a state interest that is separate from the classification itself [ see id. , 633 , 635 ] .
Because the ' tradition ' of excluding gay [ persons ] from civil marriage is no different from the classification itself , the exclusion cannot be justified on the basis of ' history . '
Indeed , the justification of ' tradition ' does not explain the classification ; it merely repeats it .
Simply put , a history or tradition of discrimination -- no matter how entrenched -- does not make the discrimination constitutional . . . .'' ( Citation omitted . )
Hernandez v. Robles , supra , 7 N.Y.3d 395 ( Kaye , C. J. , dissenting ) ; cf. Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health , supra , 440 Mass .
348 ( Greaney , J. , concurring ) ( '' [t ] o define the institution of marriage by the characteristics of those to whom it always has been accessible , in order to justify the exclusion of those to whom it never has been accessible , is conclusory and bypasses the core question [ that the court has been ] asked to decide ' ' ) .
Indeed , '' the fact that same - sex couples have traditionally been prohibited from marrying is the reason [ the action challenging the ban on same sex marriage ] was commenced ; it cannot be converted into the dispositive reason it cannot succeed . ''
In re Marriage Cases , supra , 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 750 ( Kline , J. , concurring and dissenting ) .
And the conclusion :
We recognize , as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court did in Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health , supra , 440 Mass. 309 , that '' our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law .
Many people hold deepseated religious , moral , and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman , and that homosexual conduct is immoral .
Many hold equally strong religious , moral , and ethical convictions that same - sex couples are entitled to be married , and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors .
Neither view answers the question before [ the court ] .
Our concern is with [ our state ] [ c] onstitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach . ''
Id. , 312 .
The drafters of our constitution carefully crafted its provisions in general terms , reflecting fundamental principles , knowing that a lasting constitution was needed .
Like the framers of the federal constitution , they also '' knew [ that ] times can blind us to certain truths , and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress .
As the [ c ] onstitution endures , persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom . ''
Lawrence v. Texas , supra , 539 U.S. 579 .
Not long ago , this court made the same essential point , explaining that ''as we engage over time in the interpretation of our state constitution , we must consider the changing needs and expectations of the citizens of our state . ''
State v. Webb , 238 Conn. 389 , 411 , 680 A.2d 147 ( 1996 ) .
This admonition applies no less to the guarantee of equal protection embodied in our constitution than to any other state constitutional provision .
Even though the right to marry is not enumerated in our constitution , it long has been deemed a basic civil right .
E.g. , Loving v. Virginia , supra , 388 U.S. 12 ( ' ' [ m ] arriage is one the basic civil rights of man '' [ internal quotation marks omitted ] ) ; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel .
Williamson , 316 U.S. 535 , 541 , 62 S. Ct. 1110 , 86 L. Ed. 1655 ( 1942 ) ( same ) .
Although we traditionally have viewed that right as limited to a union between a man and a woman , '' if we have learned anything from the significant evolution in the prevailing societal views and official policies toward members of minority races and toward women over the past half - century , it is that even the most familiar and generally accepted of social practices and traditions often mask unfairness and inequality that frequently is not recognized or appreciated by those not directly harmed by those practices or traditions .
It is instructive to recall in this regard that the traditional , well - established legal rules and practices of our not - so - distant past ( 1 ) barred interracial marriage , ( 2 ) upheld the routine exclusion of women from many occupations and official duties , and ( 3 ) considered the relegation of racial minorities to separate and assertedly equivalent public facilities and institutions as constitutionally equal treatment . ''
In re Marriage Cases , supra , 43 Cal. 4th 853-54 .
Like these once prevalent views , our conventional understanding of marriage must yield to a more contemporary appreciation of the rights entitled to constitutional protection .
Interpreting our state constitutional provisions in accordance with firmly established equal protection principles leads inevitably to the conclusion that gay persons are entitled to marry the otherwise qualified same sex partner of their choice .
To decide otherwise would require us to apply one set of constitutional principles to gay persons and another to all others .
83
The guarantee of equal protection under the law , and our obligation to uphold that command , forbids us from doing so .
In accordance with these state constitutional requirements , same sex couples cannot be denied the freedom to marry .

Update III : And the statements are coming in .
The org of the hour , GLAD , which argued the case :
In an historic decision , Connecticut 's Supreme Court ruled today that gay and lesbian couples in the Constitution State deserve marriage .
Not domestic partnerships or civil unions , but full and equal marriage and the respect and security that only marriage provides .
Today 's ruling , in GLAD 's case Kerrigan & Mock et all v. Connecticut Department of Public Health , makes Connecticut the second state in New England -- and the third in the United States -- to swing open the doors to true equality for lesbian and gay couples .
The Task Force :
" This is a momentous victory for the people of Connecticut and all Americans who hold fairness as a fundamental value .
The high court 's analysis comes down to this simple yet profound principle :
All of Connecticut 's families deserve and need the protections , rights and responsibilities that support and sustain them , and should be treated equally under the law .
" We thank the plaintiffs for their courage and our colleagues at Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders and their cooperating counsel for their outstanding advocacy on behalf of our community .
We also applaud the years of work undertaken by our state partner , Love Makes a Family , which played a central role in creating a climate in Connecticut that made today 's historic opinion possible . "
And HRC :
This is a very proud day for Connecticut and a very proud day for every American who believes in the promise of equal rights for all .
The Connecticut Supreme Court recognized that gay and lesbian couples who form committed relationships and loving families deserve the same level of respect afforded to straight couples .
The court did its job by making clear that the state constitution guarantees the same rights and protections for everyone .
This decision strengthens Connecticut families .
We congratulate and commend the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders ( GLAD ) , Love Makes a Family , which worked closely with GLAD on this case , and , of course , the courageous plaintiff couples and their families who looked to the courts to vindicate their rights .
Update IV : Here 's video of the plaintiffs winning .

LINDSAY , ONT .
– John
Tory pressed the reset button on his rocky leadership of the Progressive Conservatives by announcing today he 'd finally cleared a path to return to the Ontario legislature , hoping to quell critics who insist it 's already game over .
Progressive Conservative Laurie Scott will resign her central Ontario seat and take on the job of getting the Opposition ready for the next election , Tory said in Lindsay , about 130 kilometres east of Toronto .
The embattled Conservative leader travelled to Scott 's riding of Haliburton - Kawartha Lakes - Brock – almost 15 months to the day his party suffered one of its worst electoral defeats – to announce she had agreed to step aside so he could run in a byelection .
Tory vowed to do a better job as leader of the party , acknowledging that his " impatience " to get things done may have clouded his judgment at times .
" I think I 'm a stronger leader and wiser leader today than I was two years ago , " he said .
It 's become a common refrain for Tory , whose political missteps during the 2007 provincial election fuelled an open rebellion within his party .
His critics have pointed to his long drawn - out seat search as proof that Tory is too weak and indecisive to lead the party to victory against the reigning Liberals .
His decision to run in Scott 's riding should " eliminate " that concern , said Tory , who acknowledged that the last few months have been difficult for him personally .
" I am determined in my view that my experience , that my hard work , that my honest and straightforward approach is , in the end , going to be found to be what the people feel they need to get this province back on top economically , " he said .
One veteran party member , who asked to remain anonymous , said he thinks " some people will take a wait - and - see view and hope that Tory can turn it around now . "
" But I do n't think it 's going to change a thing , " he added .
Tory said Scott offered to step down in the fall , but he did n't accept until after it became clear Prime Minister Stephen Harper would n't inadvertantly free up a seat in the legislature by giving any of Tory 's 25 caucus members a Senate seat .
Tory refused to say whether he would stay on or resign as leader of the party if he failed to win the byelection , which has not yet been called .
Scott was also tight - lipped on whether she intended to return as a Conservative candidate in the 2011 provincial election , or leave the seat vacant for Tory .
She was first elected in 2003 and easily won re-election in 2007 in the riding that the Conservatives have held since 1994 .
In exchange for giving up her seat , Scott will take on the ``enormous responsibility " of election readiness chair for the party , Tory said .
The NDP were quick to open fire , accusing Tory of pushing one of only seven women in his caucus to quit .
" Leaders are supposed to attract women into politics , not force them out , " said New Democrat Andrea Horwath .

Tory struggled for more than a year to find a riding to contest since losing his ill - fated bid for a Toronto seat in the 2007 election , where he went head - to - head against Education Minister Kathleen Wynne .
His controversial campaign promise to extend public funding to religious schools – and refusal to back off the proposal until the last minute – poisoned the Tories ' chances of defeating the Liberals , leading them to one of their worst showings ever .
Despite calls to resign and a dismal 66.9 per cent approval rating in a leadership vote last February , Tory vowed to stay and learn from his mistakes .
His efforts to unite the party , including the launch of a grassroots policy project , were overshadowed by his inability to find a seat and failed to stamp out lingering resentment within party ranks .
Longtime Conservative Bill Murdoch was kicked out of caucus in the fall for suggesting Tory find another job .
And a group of disgruntled party members are putting forward a proposal at the party 's convention next month that some say is designed to ``humiliate " Tory .
It puts a firm deadline on the amount of time a leader can take to find a seat .
Tory 's next big battle will likely be fought in Scott 's riding , where he 'll have to convince voters – and his party – to give him another chance .
Lindsay resident Charlie Orr , 66 , said he resents that taxpayers will have to foot the hefty bill – up to $ 500,000 – for a byelection just so Tory can find a seat .
" In this economic situation , it is n't right at all , " said Orr , a retired mechanic who worked for the local school board .
" We 're spending half - a- million dollars that we should n't be spending , and we should n't even be having a byelection because this is all nonsense . "
Premier Dalton McGuinty has six months to call a byelection , but has indicated in the past he would move quickly to give
Tory a chance to run for a seat .
Losing your dog in the woods is a dog owner ’s nightmare .
If you are in this situation , you might start to panic as time goes on and your dog is nowhere to be seen .
Fortunately your odds of finding it are good , there are some steps you can take to find your lost dog .
Stop For A Moment
The first thing that people do when they lose their dog is to frantically call for them while moving around .
This is a strategy that you might want to reconsider .
Randomly moving around while calling for your dog is not going to help and you need to stop for a moment .
Collecting yourself is important because it ensures that you are able to calmly plan your next steps .
What you have to do will vary depending on where you are and what you have with you .
If you have been out hiking , you will need to take different steps to when you lost your dog in the woods around your home .
Check Familiar Areas
If there are parts of the woods that you frequent with your pet , you need to head to these areas first .
Your dog may have gone ahead of you to where they assumed you were going .
It is possible that you will find your dog in one of these places .
Walking the trails that are familiar to your pet is also a good idea because there is a better chance that you will find them there .
If you find your dog in these familiar areas , you need to be careful when you approach them .
This is particularly important if your pet has been missing for a number of hours .
Being lost and alone is stressful for your dog and you should not chase them if they start to back away .
This will cause them to run off and you will have to start your search again .
Bring What They Love
If you are close to home , you should get a leash and something that your dog loves .
This can be a treat that has a strong smell that your dog loves or their favorite toy that makes a noise .
Once you have these items , you will need to head into the woods again .
While walking the paths that are familiar to both of you , call your pets name in a happy voice .
If you have a noisy toy , you can make a noise with it as your dog will recognize this .
It is important that you move slowly through the woods as you do this to not confuse your pet .
If you are unable to get back into the woods , you should place some water and the familiar items in a set area .
This could be the parking lot where you left to enter the woods .
Dogs are natural trackers and when they get lost they will often double back on their own trail .
If you are not where their trail ends , they are likely to leave and this will lower your chances of finding them .
Leaving familiar items will keep them in the area for longer so you can reunite with them .
Use Another Dog
If you have another dog or have a friend who has a dog , you can use them to find your lost dog .
Of course , it is best to have a dog that is good at tracking for this task .
Present them with something that has your dogs scent on them and allows their natural tracking abilities to take over .
If you do not have another dog or any friends , there are some dog tracking services that you can use .
These services will generally use bloodhounds to track your dog and help you find them in the woods .
If you are in a state park , the information service might be able to help you as well .
If you have lost your dog in the woods , you need to stay focused , calm and positive .
Your dog will often track its own trail and head back to where you last saw them .
Staying on the paths they are familiar with will also increase the chances of finding them .
If all else fails , you can work with a tracking service that specializes in finding lost dogs .
An often mentioned complaint about Linux is the lack of games .
If you ’re looking for the latest blockbuster from EA , sure , chances are , it wo n’t work with Linux out of the box .
That does n’t mean there are n’t great games out there for you to waste your time on though !
I ’m the type of person who really appreciates the 2d side - scroller / puzzle games though , so I ’m going to limit this article to talking about my favorite 2d games on Linux .
As I only recently discovered , the Debian / Ubuntu repositories have tons of sweet little 2d games .
Here are some of the favorite ones I ’ve found so far …
Sopwith / Airstrike .
In these games , you ’re a little biplane , capable of going up , down , and flipping over .
You can also shoot bullets forward at targets , and launch bombs down that fall in a parabolic trajectory .
Sopwith has very “ retro ” graphics , but that does n’t discredit it in my book .
Airstrike has modern SDL based graphics , but only has a dogfight mode , not a ‘ campaign ’ mode , which I also really enjoy .
Pingus
Pingus is pretty much just a clone of lemmings , but I love it just the same .
Great graphics , and a small community of level - creators makes this game pretty much a lot of fun , that can take you a while to get to the bottom of .
KNetWalk .
This game is a lot like some “ pipes ” or “ railroad ” games , where you have to construct a network of linked objects by rotating connector tiles on a grid .
The twist to this game is that you ’re hooking up computers by rotating the little ethernet cable tiles around .
The Easy mode is pretty trivial , you can solve it in a few seconds , but the Expert mode is pretty tough , requiring you to think about connections that go off the left edge and come back on the corresponding row on the right edge ( for instance ) .
Nibbles .
If you ’re running a Gnome system , there ’s a decent chance that this little game is already on your computer .
It is , in my humble opinion , by far the best game that comes in the default Gnome game pack .
Its what the name says , a classic nibbles clone , but its still a great way to get through a boring lecture … 😀
Visualboy Advance
Alright , you sticklers out there may point out that this is not a 2d game .
I grant you that .
It is , however a gateway to tons of amazing 2d games .
I also have a lot of fun with it , so it gets a mention .
Grab a rom of your favorite old school to GBA game , and get gaming !
( FZero shown )
So I hope this article has introduced you to a few novel games that are ready to go ( on a Debian / Ubuntu system ) .
The debian repository of games like this is pretty big , and there are a lot of games out there that I ’ve yet to try out .
Poke around the “ Games and Amusement ” section in Synaptic , and leave comments if you find anything good ! 😀

Berlin's Massive Jewelry Heist Perfect Genes for a Robbery
Investigations into the spectacular heist at Berlin 's luxury department store KaDeWe have run into a problem :
The suspected robbers may be identical twins .
That means that the traces of DNA found at the crime scene could be useless under German law .

Is it possible to prevent drug addiction altogether ?
Anything is possible , but if you are predisposed genetically to addiction your chances are greater for developing an addiction .

Philip Van Hoof , the developer behind the lightweight Tinymail e-mail framework , has written a plugin for GNOME 's Evolution e-mail client that exposes the application 's functionality through D - Bus .
It is the first step towards creating a standardized D - Bus API for Linux mail clients .
The aim of the project is to provide desktop search and indexing systems like Tracker and Beagle with a more practical and efficient way to extract e-mail metadata .
The current strategy employed by such indexing systems is to parse the raw mbox data files , which can be clumsy and inefficient .
The new D - Bus API will require indexers to register with the e-mail client over D - Bus to receive a notification every time mail data is altered .
According to van Hoof , the D - Bus API is so complete that it could theoretically be use to build a completely external mail client .
This is a big win for desktop automation and it has significant advantages beyond the scope of indexing systems .
It could be used to integrate mail capabilities more tightly into the rest of the desktop stack .
For example , it could be used to build a richer visual notification system that informs users when new messages arrive .
Evolution already provides relatively effective programmatic access to its address book and calendaring capabilities to third - party applications through the Evolution Data Server system and its assorted libraries , but Evolution has never before offered rich externally accessible APIs for interacting with the program 's underlying mail storage .
The current version of van Hoof 's Evolution D - Bus plugin is somewhat coupled with Tracker , which is the indexing system that will be used for the reference implementation .
In the future , however , he plans to turn the D - Bus API into a FreeDesktop.org standard and encourage its adoption by other mail clients and indexing systems .
The D - Bus API and other details about the plugin are documented on the project 's page at the GNOME Live wiki .
For additional information , see van Hoof 's blog entries .
There are concerns that social networking keeps people apart People 's health could be harmed by social networking sites because they reduce levels of face - to - face contact , an expert claims .
Dr Aric Sigman says websites such as Facebook set out to enrich social lives , but end up keeping people apart .
Dr Sigman makes his warning in Biologist , the journal of the Institute of Biology .
A lack of " real " social networking , involving personal interaction , may have biological effects , he suggests .
He also says that evidence suggests that a lack of face - to - face networking could alter the way genes work , upset immune responses , hormone levels , the function of arteries , and influence mental performance .
This , he claims , could increase the risk of health problems as serious as cancer , strokes , heart disease , and dementia .
' Evolutionary mechanism '
Dr Sigman maintains that social networking sites have played a significant role in making people become more isolated .
" Social networking is the internet 's biggest growth area , particular among young children , " he said .
" Social networking sites should allow us to embellish our social lives , but what we find is very different .
The tail is wagging the dog .
These are not tools that enhance , they are tools that displace . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Dr Sigman says that there is research that suggests the number of hours people spend interacting face - to - face has fallen dramatically since 1987 , as the use of electronic media has increased .
And he claims that interacting " in person " has an effect on the body that is not seen when e-mails are written .
" When we are ' really ' with people different things happen , " he said .
" It 's probably an evolutionary mechanism that recognises the benefits of us being together geographically .
" Much of it is n't understood , but there does seem to be a difference between ' real presence ' and the virtual variety . "
Dr Sigman also argues using electronic media undermines people 's social skills and their ability to read body language .
" One of the most pronounced changes in the daily habits of British citizens is a reduction in the number of minutes per day that they interact with another human being , " he said .
" In less than two decades , the number of people saying there is no - one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled . "
Dr Sigman says he is " worried about where this is all leading " .
He added : " It 's not that I 'm old fashioned in terms of new technology , but the purpose of any new technology should be to provide a tool that enhances our lives . "
A selection of your comments to the BBC news website : I agree that I would prefer face to face contact with my friends and family , but as an immigrant to the UK who is separated from so many friends and family far away in another country and as a disabled person with a variable health condition that means that some days I am unable to get out of bed , the internet and social networking is a real life - line for me .
Losing track of old friends can happen so easily .
I 've re-established many friendships this way .
Morgan , Wales
Just a week ago I switched off my Facebook account for just this reason .
These sites claim greater social networking , but all it really creates are more distractions for people , more isolation in front of their computers , more escapism , and a false sense of relationships with other people .
People do not interact with each other properly , becoming more isolated and so more depressed .
Travis , Bochum , Germany I do n't see this at all .
For me , and I think a lot of people with Aspergers and other ADS 's , these sites make it easier to meet people .
If anything you are meeting people who you might never have spoken to without meeting them online first .
Chris , Medway , Kent I can agree with some of this , if you are communicating with your neighbour by facebook then that is a problem .
I live in Norway but I come from New Zealand , with facebook I can really be a part of my friends ' and family 's lives .
I think it 's great , but in moderation .
Simon , Norway I live in a very rural community that unfortunately is seriously lacking in community spirit .
There is very , very little to do and very little social interaction .
I do not drive and I am home with small children .
If it were n't for Facebook I would feel even more isolated from society than I already am .
Facebook reminds me that there are people out there who care about me , even though they may be people I grew up with that live thousands of miles away .
Elizabeth , Shetland I am a full - time wheelchair user and use social networking sites as it is not so easy for me to get out and meet people .
However , I do agree with Dr Sigman and I am often aware of the need to get out and meet people rather than just type away to whoever chooses to read .
I also think the quality of communication is affected ; it 's all gossip and silly comments , hardly anything of substance .
Much better talking to a good friend in confidence , in private , face to face .
It 's more productive and in the long run more meaningful and good for well - being .
Rachel Ellis , Warrington , Cheshire , UK I use most of the social networking sites that there are .
I live in a small village where nobody talks to each other in person .
I 've tried everything to create human interaction and even done a School for Social Entrepreneurs Course to assist me in that but to no avail .
I know that online friends are not the same but I am a single parent and not working .
It is the only social interaction I can get to drive away the loneliness .
When people are not online I miss them .
Shona , Kirkcaldy , Fife I could n't agree more .
I witness my 4 year old son and his 8 year old sister interact wonderfully when playing together , yet they become ' withdrawn ' and subdued when playing solitary electronic games .
Technology should enhance the human experience , but often fails to live up to its brief and actually causes more harm compared to when we did without .
Mark E , Corby , Northamptonshire
I 'm fed up with the number of people telling me I should join facebook .
I have an active social life , I use phone and email to keep in touch and just can't see the point of it all .
If I want to keep in touch with friends I will , if I do n't I wo n't so the argument that you can catch up with people that you have n't seen for years is irrelevant to me .
I even have a couple of friends who only send invites to their parties through facebook !
I 'm not a traditionalist at all , in fact quite the opposite , I just think the social networking fad is all a bit sad , I 'd rather to go out and have fun with real people .
Andrew , London I used to use Facebook quite a lot .
I had a lot of ' friends ' on there .
These were people who I knew ' in real life ' and did n't get a chance to see and speak to regularly , others were people I knew only in passing or as an acquaintance of other friends .
I am not a social butterfly and I find making friends very difficult .
But after some time I realised that I was spending more and more time altering my ' status ' and logging into Facebook , than I was spending with actual real - life friends .
I think the report cited is absolutely correct and there is an issue of people becoming distant from human contact .
I think it is right that scientists are concerned about us becoming isolated from other human beings .
I deactivated my Facebook account because I realised I was spending a lot of time with it which could be better spent elsewhere .
C.A.D , UK
These health effects seems pretty far fetched to me .
I am a retired teacher who loves Facebook .
Surprisingly , I have been in contact with former students I had forty years ago .
It is a wonderful tool .
The health benefits to me have been wonderful .
I am grateful for such services .
Who would have ever thought so many former students would stop by my site and say hello ?
Richard Orndorff , Mason , Ohio , USA I think it brings people together , in a sense that I communicate with people I would n't even be interested to in real life .
I have managed to get invites to social functions more than I did before .
My social scene has in actual fact improved .
Martha , Johannesburg SouthAfrica
The very best friends I have ever had in my life , I met online and this was before the social networking sites came to be .
I 've travelled to visit them and attended one of their weddings .
Anything that helps people make friends is good and not harmful in my opinion .

The Official Google Store which sells a range of Google labelled products does n’t use Google Checkout for credit card processing but instead uses Worldpay .
Google Store uses Oscommerce ( popular open source PHP ecommece store management program ) and free open source plugins are available to integrate google checkout with oscommece in minutes ( eg : http://code.google.com/p/google-checkout-oscommerce/).
I wonder why they cant simply use Google checkout to deal with credit cards on their own site ?
Screenshots
1 ) Google store without Google checkout option for payment .
2 ) Worldpay message when checkout starts .
Another question
OK , now we know that Google store doesnt have Google Checkout support at the moment .
Then how does the store have the google checkout badge on their sponsored listing ?
Try a Google search for “ Google Store ” and you can see the sponsored link has Google checkout badge on it .
NOTE : I love Google and use most of their products .
Just do n’t understand why they cant use their own checkout in their official store .
A bit of pound cake with a brightly iced cookie top .
These cookies are the same size as a mushroom , but taste better and are cuter to boot .
Ingredients for making the mushrooms :
1 cup butter ( two sticks )
1/2 cup pecans ( walnuts or hazelnuts work as well )
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1 3/4 cups all - purpose flour
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
Pound cake ( a frozen loaf is fine )
Black decorator 's gel
Red and green food coloring
White frosting or white fondant
Ingredients for Royal Icing :
1 3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 egg white
The cookies are a slightly less sweet version of the cookie used in the Koopa Shell Cookie .
These cookies hold their shape well , plus they 're darn tasty .
As with all things involving royal icing , there will be long drying times .
If you 'd rather do these recipe in steps , the cookies can be made the day before and stored in an air tight container .
To start off the cookies , beat together the softened butter and sugar until the mixture is fluffy and looks like mayo .
Add the vanilla extract .
Mix in the salt and flour until everything is well combined .
Add the pecans ( or whatever nut suits your fancy ) and stir .
Wrap up the dough in plastic wrap and pop in the fridge for a hour for it to firm up .
Cooling the dough is n't required , but it does make the ball forming a tiny bit easier .
Once you 're ready to bake , preheat oven to 350 °F .
Form into one inch balls and place on a cookie sheet .
They 'll flatten out a tiny bit to give the mushroom top shape .
Bake for about 15 minutes , until the cookies are firm and the bottoms are golden brown .
Allow the cookies to cool .
Creating the bottom part of the mushroom is easy .
Pick out a circular cookie cutter that 's a little smaller than your baked cookies .
Take a slice of pound cake that 's about 1 / 2 " thick and cut out as many pieces as needed .
Cutting the proper length out of the loaf .
Bigger image .
We have the shapes , now we need the colors .
When you 're ready to make the royal icing , beat the egg white and the lemon juice together for a few minutes .
Add the powdered sugar to the mixture until you get a thick icing .
If it 's too thick , add a few drops of water .
Thick royal icing .
Lay down some tin foil and coat the sides of the pound cake pieces with the icing .
If your icing is too thin , add a bit more powdered sugar to the icing mix .
Allow the freshly iced pieces to dry for about an hour .
This next part gets quite messy , so you 'll want a lot of paper towels and a sink nearby !
Divide the reminding icing into two bowls .
Dye one green and one red .
The green icing ready to go !
Dip the cookies into the icing , making sure to get the tops fully colored .
Place the iced cookies on a tin foil sheet .
Do n't worry about the icing run-off from the cookies , we 'll take care of that next .
Allow the cookies to sit for an hour .
After that , move the cookies from their rather - messy location over to a clean sheet of tin foil .
This way the icing run -off wo n't harden to the cookie ( which would lead to rather odd mushroom shapes . )
If the extra edge icing does n't fall off the cookie when you pick it up , knock the edge of the cookie on the counter - top .
The cookies should sit for another 30 minutes to finish hardening , as the icing around the edge of the cookie will still be soft .
To finish the top of the mushroom , draw circles with white frosting or use fondant .
I used tiny balls of fondant and pushed them onto the cookie .
Completed tops .
And to finish the bottom part of the mushroom , draw on eyes with black decorator 's gel .
Whew !
Now to finally put them together !
Take a bottom part of the mushroom , add a little frosting to glue the top part on , and then push on the cookie .
Makes about dozen and half mushrooms .
MOSCOW -
If there was any doubt about who is in charge in Russia , a television phone - in laid them to rest : the Vladimir Putin show is alive and well .
The prime minister , addressed by one young caller as " Uncle Volodya , " showed in a stage - managed question - and - answer session lasting three hours on Thursday that he remains the country 's dominant political force , telling Russians he was there for them in troubled times .
As Putin 's protege President Dmitry Medvedev headed to India on an official visit , Putin took the stage at a conference hall near the Kremlin in a populist format designed to connect with television viewers -- a format Medvedev has so far shied away from .
Putin promised the country would get through current economic difficulties and took questions on everything from relations with the United States to agricultural tariffs and his love of traditional Russian steam baths .
" There can be no doubt about who is in charge , " said Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Moscow - based investment bank Uralsib , saying Putin delivered what looked like a second state - of - the - nation speech weeks after Medvedev 's own one .
Medvedev 's speech in November only fuelled speculation about a possible come - back by Putin to the presidency , as he outlined constitutional changes lengthening presidential terms -- changes subsequently rushed through parliament .
Some 1.5 million calls were made to the Putin call centre and 600,000 text messages were received , according to the mainly state - controlled media .
Highlighting his popular touch , Putin invited one family in Siberia to come to Moscow for New Year celebrations , promised another man help erecting a tomb stone for his father and said he would look into the absence of a knitting circle for children in one town .
In the absence of the kind of ties that bind society together in more democratic countries , Russians " live with the feeling they have nobody else to turn to , " said Maria Lipman , a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre , a research institution .
" Of course , people see him as the man who can solve their problems and make their dreams come true , " she said .
Friday 's newspapers said Putin 's performance was just like old times , with the Vedomosti daily headlining its story " In His Former Role " and Gazeta describing Putin 's reassuring tone in an article headlined " The Lifeline . "
For now , on the international stage Putin 's preferred role seems to be one of a backseat driver .
In Russia 's war with Georgia in August he did not take the lead role in publicly declaring the start or end of hostilities , although subsequent reports showed he was at the heart of the decision - making .
But as he laps up plaudits in the technocratic role of prime minister , many of the policy directions he set as president are proving resilient .
Western threats to isolate Russia as punishment for the Georgia war have borne limited fruit , as Putin himself promised , while the tide of NATO enlargement appears to have been turned back for now .
Russian officials were jubilant this week as NATO foreign ministers declined to offer formal candidacy to ex-Soviet neighbours Georgia and Ukraine .
Putin was even able to observe that the incoming Barack Obama administration in the United States might be thinking twice on missile defence , an area where the outgoing administration 's plans have drawn vehement Russian criticism .
So has Putin won ?
Yevgeny Volk , head of the Washington - based Heritage Foundation 's Moscow office , was sceptical , describing Thursday 's performance as a " tactical win " in terms of Putin 's international goals , saying Russia had not necessarily won its battle of wills with the West .
Lipman of the Carnegie Centre said Putin had advanced his own political goals and was positioning himself for a presidential come - back , possibly in 2012 .
" I think he achieved what he wanted , " she said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Connecticut lawmaker Frank Nicastro sees saving the local newspaper as his duty .
But others think he and his colleagues are setting a worrisome precedent for government involvement in the U.S. press .
Nicastro represents Connecticut ’s 79th assembly district , which includes Bristol , a city of about 61,000 people outside Hartford , the state capital .
Its paper , The Bristol Press , may fold within days , along with The Herald in nearby New Britain .
That is because publisher Journal Register , in danger of being crushed under hundreds of millions of dollars of debt , says it cannot afford to keep them open anymore .
Nicastro and fellow legislators want the papers to survive , and petitioned the state government to do something about it .
“ The media is a vitally important part of America , ” he said , particularly local papers that cover news ignored by big papers and television and radio stations .
To some experts , that sounds like a bailout , a word that resurfaced this year after the U.S. government agreed to give hundreds of billions of dollars to the automobile and financial sectors .
Relying on government help raises ethical questions for the press , whose traditional role has been to operate free from government influence as it tries to hold politicians accountable to the people who elected them .
Even some publishers desperate for help are wary of this route .
Providing government support can muddy that mission , said Paul Janensch , a journalism professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut , and a former reporter and editor .
“ You ca n’t expect a watchdog to bite the hand that feeds it , ” he said .
The state ’s Department of Economic and Community Development is offering tax breaks , training funds , financing opportunities and other incentives for publishers , but not cash .
“ We ’re not saying ‘ Come to Bristol , come to New Britain , we ’ll give you a million dollars , ’ ” Nicastro said .
The lifeline comes as U.S. newspaper publishers such as the New York Times , Tribune and McClatchy deal with falling advertising revenue , fleeing readers and tremendous debt .
Aggravating this extreme change is the world financial crisis .
Publishers have slashed costs , often by firing thousands in a bid to remain healthy and to impress investors .
Any aid to papers could gladden financial stakeholders , said Mike Simonton , an analyst at Fitch Ratings .
“ If governments are able to provide enough incentives to get some potential bidders off the sidelines , that could be a positive for newspaper valuations , ” he said .
NEWSPAPERS ARE DIFFERENT
Many media experts predict that 2009 will be the year that newspapers of all sizes will falter and die , a threat long predicted but rarely taken seriously until the credit crunch blossomed into a full - fledged financial meltdown .
Some papers no longer print daily , and some not at all .
Even as industries deemed too important to fail are seeking bailouts , most newspaper publishers have refused to give serious thought to the idea , though some industry insiders recounted joking about it with other newspaper executives .
“ The whole idea of the First Amendment and separating media and giving them freedom of control from the government is sacrosanct , ” said Digby Solomon , publisher of Tribune Co’s Daily Press in Newport News , Virginia .
Former Miami Herald Editor Tom Fiedler said that a democracy has an obligation to help preserve a free press .
“ I truly believe that no democracy can remain healthy without an equally healthy press , ” said Fiedler , now dean of Boston University ’s College of Communication .
“ Thus it is in democracy ’s interest to support the press in the same sense that the human being does n’t hesitate to take medicine when his or her health is threatened . ”
Connecticut does not see trying to find a buyer and offering tax breaks as exerting influence on the press , said Joan McDonald , the economic development commissioner .
“ It is what we do ... with companies whether it ’s in aerospace , biomedical devices , biotech or financial services , ” she said .
“ If a company is developing laser technology , we do n’t get into the business of what lasers are used for . ”
Connecticut ’s actions are not the first time government has helped newspapers .
The U.S. Postal Service has offered discounted postage rates .
Several cities have papers running under Joint Operating Agreements , created following the congressional Newspaper Preservation
Act of 1970 to keep competing urban dailies viable despite circulation declines .
But the press is not the same as other businesses , said veteran newspaper financial analyst John Morton .
“ You ’re doing something that has a bearing on political life , ” he said .
Marc Levy , executive editor of the Herald and the Press , said he would not let gratitude get in the way of reporting on local political peccadilloes .
“ It ’s the brutal reality , ” he said .
“ You ’d say , ‘ thank you very much for helping me with that , but now we have to ask you about this thing . ’ ”
While it would be easy to dismiss this move by the People ’s Bank of China to inch away from dollar based invoicing , the fact is that the use of other currencies for denominating trade transactions has been on the rise .
We cited this Globe and Mail story back in February :
The chief executive of jewellery giant De Beers SA made waves this week when he suggested the global diamond industry consider pricing the shiny gems in a currency other than the U.S. dollar .
That comment , from the head of the world ’s largest diamond company , is the latest in a string of signs that the greenback ’s glory days could be fading .
A UBS Investment Research report says that while it would be wrong to write off the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency , its roughly 90 - year iron grip on that position is loosening .
“ The use of the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency is in decline , ” said UBS economist Paul Donovan .
“ The market share of the dollar in international transactions is likely to decline over the coming months and years , but only persistent policy error – or considerable fiscal strain – is likely to cause the dollar to lose reserve currency status entirely . ”
The UBS report maintains that the gradual slide of the U.S. dollar is being driven not by the world ’s central banks , but by the private sector , as individual companies increasingly abandon the greenback as their international currency of choice .
“ The private sector ’s use of reserves is more important than official , central bank reserves – anything up to 20 times the significance , depending on interpretation , ” Mr. Donovan said .
“ There is evidence that the move away from the dollar as a private - sector reserve currency has been accelerating since 2000 . ” …
A Financial Times story in March said that Chinese exporters in particular were leery of the greenback :
Rising numbers of Chinese exporters are shunning the US dollar or devising ways to offset the impact of the falling currency as they confront rising labour and raw material costs at home .
According to Alibaba.com , the online company that matches Chinese suppliers with international buyers , the vast majority of their almost 700,000 Chinese suppliers no longer use dollars to settle non-US transactions in order to minimise foreign exchange risk .
So one could read the pending PBoC pilot of a yuan - based trade settlement system as a response to realities on the ground .
But there have also been US reports of far more fundamental discontent with the dollar , per the New York Times in August :
Victor Shih , a specialist in Chinese central banking at Northwestern University , said that when he visited the People ’s Bank of China for a series of meetings this summer , he was surprised by how many officials resented the institution ’s losses [ on dollar assets ] .
He said the officials blamed the United States and believed the controversial assertions set forth in the book “ Currency War , ” a Chinese best seller published a year ago .
The book suggests that the United States deliberately lured China into buying its securities knowing that they would later plunge in value .
“ A lot of policy makers in China , at least midlevel policy makers , believe this , ” Mr. Shih said .
And Reuters reported a more frontal attack in October in an article that appears likely to have been sanctioned :
The United States has plundered global wealth by exploiting the dollar ’s dominance , and the world urgently needs other currencies to take its place , a leading Chinese state newspaper said on Friday .
The front - page commentary in the overseas edition of the People ’s Daily said that Asian and European countries should banish the U.S. dollar from their direct trade relations for a start , relying only on their own currencies …
The People ’s Daily is the official newspaper of China ’s ruling Communist Party .
The Chinese - language overseas edition is a small circulation offshoot of the main paper .
Its pronouncements do not necessarily directly voice leadership views .
But the commentary , as well as recent comments , amount to a growing chorus of Chinese disdain for Washington ’s economic policies and global financial dominance in the wake of the credit crisis .
So seen against this backdrop , the pilot program looks to be part of a more concerted effort to reduce exposure to the dollar , even if it is not very significant in isolation .
From the Shanghai Daily ( hat tip reader Bill ) :
China ’s central bank said yesterday that it plans to implement a pilot program that would settle overseas trade with the Chinese currency instead of the US dollar .
The People ’s Bank of China will expand financial cooperation with overseas economies and “ properly deal with the global financial crisis , ” the central bank said .
“ We ’ll actively join international efforts to tackle the global financial crisis while safeguarding national interests , ” the central bank said …
China will allow the yuan to be used for settlement between Guangdong Province and the Yangtze River Delta , China ’s two economic powerhouses , and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau , according to the central bank .
Meanwhile , exporters in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province in southwestern China will be allowed to use the yuan to settle trade payments with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations .
Those moves are expected to facilitate overseas trade , as Chinese exporters might face losses if they continue to be paid in US dollars , analysts said .
The dollar ’s exchange rate has become more volatile since the global financial crisis began .
The central bank said it will make the exchange rate of the yuan more flexible and keep it “ basically stable on a reasonable , balanced level . ”
There has been speculation that the yuan ’s appreciation will slow down , which would help Chinese exports maintain price advantages in overseas markets .
Note that China has been arguing for a fixed currency regime for some time .
From their perspective , it makes perfect sense .
Currency volatility is a deterrent to trade , since it increases uncertainty .
You cannot get pregnant from fingering yourself , or masturbating .
You get pregnant when a male sperm enters your " vag " and successfully fertilizes an egg ( see links ) .
Masturbation cannot impregnate you , as long as you rr anybody else who touches you down there , has no sperm on their fingers -- though even then the chances of becoming pregnant are very low .
( And I once made the same mistake in thinking that because I masturbated I would surely get pregnant , until some kind folks set me straight on the matter )
President Obama has indicated US policy on Cuba will change The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that should lead to the easing of restrictions on Cuban - Americans wanting to travel to Cuba .
The provisions are part of a spending bill and must pass in the Senate - where it faces some opposition - before it becomes law .
The bill would allow Cuban - Americans to visit Cuba once a year instead of once every three years .
Meanwhile France has sent a former Socialist minister as envoy to Cuba .
Embargo moves HAVE YOUR SAY Democracy without the free will of people defeats even its own definition Muhammad Saeed , Islamabad , Pakistan
The measures announced in the US bill represent a first move in broader efforts to ease the US trade embargo and end travel restrictions for all Americans .
President Obama has said that the trade embargo against Cuba should stay in place as it increases pressure for democratic reforms .
However , under the bill , Cuban Americans should be able to spend $ 170 a day on the island , more than three times the current daily limit of $ 50 .
It also creates a general travel licence for Americans who sell food and medical supplies to Cuba .
As well , it should allow the Cuban authorities to pay for US products once they arrive rather than pay up front before they are sent , a move which some analysts say could boost rice sales to Cuba .
Francisco Hernandez , president of the Cuban American National Foundation , welcomed the news .
" We have been asking for that since the [ travel ] restrictions were put in place , " he said .
" We believe there should be more opportunities for Cuban families to connect . "
But Mr Hernandez and others fear the bill could run into trouble in the Senate .
Florida Republican Senator Mel Martinez opposes the changes and may try to stop the bill .
Rapprochement ?
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has sent Jack Lang , a former culture minister , to Cuba in an effort to strengthen ties with President Raul Castro .
Last year the European Union voted to lift sanctions on Cuba , sanctions which were imposed after the arrest of alleged government opponents in 2003 .
Their removal followed the departure of Fidel Castro , who had ruled Cuba for nearly 50 years , and his replacement by his brother Raul .
" We thought it was the right time to reinvigorate French - Cuban relations , at a time when the European Union has resumed dialogue with Cuba , when Cuba is evolving slowly , too slowly perhaps , when the United States themselves are thinking about their position on Cuba , " an official in the President 's office said of Mr Lang 's trip .
Mr Lang was culture minister in the 1980s , under President Francois Mitterrand , who had close ties with Fidel Castro .

Nadya Suleman has 14 children , including newborn octuplets .
She has no job , no income and owes $ 50,000 in student loans .
Still , the 33 - year - old Whittier woman said she ’s confident that she can afford to raise her huge family , insisting she can do it without welfare .
In an interview Tuesday with NBC , she said she could use student loans to make ends meet until she finishes graduate school and gets a job .
But Suleman faces what are likely to be millions of dollars in medical bills alone , and it ’s increasingly likely that taxpayers will foot many of those bills .
Her family is eligible for large sums of public assistance money .
Even before she gave birth to the octuplets Jan. 26 , Suleman was receiving $ 490 in monthly food stamps , and three of her children were receiving federal supplemental security income because they are disabled .
Advertisement
Lowell Kepke , a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the Social Security Administration , said that a single parent with no income qualifies for up to $ 793 a month for each child with a physical or mental condition that results in “ marked or severe functional limitations . ”
That money is used for support and maintenance of the family , and Suleman would not be required to specifically account for how it is spent .
If Suleman ’s disabled children received the maximum payment , she would get nearly $ 2,900 a month in state and federal assistance , including the food stamps .
Suleman ’s octuplets qualify for Medi-Cal , California ’s healthcare program for the poor .
Three sources told The Times that Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower had requested reimbursement for care of the eight premature infants .
Reimbursement rates for the octuplets were not immediately available .
However , 2007 records show that Southern California hospitals received an average of $ 1,198 per day , per patient .

Tony Cava , a spokesman for the California Department of Health Care Services , said that for a baby in a hospital ’s neonatal intensive care unit , that amount would probably increase .
Using the 2007 average as a low estimate , Kaiser would be eligible for a combined $ 9,584 per day in Medi-Cal reimbursement .
The babies , who are 16 days old , have already racked up a conservative $ 153,344 in Medi-Cal costs , not including their delivery .
Kaiser doctors have said they will remain hospitalized for seven to 12 weeks .
If they stay for seven weeks , the cost would be $ 469,616 .
If they stay 12 weeks , the cost would be $ 805,056 .
Kaiser gathered 46 doctors , nurses and other medical professionals together to perform the delivery .
It ’s unclear how much that cost and who will pay .
Suleman told NBC that she planned to go back to Cal State Fullerton , where she is earning a master ’s degree in counseling .
Once she receives the degree , she said , she will get a job and be able to financially support the children .

Suleman used to work as a psychiatric technician at Metropolitan State Hospital , where she suffered an injury in 1999 .
During a riot involving 20 people , a patient overturned a heavy wooden desk on her back .
After the incident , Suleman only briefly returned to work and she continued to experience ongoing back problems from a herniated disc .
Between 2000 and 2008 , she received $ 169,353 in temporary disability payments , a workers ’ compensation spokeswoman said .
Her workers ’ compensation file , obtained by The Times , indicates that a doctor hired by the state to evaluate her believes she is now eligible for permanent disability .
The state stopped making temporary disability payments Aug. 28 .
But the records show that she would receive payment for permanent disability .
State officials said no determination has been made yet about the amount or duration of her payments .
Suleman insisted to NBC’s Ann Curry in an interview taped Tuesday that she ’s not seeking a public handout .

“ I ’m not living off any taxpayer money , ” she said .
“ If I am , if it ’s food stamps , it ’s a temporary resource .
And I was so reluctant .
I very much so look forward to the day when I am not getting any kind of help with food stamps , which I believe will end when I graduate in about a year or year and a half . ”
Suleman also said she hopes that two of her children will soon no longer be disabled .
She said she has $ 50,000 in student loans that she will eventually have to repay .
Suleman also bristled at suggestions made by some commentators that she was being irresponsible for having so many children with no income or partner to help raise them .

“ No .
I am not being selfish .
. . .
If I were just sitting down watching TV and not being as determined as I am to succeed and provide a better future for my children , I believe that would be considered to a certain degree selfish , ” she said .
Suleman said she was married once .
But the relationship ended when she realized “ that I was n’t in love at all with him .
I was in love with having children . ”
Suleman ’s ex-husband , Marcos Gutierrez , a produce manager at a salad company , declined to comment extensively about his ex-wife but said she ’s a good person .
“ Nadya , she is a person with a great heart .
. . .
She ’s a nice person , with great love for her kids .
That ’s all I have to say , ” he said .

Meanwhile , medical experts continued to question Dr. Michael Kamrava , the fertility specialist believed to have treated Suleman .
Although she did not mention him directly , she named his West Coast IVF Clinic in Beverly Hills as the place where she sought treatment .
Dr. R. Dale McClure , president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine , said the association has contacted both Suleman and Kamrava to learn more about the circumstances leading to her pregnancy .
“ Only when we obtain and evaluate such information will we be able to determine an appropriate course of action , ” McClure said .
As for Suleman , she told NBC that she does n’t plan any more children .
“ 100 % . 200 , 300 400 % .
Yes , done , ” she said .

Amazon 's Kindle 2 has not been in consumer hands for 24 hours , and already it 's been torn apart to show every conceivable mystery that could be contained under the e-ink display .
i Fixit disassembled the device today and found an empty outline of a SIM card on the left side of the logic board .
Also identified among the guts of the Kindle 2 was its 532 MHz ARM - 11 processor , 32MB of Samsung DDR , and the 2GB Samsung moviNAND flash memory .
A SIM reader will likely be included in Kindle 2 builds destined for overseas markets , where it will simplify wireless connectivity .

That guy got owned by the President !
The conflict in DR Congo is said to stem from Rwanda 's 1994 genocide Congolese soldiers have been accused of barring UN troops and aid staff from an area where an operation with Rwandan troops is ongoing on a Hutu militia .
A UN spokesman in the Democratic Republic of Congo told the BBC it was " deplorable " , when so many displaced people were in desperate need of help .
At least 3,000 Rwandan troops have crossed the border for the joint push on Rwandan FDLR fighters since Tuesday .
The rebel group 's leaders have been linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide .
DR Congo and Rwanda agreed last month to take joint action against the Hutu rebels of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR ) , which is estimated to be more than 6,000 - strong .

The BBC's Thomas Fessy in the Congolese capital , Kinshasa , says hundreds more Rwandan troops entered North Kivu province on Wednesday , according to UN sources , following the 2,000 who crossed over the day before .

Our correspondent says there has been no fighting reported so far as both armies appear to be still making preparations .
Some troops are heading towards Rutshuru , 70 km ( 45 miles ) north of Goma , and others have been deployed near the strategic town of Sake , 30 km ( 12 miles ) west of the provincial capital .
The UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( Monuc ) said its peacekeepers and aid workers had been blocked by Congolese troops at checkpoints north of Goma .
Monuc military spokesman Lt Col Jean Paul Dietrich told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme they had protested to the Congolese authorities .
" We 've just tried to negotiate since yesterday that our force should have the [ access ] guarantee , " he said .
" Not only for us , the Monuc force , but as well all humanitarian [ agencies ] desperately need to get to those IDPs [ internally displaced persons ] in those areas .
" And so far it seems that the blockade cannot be lifted and we deplore that and we cannot accept that .
We will continue to keep up pressure . "
AFP news agency reported that a convoy of Indian UN peacekeepers and a Red Cross vehicle had been turned away .
The Congolese authorities have said the operation to flush out the FLDR would last between 10 and 15 days , but Lt Col Dietrich said this would be a " very challenging task " in such a short timeframe .
' Simply grave ' Congolese President Joseph Kabila has reportedly come under fire for not informing parliament about the invitation to Rwandan troops .
" If what I 'm told is true , it 's quite simply grave .
It raises lots of questions , " parliamentary speaker Vital Kamerhe told the UN - run Radio Okapi .
The UN and aid agencies have raised concerns about the threat posed to civilians on the ground .
Some 250,000 people have been displaced since last August alone Rwanda twice invaded its much larger neighbour during the 1990s , saying it was pursuing the FDLR .
But analysts say much of the fighting is also linked to eastern DR Congo 's rich mineral resources , which all sides have been accused of plundering .
Action against the Hutu fighters has been a key demand of the Congolese Tutsi rebel CNDP ( National Congress for the Defence of the People ) , which declared a ceasefire last week .
The CNDP , which seized swathes of territory last year , has offered to join Congolese government troops in fighting the FDLR .
Our correspondent says the CNDP may well be part of the operation , but no details have been given about how they could be integrated to the Congolese army .
On - and - off fighting involving the CNDP , FDLR , the army and pro-government militias has forced more than one million people in North Kivu to flee their homes since late 2006 .
Before last month 's deal was signed , the UN accused Rwanda and DR Congo of fighting a proxy war in the region - with Rwanda backing Gen Nkunda and DR Congo of working with the FDLR .

Sleeping Baby Trapped in a Hot Car
What do you do if you see a child trapped in a car on a hot day ?
Feb. 2 , 2009  --
Imagine walking down a busy street and suddenly hearing a cry coming from a parked car .
When you look closer , you spot a baby in the backseat and notice that all the windows are closed .
It 's a hot summer day and the parents are nowhere to be found .
What do you do ?
Tragically , every year almost 40 children die from hyperthermia after being left alone in a hot car .
But many more kids are saved when strangers come to their rescue .
ABC's " What Would You Do ? " wanted to see what ordinary people would do if they came upon a baby left alone in the backseat on a hot summer day .
For our ABC News experiment we parked a car on a busy suburban street for two days .
Inside , we left a lifelike doll called a " reborn , " made to look like a newborn infant .
The doll 's battery - operated breathing mechanism made it all the more convincing .
We hired an actress to play the baby 's mother and , with the help of a dozen surveillance cameras , watched the action from a nearby building .
Janette Fennell , president of Kids and Cars , a group that promotes car safety for children , watched as the footage unfolded .
What we learned both surprised and alarmed us .
10 Minutes Is All It Takes
Initially we left the baby in the car with the windows rolled up .
To someone passing by , it looked as if the child were sleeping .
We sat and waited for more than half an hour , but nobody seemed to notice the baby in the backseat .
According to Fennell , almost 50 percent of kids who are left in cars by accident are usually forgotten by their caretakers while asleep .
The only hope for these kids is if a stranger notices them inside .
But during the first part of our experiment , nobody seemed to look inside our car , and the baby went unnoticed .
We decided it was time for our baby to attract some attention .
We placed a small speaker in the front seat of the car , propped open the sunroof and played the sound of a newborn wailing as people passed by .
We were surprised to see that many were still oblivious .
People seemed too busy to notice , many listening to their iPods or using their cell phones .
Meanwhile , our car was getting hotter and hotter .
Before the experiment , we installed a thermometer to measure the temperature inside our vehicle .
Although the temperature outside did n't rise much above 80 degrees , our car heated up to almost 120 degrees .
" It does n't have to be hot outside for a child to die in a car , " said Jan Null , professor of Meteorology at San Francisco State University .
" Last year a child died in a car when it was 66 degrees outside . "
Heat in a Car
" An infant can die in a car in as little as 10 minutes , " he said .
" Their bodies heat up three times as fast as an adult 's body temperature .
So in a situation where an adult would be fine , but uncomfortable , a baby would not . "
Assumptions and Hesitation
As we kept watching , we noticed that many people heard the sound of our baby crying and still kept walking .
We asked Joanne Bowman , a mother herself , why she did n't stop .
" You just assume that someone is in the car with the child , " she told us .
" It is really something you would imagine not happening .
You do n't imagine that there 's a child left by itself . "
When teenager Mandy Strenz walked passed the baby , she was clearly disturbed .
But she walked on .
She told us that she did n't want to touch somebody else 's car , and that she was n't quite sure what to do .
She said she was planning to call her mother for advice .
Fennell said people are afraid to break the car window because they may be liable , but if they see that a baby is in trouble , they may need to do just that .
" The first thing I would do is look around and see if there 's any parents , and then I would call 911 , " she told us .
" But if you are looking and the child looks like they are in imminent danger , I would break the window that 's farthest away from the baby .
It 's a piece of metal versus a baby 's life . "
Skepticism and Anger Over Baby Left Behind
As our experiment continued , we came across one man who seemed to know exactly what to do .
As soon as Joe Alferi noticed the crying baby , he tried to open the car 's doors .
When that did n't work he called 911 , without hesitation .
But the police were not coming because they were in on our experiment .
When we told Joe what we were up to , we were surprised to find out that he was a police officer , well aware of the dangers of leaving a child alone in a hot car .
But you do n't have to be a police officer to do the right thing .
Vicky Lefkowitz did a double - take when she saw the baby and she called 911 right away .
We wanted to see what Lefkowitz would do when the mother returned , and so we sent our actress to get something out of the car .
" Do you always leave your baby sleeping in the car ? " Lefkowitz asked politely .
" I 'm a mother , and I would never do that in a million years . "
As she walked away she was clearly shaken and in tears .
" I have a baby and I would never do that , " Lefkowitz told ABC News correspondent John Quinones .
" How could I not get involved ? "
As the day went on , more and more people came to the baby 's rescue .
Similar to Lefkowitz , most were polite to the baby 's " mother . "
But Vinnie Torres handled the situation differently .
" You should be shot , " he yelled at the mother when she returned to the car .
Torres later told us that he works with young children and he was outraged by the mother 's actions .
Throughout our experiment , most people left the scene when the mother returned to her car .
But when Amy Edelman got involved , she made sure the mother knew how she felt .
" That 's totally irresponsible , " she told the mother .
" You should n't have that baby . "
She and another passerby called the police , and were surprised when ABC 's cameras arrived instead .
Edelman told ABC
News that it 's just not part of her makeup to walk away , and that she was about to " take the baby home with her . "
After two days of filming we learned that while many people were simply too busy or distracted to notice a sleeping baby , many others simply did n't know what to do once they spotted our child .
Many of those who did act said that they had seen news reports and knew about the dangers of leaving children in locked cars .
Those who came to the rescue and called the police did what one should do in the situation , said Fennell .
She hopes that our experiment will " empower people to understand , that when you see a child in distress you do n't walk the other way .
You get involved and you do whatever it takes to make sure that the child is safe . "

Oh dear Mr Burnham - you surely cannot have expected a little light musing in the Daily Telegraph to have turned you into the blogosphere 's Public Enemy Number One ?
On Saturday the culture secretary gave one of those broad - ranging interviews to a national newspaper which eager politicians are wont to do at this time of year .
The problem was , he threw into the mix , along with some hints about how Channel 4 might be funded , some thoughts on ways of regulating the internet .
There was vague talk of " cinema - style , age - ratings for websites " , mutterings about ISPs being forced to provide child - safe services , and of negotiations with the incoming Obama administration on new international rules for English - language websites .
When I heard about this on Saturday morning 's radio news bulletin , my first thought was that a web storm was about to break over his head , and so it has proved .
He has been attacked , abused , and mocked for days now - and one blogger went so far as to set up a Twitter account in his name in an attempt , he says , to educate him about just how the internet works .
The Twitter administrators have now deleted the account .
A couple of things strike me .
First , yes , Andy Burnham 's suggestion that Britain and the US could get together and impose some sort of web code does beg all sorts of questions .
Who would decide what was permissible ?
How would trillions of constantly changing websites be policed ?
How would it work with existing ratings schemes such as PICS , set up by the W3C consortium ?
And is n't it up to parents , not the state , to watch over the way their children use the web ?
Then again perhaps the blogosphere is underestimating the subtlety of Mr Burnham 's approach .
After all , it was unlikely to have been the primary audience he had in mind when he made his remarks to the Telegraph .
He may be betting that millions of parents share his concerns , and sense of helplessness about the web .
He is also probably correct in thinking that governments are more able these days to apply pressure on both ISPs and on major web international brands than web libertarians would like to think .
So , for instance , suggesting industry - wide " take - down " times for sites like YouTube and Facebook to remove offensive material may not actually be as naïve as the blogosphere believes .
Whether more regulation of the internet is actually a good thing is of course another matter , and of course one on which the BBC has no opinion whatsoever !
But perhaps we all need to move on .
Mr Burnham could explain more clearly exactly what he has in mind in terms of producing a safer web - and his online opponents could explain , probably in less sarcastic language , just why they think those proposals would not work , and whether there is any role for government here .
The culture secretary 's web - savvy colleague Tom Watson has used his blog to invite views on Mr Burnham 's " cinema - style ratings plan " , and promises to forward them , but that is a bit of a one - way process , not the conversation that the blogosphere prefers .
So here is an invitation , Mr B .
Why not come on to " dot.life " and start a dialogue with those critics who believe you just do n't understand the web ?
You would be very welcome - as would anyone else with views on this matter .
LAKELAND , Fla . --
" I have n't seen shoes like this in 25 years , " marvels Jim McFarland .
The narrow hall of his small shoe - repair shop is piled high with reheeled stilettos , resoled boots and polished oxfords .
Mr. McFarland , a third - generation cobbler , is riding a shoe - repair boom .
Since mid-November , he has been juggling roughly 275 repair jobs a week -- about 50 % more than usual .
" I 'm so busy right now it 's unbelievable , " he says .
The recession is battering big swaths of the U.S. economy , but it 's given a new lease on life to the tiny shoe - repair industry , which has been shrinking for decades .
Nationwide , cobblers and their suppliers report markedly higher revenues than a year ago , as newly frugal Americans opt to repair their shoes rather than replace them .
" Our business is very , very strong in an industry that has been depressed and declining for many years , " says Lee Efronson , owner of Miami Leather Co. , a wholesaler of shoe - care products to cobblers since 1959 .
In assorted nooks of the national economy , the recession has provided a welcome jolt .
Résumé writers have seen an upsurge in business from customers looking for jobs .
Auto mechanics say they are getting busier keeping old cars on the road .
And employment lawyers are picking up clients swept up in the waves of layoffs .

Update 2 : Elastic Load Balancer and EC2 instance bandwidth .
It turns out we are limited by bandwidth and not by CPU .
Solution : use DNS Round Robin for two to three HighCPU medium instances .
Update : The Skinny Straw : Cloud Computing 's Bottleneck and How to Address It .
For cloud computing , bandwidth to and from the cloud provider is a bottleneck .
Solution : Evaluate application architecture and consider application partitioning .
I 'm writing this post as a sort of penance .
My sin was getting involved in another mutli - threaded mess of a program that was rife with strange pauses and unexpected errors .
I really should have known better .
But when APIs choose to make callbacks from some mystery thread pool it's hard to keep things straight .
I eventually sobered up and posted all events to a queue so I could make sure the program would work correctly .
Doh .
I may never know why the .
Net console output stopped working , but I 'll live with it .
And that reminded me that I 've been meaning to write a post on the standard Cloud Architecture .
I 've tried to hit all the common architectures at one time or another , but there have been some excellent sources lately on structuring programs in a cloud that people may " know " in the same way I knew what not to do , but when the code hits the editor those thoughts may have hidden like a kid next to a broken cookie jar .
The easiest way to create a scalable service is to compose the service from other scalable services .
This is how Google AppEngine works and is largely how AWS works as well ( EC2 , S3 , SQS , SimpleDB , etc ) , though AWS also functions as a blank canvas on which you can draw your own designs .
The canonical cloud architecture that has evolved revolves around dynamically scalable CPUs consuming asynchronous , persistently queued events .
We talked about this idea already in Flickr - Do the Essential Work Up - front and Queue the Rest .
The cloud is just another way of implementing the same idea .
Amazon suggests a few applications of the Cloud Architecture as :
Processing Pipelines
- Document processing pipelines – convert hundreds of thousands of documents from Microsoft Word to PDF , OCR millions of pages / images into raw searchable text
- Image processing pipelines – create thumbnails or low resolution variants of an image , resize millions of images
- Video transcoding pipelines – transcode AVI to MPEG movies
- Indexing – create an index of web crawl data
- Data mining – perform search over millions of records
Batch Processing Systems
- Back - office applications ( in financial , insurance or retail sectors )
- Log analysis – analyze and generate daily / weekly reports
- Nightly builds – perform nightly automated builds of source code repository every night in parallel
- Automated Unit Testing and Deployment Testing – Test and deploy and perform automated unit testing ( functional , load , quality ) on different deployment configurations every night
Websites
- Websites that “ sleep ” at night and auto - scale during the day
- Instant Websites – websites for conferences or events ( Super Bowl , sports tournaments )
- Promotion websites
- “ Seasonal Websites ” - websites that only run during the tax season or the holiday season ( “ Black Friday ” or Christmas )
A good list , but after having worked on a seasonal website for taxes AWS is a horrible match .
AWS only works on the instance level , so you need a whole instance turned on all the time even when there 's no demand .
This is a complete waste of money .
An AWS model truly based on use combined with an SLA driven dashboard would be very convenient .
But on to cases where AWS is a good fit .
SmugMug 's Cloud Architecture AWS pioneer Don MacAskill of SmugMug details how they process high - resolution photos and high - definition video use a cloud hosted queuing architecture in SkyNet Lives ! ( aka EC2 @ SmugMug ) .
SkyNet , as you might expect , operates completely without human minders and automatically scales up and down in relation to the work load .
Their system has several components :
Work Initiators -
Work comes in from your website and / or other software subsystems and is queued up for processing in the Queue Service .
Work does n't have to be large requests either .
Work can be small independent parts of an overall pipeline .
Do n't keep state in the Workers .
Bundle what you need done into a work request in shoot back into the Queuing Service for processing .
Provisioning Service -
This is Amazon 's infrastructure that allows instances to be automatically scaled up and down in relation to the work load .
This will be the major difference between your VPS or typical datacenter setup .
There 's an API for starting and stopping AMIs and
mechanisms for automatically configuring and running VMs .
Workers -
These are the guys that continually pull work off queues and do something interesting with it .
For SmugMug the results are stored on S3 but the results could be put in your own database , SimpleDB or whatever .
Queuing Service -
This is where work is queued for consumption by the workers .
SmugMug built their own queuing service , but you could just as easily use Amazon 's own SQS .
Creating a scalable , distributed , performant , highly available queue service is not easy , so you may want to take a look at a number of different queue product suggestions in Flickr - Do the Essential Work Up - front and Queue the Rest .
Controller -
This component monitors many variables related to the work flow and decides how many instances of EC2 are necessary based on optimizing a small set of goals .
Instances are add and removed as needed .
Don shares a lot of practical detailia on how to efficiently use AWS , how their queue service works , and how their controller manages to balances minimizing cost while still being responsive to users .
Achieving fairness and balance in a queue system can be difficult , but SmugMug appears to have done a good job of that .
What rocks about queuing architectures is that they are just so damn robust .
Work is safe in the queues .
A random reboot wo n't cause a loss .
If one component is producing events too fast the queue will buffer up events until they can be processed .
New components can be cleanly added and removed from the system at any time .
Timing is n't critical .
Work is processed when someone gets around to it .
Timeouts and retries are unnecessary .
Programs are simple loops that block on the queue , do something , persist results , and feed back more parallelizable work requests back into the queue .
Very hard to screw up .
Compare and contrast to complex multi- threaded system with shared - state .
Building GrepTheWeb in the Cloud Amazon has published a great couple of articles on building a canonical Cloud Architecture : Building GrepTheWeb in the Cloud , Part 1 : Cloud Architectures and Building GrepTheWeb in the Cloud , Part 2 : Best Practices .
These are really tight and well written articles so I 'll just hit certain high points .
The example used is an application called GrepTheWeb .
GrepTheWeb searches using a regular expression across millions of web documents .
So it 's a grep for the web , ah got it now .
The idea is to take an unpredictable but possibly large number of search requests , apply the search expression to hundreds of terabytes of documents , and return the results in a reasonable period of time .
How exactly would you do such a thing ?
Here 's how you do it in the cloud :
Amazon S3 for retrieving input datasets and for storing the output dataset
Amazon SQS for durably buffering requests acting as a “ glue ” between controllers
Amazon SimpleDB for storing intermediate status , log , and for user data about tasks
Amazon EC2 for running a large distributed processing Hadoop cluster on - demand
Hadoop for distributed processing , automatic parallelization , and job scheduling
Clearly these are all ( except for Hadoop ) built on Amazon services , but the general ideas apply anywhere .
For storing large amounts of data and accessing it efficiently in parallel you need a distributed file system like S3 .
To coordinate and dispatch work you need a queuing service like SQS .
For keeping intermediate state you need a scalable database store like SimpleDB , though you could also imagine using S3 .
For dynamically scaling processing nodes something like EC2 is necessary .
And for actually carrying out the document search a framework like Hadoop provides a lot of features , though you can imagine using other compute grid products .
Here 's their fabulous picture of what the system looks like :
All the parts and linkages are described in the paper .
What 's important to note is that even though there are a lot of independently moving parts all the boundaries are clear and well described .
In your typical program few will have any idea how it works .
Using Cloud Architecture principles it 's possible to create a system which both scales and easy to understand and explain .
The paper makes several key architectural recommendations :
Use Scalable Ingredients -
Ensure that your application is scalable by designing each component to be scalable on its own .
If every component implements a service interface , responsible for its own scalability in all appropriate dimensions , then the overall system will have a scalable base .
Have Loosely Coupled Systems -
For better manageability and high - availability , make sure that your components are loosely coupled .
The key is to build components without having tight dependencies between each other , so that if one component were to die ( fail ) , sleep ( not respond ) or remain busy ( slow to respond ) for some reason , the other components in the system are built so as to continue to work as if no failure is happening .
Think Parallel - Implement parallelization for better use of the infrastructure and for performance .
Distributing the tasks on multiple machines , multithreading your requests and effective aggregation of results obtained in parallel are some of the techniques that help exploit the infrastructure .
Utilize On - Demand Requisition and Relinquishment - After designing the basic functionality , ask the question “ What if this fails ? ”
Use techniques and approaches that will ensure resilience .
If any component fails ( and failures happen all the time ) , the system should automatically alert , failover , and re-sync back to the “ last known state ” as if nothing had failed .
It is beyond me to describe everything I felt when our son killed himself last summer .
But one thing that tormented me was that , although I longed to empty my heart with a flood of tears , I could n't cry .
I 'm 60 , so perhaps it 's just another of those secretions that dry up with age .
I hated the way I could contort my face in private into an expression of the agony I felt , with no effect except a slight moistening along my lower lids , and then a second later rearrange my features and turn dry - eyed to the world again as if nothing had happened .
It made me feel my grief was n't real .
So after a week or two I bought a small plastic tube of tiny metallic stars .
I tipped the contents out , and began an eccentric bedtime ritual .
Every night I wept what little I could into the empty transparent tube .
I felt I owed Andrew these tears and I planned that when the tube became full I would pour it on the stump in the garden where he'd sawn down a tree for us a month before his death .
It would be my offering to him .
I would sit on the bed holding the tube , and deliberately remember the policewoman coming to the door , my voice asking , " Is he alive ? " and her grave , silent stare in reply .
That memory was enough to produce the faintest lip of liquid inside the rim of the tube , hardly more than a silver line , but something .
I 'd force myself to remember seeing him , lying under the red sheet .
He was cold and iron - hard and the shock of realising that he , himself had changed his lovely , warm , breathing body into this terrible thing could coax out a tear .
Gradually , what had started as the merest frosting on the inside of the tube started to coalesce into drops .
He had left us no suicide note , but two days after he died in August , we collected his belongings from his home and found a box of letters to his ex-girlfriend .
In his small , neat handwriting , most ended " Loves ya babe ! " .
But one stood out .
The one in which he explained that his " little man " would n't do what he wanted it to , and her reply , wondering if it was her fault , and what she could do to help .
Shocked , I had phoned her , hoping to hear that things had got better eventually , but she said no .
In the four years they had been together they had never had full sex .
This I could not bear to think of .
How cruel it must have been for them both , how good she had been to stay so long .
And poor , poor Andrew .
The thought of him trying and failing , and keeping it secret , never having the sense to go to the doctor , was a sharp stab .
How could I never have guessed , why did I never ask ?
Memories of conversations came back , when he was trying to speak of sex , but was blocked by my obvious embarrassment .
Why had n't I realised that his only reason for raising the subject would be that he needed help ?
Days later , my sister discovered research on the internet that suggested his impotence could have been caused by a terrible head injury he had suffered when he was seven and fell out of a tree .
She discovered that about a third of traumatic brain injury survivors suffer damage to the pituitary gland , which can cause impotence and depression .
It is under - diagnosed , but treatable .
To us the information was electrifying .
We felt that if we had only known , we could have saved him .
Also , if he had known there was even a chance that his fall had caused this it would have spurred him to go to a doctor .
If I felt so inadequate because I could n't express my grief , how must he have felt , when he could n't express his love ?
I thought of him with all his happiness and confidence destroyed from inside , hiding his despair behind that fatally jaunty facade .
Yet in the end he had said nothing .
As the months passed the tear - level mounted slowly , a whole centimetre now , almost reaching the label .
Crying seemed to come more easily .
It was not just the loss , it was that I 'd misunderstood him so harshly .
I had been impatient that , five years after his girlfriend had left him , he still had n't moved on .
I had thought him sentimental and over - romantic .
I 'd wanted him to be tougher , and he must have felt my lack of sympathy .
But how could he move on , with this miserable secret ?
He must have wondered who would accept him .
When I really wanted to cry , I thought about his laptop .
The police had taken it away when his body was found in his home and did not release it to us until November .
On it , we found his emails , which told two stories .
The story we knew , of his busy social life filled with friends ' weddings , visits home , digging sessions at the allotment with his friends , the triathlon he had done for work and the kayaking course .
And , in parallel , the other story of how he was slowly sucked towards death .
To our dismay , we discovered that he had ordered a suicide manual seven weeks before he died .
Ten days later a Paypal entry shows him buying some of the equipment he needed , then some extra bits the week after that .
There are the emails to his understanding boss ( who knew about his depression when we did n't ) saying that he'd had a bad night and did n't feel he could come in .
Emails to the counsellor we did n't know he was seeing .
An email to his ex-girlfriend , apologising for the depression that had spoiled their relationship .
The time - delayed emails he sent on the day he died to the police , his boss , his friends .
( " The responsibility , guilt , weakness and shame rests entirely with me .
I am who I am and I can't change that . " )
I 'd review this whole sequence and it would be like watching him slowly falling away from me , as if he were behind glass and me powerless to help him .
I do not believe that he completely wanted to die .
Why would he have had the counselling ?
I wanted to smash through the glass to this past Andrew , to take him in my arms and comfort him , to tell him how much I loved and respected him , how brave I knew he had been , say all the things that might have helped if I had said them at the time .
In the meantime I made progress with my tube .
The level of liquid rose to almost a third full .
But then , one bad night when I could n't sleep for the barrage of sad thoughts , I felt big fat tears coming .
As I flailed to switch on the lamp and grab my tube , I spilled the whole thing down my front .
Four months ' crying became a wet patch on my pyjamas , roughly over my heart .
I have started again , more cautiously .
But I discovered from the optician that some " floaters " I 'd developed were probably the result of jabbing a hard object against my eye .
I think maybe I shan't be able to fill the tube after all .
It has all been a silly game with myself .
Andrew does n't know how I feel , he does n't know how old my face has become , how my left frown - line has deepened since August , how his father and sisters and friends miss him , how his empty house that he was once so proud of grows daily danker , darker and more desolate .
The only thing that has given me any comfort since is a dream .
I had gone in to where Andrew was sleeping with his face turned away , to try to wake him up .
I sat on his bed and stroked his warm head .
Afterwards , even when I woke up , I had the feeling of his hair under my hand , and his hard head below , still ridged from where it was fractured 24 years ago .

Massively reports that an EVE
Online player - versus - player tournament match this weekend was upset by an assassination attempt , in which an infiltrator destroyed his own team leader 's ship .
Warfare in EVE
Online is a political , no - holds - barred affair , which is why developer CCP hosts a PVP Tournament to allow player alliances to test their strength against each other on a level playing field .
However , a player going by the handle Happy Joymaker changed all that when he turned his weapons on the leader of his own team , Issler Dainze of an alliance called The Honda Accord , before self - destructing .
Happy Joymaker turned out to be an agent of another alliance , The Dead Parrot Shoppe Inc .
Apparently the assassination was motivated by a personal grudge and intended to be a public humiliation of Dainze , rather than an attempt to sabotage the chances of The Honda Accord in the tournament .
Just as well , since The Honda Accord went on to win the match regardless , as you can see from the match report and video footage .
The victim of the attack seems quite happy with the extra attention garnered for his team 's first entry into the PVP tournament .
But the move has caused some debate among EVE players .
Some feel the manipulation of an organised tournament was a step too far .
For others , the game 's complete freedom of action and deep political machinations are what sets it apart , and this assassination is the perfect example of that .
One thing 's for sure - writing MMO news would be much more dull in a world without EVE Online .

George W. Bush gave his last press conference today and , as usual , could not restrain himself from his tendency toward long , rambling non-answers to questions and inappropriate smiles and shrugs .
Regarding Katrina , Bush said he ’s thought about it a lot .
Then he proceeded to give a sarcastic “ what if ” scenario about landing Air Force One in New Orleans or Baton Rouge , and the fact that the media would then have gone after him for pulling police protection off “ the mission . ”
I do n’t recall anyone ever actually wanting Bush to personally pull people out of the Superdome or the attics of flooded homes .
He was the most aggressive after being asked a question about the popularity of the US , raising his voice and declaring that he did n’t believe the US was unpopular in the world , and he was n’t trying to be popular anyway .
What I found most disturbing was his flippant response to the WMD that were never found in Iraq :
“ Things did n’t go according to plan , let ’s put it that way , ” Bush said with a smile , then a grimace .
The WMDs touted by Bush and his advisers were never found .
More than 4,000 American troops have died as a result of the invasion ; the toll for Iraqi civilians is in the tens of thousands .
The shrug after he said that sent chills down my spine .
How could he have such a “ who gives a shit ” attitude after sending so many to their deaths — when it was entirely preventable ?
This has been the longest eight years of my life , and thankfully I and my children have our lives — unlike so many thousands .
The trash goes out on January 20 , 2009 .
Good riddance .
UPDATE : Bush to give farewell address to the nation on Thursday night .
Thanks for the warning …

I come before you this morning with a morality play , a modern - day American fable .
I ’d call the following , which made its way to me a few days ago , a true story , but since I was n’t actually present I suppose I ca n’t swear to its accuracy .
I will say that the source is someone I have come to respect and trust , and I believe that what I am about to relate is , in fact , true , even if the facts are off an inch or two in places .
So I ’ll change the names to protect myself from malevolent whores litigious types and leave you to decide if it all seems plausible .
Meet Danielle Jones
My source is a woman we ’ll call Anne .
She ’s a talented public relations professional with an established track record of doing such good work for her clients that in a couple cases they ’ve actually had to call her and ask her to stop because they could n’t handle the results she was generating on their behalf .
Until recently she worked for a small - to - mid - sized firm in a major metropolitan market – let ’s call them JonesPR , since Jones is a common enough name .
Jones is owned and operated by Danielle Jones – again , not her real name – a youngish and obviously bright woman whose ambition seems to fill whatever room she ’s in .
Jones has been successful in a competitive field owing in part to her professional and personal drive and in part to the fact that she ’s hired some accomplished people to work for her .
In recent weeks , JonesPR has been advertising for senior - level account executives .
Odd that , in an economy where most agencies are finding the going a little tight .
But you have to appreciate that somebody is doing well , right ?
Then the details begin to emerge .
What Danielle was really doing was advertising for multiple people when she did n’t really have multiple jobs .
The plan was to get several high - level folks through the door , offer them all the “ job , ” then let them work – unpaid .
Whoever did the best , she ’d keep .
The rest would be on their way , uncompensated .
So in a sense she was offering up something that had all the responsibility of a senior level job with the compensation , security and benefits of an internship .
The job ad could easily have led with “ how desperate are you , you pathetic bitches ? ”
It gets better .
As Jones scoured the marketplace and talked to people , she found what you ’d expect – lots of experienced , talented pros looking for a gig .
It being a buyer ’s market , she probed as to what they ’d be willing to work for .
Probed , poked , squeezed , “ leveraged , ” whatever you want to call it .
And since people are desperate for an income , or even a fraction of an income , she was able to wring lower and lower salary requirements out of them , to the point where she had people willing to work for half of what they were worth .
She then took those numbers back to her current employees with a message that went something like “ you know , I think I may be paying you too much . ”
Anne finally called her on it , suggesting that such practices were unethical .
Anne was quickly joined to the ranks of “ people without a gig . ”
Ethics and Morality
I do n’t know a lot about Danielle Jones , but pieces of information that seem relevant have made themselves available .
We know , for instance , that she comes from a family of some means .
It ’s not known how well - off she was growing up , but we do know that she was able to comfortably attend an elite and quite expensive university .
There is nothing in her professional record to suggest that she worked to earn the cash needed to launch JonesPR .
So we ’re left with the suspicion that she made her money the old - fashioned way – she inherited it .
If so , we might now be forgiven for concluding that her parents provided her with much in the way of the material but almost nothing in the way of basic humanity .
Anne challenged her for being unethical .
My accusation goes much deeper .
I find her actions to be immoral to the point of pathology .
Ethical codes are in some ways negotiable , and ideals that compete directly can both be considered ethical ( witness the ages - old debate between Kant and Mill , for instance ) .
Morality , though , goes to some fundamental assumptions about what is right at a foundational , spiritual level .
At the core of what separates humans from beasts we find the evolutionary firewalls that prevent us from eating each other whole – both literally and metaphorically – in times of crisis .
But here , as the economy begins to threaten the lives of countless intelligent , dedicated people , only the frothing hyena smells opportunity .
Principle , Clear and Sure
I recall Alexis de Tocqueville ’s insightful turn of phrase from Democracy in America , where he ruminated on what made the then - young nation so great .
His term was “ self - interest , rightly understood . ”
If you ’ll indulge me , I believe this longish excerpt from the eighth chapter of the book is worth reviewing :
The Americans , on the other hand , are fond of explaining almost all the actions of their lives by the principle of self - interest rightly understood ; they show with complacency how an enlightened regard for themselves constantly prompts them to assist one another and inclines them willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property to the welfare of the state .
In this respect I think they frequently fail to do themselves justice , for in the United States as well as elsewhere people are sometimes seen to give way to those disinterested and spontaneous impulses that are natural to man ; but the Americans seldom admit that they yield to emotions of this kind ; they are more anxious to do honor to their philosophy than to themselves .
I might here pause without attempting to pass a judgment on what I have described .
The extreme difficulty of the subject would be my excuse , but I shall not avail myself of it ; and I had rather that my readers , clearly perceiving my object , would refuse to follow me than that I should leave them in suspense .
The principle of self - interest rightly understood is not a lofty one , but it is clear and sure .
It does not aim at mighty objects , but it attains without excessive exertion all those at which it aims .
As it lies within the reach of all capacities , everyone can without difficulty learn and retain it .
By its admirable conformity to human weaknesses it easily obtains great dominion ; nor is that dominion precarious , since the principle checks one personal interest by another , and uses , to direct the passions , the very same instrument that excites them .
The principle of self - interest rightly understood produces no great acts of self - sacrifice , but it suggests daily small acts of self - denial .
By itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous ; but it disciplines a number of persons in habits of regularity , temperance , moderation , foresight , self - command ; and if it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will , it gradually draws them in that direction by their habits .
If the principle of interest rightly understood were to sway the whole moral world , extraordinary virtues would doubtless be more rare ; but I think that gross depravity would then also be less common .
The principle of interest rightly understood perhaps prevents men from rising far above the level of mankind , but a great number of other men , who were falling far below it , are caught and restrained by it .
Observe some few individuals , they are lowered by it ; survey mankind , they are raised .
I am not afraid to say that the principle of self - interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time , and that I regard it as their chief remaining security against themselves .
Towards it , therefore , the minds of the moralists of our age should turn ; even should they judge it to be incomplete , it must nevertheless be adopted as necessary .
I do not think , on the whole , that there is more selfishness among us than in America ; the only difference is that there it is enlightened , here it is not .
Each American knows when to sacrifice some of his private interests to save the rest ; we want to save everything , and often we lose it all .
Everybody I see about me seems bent on teaching his contemporaries , by precept and example , that what is useful is never wrong .
Will nobody undertake to make them understand how what is right may be useful ?
Somewhere along the way , though , America ’s noble self - interest , that of the rightly understood variety , has given way to “ self - interest , and the rest of you can fuck yourselves . ”
This self - interest , purged of all meaningful human morality , sees getting to the top as the only imperative , and it treats fingers , faces and rungs the same – all are things to be trampled on the way up the ladder .
The Ghost of the Gipper
I will not allege that Danielle Jones is the rule describing our current , troubled moment , but I will also not allow that she ’s the exception .
I know too many principled business people , too many who are as appalled by her behavior as I am , to believe that everyone in corporate America has become a bloodless caricature with all the nuance of a B - movie villain .
But at the same time , the disease rotting what ’s left of her soul hardly strikes the thoughtful citizen as unique , does it ?
The United States contracted , around the time that the sainted Gipper took office , a particularly virulent strain of Fuck - You - Itis .
Michael Milken , for whom hundreds of millions of dollars were n’t enough to evoke even a little “ rightly understood , ” was the poster boy for Reaganomic excess , and I suppose the latest in that line would be Bernie Madoff , who despite having more millions than many of us have thousands ( or hundreds , even ) , continued growing what begins to smell like the king - hell Ponzi scheme in all of recorded history .
Along the way we endured outbreaks of Lay and Skilling and Nacchio and Ebbers and Rigas and Kozlowski and how many , how many more ?
Where de Tocqueville once found virtue , he ’d now be overcome by the stench of values - free capitalism run amok .
Where once America cared about principle , now it only seems to care about principal .
Danielle Jones is n’t the whole coal mine , but she ’s also not the first canary to go toes up .
We ’re entering a time that will reveal much about our character , not only as individuals but as a collective .
If we tolerate JonesPR , we condone our own destruction .
So , America – who are you going to be ?
“ This is the eighth time I ’ve rewritten this thing , the filmmakers kept telling me I was doing it wrong but I ’m really feeling this one .
Here ’s what the film is : Mike Diamond and Adam Horovitz of Beastie Boys tell you an intimate , personal story of their band , and their 40 years of friendship together .
From the 1980s New York City punk scene , to Fight For Your Right ( to Party ) and becoming the first hip - hop artists to make a # 1 record ( Licensed to Ill ) , through their evolution , which took them to Sabotage , Intergalactic and beyond .
Created with their old friend , their former grandfather and collaborator , filmmaker Spike Jonze , the film seamlessly mixes a live stage show and documentary to create a new format , a live documentary .
Does that make sense ?
It ’ll make more sense when you see the trailer that the filmmakers have n’t finished editing yet , despite constant badgering .
But anyways , I ’m not mad .
In this film that was shot at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn , Mike D and Adrock discuss their evolution as musicians , artists and people , and a whole bunch of other crazy sh!t .
Their co-conspirator , musician , activist , inventor , discredited astrophysics professor and my favorite Beastie Boy , Adam Yauch , could n’t be there that night because he passed away in 2012 .
But even though he ’s not there , his spirit is very much felt onstage through Mike and Adam and the force of nature that was Yauch , their band , and their friendship . ” - Larry

Members of Congress on Twitter
The Electoral College is incredibly obsolete but still remains .
Many institutions in government are slow to change , but one thing I find fascinating is incredible changes in how candidates and politicians communicate .
Imagine if you could follow your representative or senators throughout their day and even communicate with them ?
Well exactly that is happening on Twitter !
About 10 % of the members of Congress are now on Twitter .
I 've detailed the list below and linked to their Twitter pages .
But think about this .
Many of these folks are personally reading their Twitter pages .
If not personally , then someone close to them who probably interacts with them on a weekly basis if not more frequent .
There is probably no better way of interacting with your representative ( provided you do n't already have a personal relationship with them ) .
So far as I can tell , 17 senators are active on Twitter ( 8 Republicans and 9 Democrats ) .
They all seem to be active although not very followed ( Senator McCaskill has the most followers at about 4,300 compared to Lance Armstrong at 80,000 and Robert Scoble at 58,000 ) :
As for the House of Representatives , there are 46 members on Twitter ( 32 Republicans and 14 Democrats ) and the one with the most followers seems to be John Culberson ( R ) from Texas at 6,500 :
Bottom line is that this is great .
The more transparency we bring to government the better .
PS , let me know if you find other members of Congress on Twitter and I 'll update the list .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wholesale prices fell in December for the fifth month in a row , according to a key government inflation report released Thursday .
The Producer Price Index ( PPI ) for finished goods fell 1.9 % last month , according to the Labor Department .
That drop was less than the 2.2 % drop in November , but in line with the 1.9 % decrease expected by a consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The drop in wholesale prices slowed slightly because energy prices did n't fall as fast .
The index for energy prices dropped 9.3 % in December after sinking a more hefty 11.2 % in November .
Meanwhile , prices for consumer foods fell 1.5 % after holding steady in November .
One analyst said that the government report on wholesale prices was more about the dramatic change in energy prices than it was reflective of the change in prices overall .
" We should begin to see energy and commodity prices in general find some kind of stabilization , " said Anika Khan , economist with Wachovia .
" It is energy prices in general that is pulling down overall or headline PPI , " she said .
Prices for wholesale goods fell through the various production stages .
For those producers of intermediate goods , prices fell 4.2 % in December after declining 4.3 % in November .
And basic goods dropped 5.3 % in December after falling 12.5 % the month before .
The so - called core PPI , which strips out volatile food and energy prices , jumped 0.2 % after a more modest 0.1 % rise in the prior month .
Economists were looking for a 0.1 % rise in that reading .
On a year - over - year basis , the price of finished goods eased 0.9 % .
In the prior year , the price increased 6.2 % .
The key factor in the annual turnaround was energy prices .
They sank 20.3 % over the course of 2008 , compared to a 17.8 % jump in the year prior .
In July , the annual rate of increase in the PPI surged to 9.9 % as crude oil prices hit their record highs .
Over the summer , analysts were concerned about inflation .
With the PPI showing its first month with a year - over - year decrease in prices in five years , however , analysts were no longer worried about inflation , but had started to worry about deflation .
While lower prices seem like a boon for cash strapped consumers , some economists have begun to grow concerned over the dangers of deflation in a recession .
A drop in prices signals a drop in demand and may inhibit businesses and consumers from ramping up their spending .
Another key reading on inflation is due out Friday .
The Consumer Price Index , which measures retail prices , is expected to have fallen by 1 % in December .
The core CPI is forecast to have risen by 0.1 % .
If you have a collection of interconnected objects in Objective - C , what is the best way to traverse them all in order from nearest to furthest ?
Are the NSMutableSet methods good for tracking already - visited nodes ?
How much overhead does an NSMutableArray FIFO queue impose relative to a depth - first search ( which does n't require a FIFO queue ) ?
Does NSMutableArray perform better if objects are pushed onto the front , or the back ?
In this post , I present answers to these questions and more .
Graph theory
In programming , a graph is any collection of connected data objects .
If that information was new to you , then I suggest you read this Wikipedia page : Graph ( computer science ) , then read every page to which it links , then for each of those pages , also read every page to which they link .
Come back to this page once the irony is apparent .
The two common means of processing nodes in a graph are depth - first and breadth - first traversal .
Breadth - first graph traversals are normally slightly harder to write than depth - first traversals because we have the added requirement of a maintaining a FIFO queue to handle the nodes to be processed .
When all the nodes in the graph are Objective - C objects and an NSMutableArray is used to maintain the FIFO queue , what is the fastest way to traverse ?
I tested a few different approaches to see which would work best .
The graph used for testing
All my tests were on graphs where each node of the graph was connected to two more nodes until the center layer of the graph , at which point pairs of nodes were subsequently connected to a single node until the graph converged back to a single node .
An example of this graph structure ( shown horizontally so layers are aligned in columns ) with two increasing layers and two decreasing layers is :
Since there are two increasing layers and two decreasing layers , I called this a " half - depth " of 2 .
I will refer to the size of all subsequent graphs by their " half - depth " .
All nodes are objects of the following class :
@interface Node : NSObject { NSSet * linkedNodes ; } @property ( nonatomic , retain ) NSSet * linkedNodes ; @end
These classes do n't store any useful information but that 's not the point of these tests : I 'm testing traversal performance only .
Initial approach
The basic algorithm is :
create a set to track already - visited nodes create an array to queue nodes - to - process for every node ( in order ) in the nodes - to - process array : get the set of nodes linked to the current node exclude nodes that we 've already visited from the linked set add non-excluded , linked nodes to the nodes - to - process array
The first code I wrote implementing this algorithm was :
NSMutableSet * visitedNodes = [ NSMutableSet setWithObject : startingNode ] ; NSMutableArray * queue = [ NSMutableArray arrayWithObject : startingNode ] ; while ( [ queue count ] > 0 ) { NSMutableSet * newNodes = [ [ (( Node * ) [ queue lastObject ] ) .
linkedNodes mutableCopy ] autorelease ] ; [ newNodes minusSet : visitedNodes ] ; [ visitedNodes unionSet : newNodes ] ; [ queue replaceObjectsInRange : NSMakeRange ( 0 , 0 ) withObjectsFromArray :[ newNodes allObjects ] ] ; [ queue removeLastObject ] ; }
This code uses NSMutableSet 's own set - operators to exclude already visited nodes .
It also pushes new objects onto the front of the queue and pops each node for processing off the end .
So , how did this approach perform ?
In a word : terrible — and it's the fault of -[ NSMutableSet minusSet : ] .
Lesson 1 :
Only ever use [ setOne minusSet:setTwo ] if setOne is bigger than setTwo .
This method runs in O ( n ) time , where n is the size of setTwo .
In the above code , where visited Nodes can be orders of magnitude bigger than newNodes it is much faster to iterate over newNodes and exclude nodes found in visited Nodes ourselves .
That way we run in O ( m ) time , where m is the size of newNodes ( and is actually small and constant for this test case ) .
The method minusSet : really should iterate over the smaller set between the receiver and the parameter .
However , since it does n't we must avoid it .
Front - to - back or back - to - front
The next problem to address : is it faster to push objects onto the front of an NSMutableArray and pop them off the end , or to push them onto the end and pop them off the front ?
The following is the push onto front :
while ( [ queue count ] > 0 ) { NSSet * newNodes = (( Node * ) [ queue lastObject ] ) .
linkedNodes ; for ( Node * newNode in newNodes ) { if ( ! [ visitedNodes containsObject : newNode ] ) { [ visited Nodes addObject : newNode ] ; [ queue insertObject : newNode atIndex : 0 ] ; } } [ queue removeLastObject ] ; }
This is the push onto back :
while ( [ queue count ] > 0 ) { NSSet * newNodes = (( Node * ) [ queue objectAtIndex : 0 ] ) .
linkedNodes ; for ( Node * newNode in newNodes ) { if ( ! [ visitedNodes containsObject : newNode ] ) { [ visited Nodes addObject : newNode ] ; [ queue addObject : newNode ] ; } } [ queue removeObjectAtIndex : 0 ] ; }
The result , testing over graph half - depths of 8 , 12 , 16 and 20 ( from 766 to 3145726 nodes ) is that push onto end ( the second one ) is consistently 5 % faster .
Lesson 2 :
An add to the end of an NSMutableArray is the only operation that works quickly — most other operations are consistently slower .
If the number of operations is equal , favor algorithms that add to the end of the array .
Other questions tested
Will local NSAutoreleasePools help small loops like this ?
Wrapping the body of the above loops in an NSAutoreleasePool to release storage locally resulted in a 25 % increase in time taken .
The inside of these loops do n't autorelease any memory ( NSMutableArray and NSMutableSet maintain their own memory manually ) so the autorelease pool is wasted effort .
Is an NSOperation Queue for the FIFO queue faster ?
Moving the content of the loop into an NSOperation object and pushing each operation into an NSOperationQueue to traverse the graph made the overall traversal approximately 100 times slower .
The extra work involved in creating each operation object , then having NSOperationQueue distribute the jobs over different CPUs ( I have a 2 x PPC G5 CPU machine ) and waiting for each thread to start and end is a lot of overhead .
Additionally , while NSOperationQueue is a FIFO queue , the jobs only run in - order if we set the maxConcurrentOperationCount to 1 , so we 're not really gaining anything from using the NSOperationQueue .
NSOperationQueue is intended for independent ( threadable ) operations of a non-trivial size .
The inside of this loop does n't meet that expectation .
How much overhead does the FIFO queue impose ?
The only way to examine this is to run a depth - first search using a recursive algorithm .
void Recursively Traverse ( Node * node ) { NSSet * newNodes = node .
linkedNodes ; for ( Node * newNode in newNodes ) { if ( ! [ recursiveSet containsObject : newNode ] ) { [ recursiveSet addObject : newNode ] ; Recursively Traverse ( newNode ) ; } } }
The result , over half - depths of 8 , 12 , 16 and 20 is that the recursive algorithm is consistently twice as fast .
Lesson 3 :
Using NSMutableArray as a FIFO queue imposes a constant additional time per node .
In this trivial test , the additional time amounted to half the computation for the node but if you have significant additional computations to perform per node , the overhead of the FIFO queue may be insignificant relative to the remainder of your algorithm .
Conclusion
You can download the test code I used : FIFOQueues.zip ( 46kB )
Even in such a simple algorithm , there are clearly some lessons to learn .
The biggest surprise for me was that I could n't trust minusSet : to work in the most efficient manner .
I think I 'll need to submit a bug for this to Apple .
NSMutableArray s are not symmetric front - to - back , although the difference is minor enough that it may wo n't always matter .
This ad came on during the Oscars and we 're still baffled .
It starts with Tom Cruise and Jimmy Kimmel in a steamy , tumbling embrace in Cruise 's bedroom .
Then it gets weird .
Even outside this spot , Cruise and Kimmel have a stiff , awkward relationship .
Witness the pair 's somehow very wrong conversation on Kimmel 's ABC late - night show this past December .
It was the most awkward thing ... well , since Kimmel had that one guest on and no one knew whether the couple were having sex with each other or not .
Which was obviously a totally different situation from the Cruise thing .
Entirely .
Now there 's this , a bizarre ad that puts Cruise and Kimmel in a hot , handsy , intimate back and forth .
Until the end , where Cruise decides the relationship is unnatural , and then kills Kimmel , like some kind of psychotic crazy person .
Which , uh , must have required some strenuous acting .
Especially because it's not like a male relationship would ever make Cruise just SNAP in some way .
We look forward to seeing this creepy role - playing game between the two men continue , until their relationship gets as odd and twisted as the Kimmell - Matt Damon bond , and we learn something new and vaguely unsettling about the ABC host .

Today is the final day of the year 2008 .
Our society ’s numbering of years always bothered me and makes little sense from a logic perspective – it is a system based on culture , not science .
This is n’t the 2008th year the planet has been around .
Alas , this is what society has decided to use , so we ’ll go with it for now .
Also , yesterday was the final day of my 25th year on this by - chance , life - supporting planet we call Earth .
Always a retrospective time of year for me , and probably for you as well .
Most bloggers make lists of their most popular posts of the year , but instead of doing that ( you can browse the archives here if you ’d like ) I thought I ’d do something different and piece together a few smart / inspirational quotes from several bloggers I ’ve been reading this year .
Chris Brogan
From The Way Today ’s Web Changes Things
“ You CAN do things a lot more streamlined than before .
You do n’t need an IT team .
You need a nerd .
You do n’t need millions of dollars .
You need day jobs .
You do n’t need a million customers .
You need the right 10,000 . ”
Seth Godin
From Be Careful Of Who You Work For
“ If you want to become the kind of person that any company would kill to have as an employee , you need to be the kind of employee that ’s really picky about who you align with . ”
Eric Friedman
From Where Do You Live ?:
“ I recognized early on in my own career that some people want to feel safe and get a paycheck every 2 weeks without challenging the status quo .
I also recognized that these people had convictions about things that made them seem to come alive when they talked about them .
Why not take that passion and conviction and try to spend more time on it ? ”
Tim Jahn
From Make Friends With Your Weaknesses
“ What separates the successful from the unsuccessful is the acknowledgement of weakness .
Bring your weaknesses to the front of the line , acknowledge them , and learn from them .
Think of them as a valuable tool rather than trash to take out . ”
Brian Solis
From The Social Revolution is Our Industrial Revolution
“ Evolution is evolution – and it ’s happened before us and will continue after we ’re gone .
But , what ’s taking place now is much more than change for the sake of change .
The socialization of content creation , consumption and participation , is hastening the metamorphosis that transforms everyday people into participants of a powerful and valuable media literate society . ”
Chris Anderson
From Why Technology Has n’t Saved Us From Inflation ( But Still Can )
“ In a world where seemingly everything is getting more expensive , the price of digital technology continues to fall and the differences between those two economies are growing .
If getting rich was the incentive to go digital a decade ago , saving money may be an even stronger motivation this time . ”
Peter Kim
From How To Set An Ego Trap
“ The old saying tells us , “ the way to a man ’s heart is through his stomach . ”
Let ’s update that for today ’s world and recognize that the way to a blogger ’s keyboard is through their ego . ”
Matt Dickman
From Do n’t Forget The Rest Of The Digital Puzzle
“ Social media is n’t the end - all - be - all , but it offers marketers unparalleled opportunity to participate in relevant ways .
It also provides a launchpad for other marketing tactics .
Social media is not an island , it ’s a high - power engine on the larger marketing ship . ”
Steve Hodson
From WOOHOO !
Someone finally gets it
“ Just because we slap a new term and some soothing pastel web pages together it does n’t invalidate what came before it .
It does n’t change the fact that we have been socializing on the web long before someone invented the marketing term of social media .
It sometimes seems though that the tech world has this inbreed need to proclaim something as new and totally different than what came before when in fact this is n’t the case . ”

Gun Company Hires Mother ’s Assassin Vicki Weaver ’s FBI killer now a spokesman for South Dakota gunmaker By Pat Shannan An American gun manufacturer has hired a professional killer to tout the merits of its weapons .
What better spokesman could a company have than one who has shot and killed a young mother with her baby in her arms ?
The South Dakota company ’s Internet website has proudly published a letter attesting the greatness of its new sniper weapon .
“ Pound - for - pound , component - for - component , dollar - for - dollar , you will not find a better rifle , ” says the new spokesman for H - S Precision in Rapid City .
His name is Lon Horiuchi , a government assassin who retired from the FBI in 2006 .
AFP called to ask him if this was also the weapon he used to blow away the face of Vicki Weaver at the remote area of Ruby Ridge in Idaho in 1992 , but he did not return the calls .
On Aug. 21 , 1992 , U.S. marshals perpetrated a sneak attack on the mountain cabin of the Randy Weaver family in northern Idaho .
When the family dog , Striker , a docile and loving golden retriever , began to bark at the agents , they shot him dead “ because he was giving away our position , ” one said later .
Sammy Weaver , 14 , saw the incident and screamed , and the agents nearly blew his arm off ( the impact of which spun him around ) , and then zippered him through the back with a three - round blast from automatic weapons .
The boy was dead before he hit the ground .
His father , Randy , later told this writer that when he got to him , “ his chest was blown out and his heart was like raw hamburger . ”
The marshal directing the raid , Bill Degan , was also killed , maybe by his own men .
During the afternoon and night , all sorts of deceptive information was being transmitted from the scene to the FBI headquarters in Washington .
The marshals , desperate after being caught in the act of breaking the law , had made up all kinds of cover - up stories — the most outrageous being that the Weaver family had them pinned down for eight hours in an all - day shootout in which Randy ’s 16 - and 10 - year - old daughters had been holding them off with high - powered weapon fire from the windows of the cabin .
Rather than eight hours , the whole situation had lasted closer to eight seconds at a location where the young girls were not even present .
However , not only did the news media trumpet the lie , but Attorney General Janet Reno and the FBI brass in Washington bought it , too .
By nightfall , a government jet was hauling a mob of retaliatory killers from the FBI ’s Hostage Rescue Team to Idaho .
The next morning FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi lurked in the woods outside the cabin .
When Randy and 16 - year - old Sarah came out to visit the body of Sammy in a shed a few feet away , he shot Randy in the back as he reached for the latch .
Fortunately , the bullet did not seriously wound him .
Hearing the shot , Vicki opened the front door
As Mrs. Weaver stood in the doorway holding her baby , Horiuchi delivered the next .308 slug through her right temple .
Horiuchi was nearly prosecuted in 1997 by the State of Idaho but his lawyers were successful in getting the case removed to federal court where it was easy to get it dismissed .
Even though this incident happened most of two decades ago , Horiuchi ’s name was instantly recognized by someone perusing a print catalog from H - S Precision and saw the letter printed on its back cover .
When he sent it across the Internet , the response of outrage began from the many others who remembered .
“ I hope I am not alone in wanting to see a boycott against HS Precision , ” said one .
“ We should let them know how we feel about people who murder women holding their babies and how we feel about businesses who brag about murderers using their weapon to commit their murders . ”
“ One of the murderers at Ruby Ridge and Waco used in an ad ? ” wrote another .
“ Killer of innocent women and children used to sell rifles ?
How sick does it get ?
This is almost like Oliver North getting a TV show .
Let ’s put him back in hiding .
He should be in prison but since we have no control over that , let ’s at least not let him have a normal life . ”
Ill - publicized at the time , the later Waco investigation showed that Delta Force and the FBI ’s HRT team were on the ground at the Branch Davidian church near Waco on April 19 , 1993 .
When the fire broke out — all surviving Davidians said that it was not set by them — the assassination teams fired hundreds of rounds at the fleeing church members as they tried to escape .
This was confirmed by the FBI ’s own FLIR tapes shot from a hovering aircraft at 4,000 feet .
It was long ago confirmed that Lon Horiuchi was on the ground that day , firing and presumably murdering more innocent people .
It makes an investigator want to ask , where else was he during his murderous career and who else might have been among his victims ?
Was Horiuchi in Lawrence County , Ark. in June of 1983 when the FBI and U. S. marshals murdered an unarmed and defenseless Gordon Kahl ?
How about in Philadelphia in 1985 when the black ghetto was bombed and burned down ?
OKC police Sergeant Terry Yeakey complained to his wife and friends of being hounded by the FBI only one day before he was found murdered on May 8 , 1996 .
Was Lon Horiuchi in Oklahoma that week ?
And consider the many “ Arkancides ” during Bill Clinton ’s gubernatorial and presidential regimes .
Where was Horiuchi on 40 different dates in the 1980s and 1990s ?
That ’s a topic for another time .

“ Now should be environmental vegetarianism ’s big moment .
Global warming is the single biggest threat to the health of the planet , and meat consumption plays a bigger role in greenhouse gas emissions than even many environmentalists realize . ” – Ben Adler[social_buttons ]
This quote above is from an article by Ben Adler in American Prospect , titled “ Are Cows Worse Than Cars ? ” .
It really stands out as a reminder of the clearly divided environmental movement .
By and large , the movement towards environmental sustainability has just plain ignored the impact that dietary choices have on global warming .
Curious , is n’t it ?
On the one hand , we can support cleaner energy , buy more efficient cars , and reduce our consumption of products derived from petroleum , and yet with our other hand , eat a burger that has a carbon footprint bigger than most SUVs .
“ I think it ’s amazing that even the greenest of green liberal environment activists , the vast majority of them tend to consume meat at the same rate as people who think global warming is a hoax .
Meat consumption seems to be the last thing that progressive people address in their lifestyle .
If I had a nickel for every global warming conference that had roast beef on the menu , I ’d be rich . ” – Mike Tidwell , director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network
The beef industry is driven largely by corn subsidies ( over 5 billion dollars last year alone ) .
If feedlots had to pay the true cost of feeding the cows all of that corn , or if they had to offset all of the fuel and emissions produced from calf to slaughter , most of them would probably have been out of business long ago .
We ’ve been bailing out the meat industry with subsidies and price supports for years , and for what ?
For greenhouse gas emissions that out - pace the levels from cars and other transportation .
Considering the large carbon footprint for animal agriculture , why is it that we ’re so adamant about not giving up meat ?
“ I do n’t know of anyone in the environmental community that has taken a stance of ‘ we support no meat consumption because of global warming . ' ” – Tim Greef , League of Conservation Voters
Owning a hybrid vehicle with Sierra Club stickers on the back is way more sexy than cutting the flesh out of our diets .
Until the connection between CO2 emissions , global warming , and our diet is accepted , you can be sure that people will be rolling through the drive - thru for Big Mac , in the biodiesel or hybrid , feeling like they ’re really making a difference …
Read the entire article by Ben Adler in American Prospect for more juicy tidbits on dietary choices , climate change , and global warming .

Waitrose Waitrose Waitrose
During January and February , 21 Waitrose stores across the UK are introducing cycle trailers to help customers to transport their shopping home by bike .

Equipped with large canvas shopping bags , the trailers will be loaned out for a day free of charge to any Waitrose customers who wish to use them .
The supermarket hopes the scheme will encourage its customers to cycle to its stores rather than travelling by car .
“ January is the time that many people are setting themselves targets for the New Year such as getting fit through doing more exercise , ” said Waitrose assistant project manager , Nicky Snelgrove .
“ Our cycle trailers are an excellent way of helping our customers stay healthy and has the additional bonus of being able to play a positive role in the environment in 2009 , ” she added .
When a customer registers for the scheme at a shop ’s welcome desk , a special bracket will be attached beneath their bicycle saddle to enable them to clip the trailer onto their bike .

U.S. President - elect Obama has chosen president of the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) Richard Haass , along with senior CFR - member Richard Holbrooke , and CFR - member Dennis Ross as special Foreign Envoys / Foreign Policy Advisors , reporting directly to Obama ( as reported by CBS News ) .
Richard Holbrooke has also been a CFR director three times , as he is presently .
Richard Haas is also a CFR director .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Even the CBS Evening News ( reported by CFR - member anchor- propagandist Katie Couric ) identified Haass as the president of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Not surprisingly , CBS did not bother to mention that both Richard Holbrooke and Dennis Ross are also members of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Neither did CBS report that Richard Haass and Dennis Ross are also members of the Trilateral Commission , the more selective creation ( 1973 ) of David Rockefeller and Obama adviser / supporter Zbigniew Brzezinski .
Richard Holbrooke is also a former member of the Trilateral Commission .
And of course , neither did CBS report that Richard Haass , Richard Holbrooke , and Dennis Ross , have each also been Bildberger attendees .

Linux vendor Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) is out today with its newest Real Time Linux platform , MRG 1.1 boasting new performance , messaging and grid computing ( cloud ) capabilities .
The new MRG 1.1 platform marks the debut of Red Hat 's commercially - supported grid technology , which helps users create their own enterprise clouds as well as leverage the power of Amazon 's EC2 service .
Red Hat is also claiming significant performance gains with a new Real Time Linux kernel and improved messaging speeds in a bid to appeal to unique sectors such as government , military and financial services .
Real Time is a technical ideal for providing deterministic performance .
It enables actions within the same amount of time , every time -- a feature critical for a number of industries including telecommunications , the military , healthcare and financial services .
" MRG 1.1 is a pretty big update for Red Hat , " Bryan Che , product manager for Red Hat MRG , told InternetNews.com .
" A big theme for the release is formal support for grids .
We previously had support for messaging and real time , but grid was in tech preview . "
Red Hat announced the MRG 1.0 platform in December of 2007 .
With the 1.1 release , Che noted that Red Hat added a full Web - based console for grid management as well as the ability to offload to an Amazon EC2 instance as well .
A computing grid is a distributed utility computing environment where multiple node contribute their compute resources .
It 's a term that lately has become intermingled with the popular term Cloud computing , which also pulls on distributed resources for compute power .
As for why Red Hat its Grid instead of Cloud ?
Target markets .
Che noted that traditional high performance computing environments , such as financial services and research are used to calling distributed computing a grid .
" They do n't think of their own workloads as a cloud because they 've been doing it for years , " Che added .
" We call it a grid but depending on who we talk to we emphasize the point its not so much it 's a grid but it 's the ability to execute any time of computation from sub-second calculations to persistent applications , " Che said .
Overview :
The previous year , 2007 , had been quite a good year for filmed nudity , but 2008 was not .
Two observations will stand out if you peruse the lists below : 1 . There is barely a pubic hair to be seen among the top finishers .
Milla Jovovich 's lower body exposure scene in .45 , brief though it is , is not even really from 2008 .
It was actually filmed more than two years ago .
Kate Groombridge 's scene in Virgin Territory is a great one , but is actually from the deleted scenes on the DVD .
Cassandra Hepburn played a minor character in a B movie .
Lust , Caution was technically a 2007 film since it had a brief release during Christmas week to establish Oscar eligibility last year .
Given all those disclaimers , you could fairly argue that there were no significant actresses to perform frontal nudity in 2008 .
Even Kate Winslet kept her crotch off - camera !
2 . As grim as the situation was in general , it would be far worse if the television stars were removed from the list .
Three of the top seven finishers ( Anna Paquin , Lizzy Caplan , and Mary - Louise Parker ) earned their places with nudity in a TV series .
Three others ( Mischa Barton , Eliza Dushku , and Danneel Harris ) are TV stars who did nude scenes in obscure movies which never received any significant theatrical distribution .
That leaves Marisa Tomei alone among the top seven as the only movie star performing in a theatrical movie .
20t Amy Smart in Mirrors ( 6.2 at IMDb )
We 've been waiting for this cute actress to do another worthwhile nude scene since Road Trip , and she finally delivered the goods , including the rear view for the first time .
20t Angelina Jolie in Wanted ( 7.0 at IMDb ) Speaking of rear views , here 's one of the most famous in the world , complete with tats .
20t Cassandra Hepburn in Hell Ride ( 5.3 at IMDb )
Did you like the biker films from the drive - in era of the late sixties and early seventies ?
If so , this is the film for you !
It has everything they had back then ( including the same cast , now elderly ) , plus more graphic nudity and violence .
The scene itself is a good one and would have placed higher had the film or the actress been better known .
20t Cynthia Nixon in Sex and the City ( 5.4 at IMDb )
This vaginocentric flick became event viewing for female viewers in the early summer , kind of the distaff equivalent of a fan - boy flick .
For a film which had no designs on male audiences , it offered a damned good collection of female body parts , including a sex scene from Cynthia Nixon , who proved to be a very youthful 42 .
20t Milla Jovovich in .45 ( 5.5 at IMDb )
This film was lensed years ago , but languished in distribution limbo and finally made it onto our radar this year .
Milla looks great , as always , and even offered a quick frontal flash .
20t Winona Ryder in Sex and Death 101 ( 6.2 at IMDb )
Unlike some of her co-stars ( see Sophie Monk immediately below ) , Noni did not provide substantial nudity in this film .
Her appearance on this list is attributable to the fact that she 's internationally famous and had never shown anything clearly before .
She flashed just enough in this scene to attract the attention of voters who have been waiting a long time to get a look at her flesh .
20t Sophie Monk in Sex and Death 101 ( 6.2 at IMDb ) Nice body .
Nice nude scene .
Not a bad movie .
( See the review below . )
13t Jess Weixler in Teeth ( 5.9 on IMDb ) What a cutie !
Jess looks like a younger , less busty version of Heather Graham , and the film is an offbeat little gem .
Teeth is a horror / comedy film about the ancient myth of vagina dentata , which would be a coochie with razor - sharp teeth that destroy anything which attempts to pass through .
13t Kate Winslet in The Reader ( 8.1 on IMDb ) It seemed that Kate 's nudity career had ended when she announced as much about a year ago , but she once again gave it up when art beckoned .
Although Kate has never appeared near the top of our annual list , she has appeared on the list more than any other actress : 1999 - 14th for Holy Smoke
2000 - 12th for Quills
2002 - 10th for Iris
2006 - 13th for Little Children
2008 - 13th for The Reader
13t Marisol Nichols in Felon ( 7.9 at IMDb )
This represents a first look at the popular TV actress without her clothing .
The film went more or less straight to DVD with only a perfunctory limited release , but is rated surprisingly high at IMDb and has garnered more than 10,000 votes !
13t Neve Campbell in I Really Hate My Job ( 5.3 at IMDb ) Exposing both T and the ever - popular A , Neve makes her second appearance on the list , following her 4th - place finish in 2004 for When Will I Be Loved ?
13t Penelope Cruz in Elegy ( 7.0 at IMDb ) Penny and Gandhi ... together at last .
In this lugubrious drama , Cruz has some sex scenes with Sir Ben Kingsley .
The sensuous señorita still looks as spectacular as she did when she did her first nude scenes in the early 90s , and she still looks young enough to be playing a grad student in this film .
13t Teresa Palmer in Restraint ( 6.1 at IMDb ) Restraint is a pretty nifty little erotic thriller from Down Under about an ostensibly helpless hostage who seems to turn the tables on his captors .
The script is OK , but the highlight of the viewing experience is definitely Ms. Palmer naked .
13t Zoe Kazan in Revolutionary Road ( 8.0 at IMDb )
The popularity of this scene is a bit mystifying .
Although Zoe is the granddaughter of the legendary Elia Kazan , I never heard of her until about a week before this poll was conducted .
Moreover , she shows only her breasts , and her flash is so brief that it 's barely noticeable without the freeze frame .
She is adorable and busty , however , and I guess our voters took note of that .
10t Wei Tang in Lust , Caution ( 8.1 at IMDb ) Director Ang Lee ( Crouching Tiger ) always delivers a film which looks beautiful , and this deliberate , NC - 17 thriller is no exception .
10t Kate Groombridge in Virgin Territory ( 5.0 at IMDb )
The full frontal portion of the scene to the right was actually cut from the film , in which Kate shows only her breasts and buns .
The reason ?
No , not prudish censors , but the fact that the Groombridge grooming seemed a tad inappropriate for the 14th century , which is when the Boccaccio - type story took place .
The scene is included in the DVD special features , and is also seen in the " film clips " link below .
10t Anna Faris in The House Bunny ( 5.6 at IMDb ) Anna demonstrated that she not only has great comic chops , but one helluva firm rump as well .
8t Laetitia Casta in Born in ' 68 ( 6.2 at IMDb )
What can you say .
I do n't know anyone who has seen this film except Charlie , but even the vague scent of a nude scene from the curvy La Casta gets her on our lists !
OK by me .
8t Mena Suvari in Stuck ( 6.9 at IMDb )
After her promising start in American Beauty , Mena 's career path took some detours , but she has found her way back onto the radar in the past year or so , and Stuck represented a solid comeback role .
7 Danneel Harris in Ten Inch Hero ( 8.0 at IMDb )
When an relatively unknown actress makes the top ten list in an obscure movie , you know it has to be because of some good nudity !
As for the movie , I have n't seen it yet , but an 8.0 at IMDb is impressive enough to get my attention .
6 Mischa Barton in Closing the Ring ( 6.8 at IMDb ) Mischa provided lovely T&A for this old - fashioned romance from 84 - year - old Richard Attenborough , who began his film career in 1942 !
5 Mary - Louise Parker on Weeds Season 4 , episode 13 ( 8.7 at IMDb )
The best nudity came in the final episode of the latest season of Weeds , but Mary - Louise had already turned us on in an earlier episode when she received a vigorous spanking at the hands of her Mexican crime boss turned boyfriend , photographed in such a way to assure that it was not faked .
She 's one of those rare humans who get hotter and more beautiful as they age .
4 Lizzy Caplan in True Blood Season 1 , Various Episodes
What could words add to the picture to the right ?
3 Eliza Dushku in The Alphabet Killer ( 5.9 at IMDB )
Like many of the women who appear in these annual lists , Dushku is an actress who grew up before our eyes and has not previously done a nude scene .
2 Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler ( 8.8 at IMDb ) It 's official .
Marisa Tomei is now a screen nudity goddess .
For umpteen years we never saw her flesh .
Now she has finished second in our poll two years in a row , and she looks great at 44 years old .
She should have been naked in every movie .
And for that matter , also when she was not in a movie .
1 Anna Paquin in True Blood Season 1 , Various Episodes ( Not rated at IMDb )
The sure - fire formula for victory : a girl who grew up before our eyes doing her first nude scene .
Anna met the qualifications , and looked terrific doing so .
A system of opposing genetic forces determines why mammals develop a single row of teeth , while sharks sport several , according to a study published today in the journal Science .
When completely understood , the genetic program described in the study may help guide efforts to re-grow missing teeth and prevent cleft palate , one of the most common birth defects .
Gene expression is the process by which information stored in genes is converted into proteins that make up the body ’s structures and carry its messages .
As the baby ’s face takes shape in the womb , the development of teeth and palate are tightly controlled in space and time by gene expression .
Related abnormalities result in the development of teeth outside of the normal row , missing teeth and cleft palate , and the new insights suggest ways to combat these malformations .
The current study adds an important detail to the understanding of the interplay between biochemicals that induce teeth formation , and others that restrict it , to result in the correct pattern .
Specifically , researchers discovered that turning off a single gene in mice resulted in development of extra teeth , next to and inside of their first molars .
While the study was in mice , past studies have shown that the involved biochemical players are active in humans as well .
“ This finding was exciting because extra teeth developed from tissue that normally does not give rise to teeth , ” said Rulang Jiang , Ph.D. , associate professor of Biomedical Genetics in the Center for Oral Biology at the University of Rochester Medical Center , and corresponding author on the Science paper .
“ It takes the concerted actions of hundreds of genes to build a tooth , so it was amazing to find that deleting one gene caused the activation of a complete tooth developmental program outside of the normal tooth row in those mice .
Finding out how the extra teeth developed will reveal how nature makes a tooth from scratch , which will guide tooth regeneration research . ”
Why Extra Teeth Formed
When we lose our baby teeth , the permanent teeth grow in to replace them , but permanent teeth when lost are lost for good .
U.S. adults aged 20 years and older are missing an average of four teeth due to gum disease , trauma or congenital defects .
Tooth loss makes chewing difficult , causes speech problems , accelerates oral disease , and disfigures the face .
Current treatments for missing teeth include dentures or dental implants , but each procedure comes with disadvantages .
The idea of growing teeth to replace missing ones has captured the imaginations of scientists , with many labs investigating ways to regenerate teeth .
In the current study , Jiang and colleagues generated mice that lacked the oddskipped related - 2 ( Osr2 ) gene , which encodes one of many transcription factors that turn genes on or off .
“ Knocking out ” ( deleting ) the Osr2 gene resulted in cleft palate , a birth defect where the two halves of the roof of the mouth fail to join up properly , leaving a gap .
Secondly , and surprisingly , the Osr2 “ knockout ” mice developed teeth outside of the normal tooth row .
Jiang decided to focus his research first on the effect of Osr2 on teeth patterning ( vs. cleft palate ) because much more was known at the time about teeth development pathways .
Although teeth usually do not become visible until after birth , their formation starts early in development .
Teeth develop from the epithelium and mesenchyme , two key tissue layers within the mammalian embryo .
The first sign of tooth development in mammals is the thickening of the epithelium along the jaw line to form a band of cells called the dental lamina .
Because all teeth subsequently form from the dental lamina , the assumption was that some special quality of epithelial cells there made them “ tooth competent . ”
Classical experiments , however , found that the developing tooth mesenchyme was capable of inducing tooth formation from epithelial tissues that normally would not participate in tooth development .
Researchers confirmed that it was indeed the mesenchyme that carried tooth initiation signals later in development , but how those signals were restricted to the area beneath the tooth row was unknown .
Past studies in other labs had shown bone morphogenic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) to be an important factor for the initiation of teeth , and that a protein called Msx1 amplifies the BMP4 tooth - generating signal .
Jiang and colleagues suggested for the first time that some unknown factor was restricting the growth of teeth into one row by opposing the Bmp4 signal .
The current study provides the first solid proof that the precise space where mammals can develop teeth ( the “ tooth morphogenetic field ” ) is shaped and restricted by the effect of Osr2 on the expression of the Bmp4 gene within the mesenchymal cell layer .
Jiang ’s team has shown not only that removing the Osr2 gene results in extra teeth outside of the normal row , but also that Osr2 is expressed in increasing concentration in the jaw mesenchyme as you move from the cheek toward the tongue in the mouse embryo , the exact opposite of the BMP4 concentration gradient .
Osr2 restricts Bmp4 expression to the tooth mesenchyme under the dental lamina , and in Osr2 ’s absence , Bmp4 gene expression expands into the jaw mesenchyme outside of the tooth row .
A second major finding of the study backs up another emerging theory which holds that careful regulation of competing pro- and anti-tooth initiation signals controls how mammalian teeth come one by one in sequence .
As each tooth develops , something must prevent it from forming too close to the next or mammals would have no gaps between their teeth .
When this mechanism occasionally falters , adjacent teeth come in fused together .
Since evolution is not perfect , wisdom teeth ( third molars ) often come in too close to their predecessors , and must be pulled to make space .
Jiang and colleagues also engineered a group of mice with both the Osr2 and Msx1 genes removed .
While mice without Msx1 failed to grow any teeth , mice lacking both Msx1 and Osr2 grew the first molars , but no additional teeth .
Thus , without Osr2 , enough BMP4 was expressed for the first molar teeth to grow , but without Msx1 , the BMP4 signal was not amplified to the point where it could kick off the next tooth in the row .
With these results , Jiang argues that BMP4 cooperates with other factors to create a temporary zone around each tooth where no other tooth can grow .
When the tooth gets closer to maturity , Msx1 overwhelms decreasing levels of inhibitory factors to start the BMP4 - driven development of the next tooth .
Since the jaw is growing at the same time teeth are forming , it follows that each tooth must also receive signals that enough jaw has grown in for the next tooth to start forming atop it .
The implications of the current results may go beyond tooth development , researchers said .
Thanks to the work of Jiang and others , some of the biochemical pathways involved in cleft lip / cleft palate development are now recognized , and may include BMP4 , Msx1 and OSR2 as well as several others .
In humans , Msx1 mutations have been linked with cleft lip / palate and with the failure to develop one or more teeth .
In the next phase of the team ’s work , researchers will look at what other factors may be regulated by Msx1 and Osr2 to begin pinpointing the genetic network that controls teeth patterning and palate development .
Their goal is to manipulate stem cells to treat malformations and to develop prevention strategies for cleft palate ( e.g. the inclusion of folic acid in prenatal vitamins prevents neural tube defects in some cases ) .
Cleft lip / palate occurs one in 700 live births .
Along with Jiang , the work was led by Zunyi Zhang and Yu Lan within the Center for Oral Biology and Department of Biomedical Genetics at the Medical Center .
Yang Chai collaborated on the effort from the Center for Craniofacial Molecular Biology at University of Southern California School of Dentistry in Los Angeles .
The work was sponsored by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research , part of the National Institutes of Health .
“ Beyond medical applications , our results suggest that diversity in the number of tooth rows across species may be due to evolutionary changes in the control of the BMP4 / Msx1 pathway , ” Jiang said .
“ In mammals , Osr2 suppresses this pathway to restrict teeth within a single row . ”

She once tipped the scales at 270 pounds and still can't believe that she was ever overweight now that she has become accustomed to her new form .
The 40 year old mother of two sons , credits her daily delivery of prepared meals from Fresh Dining .
The organic fare satisfies her and keeps her on track but she does worry that something could throw her off balance .
She stays active and is satisfied with her current weight but does admit that she is guilty of wanting to lose more .
Not immune to the pressures of staying thin , she said , " According to Hollywood standards , I 'm not a thin girl , I 'm a normal girl . "
The holiday season can pose problems for many people who suddenly lose their resolve and succumb to full blown grazing .
She weighed in on the dilemma by saying , " I will be really conscious because I have this book coming out and I want to look great .
I do n't need to lose any more weight but I do n't want to go backwards .
So I 'm not going to pig out this Christmas . "
We checked out the website and discovered that Fresh Dining , located in Southern California , was founded in 2005 and offers five plans : Fresh Dining , Fresh Lite , Healthy Lifestyle , Fresh Mommy and Whole Family .

At the 1854 Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War , British cavalry were ordered to attack withdrawing Czarist artillery brigades .
By the time the order cascaded down the chain of command , however , it misdirected the British horsemen into a hail of fire from Russian guns .
The debacle caused a furor in England , and inspired Alfred , Lord Tennyson , to pen “ Charge of the Light Brigade , ” with its mournful refrain :
Into the valley of Death rode the six hundred .

CLOSE Thunderchief pilots faced three formidable enemies over North Vietnam : antiaircraft guns , SA - 2 surface - to - air missiles ( SAMs ) , and MiG - 17s and - 21s .
On a recent visit to the National Air and Space Museum retired Air Force Generals Spence “ Sam ” Armstrong and Michael Nelson recalled what it was like to face those enemies .
During the Wild Weasel missions that Nelson describes , the F - 105s deliberately tried to smoke out one of these threats .
Once they were targeted by enemy radar used to guide SAMs to their airplanes , the F - 105 pilots would fire missiles that homed on the enemy signals and destroyed the SAM site .
Armstrong also describes one technique he used to escape MiGs : leading them to the “ SAM ring . ”
Knowing the dangers of flying within reach of the SAM ’s radar , the MiG pilots would break off their pursuit .

CLOSE Restoration Specialist John Shatz describes how squadron maintenance crews in the Vietnam War came to love a beast like the F - 105 Thunderchief .
Twice a day , almost every day , the aircraft had to be ready for strike missions into North Vietnam , where anti-aircraft defenses and MiGs awaited them .
More than half of the 610 Thunderchiefs built were lost on those missions ; a surviving example is on display at the National Air and Space Museum ’s Steven F. Udvar - Hazy Center in Chantilly , Virginia .

Just over a century later , something like that infamous charge was performed in modern dress , this time with airplanes , and with the Russian weapons hidden in the forests of North Vietnam .
And this time the action was not completed in a single day , but recurred , every morning and afternoon , weather and politics permitting , for more than three years .
Charge of the Light Brigade , meet Groundhog Day .
The Republic F - 105 Thunderchief , the main aircraft involved in the drama , had never been intended to play the role of a strategic bomber .
Rather , it had been created to make a single , low - level nuclear strike — to use its potent stinger once , then die , like a bee .
In January 1952 , the U.S. Air Force was seeking such an aircraft , one that could penetrate enemy territory and take out military bases with both conventional and atomic weapons .
At Republic Aviation ’s Farmingdale , Long Island plant , such an airplane was already taking form as Advanced Project 63 under legendary Russian émigré designer Alexander Kartveli .
Republic Aviation was awarded the contract , and the YF - 105A first flew on October 22 , 1955 .
The F - 105 seems to have accreted around the single Mk - 28 thermonuclear bomb it would carry in a fuselage bomb bay .
About the size of a mansion - grade hot - water heater , the weapon could deliver anything from 10 kilotons to more than a megaton of explosive power .
The Republic design team took the tubular fuselage of the company ’s F - 84 , a fighter - bomber used extensively in the Korean War , and gave it an area - rule pinch at the waist to improve the transonic behavior of what would become a Mach 2 - plus airplane .
Wing - root inlets were swept forward to prevent engine stall , and a new Pratt & Whitney J - 75 turbojet replaced the proposed J - 71 .
In an era when guns were so 1950s , compared with missiles , someone added a 20 - mm Gatling in the Thunderchief ’s nose .
In 1957 , a year before the F - 105 entered service , the Air Force had Republic upgrade it with new navigation electronics and radar for all - weather operations , a fire - control system , and a more powerful version of the J - 75 engine .
The changes yielded the fully evolved , stiletto - shaped F - 105D .
The aircraft ’s 45 - degree swept wings measured , tip to tip , not quite 35 feet — about the same as a Piper J - 3 .
But it was no trim little thing .
The - 105 ’s vertical stabilizer towered 19 feet above the ground , about the height of the vertical stab of a Boeing B - 17G Flying Fortress , and its fuselage was only about 10 feet shorter than the Fort ’s , making the F - 105D the largest single - engine jet aircraft ever sent to war .
With some fanfare , the D model entered service in September 1960 .
Wrote a New York Times reporter : “ The Air Force rates the Thunderchief as the most devastating system of destruction ever controlled by one man . ”
Accordingly , only high - time fighter pilots were sent to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to learn how to wield that power .
“ You had to have a thousand hours before they let you fly the thing , ” recalls Michael Cooper , a Nellis grad .
He ’d won his wings in 1955 , and had been flying North American F - 100s .
“ We transitioned to the -105s in the summer of ’ 63 .
I went down to Mobile , Alabama , and picked up a brand - new airplane .
Took it home . ”
Cooper still remembers the serial number , 62-4372 .
The aircraft flew until 1980 , when it crashed during a NATO training exercise in Denmark .
“ It was a great airplane , ” says Cooper .
“ Not much of a fighter .
But it was so much faster than everything else .
The Navy F - 4s , we ’d fly right through their formations , ” closing from behind .
According to Thunderchief pilot Michael Brazelton , the heavy fighter could make “ 860 knots on the deck , well above the speed of sound .
Trouble with going so fast so low is that the canopy starts to melt .
We had a double canopy , with coolant between the layers . ”
Raw performance aside , the Thunderchief was “ a pretty amazing airplane , ” says Ed Rasimus , who went through a later class at Nellis .
“ We used to do a nuclear profile [ training flight ] .
There was a radar mode you could fly at 500 feet .
Gear and flaps up , you ’d engage the autopilot , set up terrain avoidance , fly 400 miles , deliver a [ mock ] nuclear weapon on a target , and take the stick back at 200 feet on final . ”
The Nellis grads were sent off to the frontlines separating East and West .
Some went to bases at Bitburg and Spangdahlem , West Germany , others were assigned to Yokota Air Base in Japan .
From the bases in Germany and at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and Osan , South Korea , the pilots began standing alerts , nuclear weapons tucked into their airplanes ’ bomb bays or hanging from wing pylons , waiting for the terrible moment to arrive .
The moment never came .
Fate had something else in store for the Thunderchiefs and the men who flew them .
On the nights of August 2 and 4 , 1964 , two U.S. destroyers , Maddox and Turner Joy , reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats .
Exactly what occurred has been debated for a generation , but , whether real or contrived , this became the Gulf of Tonkin Incident , and a call to war .
The Pirate Bay has just released a Google - powered map of the tracker connections per country .
The map is only the start of a much larger project that will cover more detailed statistics on the tracker 's users .
However , it already reveals some interesting data .
In the past few weeks The Pirate Bay has been struggling with an increase in visitors , and a corresponding load on their servers .
Luckily , with a recent upgrade of the site ’s tracker servers , there is some room to breathe again .
“ We just upgraded the trackers from 12 old boxes to 8 new ones that handle the same load , but now only at 20 % CPU usage , so we can grow a bit more , ” Pirate Bay co-founder TiAMO told TorrentFreak .
“ Having some spare power in the servers has allowed us to collect some fun stats , ” he added , pointing us to a map showing where all the connections to the Pirate Bay tracker come from .
Interestingly , according to the geo -IP data , the map reveals that 33 % of all connections come from China – around 7 million peers .
This is an impressive statistic by itself , but even more interesting when you consider that the Pirate Bay website is actually blocked in China .
The tracker seems to be popular elsewhere in Asia also , with 5.9 % of connections coming from Taiwan and 4.2 % from Japan at the time of writing .
We further see that the United States comes in second with 8 % , and Sweden – the home of the Pirate Bay – is responsible for little over 1 % ( 250,000 peers ) of the tracker connections .
Since Sweden has a population of approximately 9 million people , this is actually quite an accomplishment .
These statistics are of course just a snapshot .
They are updated frequently and vary depending on the time of the day .
This relatively simple map is just the beginning , TiAMO told us .
In the near future more statistics will be added , such as the type of BitTorrent clients people use , and the average download and upload speeds per region .
Some raw data will also be made available to the public , but not without guaranteeing the anonymity of the tracker ’s users of course .
The last of the U.S. Navy 's experimental undersea habitats , Sealab III accommodated five teams of 10 men each for 15 - day stints 600 below the Pacific off San Diego .
Ostensibly created for underwater scientific research , it was later revealed that the base was also used for Top Secret military experiments involving deep water EVAs ..
There was one fatality during these experiments , and the program was eventually scrapped .
Aurora 's flagship kit for 1970 , the Sealab III featured a clear plastic shell through which one could see the habitat 's complex interior .
The kit enjoyed only a single issue .

The artist who makes striking sculptures from matchsticks
Artists like to stick out and show their flair - and none more so than David Mach who creates colourful creatures from tens of thousands of matchsticks .
Mr Mach makes animals such as gorillas , grizzly bears and rhinos by combining an array of matchsticks with different coloured tips .
The 52 - year - old immortalises the animals in such detail that his pieces sell for between £ 20,000 and £ 35,000 each .
Monkey magic : Mr Mach specialises in making wild creatures from matchsticks
His 15 - inch high gorilla - with flared nostrils and a fierce open mouth - required 30,000 matches and took three months as each match was painstakingly glued onto a mould .
The Scot , who works from a studio in London , recreates the animals ' features and different skin shades using 14 different coloured matchsticks imported from Japan .
He said : ' I like to make figures that are instantly recognisable and make people take notice .
' The animals are a joy and a challenge to make because they have difficult features such as antlers and horns .
' I love to use a variety of material for my pieces .
I try and use common things , like matchsticks or coat - hangers , because people know exactly what they are .
These items are in everyone 's lives but are almost invisible . '
Fire and ice : Using different coloured matchsticks imported from Japan , Mr Mach made this polar bear
Mr Mach and his wife Lesley , who helps him run the studio , have made more than 350 of them so far .
The sculptures are crafted by firstly making a clay mould of the head and creating a fibreglass or plastic version from it .
The matchsticks are then stuck on using wood glue .
But although their work is labour - intensive and much sought after , their sculptures are not always kept for posterity .
Despite all the work that goes into them - sometimes the couple burn the figureheads at exhibition launches .
Mrs Mach , 51 , said that some customers even request that the pieces are burned to achieve an eerie effect .
She said : ' They are highly flammable and when they go up it 's highly dramatic .
It can send flames shooting 6ft into the air but because they 're just matchsticks , it 's all over in a few seconds . '
The practice of setting fire to them came after the couple accidentally set fire to one of them in the studio .
Match maker : Mr Mach likes making animals , such as this moose , because of the detail involved
Mrs Mach said : ' A lot of people think that David is something of a pyromaniac but it 's really not the case - he just enjoys working with matchsticks . '
But it 's not just matchsticks that hold a fascination - his style is based on flowing assemblages of mass - produced objects and he has experimented with pieces made of magazines , newspapers and car tyres .
He once crafted a 12 ft - high sculpture of a gorilla out of coat - hangers which sold for £ 200,000 .
Other works include a public sculpture depicting an LNER Class A4 steam engine made from 185,000 bricks on the A66 near Darlington , County Durham .
He has exhibited all over the world and in 1988 was nominated for the Turner Prize .
In 2000 he joined the Royal Academy of Arts as Professor of Sculpture .
A Wilkes - Barre , Pa. woman who marketed " gothic kittens " with ear , neck and tail piercings via the Internet has been charged with animal cruelty and conspiracy .
Dog groomer Holly Crawford , 34 , was charged Tuesday by humane officers .
Her home outside Wilkes - Barre was raided Dec. 17 after the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Luzerne County received a tip from PETA that she was marketing the animals online for hundreds of dollars .
Crawford has said she will plead innocent .
Crawford told The Associated Press Thursday that she did n't see any difference between piercing a cat and piercing a human .
She said she used sterile needles and surgical soap and that she checked the kittens several times a day to make sure they were healing properly .
" When I did it , it was n't with any cruel intentions , " said Crawford , of rural Ross Township .
" They were definitely loved , well - fed , no fleas , clipped nails .
And they were happy . "
Daphna Nachminovitch , a vice president for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , called the piercings " barbaric . "
" There 's no excuse for inflicting such pain on an animal that 's the size of your palm , " she said .
SPCA Officer Carol Morrison said the kittens had 14 - gauge piercings through their ears and submission rings at the napes of their necks .
One kitten 's tail was docked .
Crawford , who sports her own body piercings , said she decided on a whim to pierce the ears and neck of a stray kitten she took in last fall and named Snarley Monster .
She said she docked the cat 's tail because it was badly damaged and that the animal was not intended for sale .
Morrison charged Crawford and William Blansett , 37 , of Sweet Valley , each with three misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty , three summary counts of cruelty and three counts of conspiracy .
Crawford said Blansett helped take calls about the kittens but that he had nothing to do with the piercings .
A number for Blansett could not be located .
Crawford said her dog- grooming business , Pawside Parlor , has plummeted since the raid and that she has received dozens of nasty phone calls .
" My name 's ruined , my reputation 's ruined , my business is ruined , " she said .

Home builder sent to jail for fraud
Reported by : Terry Wood
DRAPER , Utah ( ABC 4 News ) -
The president of Cobalt Homes , Brian Brady , is in the Salt Lake County Jail serving a 90 day sentence for defrauding homeowners and subcontractors .
Bradys trouble began several years ago when he started developing homes on the mountainside in Draper .
People who bought the homes suddenly found themselves with numerous liens placed by subcontractors Brady had not paid .
When ABC 4 caught up with Brady , he promised to pay the subcontractors , get the liens removed and make the homeowners happy .
He did not follow through on those promises .
Brady pleaded guilty to four third - degree felony counts of communications fraud .
Court documents say Brady used money that should have paid subcontractors to pay for elective surgery for his wife , his daughters wedding expenses , new trucks for his sons , dinners and other personal expenses .
Bradys office manager , Melissa Lynnea Brunner , also pleaded guilty to four Class A misdemeanor counts of attempted communications fraud .
She was sentenced to 3 years of supervised probation and ordered to pay more than 130 - thousand dollars restitution .
Brady must also pay restitution ... more that 320 - thousand dollars .

Proposition 8 proponents ' complaint that a California campaign - finance disclosure law has led to harassment of same - sex marriage opponents failed to sway a federal judge , who refused Thursday to throw out the law or shield donors ' names .
" If there ever needs to be sunshine on a particular issue , it 's a ballot measure , " U.S. District Judge Morrison England said after a one - hour hearing in his Sacramento courtroom .
A lawyer for the Prop. 8 campaign said it would ask an appeals court to modify or overturn the law , which requires disclosure of all contributors of $ 100 or more .
Prop. 8 , approved by voters Nov. 4 , amended the state Constitution to recognize only marriage between a man and a woman , overturning the state Supreme Court 's May 15 ruling that gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry .
Same - sex couples and local governments led by the city of San Francisco have filed suits to overturn Prop.
8 , a case that the state 's high court could hear as early as the first week in March .
The federal lawsuit , unrelated to the validity of Prop. 8 , was filed Jan. 8 by the ballot measure 's sponsoring committee , Protect Marriage .
The suit said Internet disclosure of donors ' names and other identifying information in state - mandated reports has led to consumer boycotts , picketing and even death threats .
By requiring disclosure , " The government is getting in the middle ( of the issue ) and saying , ' Here are the people to go after , ' " Richard Coleson , a lawyer for the committee , told England .
He argued that the $ 100 disclosure requirement - adopted by California voters in 1974 - should be struck down , modified to raise the dollar limits , or at least not applied to Prop.
8 's contributors .
As a first step , Coleson said , the campaign should be exempted from the state 's post- election contribution report , due Monday .
Otherwise , he said , in future initiative campaigns " you will have donations dry up , and one side will be able to overcome another by intimidation and not by persuasion . "
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld campaign disclosure laws in 1976 but ruled in 1982 that the Socialist Workers Party in Ohio could shield its donors ' names because of a history of attacks and reprisals .
Protect Marriage argued that it was entitled to the same exemption because of retaliation against some of its contributors , but lawyers for the state said the two cases were n't comparable .
They noted that the Prop. 8 campaign raised nearly $ 30 million from 36,000 donors .
If the Prop. 8 campaign was exempted from disclosure because of reports of harassments of individual donors , said Deputy Attorney General Zackery Morazzini , the same case could be made for any controversial initiative .
Courts would have to " keep the entire California electorate in the dark as to who was funding these ballot measures , " he said .
England agreed .
He noted that some of the reprisals reported by the Prop. 8 committee involve legal activities such as boycotts and picketing .
Other alleged actions , such as death threats , mailings of white powder and vandalism , may constitute " repugnant and despicable acts " but can be reported to law enforcement , the judge said .
Even if there have been illegal reprisals , that would be insufficient reason to grant a wholesale exemption for a multimillion - dollar initiative campaign , England said .
He also rejected the Prop. 8 campaign 's argument that the $ 100 disclosure limit established in 1974 should be increased for inflation , saying some states require reports of contributions as low as $ 25 and the Supreme Court has never invalidated them .
Any desire by donors to remain anonymous is outweighed by the state 's authority to require " full and fair disclosure of everyone who 's involved in these political campaigns , " England said .
Protect Marriage still has a request pending before England to require the state to remove its past disclosure reports from the Internet .
But the state says such an order would be futile because the reports have been widely distributed on private Web sites .
Coleson said the campaign would take its case against the disclosure law to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
Referring to the donors whose names will appear in Monday 's public report , campaign spokesman Frank Schubert said England 's ruling " puts 1,600 people in harm 's way . "
The Church of England today voted overwhelmingly in favour of banning clergy from belonging to the British National Party .
On the second day of the General Synod , the legislative body that meets twice a year , more than 300 of the 418 members gathered in Westminster endorsed a motion asking the House of Bishops to keep BNP members out of the church .
The members wanted a policy similar to that adopted by the Association of Chief Police Officers , which bars police from belonging to an organisation that " contradicts the general duty to promote race equality " .
The House of Bishops is now obliged to draw up and implement the policy , and needs to decide whether any change in the church 's present laws is necessary or desirable .
In a 90 - minute debate , Vasantha Gnanadoss , who proposed the motion and is one of a handful of ethnic minority synod members , said : " My personal experience is that the church is institutionally reluctant to take any bold measures related to racism .
" Passing this motion is a push that is seriously necessary .
Without it , the day may come when the BNP will have gained significant power and the church will stand accused of having been feeble when it could have been resolute . "
The motion received support from the archbishop of York , Dr John Sentamu , and the archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams .
Another synod member , the Rev Rose Hudson Wilkins , said : " We know these [ racist ] views exist here .
Why are there so few people from ethnic minorities sitting in this chamber ?
There are racist undertones in parishes and dioceses .
" We 're all being nice and friendly .
The undertones are there .
We are kidding ourselves if it comes from somewhere else . "
There was a perception , she added , that people from ethnic minorities had nothing to contribute to the life of the church .
Others commented on the overwhelmingly white nature of the synod and suggested that a strong statement against racism could have a positive effect on the Church of England 's makeup .
According to the latest church statistics , only 2.8 % of its 114 bishops and 1.4 % of the 4,443 priests come from ethnic minorities .
The Rev Canon Simon Killwick said : " Ethnic minorities are scandalously under - represented in our clergy .
Let 's see an increase in their recruitment . "
There were attempts to stymie the proposal and dilute it , by removing references to the ACPO policy and the BNP , but these changes found little support .
The bishop of Rochester , Michael Nazir - Ali , voted in favour of one such amendment .
William Fittall , secretary general of the synod , warned that there may be legal difficulties in implementing the policy .
In a background paper , he said clergy could not currently be disciplined for lawful political activity , and the BNP was not a proscribed political party .
He suggested the church could be vulnerable to discrimination claims .
The synod also heard a presidential address from Dr Williams , who reflected on the nature of debates to come , namely tomorrow 's discussions on legislation approving the ordination of women as bishops .
He told the chamber that neither those supporting nor those opposing the historic change were unlikely to disappear .
" They want to be part of the family still .
And that means that some dreams of purity and clarity are not going to be realised .
" Both [ sides ] have turned their backs on the fantasy of a church that is pure in their own terms , in favour of a church that is honest about its diversity – even when that diversity seems at first embarassing and unwelcome . "
In tomorrow 's debate , which is scheduled to last three and a half hours , the synod will vote on whether to send the draft legislation to a revision committee or leave it unchanged .

I no longer wonder why the rest of the world laughs at us or why we cant seem to make any headway in science and math when compared with the rest of the world .
From Gallup today :
It has been a testable theory for 150 years and not a single experiment has ever contradicted the basic principles of Darwin ’s theory , despite him predating DNA and genetics , which has only gone on to confirm Darwin ’s theory .
I know this because I watched Nova last night , which was all about the Dover School Board trial in which a federal judge ( appointed by president Bush ) ruled that “ intelligent design ” was NOT science and had absolutely no right in a school , especially a science class .
During the case , they proved that the not only is intelligent design not science , it is literally re-packaged creationism .
They did this through researching the popular ID text book “ Of Pandas and People ” and found old drafts in which the authors literally replaced the word “ creationism ” with “ intelligent design ” in their definition following a court case saying creationism ca n’t be taught in schools .
It was a fascinating episode .
You can watch the whole thing here .
It is two hours , but it really , really lays out the case for not only what constitutes science , but why Darwin ’s theories not only hold up but are stronger now than when he proposed them .
It also details how creationists tried to manipulate the national argument ( and on this , some might say , they appear to be winning ) .
But still , the demographics of the Gallup poll show that as education increases , belief in creationism oops , intelligent design goes down .
One can only presume this is because once you are exposed to what science actually is , there is little room to deny evolutionary theory .
Or maybe it just takes a bit more of an evolved brain to understand that faith in god and belief in evolution are not necessarily mutually exclusive things .
But I have to say , it ’s the “ no opinion ” people that irk me .
Open your goddamn eyes , people .
Evolution is like gravity – it may be a theory , but let go of your damn keys and they will fall to the floor every time .
How can you have no opinion ?
That ’s just ridiculous .
But as Bill Hicks says , you ever notice that the people who believe in creationism look really unevolved ?
Mesa , the largest school district in Arizona , began phasing out certified librarians from most of its schools last year .
In Spokane , Wash. , the school district cut back the hours of its librarians in 2007 , prompting an outcry among local parents .
More than 90 percent of American public schools have libraries , according to federal statistics , but less than two - thirds employ full - time certified librarians .

Lisa Layera Brunkan , a mother of three in Spokane , said she recognized the importance of the school librarian when her daughter , who was 7 at the time , started demonstrating a PowerPoint project .
“ She said , ‘ The librarian taught me , ’ ” Ms. Brunkan recalled .
“ I was just stunned . ”
School librarians still fight the impression that they play a tangential role .
Ms. Rosalia frequently has her lessons canceled at the last minute as classroom teachers scramble to fit in more standardized test preparation .
Half a fifth - grade class left in the middle of a recent session on Web site evaluation because the children were performing in a talent show .
“ You prepare things to proceed in a logical sequence and then here comes a monkey wrench , ” Ms. Rosalia said .
“ We are teaching them how to think .
But sometimes the Board of Ed seems to want them to learn how to fill in little bubbles . ”
In New York City , Ms. Rosalia is a relative rarity .
Only about one - third of the city ’s public schools have certified librarians , and elementary schools are not required to have them at all .
Ms. Rosalia ran beauty salons with her husband and volunteered in her sons ’ school libraries before pursuing her graduate degree .
She was recruited to P.S. 225 by Joseph Montebello , the principal , a brother of a middle school librarian in Brooklyn .
In the school , just a block from a bustling stretch of Brighton Beach Avenue with its overflowing fruit stands and Russian bakeries , Ms. Rosalia faces special challenges .
More than 40 percent of the students are recent immigrants .
Language barriers force her to tailor her book collection to readers who may be in seventh grade but still read at a second - grade level .
Prohibition militarizes police , enriches our enemies , undermines our laws , and condemns our sick to suffering .
At around 6 pm on January 27 of last year , 80 - year - old Isaac Singletary spotted a couple of drug dealers attempting to do business on his front lawn .
It was n’t the first time .
Singletary , described by relatives as territorial and a bit crotchety , did what he ’d done in the past .
He grabbed his gun , and walked out on to his lawn to scare them off .
Problem is , this time the men were n’t drug dealers .
They were undercover Jacksonville , Florida police posing as drug dealers .
They had come on to Singletary ’s property to bait possible drug offenders .
When he brandished his gun , the police shot Singletary four times , once in the back .
He died a short time later .
A subsequent investigation by Florida ’s attorney general cleared the officers who shot Singletary of any wrongdoing .
Singletary was n’t a drug dealer .
Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford described him as “ an honest citizen trying to do good . ”
Florida Governor Charlie Crist visited Jacksonville a few days later .
When asked by a reporter about Singletary ’s death , Crist euphemistically called it one of the “ challenges in fighting crime . ”
Singletary is far from the first innocent person to die for the war on drugs , and he ’s nowhere near the last .
But let ’s call Singletary ’s death what it is : collateral damage .
Like the collateral damage of military wars overseas — innocents inadvertently killed by bombs , bullets , and missiles aimed at legitimate targets —
Singletary ’s a victim only because he happened to live in close proximity to the government ’s intended target , in this case , drug offenders .
And like the civilian casualties of military wars , Singletary ’s death wo n’t do a thing to cause the people who run this war to rethink their priorities .
Because for them , the ultimate goal is more important than the innocent lives they may take along the way .
As Governor Crist said , Singletary ’s death is really little more than a “ challenge ” on the journey to a drug - free Florida .
But whatever you may think of the legitimacy of some of America ’s military wars , past or present , they ’re waged under at least the pretense that they ’re necessary to defeat a foreign aggressor that poses a real threat to U.S. security .
The drug war ’s aim is to stop people from getting high .
When Richard Nixon first uttered the phrase “ war on drugs ” in 1971 , he chose his words carefully .
Government declarations of war signal to the country that the threat we ’re facing is so perilous , so grave , so existential , that in order to defeat it , we should prepare to give up some basic freedoms , to make significant sacrifices , and — yes — to accept the inevitable collateral damage we may endure on our way to victory .
It so happens that to Nixon , that threat was dirty hippies smoking marijuana and urban blacks strung out on heroin .
It was during the Reagan administration that the “ war on drugs ” got a lot more literal .
Nancy Reagan ’s “ Just Say No ” campaign was backed by an administration of culture warriors ready to settle remnant grudges from the 1960s , an aggressive justice department , and an eager and compliant Congress .
Every 1980s celebrity overdose or high - profile drug abuse story ( many of which turned out to be false or exaggerated — see the infamous “ crack baby ” myth , or the Washington Post ’s retracted series on “ Jimmy , ” the 8 - year - old heroin addict ) sent both parties scrambling to see who could pass the most odious and draconian new drug bill .
The climax came in 1986 , when Maryland basketball phenom and Boston Celtics draft pick Len Bias died of a cocaine overdose .
Eric Sterling , who helped write much of that legislation and is now an activist for reforming the drug laws , likened the frenzy to a stampeding herd of wildebeests .
From Baum ’s book :
Sterling had once seen a film shooting Tanzania ; a million wildebeest grazing peacefully , until one of them started running .
Assuming danger , a few more joined in , and in no time , the whole heard was stampeding wildly , trampling the sick and the slow , laying waste to the flora and fauna alike in a senseless headlong panic .
Those images kept occurring to him as he watched Congress in the weeks following Len Bias ’s death .
The wildebeests have been charging in a blind gallop ever since .
Through the Reagan , Clinton , and both Bush administrations , both major political parties have exacerbated and expanded what is arguably the most destructive and wasteful government policy of the last 40 years .
Culture11 asked me to write a piece outlining the drug war ’s collateral damage .
That ’s a tall order .
The drug war touches nearly every area of American life — certainly all facets of U.S. public policy .
But here are a few areas where I think drug prohibition has done the most damage :
Police Militarization
In the 1980s , the “ war ” part of the drug war got very real .
America ’s long ( and wise ) constraint on using the military for domestic policing began to blur , as states deployed National Guard troops to search for marijuana hidden in fields and forests and , in some cases , to patrol drug - riddled inner cities .
The line between cop and soldier further blurred when President Regan authorized active - duty elite military units to train with narcotics police , and then again with the exploding use of paramilitary SWAT teams in America .
Only a handful of police departments had SWAT teams in the 1970s , and they were only deployed in total a few hundred times per year .
That number soared to around 4,000 per year by the early 1980s .
There are around 50,000 SWAT deployments per year today in America , and they ’re primarily used to serve drug warrants .
By the late 1980s , Congress had opened up the Pentagon ’s cache of surplus military equipment for civilian police departments across the country to scavenge , again driven largely by the drug war .
Millions of pieces of equipment designed for use on the battlefield — including guns , tanks , armored personnel vehicles , helicopters , grenade launchers , and armor — would now be used on American streets , against American citizens .
Parallel to the rise of SWAT teams was the rise of the “ no - knock raid ” which sent cops barreling into private homes to look for dope , a particularly aggressive and violent method of policing , that has since left behind a predictable trail of tragedy .
As many police officers internalize the mentality that they ’re fighting a “ war , ” police - community relations have soured , and many officers have adopted the “ us or them ” mindset typically seen in soldiers .
Here ’s former police chief Joseph McNamara , in a 2006 op - ed for the Wall Street Journal :
Simply put , the police culture in our country has changed .
An emphasis on “ officer safety ” and paramilitary training pervades today ’s policing , in contrast to the older culture , which held that cops did n’t shoot until they were about to be shot or stabbed .
Police in large cities formerly carried revolvers holding six .38 - caliber rounds .
Nowadays , police carry semi-automatic pistols with 16 high - caliber rounds , shotguns and military assault rifles , weapons once relegated to SWAT teams facing extraordinary circumstances .
Concern about such firepower in densely populated areas hitting innocent citizens has given way to an attitude that the police are fighting a war against drugs and crime and must be heavily armed .
The military ’s task is to conquer and annihilate a foreign enemy ( as former Regan administration official Lawrence Korb once put it , it ’s “ to vaporize , not Mirandize ” ) .
The police are charged with protecting the public order , but without sacrificing the rights of the citizenry .
It ’s dangerous to conflate the two .
But that seems to be where we ’re headed .
Our politicians have dressed our police like soldiers , trained them in paramilitary tactics , given them military weapons and armor , and told them they ’re fighting a “ war . ”
We should n’t be surprising if and when some police officers take that message to heart .
Foreign Policy
America ’s quest to rid the world of illicit drugs knows no boundaries — political or moral .
Just months before September 11 , we gave $ 43 million to Afghanistan — a way of compensating Afghan farmers hurt by the Taliban ’s compliance with a U.S. request to crack down on that country ’s opium farms ( as it turns out , the Taliban had merely eradicated the farms in competition with the Taliban ’s own producers ) .
We do n’t seem to have learned .
The western world ’s prohibition on opium makes poppies a lucrative crop for impoverished Afghan farmers , and is a valuable recruiting tool for insurgents and remnant Taliban forces .
At the same time , we have DEA agents and U.S. and United Nations troops roving the country on search - and - destroy missions , setting Afghani livelihoods aflame before their very eyes — not exactly the way to build alliances .
Former BBC correspondent Misha Glenny , author of a book on the global drug trade , explained last year in the Washington Post :
In the past two years , the drug war has become the Taliban ’s most effective recruiter in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan ’s Muslim extremists have reinvigorated themselves by supporting and taxing the countless peasants who are dependent one way or another on the opium trade , their only reliable source of income .
The Taliban is becoming richer and stronger by the day , especially in the east and south of the country .
The “ War on Drugs ” is defeating the “ war on terror . ”
But it is n’t just Afghanistan .
The U.S. has a long history of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses and unintended consequences in the name of eradicating illicit drugs overseas .
For example , between 2001 and 2003 , the U.S. gave more than $ 12 million to Thailand for drug interdiction efforts .
Over ten months in 2003 , the Thai government sent out anti-drug “ death squads ” to carry out the summary , extra-judicial executions of as many as 4,000 suspected drug offenders .
Many were later found to have had nothing to do with the drug trade at all .
Though the U.S. State Department denounced the killings , the United States continued to give the same Thai regime millions in aid for counter - narcotics operations .
The U.S. - backed and heavily U.S. - funded drug war has led to a particularly bloody civil war in several provinces in Mexico .
Large swaths of Mexican police forces are working for the country ’s drug cartels .
Meanwhile , U.S. drug agents and politicians have been corrupted in their own way — in their willingness to accept brutal violence in Mexico as collateral damage if it brings hope for a diminished drug supply in the U.S.
In one case , federal drug agents looked the other way while one of their confidential informants participated in a series of brutal murders across the border , because they did n’t want to compromise their investigation .
Or witness a former federal drug warrior write in an Arizona newspaper that all the death and carnage in Mexico is merely a necessary step on the road to “ victory . ”
Just last year , the U.S. Congress approved another $ 400 million in drug war aid to Mexico , despite concern from human rights organizations that the Mexican military may be killing innocent Mexican citizens in its vigor to crack down on the drug lords .
In Latin America , the “ Plan Colombia ” drug interdiction effort spearheaded by President Clinton has been a disaster , as our military aid has funded right - wing paramilitary groups responsible for mass human rights abuses and spawned public support for the FARC guerilla organization that periodically rises up to threaten the country ’s stability .
The other main component of the plan — the mass spraying of concentrated herbicide on Colombian coca fields — has poisoned vast tracts of farmland ( and , some say , many people ) , depriving many Colombians of their livelihood .
This , again , is n’t likely to foster warm feelings toward the United States .
Three provinces in Ecuador are currently suing the U.S. government and U.S. contractor Dyncorp , alleging that our spraying efforts in Columbia have on several occasions crossed the Columbia - Ecuador border , raining toxic , potent chemicals down on Ecuadorian villages .
Opposition to the U.S. drug war in South America was a motivating factor in the election of the anti-American Evo Morales administration in Bolivia , and Rafael Correa in Ecuador .
Brazil and Argentina are actually moving toward decriminalizing drugs , despite the cooling of relations with the U.S. that would likely come with it .
U.S. anti-narcotics efforts have also fostered instability , corruption , and the rise of terrorist organizations in Peru .
Incidentally , it was in Peru that , in 2001 , the CIA mistook a plane full of missionaries for a drug plane .
U.S. officials ordered the Peruvian Air Force to shoot the plane down , killing 35 - year old Veronica Bowers and her seven - month - old daughter , Charity .
More collateral damage .
The Rule of Law
“ The Fourth Amendment has been virtually repealed by court decisions , ” Yale law professor Steven Duke told Wired magazine in 2000 , “ most of which involve drug searches . ”
The rise of the aforementioned no - knock raid is one example , as is the almost comically comprehensive list of reasons for which you can be legally detained and invasively searched for drugs at an airport .
In many areas of the country , police are conducting “ administrative searches ” at bars and clubs , in which an obvious search for criminality is cloaked in the guise of a regulatory inspection , obviating the need for a search warrant .
But the drug war has undermined the rule of law in other ways than its evisceration of the Fourth Amendment .
Take the bizarre concept of asset forfeiture , an attack on both due process and property rights .
Under the asset forfeiture laws passed by Congress in the 1980s ( then reformed in 2000 ) , property can be found guilty of a drug crime .
The mere presence of an illicit substance in your home or car can allow the government to seize your property , sell it , and keep the proceeds .
The onus is then on you to prove you obtained your property legally .
Even the presence of an illicit drug is n’t always necessary .
The government has seized and kept cash from citizens under the absurd argument that merely carrying large amounts of cash is enough to trigger suspicion .
If you ca n’t prove where you got the money , you lose it .
The drug war has undermined the rule of law in less obvious ways , too .
As was the case with alcohol prohibition , and is the case with the prohibition of any consensual crime , the people we ask to police these crimes often have to break the very laws they ’re enforcing .
The presence of large sums of unaccounted money can be tempting , as we ’ve seen in the countless stories of drug cops gone bad .
But the drug war breeds corruption in less obvious ways , too — ways that are likely more common .
Politicians and prosecutors want statistics — lots of arrests , big busts , and lots of drug seizures .
The temptation for even well - meaning cops to take shortcuts looms large .
We saw this in Atlanta in 2006 when a botched drug raid led to the death of 92 - year - old Kathryn Johnston .
Subsequent investigations revealed that not only did police in that case lie about nearly every aspect of Johnston ’s case , but that lying on search warrants to make the quick bust was common among Atlanta ’s narcotics cops .
The cops in the Johnston case also lied about their use of a confidential informant , another common temptation in drug policing .
Police abuse of the drug informant system led to the high - profile scandals in Tulia and Hearne , Texas , as well as other scandals in St. Louis , Cleveland , and elsewhere .
The use of street informants is bad enough .
But there ’s also the problem of jailhouse informants , convicts facing long sentences who testify against drug suspects in exchange for a reduction in their time behind bars .
Despite the obvious shortcomings in their trustworthiness — they ’re cons who have everything to gain by lying , and nothing to lose — countless innocents have been wrongly convicted on the word of jailhouse snitches .
These inherent problems with the informant system have given rise to the “ Stop Snitch ’n ” movement , which , whatever you may think of it , has revealed the troubling extent to which entire communities in America have completely given up on the people charged with protecting them , even when it comes to helping with investigations of violent crime .
Many understandably find the “ Stop Snitch ’n ” movement repugnant , but there ’s no question that it ’s symptomatic of a larger problem :
In many urban areas , the drug war has completely eradicated respect for the rule of law .
Crime , Violence , and Prison
If you look at a graph of the U.S. murder rate going back to about 1915 , you ’ll notice a few interesting patterns .
There ’s a spike at around 1919 , just at the onset of alcohol prohibition .
The graph then takes a dramatic dip in 1933 , just after the repeal of prohibition .
There ’s then another spike in the late 1960s , just as Richard Nixon took office and fired the first shots of his war on drugs .
That spike falls in the 1970s as President Carter took a less militant approach to drug prohibition , but then with Reagan ’s reinvigorated war in the 1980s , it begins another upward ascent .
This should n’t be surprising .
Prohibitions create black markets , and black markets spawn crime .
Drug prohibition , then , spawns violent crime .
There ’s a reason we do n’t often hear about a Michelob deal gone bad .
Because alcohol is legal , there are no turf wars , no sour deals , no smuggling operations to defend .
One in 100 Americans today is behind bars .
That number by far and away leads the world , and is at its highest point in American history .
About 350,000 of the approximately 3 million Americans behind bars are there for nonviolent drug crimes ( trafficking or possession ) .
It would be impossible to approximate , but countless others are undoubtedly in for violent or property crimes that are by - products of drug prohibition .
The drug war has turned entire neighborhoods into , well , war zones .
If the temptation of the drug trade can be too much for some police officers , you can imagine the allure for a young urban kid wasting away in an awful public school with few other prospects .
It ’s difficult to know what effect the exploding prison population will have on American society going forward , but it certainly ca n’t be good .
Hundreds of thousands of people who victimized no one will spend a good deal of their lives in prison alongside hardened criminals , then face lives on the outside limited by their status as convicted felons .
Medical Treatment
One final and emerging class of drug war collateral damage is medical treatment .
As the drug war has become increasingly federalized , the federal government has at the same time increasingly nosed in on the relationship between doctor and patient .
The most obvious example is medical marijuana , where the federal government has not only told doctors what they can and ca n’t prescribe to their patients , it has barred research into the possible medical benefits of marijuana ( it then dishonestly claims there is no research providing evidence of said benefits ) , and asserted the supremacy of federal law when it comes to marijuana - related medical policy — a field of policy America has traditionally ( and wisely ) left to the states .
Supporters of drug prohibition argue that medical marijuana is merely a ruse to get the drug legalized on a wider scale , and in some ways they ’re right .
You ’d have to be fairly gullible to believe that everyone sporting a prescription for marijuana in California right now is in dire need of the drug ( and I say this as someone who supports complete legalization ) .
Yet there are , unquestionably , people who do need the drug , and they ’re unquestionably suffering — and in some cases dying — because they ca n’t get it .
Peter McWilliams is one of the sadder examples .
Angel Raich — whose case upheld the federal government ’s imposition of federal law on states like California — is another .
Or consider National Review ’s Richard Brookhiser , a credentialed conservative who , as it happens , used marijuana to help with the nausea that came with chemotherapy .
When Drug Czar John Walters said in 2005 that there ’s no evidence of a medical benefit to marijuana , Brookhiser responded , “ He is a liar or an ignoramus , probably both . ”
Perhaps more eloquently , in testimony before Congress in 1996 , Brookhiser said :
“ My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles , but an extension of them .
I am for law and order .
But crime has to be fought intelligently and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick .
I am for traditional virtues , but if carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not moral , it is philistine . ”
One more recent area where the drug war is corrupting medical treatment is in the treatment of pain — specifically , chronic pain .
By some estimates , as many as 30 million Americans suffer from untreated chronic pain .
That number is only likely to rise as the country continues to age .
A promising new treatment called “ high - dose opiate therapy ” has proven successful at keeping chronic pain at bay in many patients .
The problem is that as patients build up a resistance , doctors must titrate up their dosages , to the point where some patients can take 40 or more pills per day .
These patients do n’t get high , and they do n’t suffer any ill effects .
They are n’t addicted , they ’re merely dependent .
Take the medication away , and the pain comes back .
Unfortunately , because some addicts use opiate painkillers to get high , the Drug Enforcement Administration has decided to play doctor , determining that no patient should ever need medication at dosages that high , and that any doctor prescribing drugs in those quantities must be dealing ( or “ diverting , ” as it ’s called in the white collar world ) .
While it ’s certainly possible that some doctors who prescribe pain medication are unethical , the DEA ’s aggressive , un - nuanced pursuit of pain doctors has put the fear of prosecution into nearly all doctors who specialize in pain treatment ( and scared young doctors from entering the field ) .
Driven by politicians spooked by a spate of irresponsible press reports warning of an OxyContin fad sweeping the country , the DEA ’s high - profile pursuit of pain specialists has poisoned the relationship between pain doctors and their patients , and left the country with a dire shortage of physicians willing to prescribe pain medication at the dosages many patients need .
We have drug cops dictating medical policy , and it ’s leading to all sorts of unnecessary suffering .
Some patients have lost one doctor to a DEA prosecution , spent weeks to find another who will treat them , sometimes miles away , only to have that doctor come under investigation , too .
More than a few pain patients have attempted suicide after being unable to find a doctor to treat them .
All just collateral damage .
The DEA ’s mission is to prevent people from getting high .
If it takes an overly broad , overly aggressive , chilling campaign against doctors to do that , leaving millions of people in needless , sometimes debilitating pain , so be it .
And for What ?
Even if the drug war were working — even if all the horrible things the federal government says are caused by illicit drugs were accurate ( and some of them admittedly are ) , and even if the war on drugs were proving successful in eradicating or even significantly diminishing our access to those drugs — you ’d have a difficult time arguing that the benefits would be worth the costs .
But the kicker is , of course , that it is n’t working .
Much of the federal government claims about the evils associated with illicit drugs are either exaggerated or misapplied effects not of the drugs , but of the government ’s prohibition of them .
More to the point , none of this is working even taking drug war advocates ’ positions at face value .
It is as easy to achieve an illegal high today as it was in 1981 , as it was in 1971 , as it was in 1915 .
The vast majority of you reading this either know where to get a bag of marijuana , or know someone who knows where to get one .
Specific drugs come in and out of vogue , but the desire to alter one ’s consciousness , to escape life ’s drab monotonies , or just to call in a different mindset is as strong and pervasive as it ’s ever been , going back to the stone age .
It ’s also just as easy to fulfill .
In a 1986 speech designed to drum up public support for yet another round of War on Drugs legislation , President Ronald Reagan officially designated illicit drugs a threat to America ’s national security .
After declaring that , “ We ’re running up a battle flag , ” Reagan then compared America ’s determination in the war on drugs to that of the French troops at the World War I Battle of Verdun .
As the journalist Dan Baum notes while explaining Reagan ’s speech in his book Smoke and Mirrors , Verdun was a protracted , bloody , brutal battle of attrition .
A quarter million troops lost their lives and another 700,000 were wounded in the months - long battle for a small strip of land that offered little practical advantage to either army .
In fact , in much of Europe , Verdun has come to symbolize the futility of war , and the way governments are willing to write off the loss of human life as mere collateral damage in the pursuit of some noble but ultimately elusive aim .
Looking back , Reagan ’s analogy was quite a bit more appropriate than he probably intended .

– Article from Culture11 on January 14 , 2009 .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israel has declared a unilateral cease - fire in the fighting in Gaza beginning at 2 a.m. Sunday ( 7 p.m. ET Saturday ) , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said .
A man escapes after an Israeli strike in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza on Saturday .
" Hamas has been dealt a very serious blow , " Olmert said .
" We can say that the conditions have been brought about that enable us to say that the aims that we laid down for the operation have been completely achieved . "
Yet Israel is prepared to respond if Hamas militants continue fighting in the Palestinian territory , Olmert said .
" If foes decide to continue to fight against us , then we will be ready and we shall consider ourselves justified in replying , " he said .
" I do not suggest that Hamas or other terrorist organizations try us . "
Immediate Palestinian response to Olmert 's announcement was pessimistic .
Saeb Erakat , the chief Palestinian negotiator involved in diplomatic talks on the conflict , noted that Olmert did not say Israeli troops would be leaving Gaza .
" I 'm afraid this means the cease - fire will not stand ; it will break , " Erakat told CNN International .
" Anybody can fire a shot now .
...
It 's a very fragile moment . "
The announcement followed a Cabinet meeting Saturday meant to vote on the basics of a plan that could end fighting in Gaza .
It also came a day after Israeli and U.S. diplomats signed an agreement designed to stop arms smuggling into the Palestinian territory through tunnels .
Israel launched the offensive in Gaza three weeks ago with the stated intent of stopping rocket fire into southern Israel from Hamas fighters in Gaza .
There is mounting international pressure to end the fighting .
In a televised speech Saturday , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called on Israel to end military operations and withdraw from Gaza .
He dismissed the idea of an international force based in Egypt , saying he would " never accept " a foreign presence on Egyptian soil .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon also reiterated his call for a cease - fire during a speech before the Lebanese parliament Saturday .
" The level of violence in Gaza is unprecedented , " the U.N. chief said .
" The Israeli aerial and land offensives against Hamas targets are inflicting heavy civilian casualties , widespread destruction and tremendous suffering for the entire region . "
Watch opinions from the iReport community »
The three - week conflict has killed 1,203 people in Gaza and injured more than 5,000 more , many of them Palestinian civilians , according to medical sources in Gaza City .
They said 410 children have died .
On the Israeli side , 10 soldiers and three civilians have been killed and more than 200 soldiers have been wounded since the fighting began , an Israel Defense Forces spokesman said Saturday .
Fighting continued as the IDF attacked 50 targets between Friday night and Saturday morning , including eight missile - launching sites and 70 tunnels along the Egyptian border .
The IDF says the tunnels were being used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza .
Two children were killed in an Israeli artillery attack at a U.N. school north of Gaza City early Saturday .
" This yet again illustrates that there is no place safe in the Gaza Strip , " said Chris Gunness , a U.N. spokesman , speaking of the attack .
" This fighting has to stop , because innocent people , women and children , who are taking refuge in neutral U.N. buildings are discovering that there is nowhere safe . "

Four IDF soldiers were seriously wounded early Saturday by mortar fire in Gaza , according to an IDF statement .
Hamas has said a cease - fire alone is not enough .
" We are working in every direction so we can achieve our objectives in stopping the aggression , lifting the blockade , opening the crossings , and the compensation of our people and the rebuilding of the Gaza strip , " said Hamas delegation spokesman Salah Bardwill .
In other diplomatic efforts , the state of Qatar held an emergency summit Friday in an attempt to find a unified Arab voice on Gaza .
The meeting brought together several Arab and Muslim leaders , including the presidents of Iran and Syria and the leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshaal .
Friday evening , the U.N. General Assembly voted 142 - 4 to call on Israel to abide by a January 8 resolution by the U.N. Security Council .
The resolution , which called for an immediate cease - fire by both sides in the conflict , had been universally ignored .
Israel and the United States were among the countries voting against Friday 's effort .

An additional copper atom positioned into the 1212C chain of the B212/1212C structure ( where B=11 and C=copper chain ) causes a branching of the copper chain , creating a B212/ 2212C structure ( shown at left ) .
This extra copper atom increases the hole content of that insulating layer and further stiffens the lattice , raising Tc .
Even though the copper chain branches , the planar weight ratio remains high along the C axis .
As with the 212K , 200K , 195K , and prior discoveries , planar weight disparity is the driving force behind these extraordinarily high Tc materials .
Synthesis of these materials was by the solid state reaction method .
Stoichiometric amounts of the below precursors were mixed , pelletized and sintered for 36 - 60 hours at 830C .
The pellet was then annealed for 10 hours at 500C in flowing O2 .

The magnetometer employed twin Honeywell SS94A1F

The 4 - point probe was bonded to the pellet with CW2400 silver epoxy and used 7 volts on the primary .
RESEARCH NOTE :
The copper - oxides are strongly hygroscopic .
All tests should be performed immediately after annealing .

Vows to ' Reverse ' Bush Politicization of U.S. Dept. of Justice ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/15/2009 , 12:33 pm PT
If he 's confirmed , Attorney General nominee Eric Holder told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee during confirmation hearings today , he 'll review the Bush U.S. Attorney 's decision to not prosecute former DoJ Civil Rights attorney Bradley Schlozman for his grotesque bastardization and politicization of the department as we detailed earlier this week .
Schlozman , the DoJ's Inspector General found , broke federal law and custom vis a vis his hiring practices of only fellow whack - a- doodle wingnuts , and further went on to lie to Congress about during hearings ( which is also a federal crime ) .
Said Holder during questioning by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ...
I understand that prosecutors in the US attorney 's office in DC --- again , just based on the press reports , actually reviewed the report and then made a prosecutive determination .
If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as Attorney General , I will indicate to you that I will review that determination .
I do n't know all the facts of the case , but given the findings in the Inspector General 's report that are consistent with what you have said , I want to know why the determination was made not to pursue charges , criminal charges .
...
I have not had a chance to read the report , Senator , and yet I have read the news accounts of it .
What 's contained in the report is very disturbing .
The notion that the Justice Department would ever take into account a person 's political affiliation or political beliefs in making hiring decisions is antithetical to everything the department stands for and everything I 'm familiar with .
I served very proudly in the Justice Department , under Republican Attorneys General , Democratic Attorneys General , and it was never a thought given to what your party affiliation was , what your political beliefs were in hiring , in promotion decisions .
What we have seen in that report I think is aberrant , but is also I think one of the major tasks the next Attorney General is going to have to do .
You have to reverse that .
Good rhetoric .
Encouraging language .
Though whether Holder will bring the full accountability for so many past Bush Administration crimes --- as necessary to even consider an Obama Administration to be a success , as we also discussed --- remains to be seen , of course .
On the other hand , if Holder promised that outright during these hearings , he 'd never be confirmed , as likely Democrats ( as perverse as it would seem ) would then have to find some reason to block him , no doubt .
The short video ( 3:15 ) of the exchange between Feinstein and Holder is below .

According to recent reports , $ 250 worth of electronic equipment allowed Chris Paget , an " ethical hacker , " to scan and copy the information stored on radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) chips embedded in new passport cards ( but not the traditional passport books ) , as well as some enhanced drivers ' licenses while he drove around San Francisco .
The 20 - minute experiment was captured on video by The Register .
According to Paget , it would be trivial to program blank tags with the skimmed identification numbers -- a key part of the process of creating counterfeit cards .
Because the embedded RFID chips broadcast their information , Paget was able to scan passport cards from a moving vehicle .
According to the Examiner , The State Department advertises this feature as a convenience , saying " with RFID technology , Customs and Border Protection inspectors will be able to access photographs and other biological information stored in secure government databases before the traveler reaches the inspection station . "

The State Department emphasizes that the passport card only contains a unique number that links the card to a secure database maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and State Department .
Issued with the passport cards by the State Department are sleeves that block their transmissions .
Two of the passport cards Paget scanned within the 20 - minute experiment reveals that not everyone is using those sleeves .
RFID Vulnerabilities Remain In Place
Several disturbing revelations resulted from Paget 's experiment including :
With the proper equipment you can track an identity around the city
Similar RFIDs are beginning to appear in enhanced drivers ' licenses , such as those issued by Washington State , raising privacy issues
Putting a traceable RFID in a pocket has the potential to make everybody a blip on somebody 's radar screen
The video of Chris Paget 's RFID - skimming experiment is available from The San Francisco Examiner .
More information on the vulnerabilities that appear to remain in place in passport cards and enhanced drivers ' licenses that were exploited in Paget 's experiment can be found from RSA Labs .

Genetic information taken from nearly 1.1 million children is now stored on the national DNA database , official figures show , and campaigners believe that as many as half of them have no criminal convictions .
The figure fuels the row about retention of personal information on the DNA register and on the police national computer for years after it ceases to be relevant .
The figures , revealed in a parliamentary answer to the Liberal Democrats , show that 1.09 million DNA profiles of people aged under 18 were held on the database with 337,000under 16 .
The Met police has added by far the largest number of profiles to the register , 117,000 boys and 33,000 girls .
The second biggest number is in the West Midlands force area , 49,000 and 17,000 respectively .
The Lib Dems ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said : " We already know that guilt and innocence are of no concern to ministers , but clearly neither is the negative effect the database has on children .
" It is unacceptable to keep the DNA of children on record in perpetuity for the most minor of offences .
Unless convicted of a sexual or violent offence , under - 16 s should not have their DNA stored on the database . "
Around 570,000 child profiles have been added in the last five years .
Campaigners blame changes in police tactics to meet targets for the rise in the number of children on the register .
Terri Dowty , of Action on Rights for Children , said : " Many children get arrested , have their DNA taken and there is no further action against them or they get a reprimand or final warning .
We are collecting massive amounts of data on children , including how likely they are to be criminals , and it runs the risk that we will prejudge them . "
The National Policing Improvement Agency ( NPIA ) , the body in charge of the database , said that 88 % of children were charged , convicted , or received a final warning .
But it could not say how many of those charged were acquitted or what proportion received a final warning , which does not count as a criminal conviction .
" We believe that the government underestimates the number of innocent children on the database , " said Helen Wallace , the director of GeneWatch , a campaign group which has calculated that about half of children added to the database are innocent .
" There has been a very large increase in the number of children arrested in past few years and this has been driven by the government arrest targets . "
Britain's DNA database is proportionately the biggest in the world and includes the profiles of more than 7 % of the population , according to Home Office figures .
Almost everyone arrested for a recordable offence is required to provide a DNA sample .
Whether or not criminal proceedings follow , DNA records stay on file until the person reaches their 100th birthday .
Police insist the database is an invaluable tool in fighting crime .
However , a European court of human rights ruling last December found the government was violating the rights of two innocent UK citizens whose DNA details continue to be held .
Peter Mahy , a solicitor who represented one of the men , said : " We have probably had a thousand calls from people in similar circumstances since the ruling in December , and many thousands since we started acting for these clients five years ago .
" The fact that it got to the House of Lords and got chucked out then went to Europe and all 17 judges ruled in our favour shows the massive gulf between the British authorities and other countries . "
Following the European decision the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , promised to consult on bringing greater flexibility and fairness to the system , and raised the prospect that some people 's details could be removed over time .
Peter Neyroud , the NPIA chief executive , told a Lords committee last year that the database " continued to grow in significance as a national intelligence resource " .
In a separate development , five police forces are appealing against an Information Tribunal decision last July that they must destroy decades - old criminal records because they are no longer relevant .
People whose data was stored in criminal records complained after their history showed up in Criminal Records Bureau checks when they applied for jobs .
The forces are Humberside , Northumbria , Staffordshire , Greater Manchester and West Midlands .
' I am blackmarked for life '
John Webb , 47 , from Hull , runs a paragliding business and was in the army for 20 years .
When he applied for clearance to work with children , a minor conviction surfaced , dating back to a fairground trip when he was 16 .
" One of my friends had some metal discs the size of 1p or 10 p pieces , and he put them into one of the slot machines which allegedly short - circuited , " he said .
The friends were taken to a police station , and he admitted attempted theft and minor criminal damage to the machine .
He says police said his details would only be kept until he was 18 .
" I felt surprise , shock , horror and disgust at my being portrayed as convicted of attempted theft and criminal damage , " Webb said of the disclosure .
" Although I accept what happened in the incident was wrong , I consider that by today 's standards what I did would be considered more of a juvenile prank .
" I do not have a problem with the police holding the information .
It is how it has been used .
The conviction has nothing to do with children and ... 31 years later it is still holding me back .
I could not emigrate to Canada , for example .
I am pretty sure my information has now been stepped down , meaning it wo n't appear on a CRB check again , but it is too late .
I am blackmarked for life . "
• In 1984 , a 16 - year - old , who has not been identified , was fined £ 15 for stealing a 99 p packet of meat from Marks & Spencer .
Twenty - two years later and working as a care assistant , the conviction came up in a CRB check .
" I told my manager that I had completely forgotten about the incident , which I had .
I was left with the impression that I could well lose my job , " he said .
He kept the job but his position was downgraded the following year and his salary cut .
He blames the check .
" I am devastated that it has been disclosed to my employer , as I have no idea who may now know about this matter . "
• Kylie Smith was 14 when she was attacked by a girl she had known at school .
In defending herself , she pushed the girl to the ground .
Three days later , she was arrested .
" I was accused of kicking her , which I denied because I had not done it , but the sergeant said if I did not admit to kicking I would have to go to court .
However , if I did admit it I would be given a reprimand and be allowed to go home . "
Four years later , she began working as a social care assistant , but a Criminal Records Bureau check led to her employment being terminated .
She took the complaint to the information commissioner , who ordered the caution to be removed from the register .
• John Cann intervened after he saw a drunken man trying to smash a woman 's car windscreen and drag her out .
The man turned on Cann , of Twickenham , west London , who laid him out with one punch .
Despite witness testimony , police arrested Cann .
It was only after MP involvement that his DNA sample was removed from the database .

Creation science is branch of science which sets out to show that supernatural creation of the material universe by God is consistent and compatible with the available scientific evidence .
Being in the realm of origins science , creation science is a historical science . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Most advocates of creation science believe the earth is about 6,000 years old , and they publish scientific evidence supporting this view ( See , for example , Counterexamples to an Old Earth ) .
The ongoing discovery of hundreds of living fossils correlates well with creation science but finds no answer in Darwinian theory .
[ 5 ]
In addition , scientists in the discipline of creation science state that the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics argue against an eternal universe .
They also claim that these laws point to the universe being created by God . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ]
Creation scientists also assert that naturalistic processes alone cannot account for the origin of life and that the theory of evolution cannot account for the various kinds of animals and plants .
Both evolutionary scientists and young earth creation scientists believe that speciation occurs ; however , young earth creation scientists state that speciation generally occurs at a much faster rate than evolutionists believe is the case . [ 9 ]
Creation Ministries International , a leading biblical creation science organization , declared :
“ Creationist research is having a global effect that is worrying the atheists and secularists of this world .
They have had it all their own way for over a century but things are slowly changing .
For almost twenty five years now , Journal of Creation has been publishing cutting - edge creationist research that has been fueling the war against evolution , creating little fires all around the world , including Great Britain .
Atheist evangelist , Prof Richard Dawkins , speaking at the 20th anniversary of the Edinburgh International Science Festival in April 2008 , said the rise of creationism in British schools raised a serious problem for science teachers .
It is a very worrying trend , ’ he said , ‘ and I think a lot of it has come over from America and Australia . ’[ 10 ] ”
Creation Science and Genetic Programs and Biological Information
For a more detailed treatment , see Intelligent design .
Scientists in the area of creation science and intelligent design advocates state the genetic code , genetic programs , and biological information argue for an intelligent cause in regards to the origins question . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]
Dr. Werner Gitt , former director and Professor of Information Systems at the prestigious German Federal Institute of Physics and Technology ( Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt ) , wrote that human beings are the most complex information processing systems on earth .
Dr. Gitt estimated that the human body processes thousands of times more information than all the world 's libraries contain . [ 14 ]
Dr. Gitt has written several points regarding the origin of biological information :
In his work In the Beginning Was Information Dr. Gitt stated that “ There is no known law of nature , no known process and no known sequence of events which can cause information to originate by itself in matter . ” [ 15 ]
Dr. Gitt argued that the density and complexity of DNA information is millions of times larger than mankind 's current technology and this means a supremely intelligent being was the author of this information . [ 16 ]
Similarly , Dr. Stephen C. Meyer in his 1996 essay The Origin of Life and the Death of Materialism , wrote that " the information storage density of DNA , thanks in part to nucleosome spooling , is several trillion times that of our most advanced computer chips . [ 17 ]
Gitt stated that the author of the information encoded into the DNA molecule , who constructed the molecular biomachines to encode , decode and run the cells was supremely intelligent . [ 18 ]
Dr. Gitt asserted that because information is a nonmaterial entity and does not originate from matter , the author of biological information must be nonmaterial ( spirit ) . [ 19 ]
Dr. Walt Brown concurs in regards to the supernatural origin of biological information and states that the genetic material that controls the biological processes of life is coded information and that human experience tells us that codes are created only by the result of intelligence and not merely by processes of nature . [ 20 ]
Dr. Brown also asserts that the " information stored in the genetic material of all life is a complex program .
Therefore , it appears that an unfathomable intelligence created these genetic programs . " [ 21 ]
To support his creation science view regarding the divine origin of genetic programs , Dr. Walt Brown cites the work of David Abel and Professor Jack Trevors who wrote the following :
“ No matter how many " bits " of possible combinations it has , there is no reason to call it " information " if it does n't at least have the potential of producing something useful .
What kind of information produces function ?
In computer science , we call it a " program . "
Another name for computer software is an " algorithm . "
No man -made program comes close to the technical brilliance of even Mycoplasmal genetic algorithms .
Mycoplasmas are the simplest known organism with the smallest known genome , to date .
How was its genome and other living organisms ' genomes programmed ?
- David L. Abel and Jack T. Trevors , “ Three Subsets of Sequence Complexity and Their Relevance to Biopolymeric Information , ” Theoretical Biology & Medical Modelling , Vol. 2 , 11 August 2005 , page 8 [ 22 ] [ 23 ] ”

Creation Scientist Successfully Predicts Planetary Magnetic Fields
Using a young earth creation model , physicist Russ Humphreys successfully predicted the strength of planetary magnetic fields while Darwinists failed . [ 24 ]
Since Humphreys ' first success with the Voyager II results on Uranus and Neptune , [ 25 ] subsequent explorations yielded additional successes for Mercury . [ 26 ]
Dr. Donn Chapman invited Dr. Humphreys on the Origins TV series presenting his theory . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
Other recent successful predictions were that Pluto would show active geology , it 's atmospheric escape rate would be too great for millions of years , and that Pluto 's moons would not yield evidence for being formed from collision . [ 29 ]
This was confirmed by the New Horizons flyby . [ 30 ]

The effect of evolutionism / atheism / agnosticism on the Western World and the world at large was mitigated by the growth of modern creationism and Christian apologetics in the latter half of the 20th century and today global creationism , Christian apologetics and global Christianity is seeing rapid growth .

Creation Science and the Evolutionary Science Community
Creation science is considered as pseudoscience by the majority of the scientific community .
It is also commonly rejected by atheists as they generally hold the worldview of naturalism .
Liberals reject Creation Science with the spurious pretext that it cannot be disproved ( falsifiability ) and therefore cannot be considered " science " . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]
However , Dr. Walt Brown argues that the field of creation science is scientific [ 36 ] and the evolutionists ' objections to creation science are due to their worldviews and preconceptions , rather than on the basis of scientific evidence or the scientific validity of the idea . [ 37 ]
Also , Karl Popper , a leading philosopher of science and originator of falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation of science from nonscience , [ 38 ] stated that Darwinism is " not a testable scientific theory , but a metaphysical research programme . " [ 39 ]
Michael Ruse , a leading Darwinist and philosopher of science , conditionally acknowledged Popper 's statement : " Since making this claim , Popper himself has modified his position somewhat ; but , disclaimers aside , I suspect that even now he does not really believe that Darwinism in its modern form is genuinely falsifiable . " [ 40 ]
However prominent evolutionist J. B. S. Haldane , when asked what would falsify the theory of evolution , said " Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian . "

Some of my friends have a good reason to rejoice today as Pink Floyd ’s “ Comfortably Numb ” gets selected for the best guitar solo of all time .
Though , I am not a devoted listener of Rock Music as such ( despite having a nick name as Rocky 🙂 ) , still I find some of the Pink Floyd songs completely irresistible ; particularly “ The Wall ” hence I too feel good writing this post .
No doubt that Comfortably Numb is a masterpiece but my choice for no 1 would still be the Sweet Child O’ Mine , nothing beats it , just nothing .
Anyway , here comes the video for Comfortably Numb ..
And the list of the top 10 songs with links to their youtube videos .
I just went through all of them once and I must admit that now I am feeling like going back to my home and strum that long untouched guitar of mine .
For Pink Floyd lovers , here is another link from youtube , which has complete 95 minutes of the movie “ Pink Floyd The Wall ”
