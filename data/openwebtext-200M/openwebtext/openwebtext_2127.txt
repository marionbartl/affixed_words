32bit Windowsの管理外領域をRAM
Diskに使う
このところのメモリ価格の下落から、メインメモリは2GBどころか4GB以上も余裕で搭載できるようになった。2GBのDDR2 DIMMを4枚、計8GB分購入したとしても2万円で十分おつりが来る。とはいえ、32bit
OSを使っている限り、OSは約3.5GB以上のメインメモリを認識できず、それ以上のメモリを搭載したとしても無駄になってしまう。64bit
OSを利用すればこの問題も解決するが、ドライバの対応やアプリケーションの互換性などに問題があり、使いたくても使えない状況だ。 しかし、32bit OS で認識できないメインメモリ領域を活用できる手法が見つかり、2ちゃんねるのWindows板を中心に話題となっている。その手法とは、「
Gavotte Ramdisk 」というRAM
Disk作成ツールを利用し、メインメモリのOS管理外領域にRAM
Diskを作ってしまおうというものだ。 メインメモリを手軽に4GB搭載できるようになってきた頃から、32bit OSが認識できない領域をうまく活用できないものかとさまざまなユーザーによる模索が続いていたが、ことごとく”不可能だ”という結論に達していたように思う。そのため、「RAMディスク友の会」スレッドに、Gavotte Ramdiskを利用して「 2GB×2+1GB×2のメモリを積んで、OS管理メモリ2.87GB( VRAM128MB)+RAMディスク3GBで使用中。」というレスが書き込まれても、その直後は否定的なレスが並んでいた。しかし、レス主によるヒントや、他のユーザーによる成功例が書き込まれるにつれ、徐々に盛り上がりを見せ始め、翌日には軽い祭り状態にまでなった。
ここでの記載をもとに、その方法を紹介しよう。ただ、環境によって若干手順が異なるため、筆者が試して成功した手順をベースに紹介したいと思う。ちなみに、筆者のテスト環境は表に示したとおりだ。
今回のテスト環境 マザーボード MSI P35 Platinum ( BIOS V1.8 ) メインメモ リ
PC2-6400 DDR2 SDRAM 1GB ×4( CFD ELIXIR W2U800 CQ - 1GLZJ×2 ) CPU Celeron Dual - Core E1200 ( 3.2GHzオーバークロック動作 )

・筆者およ びPC Watch編集部は、この記事についての個別のご質問・お問い合わせにお答えすることはできません。 まず 、Windows XPを起動して、Cドライブのルートディレクトリにある「boot.ini」ファイルを編集し、ブートエントリにパラメータ「/PAE」を追記し、再起動(これで、Windows XPの物理アドレス拡張モードが有効となる)。再起動後、Gavotte Ramdiskを入手し、ファイルを解凍。その中にある「ram4g.reg」ファイルをダブルクリックし、レジストリにパラメータを追加。その後「ramdisk.exe」を起動し、右の「InstallRamdisk」ボタンをクリックし、そのまま左下の「OK」ボタンをクリック。これだけで、OS管理外領域全体を利用してRAM
Diskが作成される。 なお、記事末に掲載しているURLは、公式サイトが見つけられなかったため、筆者がダウンロードできたURLであることをご了承いただきたい。

Diskを作成する場合には 、Disk Sizeなどの設定は変更せずに、左下の「 OK」ボタンをクリックすればいい。これで、OS管理外領域全体がRAM
Diskとして確保される 設定メニューには、確保するRAM
Diskの容量を指定する項目もあるが、OS管理外領域にRAM
Diskを作成する場合には、管理外領域よりも少ない容量を指定しておけば、自動的に管理外領域全体を利用してRAM
Diskが確保される。また、管理外領域を超える容量を指定した場合には、足りない容量分だけメインメモリの空き領域から確保されることになる。また、一度設定してしまえば、それ以降はOS起動時に自動的に作成されるようになる。とにかく、あっけにとられるほど簡単に、メインメモリの管理外領域にRAM
Diskが作成される。 RAM Disk作成前は、OSが認識するメインメモリ量が3,407,076Byte、利用可能容量が3,038,080Byteだった
管理外領域にRAM
Diskを作成した後の状態。利用可能容量は3,037,416Byteとほとんど減っていないが、約767MBのRAM
Diskが作成されている RAM Diskの容量 を1GBに指定した場合には、利用可能容量が減っている。管理外領域だけでは容量が足りず、メインメモリの空き領域も利用されていることがわかる
この時点でも筆者はまだ半信半疑だったのだが、タスクマネージャの物理メモリの利用可能容量がRAM
Disk作成前と作成後でほとんど変化がなかったこと(通常のRAM DiskはOSが認識しているメインメモリの空きを利用して作成されるため、RAM
Disk作成後に物理メモリの利用可能領域が確保した容量分減る)と、RAM
Diskをほぼ埋め尽くす量のデータを書き込み、そのデータをHDDに書き戻して書き込み前のデータと比較して全く違いがなかったことから、問題ないと結論づけていいだろう。かつて、「SoftRAM95」という、見かけ上のメインメモリ容量を物理容量の2倍(最大5倍とも謳われていた)に増やすというインチキソフトが存在したが、今回はどうやらそのような心配はいらないようだ。
ちなみに、紹介した設定手順は、あくまでも筆者の環境でのもので、他の環境では同じ手順でうまくいかない可能性もある。その後のスレッドの書き込みなどから、BIOSの「Memory Remap Feature 」 を「 Enable 」にする必要があったり(筆者のマザーボードにはこの設定項目はない)、boot.iniに何も追記せずとも問題なかったりと、利用環境によって手順は変わってくるようだが、マザーボードが4GB以上のメモリ搭載をサポートしていれば、ほぼ問題はないようだ。また、OSもWindows XPだけでな くWindows Vistaでも大丈夫なようなので、いろいろと試してみてもらいたい。
さて、こうして確保したRAM
Diskだが、何に使うかが難しいところだ。RAM
Diskはメインメモリ上に確保されるため、アクセス速度は非常に高速だ。実際に筆者の環境では、書き込み/読み出しとも1GB/sec超(4KBのランダム時は70MB/secほど)
と、HDDなどとは比較にならないほどのスピードが実現されていた。
CrystalDiskMark V2.1でアクセス速度をチェックしたところ、シーケンシャルではRead/Writeともに1GB/s超の速度を確認 しかし、PCの電源が落ちたら、RAM
Disk上の全データが失われるという非常に大きな欠点がある。また、OSを再起動してもRAM
Diskは削除され、全データが失われてしまう。つまり、データ保存用途には一切利用できないため、利用用途が大きく制限されてしまい、微妙に思えてしまうわけだ。
それでも用途が全くないわけではない。例えば、テンポラリフォルダやワークフォルダを置いたり、Webブラウザの一時ファイルを保存するフォルダを置くといったことには活用できるだろう。特に、画像編集ソフトのテンポラリフォルダとしてRAM
Diskを指定すれば、劇的な効果が得られるはずだ。逆に、失われると困るデータを置いて利用するのは非常に危険。少なくとも、HDD代わりに利用するということは絶対に避けるべきだ。
とりあえず、何に使えばいいかは今後考えればいいことだ。とにかく、追加投資は全く必要なく、これまで無駄になっていた領域が有効に活用できるようになるというだけで、十分魅力的ではないだろうか。
今回は、実際に試して1日ほどしか経過していないために、設定方法の紹介が中心となったが、今後の使い込みと合わせ、ツール類の充実が進んでより魅力的な活用法が登場してきた場合などに、また改めて紹介したいと思う。
また、末筆ではあるが、この面白さを発見し、広めてくれたスレの参加者一同に感謝したい。

Guy Gets Revenge on Movie - Spoiling Jerk in the Most Sociopathic Type of Way
A new report details a pattern of media manipulation by Bill Donahue and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights -- making them neither religious , nor civil .
In an election year in which three presidential candidates force voters to deal with real bigotry , in the forms of misogyny , racism and ageism , Americans are looking within their hearts , facing generational fears , seeking a less divisive way to discuss issues on which we disagree .
More often than not , mainstream media is no help — over - simplifying issues , over - emphasizing demographics , or worse , stoking the flames of hate with talking heads that shed no light but bring plenty of heat , contributing to division not healing .
Old ways die hard .
Bill Donohue , of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , is one such all heat , no light cable television guest .
Donohue claims to protect Catholics from anti-Catholic bigotry .
In reality , he manufactures controversies , bullies political opponents , and insults people with a world view different from his .
This " defender of religious and civil rights " routinely defames Jews , Muslims , gays , and women — all in the name of Jesus , and believing that he is protecting American values .
In a 43 - page report released Monday , The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights : Neither Religious , Nor Civil , Catholics for Choice documents a pattern of media and political manipulation by Donohue , his organization , and his supporters .
His base of support comes from the most politicized leaders of the Catholic hierarchy , including Cardinal Egan , and a board that reads like a Who ’s Who of partisan Republican politics ( L. Brent Bozell III , Alan Keyes , Kate O’Beirne , Linda Chavez , Kenneth Whitehead , Lawrence Kudlow , Thomas Monaghan , William Simon , Jr. ) .
Far from protecting Catholics from bigotry , Donohue plays the victim card to advance a narrow , socially conservative , hierarchical and patriarchal political view .
" Bill Donohue is a punk and a bully , " says Jon O’Brien , President of Catholics for Choice .
" His style is more suited to being in the ring of the World Wrestling Federation than a television studio .
Donohue is hiding a political and social agenda that has nothing to do with anti-defamation , and nothing to do with Catholicism . "

The report details the history of the Catholic League , its manipulative tactics , alleged successes , and exaggerated membership .
The pattern that emerges from the study demonstrates that Donohue :
Manufactures controversy
Attempts to intimidate enemies
Bullies the opposition
Complains " early and often "
Attacks popular culture
Attempts to silence the loyal opposition
With numerous and detailed examples reaching back more than a decade , the report demonstrates Donohue ’s success at creating controversy around films like Priest and television shows like Nothing Sacred , which simply wrestled with common social issues within Catholic settings , threatening advertisers by taking out full - page ads promising boycotts .
His most recent media manipulation was over the very serious threat to Christianity posed by a Chocolate Jesus .
But Donohue has different standards for how hard he fights when it comes to his friends .
Perhaps the only real anti-Catholic bigotry in recent memory , that Donohue could have genuinely used his bombast against , is the Rev. John Haggee , a supporter of Sen. John McCain .
From the report :
Even when 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain was endorsed by Rev. John Hagee — a notorious anti-Catholic bigot — Donohue ’s criticism was easily muted .
Initially he condemned McCain ’s embrace of Hagee , noting that the pastor ’s descriptions of the Catholic church included phrases like “ the Great Whore ” an “ apostate church , ” the “ anti-Christ ” and a “ false cult system . ”
But unlike his merciless attacks on Kerry and other Democratic candidates , Donohue simply called for McCain to “ retract his embrace of Hagee . ”
After several days , McCain issued a pseudo - apology : “ I repudiate any comments that are made , including Pastor Hagee ’s , if they are anti-Catholic or offensive to Catholics . ”
Donohue ’s reaction ? :
“ As far as the Catholic League is concerned , this case is closed . ”
This response is in marked contrast to his treatment of Democratic candidates .
No full page ads .
No demands the media expose Rev.
Hagee in weeks of looping cable coverage as they did Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
No , when it came to someone calling Catholicism a " whore - religion , " Bill Donohue was about as silent as it is possible for him to be .
" There is no doubt that , if you look at the list of targets Donohue has
chosen over the years , they play partisan favorites in many ways , "
O’Brien says .
" This is no where close to being a Catholic
anti-defamation league . "
As the report suggests , Catholic candidate John Kerry did n’t get off so easliy in 2004 — and all he did was express honest political views that differed from Donohue’s .
From the report :
As John M. Swomley , a noted researcher on the religious right said , the Catholic League “ redefines religious and civil rights as opposites to those normally understood as constitutional rights . ”
In other words , an individual ’s freedom of speech or expression is trumped by Donohue ’s right not to be offended by speech that challenges his brittle worldview .
The report continues :
… Donohue ’s rhetoric insists that : a ) non-Catholics have no right to participate in this debate and any non-Catholics who do so are inherently anti-Catholic ( this despite the widespread influence that the Catholic church has in society at large on non-Catholics through its provision of education and health care , and vigorous lobbying of public officials on issues of concern to the church , such as abortion ) ; and b)
Catholics who engage in such debate are by definition “ bad ” Catholics who are out to destroy the church and therefore have no legitimate role in the debate .
Catholics for Choice hopes that the report will serve as a " wake up call " to the media , says O’Brien .
He acknowledges that changes in news consumption habits and economic factors challenge mainstream media .
But , says O’Brien , " they can at least control for quality .
Most people want to leave a program knowing more at the end than when you sat down to watch , and with Donohue you always know less .
Conservative talk radio and Fox News pioneered this type of interview as entertainment and too many producers followed their lead . "
Donohue recently took aim at new media , targeting Rewire ’s own Amanda Marcotte , author of It ’s a Jungle Out There : The Feminist Survival Guide to Politically Inhospitable Environments .
Marcotte famously left the John Edwards for President campaign after Donohue criticized a blog post she ’d written six months earlier on Pandagon , before being affiliated with the campaign .
" Bill Donohue conflated genuine critique of dogma in a political context with prejudice against believers , most of whom also disagree with that dogma , " Marcotte said .
Marcotte learned of Donohue ’s attack when AP reporter Nedra Picker asked her to comment on a Catholic League press release .
" Fifteen minutes after she asked for my comment , the story was on the wire , indicating she never had any intention of getting my side , " says Marcotte .
" I ’ve since learned she has a reputation for brainlessly publishing right wing press releases as though they were facts .
Frankly , I was impressed by how easy the character assassination was for Donohue , and how complicit mainstream media was . "
" I ’m an astute defender of religious liberty .
It was clear to me that Donohue was offended by a critique of Catholic teachings , but it is morally bankrupt to equate that with anti-Catholic bigotry .
I do n’t agree with everything in the Koran , but that does n’t mean I ’m bigoted toward Muslims , " Marcotte says .
Where was Donohue ’s outrage for the six months the post in question had been published ?
Why did he wait until Marcotte was affiliated with Sen. John Edwards campaign to raise the issue ?
For Marcotte , and fellow blogger / Donohue target Melissa McEwan , Donohue ’s publicity stunt turned even uglier after the national media frenzy .
Threats of sexual violence and death filled their email boxes , including two threats so serious they were turned over to the FBI .
One Donohue devotee went so far as to pound violently on McEwan ’s front door for ten minutes .
These are the very real results of Bill Donohue ’s tactics .
Not only does he inspire others to make threats , he also carries with him an aura of violence .
The report explains that former Catholics for Choice President Frances Kissling " admitted that after a few run-ins with Donohue she
did n’t want to appear with him because she felt threatened by him :
‘He
never physically threatened me , but I felt like I was in the presence
of an abuser , ’ she said . "
And Mark Silk , director of Trinity College’s
Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life , told CFC , “ He ’s a thug .
He reverts to bullying because he thinks that ’s
what the job entails . ”
Donohue seems to drop even the pretense of anti-defamation concerns when he speaks of other religions .
The report quotes Donohue :
“ Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular .
It ’s not a secret , OK ?
And I ’m not afraid to say it . ” ( Scarborough Country , Dec. 8 , 2004 ) “ Now , in this country , we are civilized .
We do n’t appreciate it when somebody sticks it to you in the name of freedom of speech , sir .
We condemn it .
But over there , they take the uncivilized approach .
And then they wonder why so many people do n’t trust the Muslims when it comes to liberty , because they will abuse it . ”
( Scarborough Country , Feb. 9 , 2006 )
By no means does Bill Donohue , or the Catholic League , represent the views of most Catholics .
" For most Catholics , this sort of extremist discourse has no relation to their life , " O’Brien says .
" Catholics are not jumping up and down because there is no need for anti-defamation as there once was .
Catholics in good conscience ignore Donohue , just as in good conscience most use contraception , vote pro-choice , and get along with their neighbors of different faiths . "
In the report , a priest says it best :
“ As a Christian , a Catholic priest , I stand in opposition to any and all hateful speech used by anyone , especially when they do so in the name of Jesus .
I do not believe that one can claim to be a disciple of Jesus and at the same time deride , mock , insult , or threaten violence against another person …
One cannot proclaim the love of Jesus while cursing one ’s neighbor …
To continually use hateful , crude , violent language is indicative of what dwells within one ’s heart .
Mr. Donohue speaks only for himself and not the Catholic church . ” — Father Jeff Gatlain ( John Amato , “ A Catholic priest stands tall against Bill Donohue , ” Crooks and Liars.com , April 5 , 2007 ) .
As Americans consider the issues that matter most in this presidential campaign , and look within their hearts to confront and resolve bias they may find toward women , people of color , senior citizens , or people of differing beliefs , sexual orientations , economic or educational status , it is critical to discern real bigotry from fake .
We must use this election to see through the political and media manipulation , including the sort Bill Donohue has built his career on , and that social conservatives have used to hijack our democracy .
Mainstream media must look beyond the easy , entertaining aspects of bombastic television guests like Donohue , when in fact real bigotry does exist , and help shape a national dialog that brings us together as Americans .
Media should make the effort toward " quality control " , as O’Brien suggested , and include genuine intellectual tension between differing philosophies which is important in our democracy .
" Genuinely smart people like George Weigle and Kate O’Beirne who are capable of vigorous intellectual debate , but with whom I disagree , " O’Brien says , " have their credibility called into question by lending it to such an extremist organization that uses such vile tactics .
People do n’t want screaming accusations and distortions . "
With Bill Donohue and the Catholic League , that ’s all you get .
j Query UI 1.5b : New API , more features , huge performance boost
Posted on by
Hey everybody ,
The jQuery team is proud to release the first beta release of the new upcoming version of UI , jQuery UI 1.5 !
It has been a long path to this release – originally intended to be a bugfix release , it was growing into something we just could n’t call 1.0.1 , not even 1.1 , no , it ’s so damn delicious we had to call it 1.5 .
j Query UI 1.5 is a complete overhaul of the library – many of the components have been completely rewritten from scratch to improve overall stability and performance , and we finally managed to settle on a unified API for all components .
So let ’s get straight to a list of all the changes :
Unified API
The API has been updated for all UI components .
It should now be very easy to use other plugins if you ’re familiar with one of them .
There is only one exposed method for every plugin –
All other methods are called by passing in a String into the exposed method , the initialization of the plugin works by giving on a options hash as first argument .
You can now change and get all options at a later point if you want to by using the new data method .
Basic example for draggables :
$ (..) .draggable ({...} ) ; // Initialize the draggable
$ (.. ) .draggable ( " disable " ) ; // Disable the draggable
$ (..).data(" cursor.draggable " , " move " ) // Change the cursor during drag to ' move '
Updated and revised documentation
The documentation in the jQuery Wiki has been completely updated to reflect the recent changes .
We also made sure all callbacks and its arguments are documented this time .
Drag & Drop : Snapping , Relative dragging
Draggables and Droppables have been completely refactored .
It might now be the most non-destructive drag & drop implementation ever :
The css position ’s value will not be changed except for ‘ static ’ :
That means that elements , that were static or relative , will not be forced into absolute positioning , which often destroyed layouts , especially when dealing with floats .
Some options have been renamed to better be recognized : preventionTimeout becomes delay , preventionDistance becomes distance .
Also , a new option plugin has been added :
The snap plugin .
Remember the docking Winamp windows ?
Yes , you can do that now with UI draggables – just set “ snap ” to a selector to select all elements you want to snap to and you ’re ready to go .
Of course , you can also configure it to your needs using snapTolerance and snapMode .
Slider : Ranges , multiple handles and accessibility
The slider was n’t refactored , but has been completely rewritten from scratch .
While it ’s still almost backwards compatible , it ’s now very stable and simpler than ever :
The moveTo method now only takes two arguments :
The value you want to move the handle to and optionally the index of the handle you want to move .
Want to retrieve a specific handle value ?
No problem , just call $ (..) . slider ( “ value ” , index ) .
Even better , the slider now is completely keyboard accessible :
You can now tab and focus each slider handle seperately and move its position using the left / right keys .
We also improved support for using the mouse : Clicking into a empty area now moves the focused handle to the clicked position , regardless on how many handles you have .
For those of you searching for advanced usage , the slider now supports ranges :
Just set the option “ range ” to true and make sure you have two handles , and the script will create a visible range between these two sliders that can be styled individually .
The script even makes sure that you cannot create negative ranges .
Sortables : Connected sortables , serialization and more
Rewritten as well , the sortables now support a wide range of features you already know from draggables : cursor , zIndex , revert , opacity , axis , handles , containment and scrolling .
Additional to that , you can now serialize your items to a url hash , and you now have the often requested ability to connect multiple sortables , so you can drag a node from one sortable to another .
and there ’s more !
This is just an excerpt of the plugins I personally was involved in – the final release will come with an official changelog – but most of the other plugins have been refactored as well , with tons of new features in datepicker , tabs , accordion , resizables and more .
.. and less !
Preparing for our sister library Enchant , we removed the magnifier and the shadow plugin and moved it to Enchant .
Worry not , you can find them in our SVN trunk under trunk / fx .
Additionally , the table sorter component has been removed because of API and roadmap incompabilities .
There will soon be a grid component that includes most of its functionality .
… and countless bugfixes
We could have made it easy for us , just rewrite everything and delete all bug tickets of 1.0 because it ’s not possible to track down anymore , but we did not :
All issues coming in for the 1.0 release have been adressed and solved .
For everything that has changed in this release , please consult the documentation or look for it in the code .
Remember this is a beta release – expect things to be buggy and unstable ( but better than 1.0 : P ) .
Also , you would do us a great favor if you report any issues to our bug tracker .
Now go ahead and grab it here : http://ui.jquery.com or directly from our google code page : jquery.ui-1.5b.zip .
For this release , we deactivated the downloader – so please download the zip package and include what you need .
You can read about the dependancies in the documentation .
Thanks to all the contributors who made this release possible – I will thank each of you individually in the final release notes , I ’m too lazy and too tired to do it twice :)
See you again in about two weeks !
How do you catch a WIMP ?
No , I ’m not talking about bullying the weakest kid in class , I ’m talking about Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ( those WIMPs ) .
Well , it is n’t easy .
Although they are “ massive ” by definition , they do not interact with the electromagnetic force ( via photons ) so they cannot be “ seen ” and they do not interact with the strong nuclear force , so they can not be “ felt ” by atomic nuclei .
If we cannot detect WIMPs via these two forces , how can we possibly ever hope to detect them ?
After all , WIMPs are theorized to be flying through the Earth without hitting anything , they are that weakly interacting .
But sometimes , they might collide with atomic nuclei but only if they collide head - on .
This is a very rare occurrence , but the Large Underground Xenon ( LUX ) detector will be buried 4,800 feet ( 1,463 meters , or nearly a mile ) underground in an old South Dakota goldmine and scientists are hopeful that when an unlucky WIMP bumps into a xenon atom , a flash of light will be captured , signifying the first ever experimental evidence of dark matter …
Galaxies observed from Earth have some strange qualities .
The biggest problem for cosmologists has been to explain why galaxies ( including the Milky Way ) appear to have more mass than can be observed by counting stars and accounting for interstellar dust alone .
In fact , 96 % of the Universe ’s mass can not be observed .
22 % of this missing mass is thought to be held in “ dark matter ” ( 74 % is held as “ dark energy ” ) .
Dark matter is theorized to take on many forms .
Massive Astronomical Compact Halo Objects ( astronomical bodies containing ordinary baryonic material that cannot be observed ; like neutron stars or orphaned planets ) , neutrinos and WIMPS all are thought to contribute toward this missing mass .
Many experiments are in progress to detect each contributor .
Black holes can be indirectly detected by observing the interactions in the centre of galaxies ( or gravitational lensing effects ) , neutrinos can be detected in huge tanks of fluid buried deep underground , but how can WIMPs be detected ?
It seems a WIMP detector needs to take a leaf out of the neutrino detector ’s books – it needs to start digging .
To avoid interference from radiation such as cosmic rays , low energy detectors such as neutrino “ telescopes ” are buried well below the Earth ’s surface .
Old mine shafts make ideal candidates as the hole is already there for the instrumentation to be set up .
Neutrino detectors are huge containers of water ( or some other agent ) with highly sensitive detectors positioned around the outside .
One such example is the Super Kamiokande neutrino detector in Japan which contains a vast amount of ultra-purified water , weighing in at 50,000 tons ( pictured left ) .
As a weakly interacting neutrino hits a water molecule in the tank , a flash of Cherenkov radiation is emitted and a neutrino is detected .
This is the basic principal behind the new Large Underground Xenon ( LUX ) detector that will use 600 pounds ( 272 kg ) of liquid xenon suspended in a 25 foot high tank of pure water .
If WIMPs exist beyond the realms of theory , it is hoped that these weakly interacting massive particles will collide head - on with a xenon atom , and like their light - weight cousins , emit a flash of light .
Robert Svoboda and Mani Tripathi , UC Davis professors , have secured $ 1.2 million in National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and U.S. Department of Energy funding for the project ( this is 50 % of the total required ) .
When compared with the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) costing billions of Euros to build , LUX is a highly economic project considering the scope of what it might discover .
Should there be experimental evidence of a WIMP interaction , the consequences will be enormous .
We will be able to begin to understand the origins of WIMPs and their distribution as the Earth sweeps through the possible dark matter halo that is indirectly observed to exist in the Milky Way .
Detecting dark matter “ would be the biggest deal since finding antimatter in the 1930s . ” – Professor Mani Tripathi , LUX co-investigator , UC Davis .
The gold mine in South Dakota was closed in 2000 and in 2004 work began to develop the site into an underground laboratory .
LUX will be the first large experiment to be housed there .
It is hoped that the installation will start late summer , after water has been pumped out of the mine .

A change in the law could mean mediums , psychics and healers face prosecution if they cannot justify their claims .
Spiritualists are delivering a mass petition to Downing Street and complaining that a genuine religion is being discriminated against .
Madame Sosostris , famous clairvoyante ,
Had a bad cold , nevertheless
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe ,
With a wicked pack of cards .
Whether it 's TS Eliot or Shirley Ghostman , the world of the medium has been gently drizzled with ridicule for some decades .
But now psychics , healers and spiritualists fear a new threat .
Not gentle ribbing , but the long arm of the law .
Parliament is about to debate measures that will see all forms of paid - for paranormal activities fall under the new Consumer Protection Regulations .
As well as tackling a raft of more mundane commercial sharp practice , these regulations will also replace the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 .
SPIRITUALISM
Seven principles Practised since 19th Century Believe in god Believe contact with dead is possible Many mediums are not spiritualists
And some mediums are not happy .
Under the old legislation , it had to be proven that any accused psychic was setting out to commit a fraud .
The first case was a man in 1952 on a charge that he did in " purporting to act as a spiritualistic medium , unlawfully use a certain fraudulent device , namely , a length of cheesecloth " .
He was acquitted , setting a pattern for the last 50 years of very few prosecutions .
Under the new laws , some mediums feel they will be obliged to prove what they do .
And when you 're in the business of contacting spirits in the afterlife , that 's not easy .
At Battersea Spiritualist Church , the new laws mean visiting medium Bill Rae is peppering his session of clairvoyance - for which there is only a voluntary collection - with disclaimers along the lines of " this is not science " and " this is just an experiment " .
Spirit world
The clairvoyancy session is like a game of psychic battleships .
Rae fires off little salvos .
Most shots miss , but many hit , generating wonder in the congregation .
He speaks to a man a few rows back .
Rae , who receives nothing more than expenses for these sessions , has seen a man in the " spirit world " .
He thinks it might be the subject 's father .
The man nods and Rae continues .
NEW REGULATIONS
Aimed at unfair sales and marketing practices Follow EU directive Will need approval by Parliament Centre on " reasonable expectations of the average consumer " Persistent breaches punishable by enforcement order Breach of order punishable by two years in prison or fine
The medium describes the man 's father as jolly and there is agreement from the subject .
Now Rae sees a name .
George .
But the man knows no George .
" Georgette ? "
No , the man replies .
Then the medium wants to establish where the man 's father is from .
He sees a link to Jamaica .
No , says the man .
Now Rae sees the word " Windward " .
The Windward Isles , he tentatively ventures .
No , says the man again .
But Rae is unperturbed .
He guesses that the man is from an island .
No again .
Then Rae has a purple patch .
He asks about the name Gregory .
The man 's brother is called Gregory .
And he infers that the man 's father died of prostate cancer , which is correct .
The subject comes from Washington DC and his family have been there for generations .
But he is inspired by Rae 's references to his brother and father and seems totally convinced .
Talking to Rae , it is immediately apparent that he has a strong and genuine belief in what he is doing .
Healing hands
Another person who is concerned over the new rules is Alison Lyndle , a spiritual healer , shaman and " space clearing consultant " who operates out of an anonymous interwar mock Tudor house in Harrow .
Contrary to the cliche of the heavily bejewelled healer , Lyndle 's hands are unadorned with rings .
And yet she , and the people who come to see her , believe they have the power to heal .
The patient lies on a GP surgery style bed as Lyndle lays hands on the patient 's head for more than half an hour .
Hearing just the chirping of birds and the gentle thrum of the central heating boiler turning on and off , it is easy to see how both sceptic and believer would feel better afterwards .
Derek Acorah is one of the country 's better - known psychics " I agree that there needs to be something in place to stop people who are fraudulent , " she says .
" I get e-mails from people from time - to - time saying they have paid thousands of pounds to people . "
But she says that she fears that the law would open up the possibility that sceptics could make malicious complaints .
David McEntee - Taylor and his wife Carole have set up the Spiritual Workers Association to protect people like Lyndle and Rae and campaign against the new regulations .
McEntee - Taylor is particularly worried about the effect on spiritualist churches , many of which are held in impromptu venues which must be paid for .
And he is not happy about having to start religious services with a disclaimer , something that most religions would give short shrift to .
" If you believe why should there be a disclaimer ?
Why should it be different for us ? "
And yet the established religious body , the Spiritualists ' National Union - which claims 100,000 adherents - seems unconcerned by the imminent change in the law .
Minister Steven Upton , a spiritual healer and the movement 's public relations head , says regulation to tackle fraudsters is welcome .
" We do n't understand why people are protesting .
If you are claiming you can prove life after death you 've got a problem .
We never guarantee it is going to work .
Trained mediums do n't make false claims . "
Anecdotal evidence Psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman has spent 15 years investigating psychics , healers and mediums and is unconvinced .
" Anecdotal evidence on their abilities is impressive , but if you put it under more scientific conditions , their claims tend to crumble .
[ Now ] they will need to be able to justify the claims they are making . "
But there are many ordinary people who will continue using mediums , and they come from diverse backgrounds .
Lorraine Crighton - Smith , 27 , a journalist from London , saw a medium four years ago when a friend invited one to her house to do readings for a group of seven , professional , 30 - something women .
" He asked ' who 's William , who 's Bill ? ' .
I replied , ' he's my dad ' and he said ' something 's going to happen to your dad sweetheart ' .
" I suppose I did worry for a while but I was more impressed he had mentioned a name familiar to me than I was concerned .
He was spot on when he was talking about what I was like , my personality traits . "
The Office of Fair Trading says enforcement of the new regulations will not target sessions like this or churches , instead being more likely to be used against foreign mass mailshot fraudsters extracting large sums of money .
But despite the protestations of officialdom , the medium community has enough foresight to see potential problems ahead .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I see the thin end of the wedge of persecution of spritualists , druidary , hedge witches and all those who do not practice Christian based religions .
Government meddling in religion can never be welcome in any civilised society
Phil , London Proper religions do n't charge for advice , and these new regulations only cover paid - for services .
I do n't think spiritualism is being picked on , only those rogues who are happy to fleece vulnerable people .
Lucy Jones , Manchester
If we 're going to ask psychics to prove their beliefs , should n't someone pass a law requiring the Pope to prove he can speak to God .
Perhaps the government should just give us all a bit more credit , we 've all seen Derren Brown show us how easy it is to fake these things and lets be honest , the vast majority of people take it all with a pinch of salt .
However , that does n't mean that a bit of faith and belief can't be just as powerful as the best drugs .
Just because we do n't understand how something works , does n't mean it does n't work .
Gareth , Swansea
It makes me feel sick and angry to read accounts of cold readings or to see " mediums " at work .
Cold reading , whether done as a con trick or done " in good faith " ( ie equal credulousness on the part of both the medium and the mark ) is about fishing ; people remember the " surprising " hits and forget the wild misses .
It 's human nature to want to believe our loved ones live on elsewhere , and to want to seek comfort ; taking advantage of it in this way is despicable .
It 's a confidence trick and so more power to this law .
Tom Morewood , London , UK
As someone who does not have ' traditional ' religious belief I do find the above worrying .
Not because I work in the field of psychics etc , I actually have a very normal job , but because of the worry this law could mean to those who do not follow an " accepted " religion .
Catholics believe that the wine and the wafer become Christs blood and body .
Are they going to be made to back it up ?
Or will they just have to offer disclaimers as well ?
I do believe there are some workers out there that prey on the vulnerable and any spiritualist , shaman or witch who truly had a religions belief would not do so .
Jenny , UK Mediums claim to speak to the dead , but all of their apparent " skills " can also be attributed to cold reading , guesswork , trickery , psychology , and the fact most people tend to remember the hits and forget about all the misses .
TV mediums like Derek Acorah also have the advantage of careful editing to eliminate any embarrassing errors .
So is n't it reasonable to ask these psychics to provide some real evidence that what they do is genuine , especially since they tend to deal with - and take money from - the bereaved and vulnerable ?
Chris K , Cheltenham UK
I have plenty of friends who are Christians , Muslims , and practising Wiccans , I personally do not believe in any , but just because I do not believe does not give me the right to challenge them about the realism of there beliefs .
I am disgusted that Parliament would even debate such a thing , after all mediums , psychics and healers are human , they make mistakes , just because a few mistakes might be made does not mean that a religion should be belittled and questioned in the manor that parliament so shamefully is debating .
It is the fool that believes an entire religion should be belittled because of a single person .
. Sheryl Butler , Wallasey , England .
By the same logic they should insist that all religions prove that their God exists before accepting donations , otherwise it 's obtaining money by false pretences .

What are these ?
KANGDING , China ( Reuters ) - Tibetans in China ’s tense southwestern province of Sichuan said on Friday they believed police had killed several people in anti-Chinese riots there this week , disputing official claims none died .
China ’s official Xinhua news agency reported overnight that police shot and wounded four protesters this week in a heavily ethnic Tibetan part of the province , where protests broke out after anti-Chinese riots in neighboring Tibet a week ago .
The unrest has alarmed China , keen to look its best in the run-up to the August 8 - 24 Olympic Games in Beijing when it hopes to show the world it has arrived as a world power .
China ’s crackdown has drawn international criticisms , with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling the situation in Tibet a challenge to the world ’s conscience and Germany urging Beijing to allow foreign observers in the region .
China says 13 “ innocent civilians ” died in anti-Chinese riots last week in Tibet ’s capital , Lhasa , after police broke up earlier peaceful protests led by monks .
Exiled Tibetans say as many as 100 Tibetans have died .
Chinese mountaineers chosen to take an Olympic torch to the top of Mount Everest said their journey there through Tibet would be a show of national unity against exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama , whom Beijing accuses of instigating the unrest .
“ We shall go all out to ensure the smooth movement of the torch relay .
We must strengthen ethnic unity while hostile forces try to drive a wedge between ethnic groups , ” Yin Xunping , an official with the Tibet mountaineering effort , was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency .
Tensions remain high in Tibet , Sichuan and other neighboring areas where the government has poured in troops .
Kangding , a heavily Tibetan town in Sichuan and a gateway to the restive region , was crowded with troops , some on patrol , some loudly practicing martial arts moves in the town square .
Drivers refused to travel into tense mountain towns .
“ I ’m in this to make money , but no matter how much you pay me I wo n’t go that way , ” one Kangding driver said .
One ethnic Tibetan resident of Aba prefecture , where rioting began on Sunday , said he believed several died when police fired on protesters attacking officials and state buildings .
“ Everyone here believes that our people died , maybe 10 or more , ” he told Reuters , asking not to be named , fearing punishment for talking to reporters .
TROOPS KEEPING FOREIGNERS OUT
Troops and anti-riot police have set up roadblocks and are keeping out foreigners .
“ With all the troops that have gone up there , it ’s under control now .
They have tried for all those years to gain independence and failed .
So it wo n’t happen .
Not now -- it ’s impossible , ” said Ran Hongkui , a Chinese shopkeeper on the route passed by convoy of armed police heading west .
China ’s response to the rioting has triggered international criticism and some calls to boycott the Games opening ceremony .

Pelosi , who met the Dalai Lama in his exile home in the Indian town of Dharamsala , said Tibet was “ a challenge to the conscience of the world ” .
Radio Free Asia , a U.S. - funded broadcaster , said on Thursday up to 2,000 Buddhist monks and laypeople continued to protest in Huangnan Prefecture , Sichuan .
The report could not be verified .
Authorities said they had arrested dozens of people .
The Tibet Daily Web site ( www.tibetdaily.net) published pictures of the most wanted suspects , many photographed in the thick of the rioting and including two men in monks ’ robes .
Slideshow ( 20 images )
Most appeared to be young men .
One looked to be wielding a sword while others were hurling rocks .
State - run Tibet television continued to show footage of last week ’s riots , including scenes of maroon - robed monks throwing rocks at police , protesters kicking in shop fronts and plumes of black smoke from burned - out cars in the local capital Lhasa .
Its newsreaders echoed Beijing ’s insistence that the violence was orchestrated by the “ Dalai clique ” agitating for independence and trying to embarrass China ahead of the Games .
The 72 - year - old Dalai Lama , who fled Tibet in 1959 , says he is against the violence , only wants greater autonomy for his homeland and is willing to travel to Beijing for talks .
The Chinese press has intensified its vilification of the Nobel Peace Prize winner , while Pelosi called for an international probe to clear the Dalai Lama ’s name .
The Tibet Daily called him a “ jackal with a human face and the heart of a beast ” and accused him of “ never giving up hoping to restore their corrupt , dissolute theocracy and their privileges as feudal rulers and serf masters ” .
In a phone call with Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged China for restraint .
Yang told her the Dalai Lama was to blame for the riots .
“ They attempted to exert pressure on the Chinese government , disturb the 2008 Beijing Olympics and sabotage China ’s social stability and harmony , ” Xinhua quoted him as saying .

今日はロフトプラスワン で「 CAMUIロケットまつり」と題して、CAMUIロケットの開発者、北大の永田晴紀先生にいろいろお話を伺った。
CAMUI ロケットとは、燃料にポリエチレン、酸化剤に液体酸素を使う「ハイブリッド方式」の小型ロケットである。大学と小さなメーカーが開発している、今どき珍しい小さなプロジェクトだ。
そのCAMUIロケットの、本格的な開発が始まるまでの苦労話の中で、役人とのやり取りがとても興味深かった。
（記憶で書いているので、間違いもあるかも）
産学連携でロケットを作る、という計画として、補助金をNEDO（経産省系）に出してもらおうとした。ら、評価はとてもいいのに審査には落ちてしまった。いわく。
「 技術的にはすばらしい、また今後産業として成り立っていく可能性もある。んだけれども、ロケットは文科省の管轄なので不採択」。縦割り行政パワー全開。
この結果は 、CAMUIロケット計画の急所を突くものだった。ロケットだからと話を文科省へ持っていけば、「産学連携の計画は経産省の管轄です」と言われるからだ。産学連携で進めようとしていた計画を「経産省の管轄ではない」と言われたため、持っていく場所がなくなった。計画は完全に、宙に浮いてしまった。
その後、植松電機というメーカーの専務、植松努氏が「補助金はあきらめましょう、開発費はうちで持ちますよ」と言ってくれて開発が始まるのだが、ここでまた経産省が出てくる。北海道の経済産業局が補助金を出したいともちかけてきたのだ。
地元の企業が手弁当で、新しいものを開発しようとしている。それを経済産業局が見過ごすわけにはいかない、さぼっていると言われかねないし、という理屈だった。
さらにすごいのはその審査中、永田先生のところに経済産業局の担当者から電話がかかってきた。「審査はほぼ通りそうだが、もうひと声必要だ。そこで、このロケットを使うと石油の節約になります、ということを書いたペーパーを出してくれないか」。
「 そんな、無理ですよ」と永田先生が言えば、先方も「それはわかっている、だけどそういう話を紙一枚でよいから出してくれ、それで審査を通るから」。仕方なく、それらしいことを書き始めた。
「 CAMUI ロケットの燃料であるポリエチレンは、リサイクルのプラスチックで作ったものでもよく石油の節約になる。CAMUIロケットが完成したら、国内で年間1000本は上がるだろう。そういう国が20カ国あれば年間2万本打ち上げることになる。とすればトータルで年間×トンの石油を節約できるだろう」。
永田先生自身が 「誰が読んでも嘘だとわかるでしょ」と言うペーパーであるが、これのおかげで経済産業局の審査は通ってしまったのだった。しかも「省エネルギー枠」という、思いもよらない割り当てである。
さらに 、CAMUIロケット自体の法的な扱いでもエピソードがあった。
CAMUI ロケットの特徴のひとつが、火薬をまったく使わないこと。火薬類取締法にしばられるのを嫌ったからだ。ほかにも、高圧ガスやらなにやらの法律からも完全にフリーなロケットである。「でもそれだと役人さんは不安になるらしく」（永田先生談）、また経産省がロケット計画に手を出すということで文科省（ロケット担当の元祖）や防衛省（ミサイル担当）にも「大丈夫大丈夫」と言える理屈を作ろうとした。
「そこで永田先生、ひとつお願いがあって…少しでいいので、どこかに火薬を使ってくれませんか」。無火薬が売りのCAMUIロケットなのに！
でもなんとか火薬を使わないと、というので永田先生、「パラシュートを開く機構にちょっとだけ火薬を使うことにしました」。
さて、こういう話を聞いてどう思うだろうか。
融通がきかない、 「お役所的対応」の典型という人もいるだろう。
でもそこが彼らのよりどころ、いわば話を通すための理屈なのだ。逆にいえば、お役所のルールにのっとってさえいれば、生活上の感覚では「こんなのでいいんだ!?」と思うようなルートで通ってくれたりする。
お役所の仕事は、お役所の世界観で動いている。お役所の世界観は法律でガッチリ固められていて、その中にうまくおさまらない話は通らない。お役所ルールに合っていればスルリと通る。たとえそれが、ふだんの暮らしの感覚に合わないことであってもだ。
そんなアホなと思うかもしれないが、行政を運営していく方法としてこの方法はなかなかいい。同じ話を同じ理屈でもちかけたとき、役所の人によって「やります」「ダメです」の対応が分かれてしまっては、役所の仕事は回らないからだ。
お役所の世界観やルールは、日本語で書かれている。でもそれは、日常で使う日本語と同じ感覚で読んでしまうと理解できないように思う。裁判所の判決文が、ちょっとした言い回しの違いでニュアンスが大きく変わるのと同じである。
同じ日本語を使う同士でも、よりどころにするルールが違えばコミュニケーションは難しい。だからそこで「お役人には話が通じない」と怒ってみせても仕方がない。だってそれが当たり前だから。むしろこちらが相手＝お役所の世界観を理解し、それに沿って話をするのが、結局はいちばんの近道なのじゃないだろうか。
（それが難しいのはじゅうぶん承知、でもなるべく努力したい）

Or , as the Army surgeon general that 'll be overseeing the program puts it : if an animal like a salamander can regrow a lost tail or limb , " Why ca n't a mammal do the same thing ? "
[ Via
Rutgers , Wake Forest , and the University of Pittsburgh . [ Via Slashdot
Apparently not satisfied with simply building robotic body parts , the Department of Defense has now announced a brand new effort that it hopes will one day allow it to regrow actual body parts .
Dubbed the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine ( or AFIRM ) , the new group will explore the use of stem cell research , among other things , to " reconstruct new skin , muscles and tendons , and even ears , noses and fingers .
"
Not surprisingly , the institute apparently also wo n't be hard up for resources , with it boasting a budget of about $ 250 million for its first five - year period , and it enlisting the help of three universities , including
This is a huge point .
Huge .
Earlier today , Hillary ’s people tried to argue that even if Obama reaches the 2,025 delegates he needs to become our nominee , Hillary will continue to contest the election until Florida and Michigan are seated .
Yeah , only one little problem .
NBC ’s Chuck Todd , who is brilliant and highly respected on such things , just said that you can give Hillary Florida and Michigan – on her terms – and she still loses the nationwide delegate count and the popular vote .
She still loses the nomination .
“ If you threw in both Florida and Michigan , you will still look at a popular vote lead of some 150 to 200,000 .
If you throw in those delegates in her math you will have almost 100 delegate lead there for Obama .
This was a big night because it really almost erases the doubt as far as Florida and Michigan is concerned too .
You can throw those numbers in there and they really do n’t change the math that much for Obama . ” – Chuck Todd , NBC , May 6 , 2008 , 11:40 PM
There is no longer any reason for Hillary to continue in this race other than a desire to destroy Obama and make him lost in the fall so she can run again in 4 years .
This farce needs to be ended now .
Tell them what Architecture 2030 says about coal :
Because coal is the only fossil fuel plentiful and supposedly cheap enough to push the planet to 450 parts per million ( ppm ) of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere .
Because reaching 450 ppm ( or possibly less ) triggers potentially irreversible glacial melt and sea level rise .
Because 53 % of Americans live in and around coastal cities and towns and , beginning with just one meter of sea level rise , many of these cities and towns will be inundated .
Scientists are forewarning that at approx .
450 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere , we will trigger potentially irreversible glacial melt and sea level rise “ out of humanity ’s control . ”
We are currently at 385 ppm , and are increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at approx .
2 ppm annually .
At this growth rate , we will reach 450 ppm in 2035 . . .
In the US , there are over 600 existing coal plants and 151 new coal plants in various stages of development .
Tell them that there is a smarter and better way .
And a cleaner way .
Tell them that mining coal is not only ugly , it ’s dangerous for miners and everyone else .
Tell them to take a close look into a train car full of coal ( as I did yesterday ) and to ask themselves if coal looks like the fuel of the future .
I thought about coal as I noticed a train loaded with coal go by ( I took these photos ) .
I thought about how little most people know about coal yet how politicians and their constituents do n’t have the dangers of coal on their radar .
Some of these dangers are set forth in my earlier post , The Banality of Burning Coal .
I ’ve been told by a man who works with the biggest electric company in St. Louis that each coal burning plant eats an entire train full of coal each day .
That is confirmed by Wikipedia :
Coal is delivered by highway truck , rail , barge or collier ship .
A large coal train called a “ unit train ” may be two kilometers ( over a mile ) long , containing 100 cars with 100 tons of coal in each one , for a total load of 10,000 tons .
A large plant under full load requires at least one coal delivery this size every day .
Most people I speak with resist serious energy conservation as a matter of principle .
Many conservatives belittle conservation , as though it is a matter of weakness .
They scoff at conservation .
When I bring up global warming , they deny it .
When I bring up peak oil , they have no logical response .
They resist energy conservation as if they were 3 year olds whining that they do n’t want to try a new sort of food that their parents put on their plates .
It ’s an irrational emotional resistance ( not that emotions are always irrational ) that is endangering our economy .
Conservation is one - half of the solution out of this big mess .
It ’s time to raise everyone ’s consciousness regarding the dangers of coal ( and other fossil fuels ) and the beauty and efficiency of energy conservation .
Next time someone scoffs at conservation , ask them to explain why conservation is a bad idea .
Ask them why Americans should n’t immediately take steps to cut our wasteful and dangerous energy usage in half .
Ask them why we should n’t drive smaller cars ( or bicycles ) and why we should n’t turn out lights we are n’t using and why we should n’t dry clothes outside .
There are numerous other things you can do , right now .
Dare to take the time to ask your friends who resist conservation why we should n’t try to become smart and efficient in our use of energy so that we do n’t have to resort to dirty and dangerous carbon - based fuels .
All of these things add up to big things like national security and healthy economy .
Not being dependent on oil .
You ’d think that conservatives could understand this .
Tell your friends and acquaintances that there is a better way to create and use energy , but that this way would require the United States to have some sort of energy policy .
Tell them that the United States has no energy policy .
See if they know what a great deal it is to invest in conservation , including the development of zero - carbon - footprint buildings :
Investment in building energy efficiency is surprisingly effective .
A single investment of $ 21.6 billion would replace 22.3 conventional 500 MW coal - fired power plants , reduce annual CO2 emissions by 86.7 million metric tons , save 204 billion cu. ft. of natural gas and 10.7 million barrels of oil each year , save consumers $ 8.46 billion in energy bills annually ( less than a 3 - year simple payback ) and create 216,000 permanent new jobs .
Tell them to go here to read more about coal .
Energy Lifecycle of Nuclear Power
The performance of Nuclear Power can also be measured by calculating the total energy required to build and run a Nuclear Power plant and comparing it to the total energy it produces .
The following set of calculations is also taken from the independently audited , Vattenfall Environmental Product Declaration for its 3090 MW Forsmark power plant .
A more detailed description is here .
Vattenfall have also made available the aggregated data set as a spreadsheet .
You can download it from here
The following table displays the source and the amount of energy required to produce 1 KW - Hr of electricity from the Forsmark power plant .
The table includes the energy used in construction of the plant , mining the Uranium , enriching it , converting it to fuel , disposing the waste and decommissioning the plant .
The Forsmark plant is assumed to run for 40 years .
There is an additional 0.026 grams of Uranium consumed in generating this one KW - Hr of electricity .
This 0.026 grams includes the Uranium used to generate power at Forsmark and the Uranium consumed by the French Nuclear Power plants that produced the electricity that enriched the Forsmark Fuel .
So the Forsmark Plant produces 93 times more energy than it consumes .
Or put another way , the non-nuclear energy investment required to generate electricity for 40 years is repaid in 5 months .
Normalized to 1 GigaWatt electrical capacity , the energy required tothe plant , which amounts to 4 Peta - Joules ( PJ ) , which is repaid in 1.5 months .
The energy required tois also 4 PJ and repaid in 1.5 months .
In total this is less than 0.8 % of the all the electrical energy produced by the plant .
The calculations of the operating energy costs include the energy required to mine and mill the Uranium .
In the case of the Forsmark power plant some of the Uranium is sourced from the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia .
This mine has a rather low Uranium concentration ( 0.05 % by weight ) .
A detailed and audited environmental description of the Olympic Dam mine is available here .
A succinct description of the energy inputs of the mine is here .
These data show that the Olympic Dam mine supplies enough Uranium for the generation of 26 GigaWatt - years of electricity each year ( including the Uranium needed to run the power plants for enrichment ) .
The energy consumed by the the mine is equivalent to 22 % of a GigaWatt - Year .
The energy gain is over a factor of 100 .
The Olympic Dam mine energy cost includes the energy required for mining and smelting it 's huge Copper production .
Another Uranium source for Forsmark is the Rossing Mine in Namibia .
A description of the operations of the mine is available here .
The Rossing mine produced 3037 tonnes of Uranium in 2004 , which is sufficient for 15 GigaWatt - years of electricity with current reactors .
The energy used to mine and mill this Uranium was about 3 % of a GigaWatt - year .
Thus the energy produced is about 500 times more than the energy required to operate the mine .
It is worth noting that the widely quoted paper by Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen and Philip Smith ( SLS ) , which gives a rather pessimistic assessment of the Energy Lifecycle of Nuclear Power , assumes a far larger energy cost to construct and decommission a Nuclear Power plant ( 240 Peta - Joules versus 8 Peta - Joules ( PJ ) ) .
The difference is that Vattenfall actually measured their energy inputs whereas Willem Storm van Leeuwen and Smith employed various theoretical relationships between dollar costs and energy consumed .
This paper also grossly over - estimates the energy cost of mining low - grade Ores and also that the efficiency of extraction of Uranium from reserves would fall dramatically at ore concentrations below 0.05 % .
Employing their calculations predicts that the energy cost of extracting the Olympic Dam mine 's yearly production of 4600 tonnes of Uranium would require energy equivalent to almost 2 one - GigaWatt power plants running for a full year ( 2 GigaWat - years ) .
You can follow this calculation here .
This is larger than the entire electricity production of South Australia and an order of magnitude more than the measured energy inputs .
The Rossing mine has a lower Uranium concentration ( 0.03 % vs 0.05 % by weight ) than Olympic Dam and the discrepancy is even larger in the case of Rossing .
Here SLS predict Rossing should require 2.6 Giga - Watt - Years of energy for mining and milling .
The total consumption of all forms of energy in the country of Namibia is equivalent to 1.5 GigaWatt - Years , much less than the prediction for the mine alone .
Furthermore , yearly cost of supplying this energy is over 1 billion dollars , yet the value of the Uranium sold by Rossing was , until recently , less than 100 million dollars per year .
Since Rossing reports it 's yearly energy usage to be 0.03 GigaWatt - years , SLS overestimates the energy cost of the Rossing mine by a factor of 80 .
Additionally SLS predict that the yield of of Uranium extracted from low grade Ores will fall to 0 at concentrations of 0.0002 % ( 2 ppm ) .
The Olympic Dam mine extracts gold at high efficiency at concentrations of 0.0005 % ( 5 ppm ( parts per million ) ) and there are many other gold mines which produce gold profitably at this concentration .
Given the huge Uranium reserves present at 5 ppm , it unlikely we will ever need mines that operate lower than this .
The energy cost of the Olympic Dam mine is the sum of all the operations for mining Copper , Uranium , Gold and other minerals .
It is therefore the upper limit of the energy cost of extracting the Uranium alone .
The Rossing mine which only produces Uranium , is a better measure of the energy cost future Uranium mines .
It is interesting to see what effect using the correct energy cost of 8 PJ for the construction , decommissioning and waste disposal of a power plants and the measured energy consumption of the Rossing mine has within the methodology of Willem Storm van Leeuwen and Smith .
If we assume that the energy cost of extraction scales inversely with concentration and employ the Rossing experience as a benchmark , ore concentrations as low as 0.001 % ( 10 ppm ) provide an energy gain of 16 .
This also ( and very unrealistically ) assumes no further progress in mining technology or efficiency improvements in Nuclear Power operations over the course of hundreds of years .
As shown here there is an estimated 1 trillion tonnes of Uranium at concentrations of 10 ppm or higher within the Earth 's crust .
This provides a resource over a factor of 300 times greater than predicted by Willem Storm van Leeuwen and Smith to be recoverable .
So once the correct energy cost for plant construction and mining operations are used , the work of Willem Storm van Leeuwen and Smith imply that resource exhastion will not be a problem for Nuclear Power for the foreseeable future .
Storm and Smith have released a rebuttal of this argument .
You can find this rebuttal here .
We have responded in detail to the questions raised by Storm and Smith .
You can find our reponse here .
Storm and Smith have issued a rebuttal to our response .
It is here .
Our answer to this is here
Our additional investigations strengthen the conclusion that there is far more minable Uranium than predicted by Storm and Smith .
Remember that spooky thrill when the Borg were first introduced in Star Trek : The Next Generation ?
They were built up as being the ultimate enemy , or at least an enemy that might be too tough for the starship Enterprise .
And they were scary .
They lived in a giant flying cube and operated as a collection of drones in a hive that cared only for the further enhancement of the colony .
You could throw anything at them you cared to – phasers , photon torpedoes , whatever – and they would simply take the hit , analyze it , and build a new defense .
Loss of individual members did not concern them at all .
They had numbers and cool calculation on their side .
“ You will be assimilated , ” they promised , as matter - of - factly as you please .
They march relentlessly through the galaxies , sucking up entire civilizations as building materials for their own end .
They were as remorseless as they were unstoppable .
What was scariest was their complete lack of interest in individuals .
To be assimilated meant losing your identity and becoming only a means for the further growth of the Borg .
Your body was drained of blood and you were outfitted with all sorts of technical gizmos that allowed for your connection to the Borg network .
Individuals going into the cube were transformed into mechanical extensions of a huge colony , losing their status as individuals .
As I have been reading book after book about globalization , I ca n’t help but think of the Borg .
Individuals – whether persons or companies – are sucked up into the global culture and become mere extensions of it .
You will be plugged into the network , so strap on your gizmos and start taking input and producing output .
If we look into the future we ’re aiming at , we see a world where you can go pretty much anywhere and know exactly the services , languages , customs , and food you can expect to find .
Everywhere will be anywhere .
The Web is the Borg , assimilating distinctive cultures and turning them into functional units in frictionless commerce .
But no ; reading the metaphor in this way does n’t sound right to me .
The forces of globalization are not sinister .
On the whole they are bringing about very favorable conditions for the countries that manage to “ link up . ”
Gaining connectivity with the larger , outside world allows for individuals to break out of poverty ; it allows for more information being shared , and more understanding among peoples ; and it makes it harder for primitive - minded zealots to oppress women or any other group .
Admittedly , it may lead to the flattening of culture , as people start to spend more time tending the net than attending to their own cultural settings .
But , on the other hand , how kind would it be to lock people up in what are often oppressive , poverty - stricken , and disease - ridden societies just so that the rest of us can ooh and ahh over the distinctive features of their culture ?
I am not saying that an internet connection solves everything .
But lacking one , so far as I can see , does more harm than good .
So imagine the Borg ’s brethren race , the Web .
The Web reaches out into every region it finds and invites people to plug in and share information and products with everyone else in the Web .
It does require some homogeneity – all sharing does – but at the same time it rewards innovation and individuals ’ creativity .
It allows for massive databases of knowledge , available to everyone .
It allows for dialogue and discussion and dissent .
The wealth still goes to those who can produce what the masses need or want ( as always ) , but the difference is that now there are broader opportunities for anyone to be the forces of production .
To wade further into Star Trek mythology , maybe the Web is in fact the Federation , a collective where different societies try to work together to everyone ’s advantage .
What they recognize , and the Borg do not , is that fostering innovation and creativity brings greater strength and progress to the collective than does a stubborn insistence upon homogeneity .
Or that ’s what it can be , anyway .
There are dangers .
With all that sharing going on , good guys and bad guys alike can get the information they need to do what they want .
With all those services and jobs shifting around , people will be displaced and left without employable skills .
Moreover , Marx ’s warnings about the ways that capitalism can alienate people from themselves and from one another need also to be heeded .
Joining a worldwide community of innovators also means joining a worldwide field of competitors , and we need to think more about how that will affect human relations .
If all we care about is gaining global notoriety and making money off everyone else , we ’ve got problems , brother .
But – I think — the possible benefits outweigh the possible dangers .
Not that it matters .
The Web is unstoppable .
Like it or not , we have been assimilated .
Former Bill Clinton Staffer says Hillary is Exaggerating Her Experience
Many of us have been wondering exactly what kind of experience Hillary Clinton has that qualifies her on day one to be president that Barack Obama does n’t have .
True she is in her second term as a senator while Obama is only in his first term , but that is the only difference when it comes to actual experience .
Hillary likes to claim that because she is married to a former president she has all this experience .
While it is true that she accompanied Bill across the globe while he met with foreign leaders , she has been grossly exaggerating what her role was as first lady .
Former director of the policy planning office under Bill Clinton , Greg Craig , is now attempting to set the record straight .
According to Craig :
There is no reason to believe , however , that she was a key player in foreign policy at any time during the Clinton Administration .
She did not sit in on National Security Council meetings .
She did not have a security clearance .
She did not attend meetings in the Situation Room .
She did not manage any part of the national security bureaucracy , nor did she have her own national security staff .
She did not do any heavy - lifting with foreign governments , whether they were friendly or not .
She never managed a foreign policy crisis , and there is no evidence to suggest that she participated in the decision - making that occurred in connection with any such crisis .
As far as the record shows , Senator Clinton never answered the phone either to make a decision on any pressing national security issue – not at 3 AM or at any other time of day .
While this is scathing enough , he then goes on to debunk many of the examples that she has given to prove her national security / foreign relations experience .
Northern Ireland : Senator Clinton has said , “ I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland . ”
It is a gross overstatement of the facts for her to claim even partial credit for bringing peace to Northern Ireland .
at no time did she play any role in the critical negotiations that ultimately produced the peace .
As the Associated Press recently reported , “ [ S ] he was not directly involved in negotiating the Good Friday peace accord . ”
Kosovo : Senator Clinton has said , “ I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo . ”
It is true that , as First Lady , she traveled to Macedonia and visited a Kosovar refugee camp .
It is also true that she met with government officials while she was there .
First Ladies frequently meet with government officials .
Her claim to have “ negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo , ” however , is not true .
Her trip to Macedonia took place on May 14 , 1999 .
The borders were opened the day before , on May 13 , 1999 .
Greg Craig goes on to site more inaccuracies in this article , it is a must read .
I have found it laughable that Hillary Clinton has played this experience card by claiming that she has 35 years of experience because she is married to a former president .
The truth is that while she claims that Obama does n’t have enough experience to be president because he is only a one term senator , she does n’t have the experience either , being only a two term senator .
Just because she watched what Bill did while he was president , it does n’t add to her qualifications .
SHANGHAI  Weeping and yelling , “ Tibet is not free , ” a group of red-robed monks on Thursday disrupted a carefully scripted tour for foreign journalists in Lhasa , Tibet ’s capital , as Chinese officials tried to portray the recent Tibetan riots as the work of thugs and separatists .
The 15 - minute protest by about 30 monks , who spoke first in Tibetan and then switched to Mandarin , was in the Jokhang Monastery , one of Tibet ’s holiest shrines .
The protest , videotaped by reporters , ended after government handlers shouted for the journalists to leave and tried to pull them away , an Associated Press correspondent on the tour said in an interview .
The protest erupted during a tour of the temple .
Some of the monks shouted that there was no religious freedom in Tibet and that the Dalai Lama , Tibet ’s spiritual leader in exile , had been wrongly accused by China of orchestrating the protests to disrupt the Olympic Games , to be held in Beijing in August .
Some journalists said one monk complained that the government had planted fake monks in the monastery to talk to the reporters .
It was unclear whether the protesting monks were arrested .
The government later said that the monks had lied but would not be punished .
Tape Captures Philly Cops Beating Suspects Associated Press

This A half - dozen police officers kicked and beat three suspects pulled from a car during a traffic stop as a TV helicopter taped the confrontation , and the city 's police commissioner said " it certainly does not look good . "
The video , shot by WTXF - TV , shows three police cars stopping a car on a city street on Monday , two days after a city officer responding to a bank robbery was fatally shot .
The tape shows about a dozen officers gathering around the vehicle and pulling three men out .
About a half - dozen officers hold two of the men on the ground .
Both are kicked repeatedly , while one is seen being punched ; one also appears to be struck with a baton .
The third man is also kicked and ends up on the ground .
" On the surface it certainly does not look good in terms of the amount of force that was used , " Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said .
" But we do n't want to rush to judgment . "
The officers were responding to a report of a shooting nearby , police said .
Ramsey said Philadelphia officers have been on edge since Saturday , when Officer Stephen Liczbinski was fatally shot with an assault rifle after a robbery in the city 's Port Richmond section .
One of the robbery suspects was fatally shot by police , another was arrested Sunday and a third remains on the lam .
" We want to look at the video .
And I think it 's important to remember that these individuals had been observed involved at a triple shooting at the time , " Ramsey said .
" There is also a lot of heightened emotions since Sgt. Liczbinski was murdered on the streets just Saturday . "
Liczbinski was the third officer slain on duty in the city in the last two years .
D. Scott Perrine , a lawyer representing the three suspects , said that as terrible as the officer 's death was , it does not excuse such actions by police .
" We do n't take into consideration the emotions of police officers when it comes to the discharge of their duties .
...
Your emotional state , being tired , does n't justify what 's on that video , " Perrine said .
Perrine said one of his clients , Dwayne Dyches , suffered a welt on his head the size of a baseball and that one of his legs was seriously injured .
He said police would not allow him to meet with Dyches alone in the hospital Monday night .
Perrine said he now also represents the other two men in the car , Brian Hall and Pete Hopkins , but he did not know the extent of their injuries .
The attorney said he did not know what preceded the traffic stop in the city 's Hunting Park neighborhood , but that the video shows an unjustified police beating .
" It clearly shows a lack of any reasonable investigation before these police yank these individuals out of the car and take turns delivering blows , " Perrine said .
" This is a time for a thorough investigation to see what it is that happened here .
The question is ' Did they have probable cause ? " '
The police involved in the beating are being put on desk duty during the department 's investigation , reports CBS News reporter Tara Mergener .
A court official said late Tuesday that the defendants had been charged with criminal conspiracy , aggravated assault , simple assault and reckless endangering .
Bail for Hopkins was set at $ 1 million and for Hall at $ 300,000 , while Dyches was awaiting arraignment .
Perrine said the aggravated assault charge was intended to justify the officers ' acts .
" Look at that video and try to determine if these guys even had a chance , " Perrine said .
Lt. Frank Vanore , a police spokesman , did not immediately return a call for comment from The Associated Press .
Video follows :
Yield Spread : 10 Year and 2 Year Treasury Bonds
Basis Points , NBER Recessions in gray
Converted this into recession probabilities , the spread predicts improving conditions throughout the year and into 2009 :
Recession Probabilities
12 - month ahead forecast , NBER Recessions in gray
Where can one find news to support the 10 - 2 yield spread story ?
One hint comes from Calculated Risk , who notes :
This graph indicates the difference between single family starts and new home sales has narrowed recently , possibly indicating : 1 ) that fewer homes are being built by owners , and 2 ) that single family starts are now low enough to begin to reduce the inventory of new homes for sales .
The second point caught my eye , especially after seeing that housing starts are approaching their historical lows .
Granted , theoretically they could fall to zero , but that ’s not exactly a realistic expectation .
Housing starts will eventually bottom , and with starts approaching a level that realistically allows for inventory reduction , it is not unreasonable to expect the bottom to come sooner than later .
Even arch - bear Nouriel Roubini envisions a time when housing starts will bottom .
From the WSJ :
New York University economist Nouriel Roubini expects housing starts to drop to at least 700,000 before hitting bottom , with home prices falling through at least 2009 .
" We 're still in the first few innings " of a recession , said the chairman of research firm Roubini Global Economics .
Given that in March 2008 , housing starts stood at 947 k , down from a cycle peak of 2.3 million units , we probably are n’t more than a few months away from the bottom , even assuming a worst case Roubini scenario .
Reaching a bottom is important in that new residential construction would no longer be a drag on GDP growth ; do not underestimate the impact of a flip from subtracting 1 + percentage point of growth each quarter to a flat contribution .
Aside from the consumer , incoming data is consistent with an economy scraping along the bottom - Jim Hamilton offers this forecast :
If we eke out a barely positive growth rate for real GDP for 2008 : Q1 , that along with the anemic 2007 : Q4 performance and a sharp drop in 2008 :Q2 would probably qualify as a recession .
Hamilton ’s forecast of Q1 appears reasonable , but I suspect the expectation of a sharp drop in Q2 is overly pessimistic given that the consumer data should pop temporarily as the tax rebate checks roll in , even if only half those dollars are spent .
Also consistent with the borderline recession story are the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing indexes :
ISM - Index of Manufacturing Activity
Index , above 50 reflects increasing activity
ISM - Index of Non-Manufacturing Activity
Index , above 50 reflects increasing activity
Just to be clear , while the technical recession may be relatively short lived , I am not optimistic about the other side of this downturn – no V - shaped recovery is in my forecast .
Instead , I look for something between the U and the L shapes .
My baseline scenario is that housing starts move sideways after bottoming , neither contributing nor subtracting from GDP .
The housing sector will likely remain in disarray until prices contract to their historical relationship with incomes .
Assuming the mortgage industry returns to historical underwriting conditions , the capital simply will not be available to support prices higher than roughly 3 times local median incomes .
I have trouble seeing a way around such a constraint short of continued , substantial taxpayer support that would effectively amount to a policy decision that the average household should be expected to devote 40 - 50 % of its income to housing costs .
I really cannot see this as a socially optimal outcome , and I expect that it would be met with a backlash sooner than later .
Similarly , I expect the job market to remain challenged ; recall the period of soft job growth though 2004 following after the technical end of the previous recession :
Non-Farm Payroll Growth
Thousands of employees , monthly change
I anticipate the current cycle to be similar .
Jobs will continue to be shed in the housing sector as capacity falls in line with a reduced demand .
Moreover , these displaced workers will not easily regain employment in expanding sectors such as health care or export industries .
Soft job growth and declining access to credit via home equity should keep a lid on consumer spending growth , similar again to the post - 2001 period :
Real Consumption and Confidence
Spending percentage change Y - o - Y ( Red ) , left
Consumer confidence ( Blue ) , right
So how does one reconcile the so - so ISM data with the consumer data , the latter of which is more clearly dire ?
Again , I believe the data reflects an adjustment away from a growth path that depends upon the external imbalance .
A portion of the consumer slowdown will be off - shored to foreign producers , and exporters ( primarily manufacturers ) will benefit from the weaker Dollar .
The consequence should be a relatively muted downturn and an expected improvement in the current account deficit :
US Current Account Deficit
Percentage of gross domestic product
The adjustment should yield stark disparities in rates of economic activity across sectors , and this appears to be revealed by the first wave of earnings reports .
From the WSJ :
As first - quarter corporate earnings reports begin to roll in , a stark picture is emerging of an economy on two tracks .
Banks and companies that sell directly to consumers are grappling with the impact of falling home prices and tightening credit .
But many big businesses , especially those that sell to other U.S. companies or to customers abroad , are proving resilient .
Best that this adjustment occurs slowly , considering the enormous pressure on the consumer already evident from the gradual improvements to date .
Of course , the slower the pace of the adjustment , the longer as well ( again , somewhere between the U and L - shapes ) , and therein lays the danger for policy .
Policymakers will be hard pressed to allow the process continue unabated , as they lack the courage to tell Americans that the country needs to learn to live within its means .
Given a growing populist sentiment on the back of stagnating median incomes , I see little but a river of red ink from the Federal government .
Monetary policy should be more circumspect , and financial markets are greenlighting the Fed for an end in the easing cycle at 2 % despite tame core - CPI data in February and March .
From Across the Curve :
Some participants with whom I converse are troubled by the spectre of inflation .
While the report issued today was not ugly , the surge in commodity prices and agricultural prices reminds investors that there will be no inflation relief in the near term .
The best bet is that the headline number will only worsen as we go forward .
So some traders think that the process has begun by which the market adjusts to the Federal Reserve signalling that the ease cycle is over or is nearly done .
That would not bode well for the 2 year note and would precipitate higher yields in that sector .
I would argue that monetary policy is already too accommodative given that the fear of deflation appears misplaced .
From Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser :
Taking expected inflation into account , the level of the federal funds rate in real terms — what economists call the real rate of interest — is now negative .
The last time the level of real interest rates was this low was in 2003 - 2004 .
But that was a different time with a different concern — deflation — and monetary policy was intentionally seeking to prevent prices from falling .
Recently , we have had reason to be worried about rising inflation , not declining prices .
Thus , comparing the nominal funds rate today with the stance of policy in 2003 – 2004 is like comparing apples and oranges .
Normally , I would not give much credence to Plosser ; he has been out of step with the FOMC through the current cycle .
But in the same speech he emphasizes that monetary policy alone cannot solve the current challenges , a realization also made by Governor Kevin Warsh
Fed policy -- both with respect to liquidity tools and monetary policy -- is partially offsetting the consequences of the liquidity and credit pullback on real activity .
But we must be careful to not ask policy to do more than it is rightly capable of accomplishing .
The problems afflicting our financial markets are indeed long - in - the - making .
Correspondingly , the curative process is unlikely to be swift or smooth .
Time is an oft - forgotten , yet equally essential , tool of our policy response .
Warsh also acknowledges the impact of surging commodity prices on inflation :
Consistent with our dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices , we also need to be alert to risks to price stability .
Increases in food and energy prices have pushed up overall consumer prices and are putting upward pressure on core inflation and inflation expectations .
We will continue to monitor the inflation situation closely .
And , more broadly , in my view , as financial intermediation channels reset , monetary policy will become still more efficacious .
Even arch - dove San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen cannot ignore the impact of inflation :
The factors weighing down consumer spending go beyond the effects of the credit crunch and the falling house prices .
Consumers also face constraints due to the declines in the stock market , which have diminished their wealth .
Furthermore , energy , food , and other commodity prices have risen sharply in recent years , essentially “ taxing ” their incomes .
Finally , and very importantly , labor markets have weakened .
The recent wave of commodity price increases I think was undoubtedly exacerbated by the Fed policy of recent months – it takes a leap of faith to ignore the run that was ignited when the Fed cut the discount rate last August .
My concern is that we have now passed the point of no return ; even if the Fed stops cutting rates , the expectation of stronger growth will drive further gains in commodity prices .
From Bloomberg :
Crude oil and gasoline climbed to records in New York as better - than - expected earnings results signaled a strengthening economy that may boost demand .
U.S. stocks rallied , capping the best week since February for the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index , following earnings reports from companies such as Google Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. that exceeded analyst estimates .
Refineries operated at 81.4 percent of capacity last week , the Energy Department reported .
'' The real gloomy scenario has been sort of ameliorated with some of these very positive earnings and the indication that the worst is behind us , '' said John Kilduff , vice president of risk management at MF Global Ltd. in New York .
'' There will be an uptick in energy demand with the renewed economic outlook for the second half of the year in particular . ''
I tend to agree with George Soros ; we are still in the early stages of the commodity price boom , and that boom will not come to a conclusion until the inflation outlook is uncomfortable enough that the Fed reverses policy .
In the near term , that looks very unlikely .
The Fed is still counting on weak job growth to keep core prices under control , but that is an increasingly fragile forecast .
From the most recent Beige Book :
Business contacts across all Districts continued to report increases in input costs and output prices .
In particular , price increases were consistently reported for food products , fuel and energy products , and many raw materials .
More specifically , increases in the price of chemicals , metals , plastics and other petroleum - based products were commonly cited .
Most manufacturers have or are planning to increase prices in response to rising input costs , while the response of service firms has been more mixed , in part due to differences in competitive pressures .
On balance , input costs have risen more rapidly than output prices , putting pressure on margins for many firms .
Most Districts reported little change in retail price inflation , though Richmond and San Francisco noted some moderation .
My concern here is that firms will jump at the first chance to drive through price increases , and that chance will be in the next two quarters as the tax rebates provides a boost to consumer spending .
If so , the Fed will be well behind the inflation curve .
Although Fed officials believe they can quickly unwind the policy decisions of the last six months , I think it is easier said than done given anticipated weak job growth and still fragile financial markets .
Bottom Line : I suspect the cessation of rate cuts is near at hand .
The Fed will likely pull the trigger on another 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting , and send a signal that they intend to pause soon .
I believe they could pause now , but see this as unlikely given their tendency toward dovishness of recent months .
Another 25 bp in June is not out of the question , but I think unlikely as well .
It will soon be time to turn our attention to timing the next tightening cycle .
Expected job market / housing weakness argues for an extended period of low rates similar to the last cycle ; continued strength in commodity prices argues for a more rapid reversal of recent policy .
I believe that a rapid reversal of policy will be politically difficult for the Fed given that Congress will tend toward resisting any protracted structural adjustment that is painful for US households .

WASHINGTON —
The number of Americans being secretly wiretapped or having their financial and other records reviewed by the government has continued to increase as officials aggressively use powers approved after the Sept. 11 attacks .
But the number of terrorism prosecutions ending up in court — one measure of the effectiveness of such sleuthing — has continued to decline , in some cases precipitously .
The trends , visible in new government data and a private analysis of Justice Department records , are worrisome to civil liberties groups and some legal scholars .
They say it is further evidence that the government has compromised the privacy rights of ordinary citizens without much to show for it .
The emphasis on spy programs also is starting to give pause to some members of Congress who fear the government is investing too much in anti-terrorism programs at the expense of traditional crime - fighting .
Other lawmakers are raising questions about how well the FBI is performing its counter - terrorism mission .

One of John McCain ’s leading economic advisors said Sunday that she could n’t name a credible economist who supported the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ’s proposal to suspend the federal gas tax for the summer .
But Carly Fiorina , chairwoman of the Republican National Committee ’s 2008 fundraising and get - out - the - vote efforts , scoffed at the lack of support from economic analysts .
“ I do n’t think it matters , ” she said .
Appearing on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” Fiorina , who was chairwoman and chief executive of Hewlett - Packard Co. until being ousted in 2005 , said economists “ sometimes argue about the theory ” while Americans worry about filling their gas tanks .
Her remarks echo comments last week by Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton , who said , “ I ’m not going to put my lot in with economists . ”

Both Sens. McCain of Arizona and Clinton of New York argue that a tax suspension would provide vital relief to millions of Americans at the gas pump this summer .
Clinton has offered a similar proposal .
The idea has been widely panned .
Critics say that a suspension of the 18.4 - cent - per - gallon federal gas tax could save drivers as little as $ 20 over the summer -- while resulting in a loss of as much as $ 9 billion in federal revenue for road and bridge construction .

Road builders say suspending the gas tax could jeopardize more than 300,000 highway - related jobs , about 23,000 of them in California .
Clinton has proposed to recover the money by imposing a windfall profits tax on oil companies .
Fiorina would not say what McCain might do to offset lost revenue .
Democratic front - runner Sen. Barack Obama , who once endorsed a gas tax holiday while in the Illinois Legislature , has characterized the proposal as a gimmick and cited studies showing that the Illinois suspension did little for consumers .

Economists generally agree that such tax suspensions would encourage gasoline consumption at a time of already soaring demand .
Meanwhile Sunday , Clinton ’s supporters continued to assert that she could capture the Democratic nomination and that she would remain in the contest at least until the end of the primary season in 3 1/2 weeks .
Senior Clinton advisor Howard Wolfson , appearing on “ Fox News Sunday , ” rejected the idea that the campaign was over .
He predicted victory in the next primary , on Tuesday in West Virginia , where Clinton is heavily favored .

“ If Barack Obama wants Hillary Clinton out of this race , beat her .
Beat her in West Virginia , beat her in Puerto Rico , beat her in Kentucky , ” Wolfson said , citing other upcoming contests .
Clinton ’s campaign chairman , Terry McAuliffe , acknowledged Sunday that it was unlikely Clinton would be able to overtake Obama ’s lead among pledged delegates .
But at the end of the primary season , he predicted , more people will have voted for Clinton than Obama -- if the disputed primaries in Florida and Michigan are counted .
“ I believe we will be ahead in the popular vote , ” McAuliffe said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”

Obama gained support from another superdelegate Sunday , Crystal Strait , 28 , of Sacramento , a leader in Young Democrats of America .
Over the weekend he surpassed Clinton in pledges from such party leaders and elected officials .
Strait said in an interview that she had been leaning toward Clinton , “ an inspirational figure , ” but opted for Obama because of the support he had garnered among young voters .
Strait also approved of Obama ’s plan to undertake a 50 - state voter registration drive .
“ Clearly the Obama campaign is committed to rebuilding the Democratic Party , ” said Strait , who called her endorsement “ the hardest decision of my life . ”

Times staff writer Dan Morain in Sacramento contributed to this report .
Two MIT students are currently living , working and communicating with the outside world as if they were on a mission to Mars .
Whenever they go outside their small , round habitat where eight people are spending a two - week " mission , " they don spacesuits and pass through an airlock .
When they send e-mail , it takes 20 minutes before the recipient can see it -- the time it takes for radio waves to travel to and from the red planet .
They 're not really on Mars , of course -- human missions there are not yet even in NASA 's long - term schedule , and are not expected to take place for at least two decades .
So , in order to begin understanding the logistical , mechanical , scientific and psychological issues that a real crew of Mars explorers will someday face , teams have been practicing the details of Mars exploration in several Mars - base simulators in some of Earth 's most Mars - like places .
The most heavily used simulation is the Mars Society Desert Research Station , near Hanksville , Utah , which was built in 2002 by the Mars Society .
Engineering graduate students Zahra Khan and Phillip Cunio , from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics , began their stay at the Utah facility late Sunday , Feb. 17 .
Cunio is working on a project to develop a " smart " carrier to be used for research fieldwork in remote expeditions such as planetary exploration .
The footlocker - sized container and its contents are fitted with radio - frequency ID tags , so that it constantly keeps track of its contents and can alert people if supplies are about to run out or if an item has been misplaced .
Running out of supplies is not just an inconvenience -- on a faraway planetary surface it could be a life - or - death issue .
Khan is concentrating on the logistics of making exploratory trips through the desert to carry out geological and biological research .
The team uses all - terrain vehicles to travel around while wearing their simulated spacesuits , and then takes soil samples and conducts other tests at various locations .
At the end of each day , they write up field reports on their activities , and make repairs to any damaged equipment .
Although part of the mission 's purpose is to find out about practical issues in working in difficult circumstances , the research itself is also very real .
They will be looking for organisms that live in the hostile , dry and salty desert environment , both to develop techniques for conducting such biological research and to learn about how organisms survive in these somewhat Mars - like conditions .
Both Khan and Cunio would like to be involved in real Mars missions someday .
Khan 's research is on entry , descent and landing systems for human missions to Mars .
These will require much gentler , more - controlled descents than past missions , such as the Mars rovers that hit the ground at high speed shielded by airbags and then bounced for several minutes before coming to a stop .
Khan says she would like to go to Mars herself , but thinks that with the slow progress of NASA 's plans in that direction , " the odds may not be very good .
I think it would be a good idea to send younger people , " and by the time such missions take place that may leave her out .
" I 'm an advocate of one - way trips to Mars , " she says , because the logistics of such trips would be far easier without the requirement for all the fuel needed for a return .
For a given spacecraft , she says , you could send six people on a two - way mission or 24 people for a one - way trip .
" If you 're going to go there , you might as well not waste the resources . "
Cunio's research studies the design of self - sustaining life - support systems for Mars colonists , as well as for missions to the moon or other destinations .
" We 're studying the commonalities in life support and environmental control systems , " he says , so that planners do n't have to start from scratch in planning missions to different places .
" We want to minimize the development costs and risks . "

Whether the same processes that produce mouse heart tissue also generate heart tissue in humans has been unclear , because we obviously can't do the required experiments on human embryos .
But a paper published on Thursday in Nature describes research that used human embryonic stem cells to generate human heart cells , and in the process demonstrated that human and mouse stem cells use similar molecular signaling pathways to develop , or differentiate , from stem cells to various types of heart cells .
What this means is that we now have the molecular recipe needed to grow heart tissue from embryonic stem cells .
Having that recipe in hand brings us a step closer to an embryonic stem cell - based treatment for damaged hearts .

Embryonic Stem Cell Decision Making
Embryonic stem cells are remarkable because unlike differentiated cells , they have the ability to keep dividing without limit , perpetuating themselves indefinitely .
But for medical treatments , they are largely useless in this form : we really want to use stem cells to produce other useful types of cells , like neurons or cardiomyocytes , to replace damaged spinal cords or hearts .
Stem cells can become many different types of cells , so the trick is coaxing them to become the type of cell you need .
This is not necessarily easy , because you do n't go straight from a stem cell to a fully mature , differentiated cell .
Stem cells start out pluripotent , able to become many different types of cells , but they then , step by step , commit to an ever more narrow range of possibilities .
Here is a very simplified example of how a stem cell becomes an oligodendrocyte : an embryonic stem cell makes a decision to become part of the ectoderm germ layer , foreclosing its options of becoming a member of the mesoderm or endoderm ; in due time that stem cell limits its potential to some type of neuronal cell , then chooses to restrict itself to transforming into glial cell , and finally it becomes limited to oligodendrocytes .
I 've left out many intermediate steps , but the idea is clear : a stem cell has to follow a path involving multiple decision points to reach its final destination ; you can't simply go from an embryonic stem cell to a fully differentiated heart , nerve or muscle cell in one step .
The ability to coax stem cells down the right path of any decision tree is the holy grail of stem cell research .
But how can you convince a stem cell to make the right decision ?
The key is to treat cells with the right combination of signaling molecules , small proteins or other biological molecules that flip a set of genetic switches inside the cell .
Each stem cell decision happens primarily because the cell is induced to switch some genes on and others off .
Getting the right combination of genes on and off is controlled by these signaling molecules or proteins , which usually have colorful names often inspired by genetic experiments in non-mammals , names like dickkopf ( check your German dictionary ) and sonic hedgehog .
Stem Cells to Heart Cells
In this case , what the stem cell research group ( from Mt. Sinai School of Medicine ) did was use the right combination of signaling molecules at the right time to drive stem cells to become various heart tissue cells .
The researchers knew that in mice , differentiated heart cells descend from a type of precursor stem cell called Flk - 1+ ( named for a specific type of protein present in these cells ) .
That is , in mice , the stem cell decision tree to make heart cells goes like this : embryonic stem cells commit to being mesoderm cells , and then , a few decision points later , become Flk - 1 + stem cells : stem cells that can form three types of heart tissue , the cardiac muscle , the endothelium , and the vascular smooth muscle .
So the researchers were facing two questions :
Are there analogous Flk - 1 + stem cells in humans , and can we manipulate human embryonic stem cells in a petri dish to become these Flk - 1+ cells ?
The answer to both questions is yes .
The scientists were able to produce human Flk - 1+ cells ( which are n't actually called Flk - 1+ cells , but I 'm going to ignore that to avoid confusion ) by following a molecular recipe , which called for various signaling molecules at the right time ( the abbreviations stand for the various signaling proteins added to the petri dish - DKK1 = dickkopf1 , BMP4 = bone morphogenic protein 4 , etc ) :
A Recipe for Making Heart Cells .
Figure 1a from Yang , et al. , Nature 453 ( 2008 ) doi:10.1038/nature06894
Once they had Flk - 1 + - like stem cells , the researchers were able to prompt those stem cells to differentiate into various specialized heart cells , including actual beating heart cells .
To follow the changes in gene expression during this process , and to ensure that they were seeing the right cell types , the researchers looked for key marker proteins that should be present only at certain points along the decision tree : at one point , you should have cells that express the proteins CTNT and SMA , at another point the cells should express SMA but not CTNT , etc .
The way to see whether these proteins are present is to stain the proteins so that they fluoresce under the microscope , producing some of the most appealing pictures you 'll find in a research paper :
Figure 3 c from Yang , et al. , Nature 453 ( 2008 ) doi:10.1038/nature06894
So the researchers could make these cells in a dish , but what happens in a live animal ?
To find out , they transplanted the Flk - 1 + - like , heart precursor stem cells into mice , to see if these cells would turn into heart muscle , endothelium , and vascular smooth muscle .
To distinguish the transplanted human cells from the mouse 's native cells , the scientists labeled th human cells with a green protein .
And sure enough , they found that the transplanted human stem cells had integrated themselves into the mouse hearts and differentiated into the three specific heart cell types .
In other words , scientists have turned human embryonic stem cells into heart stem cells , transplanted them into live mice , and observed those cells become functional members of the mouse 's heart .
The next big step is to use this same technique to improve human hearts .
This kind of tissue engineering in a dish obviously holds great medical promise .
Scientists hope to be able to take embryonic stem cells and use them to create replacements for any kind of damaged tissue .
To do this , we need the molecular recipe for creating each type of tissue , not an easy task , but clearly , as this research demonstrates , within our abilities .

Senator Hillary Clinton just made a remarkable charge against her senate colleague and presidential rival Barack Obama .
In a heated moment when she tried to portray him as an unknown , flip - flopping quantity she said : " You said you would vote against the PATRIOT Act – you came to the senate and voted for it . "
I spent the entire year of 2005 , and part of 2006 covering the blow - by - blow re-authorization of the PATRIOT Act .
The reality is that Obama was n't in the senate in 2001 , and then when he was , he was one of of a small band of senators who actually jumped in at the last minute to * oppose * the re-authorization of the legislation without more checks in what was a pretty bad bill that sought to remove what was left of the existing checks against abuses of the government 's investigative powers .
Ultimately everyone in the senate ( apart from Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin ) voted " for " for the PATRIOT Act and most senators voted for its subsequent re-authorization .
The disagreement was in the details , as the the readers of THREAT LEVEL well know .
Obama 's response : " What I think that is important that we do n't do , is try to distort each others ' records . "
Governor Bill Richardson 's comment on the exchange : " Well , I 've been in a lot of hostage negotiation situations that have been a lot more civil than this ! "
Here 's a link to what Obama said on the senate floor in February 2006 when Congress once again took up debate over the re-authorization of the legislation :
Mr. OBAMA : Mr. President , 4 years ago , following one of the most devastating attacks in our Nation 's history , Congress passed the USA PATRIOT
Act to give our Nation 's law enforcement the tools they needed to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over the world –terrorists who , right now , are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out even deadlier attacks than we saw on September 11th .
We all agreed that we needed legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to go undetected in this country .
Americans everywhere wanted that .
But soon after the PATRIOT
Act passed , a few years before I ever arrived in the Senate , I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law did n't just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe , but powers it did n't need to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion .
Now , at times this issue has tended to degenerate into an ``either - or '' type of debate .
Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles .
But that is a false choice .
It asks too little of us and assumes too little about America .
Let me be clear : this compromise is not as good as the Senate version of the bill , nor is it as good as the SAFE Act that I have cosponsored .
I suspect the vast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the same way .
But , it 's still better than what the House originally proposed .
This compromise does modestly improve the PATRIOT
Act by strengthening civil liberties protections without sacrificing the tools that law enforcement needs to keep us safe .
In this compromise :
We strengthened judicial review of both national security letters , the administrative subpoenas used by the FBI , and Section 215 orders , which can be used to obtain medical , financial and other personal records .
We established hard - time limits on sneak - and - peak searches and limits on roving wiretaps .
We protected most libraries from being subject to national security letters .
We preserved an individual 's right to seek counsel and hire an attorney without fearing the FBI 's wrath .
And we allowed judicial review of the gag orders that accompany Section 215 searches .
The compromise is far from perfect .
I would have liked to see stronger judicial review of national security letters and shorter time limits on sneak and peak searches , among other things .
Senator Feingold has proposed several sensible amendments –that I support–to address these issues .
Unfortunately , the Majority Leader is preventing Senator Feingold from offering these amendments through procedural tactics .
That is regrettable because it flies in the face of the bipartisan cooperation that allowed the Senate to pass unanimously its version of the Patriot Act–a version that balanced security and civil liberty , partisanship and patriotism .
The Majority Leader 's tactics are even more troubling because we will need to work on a bipartisan basis to address national security challenges in the weeks and months to come .
In particular , members on both sides of the aisle will need to take a careful look at President Bush 's use of warrantless wiretaps and determine the right balance between protecting our security and safeguarding our civil liberties .
This is a complex issue .
But only by working together and avoiding election - year politicking will we be able to give our government the necessary tools to wage the war on terror without sacrificing the rule of law .
So , I will be supporting the PATRIOT Act compromise .
But I urge my colleagues to continue working on ways to improve the civil liberties protections in the PATRIOT
Act after it is reauthorized .

Last month , the Federal Trade Commission conducted hearings and convened a workshop for scientists , economists , environmental activists and representatives of the leading American retailers of ‘ carbon offsets ’ and ‘ renewable energy credits ’ ( RECs ) to learn more about the rather opaque business models and practices of some companies .
Though the hearings were only exploratory in nature , the FTC was able to address some of the concerns and misgivings the public has about unregulated voluntary carbon markets .
The FTC also raised their concern about the validity of some companies ’ advertising claims ( for an excellent analysis of the carbon - offset hearings , read the piece by Jeremy Elton Jacquot for TreeHugger ) .
In short , people want to see what they get and get what they pay for – and in the world of renewable energy credits and carbon offsets , this can be a tricky prospect .
In response to these hearings , and in an effort to legitimize the fledgling offset and REC industries , carbon offset retailer TerraPass has decided to democratize .
By opening up a comment period for seven particular carbon - offset projects , TerraPass has decided to build - in an added layer of transparency to make their enterprise a little less hazy .
I applaud TerraPass for this move forward .
And I am totally fine if it is purely profit driven .
As companies strive to stay in the black of their ‘ triple bottom line ’
I hope we will be seeing more of these democratic experiments in the private sector .
You do n’t have to be a ‘ stockholder ’ to make a comment , just a stakeholder .
And when we ’re talking climate change , it seems that everyone is a stakeholder .
According to the company :
“ We welcome comments from our customers , from anyone familiar with the projects themselves , from policy experts , and from the general public .
If you have any feedback for us regarding these projects – their environmental records , the importance of TerraPass support to project success , or anything else , please provide it via email . ”

The marsupial lion may not have had - or needed - the most intelligent of hunting strategies
The assessment comes from scientists who have compared the heads of all manner of beasts , from dogs to bears .
None had the ability to bite down on its prey with quite the same force , say Dr Stephen Wroe and colleagues .
The lion , so described because of its cat - like appearance , became extinct more than 40,000 years ago .
Fossil evidence shows it must have been a remarkable predator .
Its stocky teeth , although not quite on the same scale as those of sabre - toothed cats , would have inflicted terrible flesh wounds .
Pound for pound , Thylacoleo carnifex was biting way above its weight
Dr Steven Wroe , University of Sydney
" Thylacoleo carnifex was one of the meanest , most frightening animals you could have the misfortune to meet , " Dr Wroe , from the University of Sydney , told the BBC News website .
Competitive edge
Wroe 's team studied the skulls of 39 mammalian carnivores , eight of them now known only from the fossil record .
The work estimates the closing force at the canine - end of the animals ' jaws and a simple model constructed by the researchers allows them to compare the relative biting prowess of all the creatures , irrespective of their size .
Wroe says the work allows researchers to make predictions about new discoveries
But then the data starts to throw up some surprises - not least between marsupials and placentals .
" Marsupials for any given size had a much bigger bite than placentals , " explained Dr Wroe .
" A 30kg Tasmanian tiger was biting much harder than a 30kg grey wolf and the marsupial lion , which on average was about 100kg , had a bite fore comparable to that of a 250 kg African lion .
" So , pound for pound , Thylacoleo carnifex was biting way above its weight . "
Rapid bleed
The researchers have an idea why this might be , and it goes to brain size and possibly to intelligence .
Modern placentals have bigger brains than their more primitive forebears and also marsupials .
It seems conceivable , Wroe and colleagues believe , that the skull architecture required for these bigger brains has evolved at the expense of muscle potential .
Researchers will look for deviations in trends .
Why an animal deviates strongly raises valid research questions about the design of that animal
Prof Norman MacLeod , Natural History Museum
" The cross-sectional area available for the two major muscle jaw - closing systems may be inversely proportional to the size of the brain .
Perhaps , modern placentals can do the same job by being more precise , " said Dr Wroe .
And this hypothesis takes an interesting turn with sabre - toothed cats .
The data shows them to have had relatively small bites for their size .
Modern lions or tigers today have similar bite forces and are substantially smaller animals .
But who needs to bite hard when your giant , 15 cm - long canines will punch deep into a victim 's neck and bring about rapid bleeding and death ?
New questions
Professor Norman MacLeod , keeper of palaeontology at the UK's Natural History Museum , commented that this type of study enabled scientists to open up new research questions about extinct ( and living ) creatures .
With such big canines , sabre - toothed cats did not need to bite hard
" Researchers will look for deviations in trends .
Why an animal deviates strongly raises valid research questions about the design of that animal .
For example , if you plot brain size versus body size , there is a nice regular relationship - but in humans , we are way off the scale .
" That 's because there 's been much greater brain development in humans than in any other animal . "
A paper detailing the science of mammalian bite force , co-authored with Colin McHenry , from the University of Newcastle in New South Wales and Jeffrey Thomason , from the University of Guelph , Canada , was published recently by the UK's Royal Society .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Amir Khan says he becomes frustrated and humiliated every time he enters the United States and federal agents search his computers .
Khan , a Pakistani - born U.S. citizen , says it has happened five times since 2003 .
A suit filed last week seeks clarification on the rules that allow federal agents to search laptops and other devices .
He says agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection have even forced him to give them access to password - protected , confidential information from his company and his banking records .
An IT consultant who travels to Europe , Turkey and Pakistan , Khan says he has cooperated with the questions and searches but feels by now border agents should know he does n't pose a threat .
Situations for travelers such as Khan are at issue in a lawsuit filed last week by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Asian Law Caucus in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California .
The suit accuses customs agents of " lengthy questioning and intrusive searches " and seeks clarification on the law that allows such searches .
The San Francisco , California - based foundation , which works to defend people 's rights in the digital world , says it knows of more than a dozen cases in which electronic devices such as cell phones , BlackBerries , MP3 players and laptops have been searched by customs agents .
In some cases , they have been confiscated and never returned .
Watch cyber searches at airports »
" Plaintiffs seek agency records in order to determine what policies and procedures exist governing CBP 's questioning and searches of individuals at the nation 's ports of entry , " the suit says .
The Customs and Border Protection defends the searches , saying the agency does not need to show probable cause to look inside suitcases or laptops .
" We have broad search authority at the borders to determine admissibility and look for anything that may be in violation of criminal law , " says agency spokeswoman Lynn Hollinger .
Hollinger says electronic devices could contain evidence of possible ties to terrorism , narcotics smuggling , child pornography and other criminal activities .
Russ Knocke , a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , equates searches of electronic devices to those of papers in briefcases .
" You forgo your right to privacy when you are seeking admission into the country , " he says .
" This is the kind of scrutiny the American public expects . "
But Marcia Hoffman , an attorney for the foundation , says the searches go too far .
" Your laptop computer may contain your financial records , your e-mail with your friends and your family and your co-workers , records of the Web sites you visit , confidential business information , " Hoffman says .
" Our position is there should be some suspicion of wrongdoing before the government can search your sensitive personal information at the border . "
Georgetown University Law Center professor David Cole says he agrees .
" We do n't allow the government to come into people 's homes at will without any probable cause , without any basis for suspicion , " he says .
" Why should we let them get into people 's computers just because they happen to be traveling across the border ? "
Federal courts have given customs and border officials the authority to examine luggage for contraband , but Cole says searching an electronic device is more like a strip search because an item such as a computer can contain intimate personal information .
But how do customs agents determine which electronic devices to search ?
Khan says he suspects his Pakistani roots and Muslim religion have a lot to do with it .
Customs officials insist the agency does not use racial profiling but declines to say more , citing the pending legal action .
For the same reason , the agency refuses to discuss what it does with the information it finds inside electronic devices .
Susan Gurley , executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives , says she 's concerned about the security of personal and business information obtained by customs .
" Where does it go ? " she asks .
" Is it shared ?
Is it stored ?
Is it destroyed ?
Does it go into the ether somewhere in the bowels of the U.S. government ? "
Customs says its agents are law enforcement officers trained to protect private , confidential information .
However , Gurley says customs policies should be clear to the traveling public .
" You should know what your rights are , " Gurley says .
" It should n't be hidden . "
The federal lawsuit may provide clarification on the matter , but Cole says the issues raised may not be sorted out for years .
" The advancement of technology has left the law behind here and the law now has quite a bit of work to catch up if we are going to maintain our privacy , maintain our liberty , " he says .
In the meantime , Gurley 's group recommends that travelers put as little personal or proprietary information as possible on computers with which they travel .
But leaving a computer at home is not an option for travelers such as Kahn .
" It 's like a wallet , right ? " he says .
" You need your wallet everywhere you go . "

Made in China ?
Police believe some flags may have already been shipped Police in southern China have discovered a factory manufacturing Free Tibet flags , media reports say .
The factory in Guangdong had been completing overseas orders for the flag of the Tibetan government - in - exile .
Workers said they thought they were just making colourful flags and did not realise their meaning .
But then some of them saw TV images of protesters holding the emblem and they alerted the authorities , according to Hong Kong 's Ming Pao newspaper .
Tibet independence
The factory owner reportedly told police the emblems had been ordered from outside China , and he did not know that they stood for an independent Tibet .
Workers who had grown suspicious checked the meaning of the flag by going online .
Thousands of flags had already been packed for shipping .
Police believe that some may already have been sent overseas , and could appear in Hong Kong during the Olympic torch relay there this week .
Known as the Snow Lion Flag Introduced in 1912 Banned in mainland China

The authorities have now stepped up the inspection of cars heading to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and onwards to Hong Kong .
The Olympic torch is due to tour Hong Kong on Friday .
It will then travel to a series of cities in mainland China before reaching Beijing for the start of the Olympic Games in August .
Its progress around the world has been marked by pro-Tibet demonstrations in several cities - including Paris , London and San Francisco .
Rallies began in the main Tibetan city of Lhasa on 10 March , led by Buddhist monks .
Over the following week protests spread and became violent - particularly in Lhasa , where ethnic Chinese were targeted and shops were burnt down .
Beijing cracked down on the protesters with force , sending in hundreds of troops to regain control of the restive areas .
But it has since agreed to resume talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama .

What are these ?
Some people seem to have interpreted You Were n't Meant to Have a Boss as putting down programmers who work for big companies .
Jeff Atwood reproduced one quote summarizing it as saying : Oh ... you have n't founded a company ?
You suck .
In fact the thesis of the essay is exactly the opposite : that although the press treats startup founders as gods , the differences between them and other programmers are due less to their nature than to their work environment .
Here is the beginning of the last paragraph : Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear that the difference between the two is due mostly to environment ...
Why are people reading an essay that says this , and coming away with the idea that it says exactly the opposite ?
My guess is that this is an instance of a fairly common Internet phenomenon .
People are reacting to what they imagine I 'd say in an essay on this subject — that an essay comparing startup founders to corporate employees would say that founders are great and corporate employees suck .
Actually that has not been our experience .
Startup founders are not somehow set apart from " ordinary " programmers .
Lots more people could start startups if they wanted to .
In fact , our business model depends on it .
If the pool of founders was limited to a few rare geniuses , Y Combinator would n't work .
The following represents my own perspective on this important question and how it applies to the form of script I practice , namely Engrosser 's script .
My approach to practicing script can be applied to almost any area of endeavor such as sports , art , etc. that involves practice and learning .
Energy costs are at an all time high .
They will continue to go up .
The price of petroleum may indeed fluctuate , but within ever higher ranges .
$ 125 a barrel oil will climb to $ 135 -150 .
This is creating a convergence for businesses in that the traditional business owner or CEO has long believed that ‘ going green ’ was an endeavor contrary to the standard operation of business .
I speak to 2 - 4 groups of CEOs every month .
As a futurist , I am increasingly being asked by these groups about what the future of energy looks like as most businesses are getting whacked by the dramatic rise in energy prices .
When they hear that high energy prices are the new normal , they groan .
I immediately launch into strategies that they can immediately implement that will not only lower costs , but will also mobilize employees and allow them to promote to customers and suppliers that they are being green .
A number of CEOs have started to act on these recommendations .
The first thing to do is to conduct an energy audit , usually provided by the local energy company , and if not them , then an energy audit firm .
Establish the baseline of energy consumption on an annual basis for every facility .
The next step is to mobilize the employees to help lower energy use .
For example , if a company spent $ 100,000 last year on electricity , set the goal of $ 85,000 for this year .
Present this to the employees that the company wants to do its ’ part in the effort to slow global warming by lowering energy consumption .
State that the company will split savings 50/50 with the employees .
So , if electric costs are lowered by $ 15,000 then $ 7,500 will go to the employees as a year end ‘ conservation bonus ’ .
The company will save the same amount .
It will amazing how much more lights will get turned off when people leave rooms .
I promise the CEOs that they all have someone at the company that will immediately get involved and work to mobilize the other employees .
Heads nod knowingly .
The second thing to do is to analyze transportation .
See how mileage can be lowered for both company business and the commuting of employees to work .
Allow those that oversee transportation to suggest ways to conserve on gas expenditures .
The third thing to do is consider how the company schedules its activities .
There are many companies that can , and have , gone to a four day work week with extended hours per day .
This obviously lessens gasoline consumption and also electric consumption .
An alternative to this is to allow people to work from home using high speed internet connections .
The fourth thing to do is to analyze how cost savings can be made by changing production and ingredients .
There was a story elsewhere here at Scientific Blogging that details how the Six Sigma practice to lower defects in manufacturing can be used to help companies go green .
There will be three distinct positive outcomes if a company decides to go down this path of conservation .
First , there can be a real lowering of costs , something essential in a marketplace of ever rising energy costs .
Second , the employees , particularly those that have developed a strong environmental consciousness , will have a much better feeling about the company and will be happier at work as personal and corporate philosophies will become more aligned .
A study in 2007 found that 88 % of college graduates that year consider environmental policy in choosing where to work .
Third , the company can let customers and suppliers know that the company is doing its part to become ever more green and environmentally conscious .
All three of these developments will feed on each other and there will be other , beneficial consequences .
I 'm pleased that Phil Haacked has written about URL s and hopefully raised awareness a bit more widely about the issues surrounding internationalising them .
He focusses on how to create URLs , which is only one half of the story .
The other half is what happens to the URLs once they get out in the wild .
Do they survive ?
I 've had internationalised URLs on this site for a couple of years now , for example , the page on the Thai New Year , สงกรานต์ , has been very popular the last two years .
The truth of the matter is that although the URLs work well in browsers and with the major search engines , a lot of other web sites can't handle them at all .
There are two big problems .
Problem 1 — What characters can be in URLs anyway ?
Too many developers working with URLs do n't know how they work — even those who should know better .
All of the characters below are legal to use in the path specification of a URL without encoding and without special meaning :
$ - _.+!*'() , ;:@&=
The number of parsers that get this wrong is just staggering .
None of these should be used as delimiters in parsers that try to autolink URLs .
This of course causes a problem when people put punctuation around the URL .
There are two safe choices for the punctuation to delimit a URL : spaces and the angled brackets — < and > , but of course most end users wo n't think of this when writing .
Because those of us who create URLs know that there is n't really a good solution for this we tend to encode these characters anyway .
Whatever you do when you process our URL , do n't decode these characters and then decide that they really mean something else , which brings me on to …
Problem 2 — What encoding is used ?
The second problem is that the encoding format is not specified .
Phil uses UTF - 8 for his example , as do many people who know Unicode .
Unfortunately many developers do n't know Unicode and just use whatever encoding happens to be laying about as the default setting on their computer .
The major browsers are all converging on UTF - 8 encoded URLs ( finally ) , but a lot of the rest of the world uses other encodings and there is no way to specify in the URL which encoding is being used .
This would n't matter if so many web sites did n't try to read the URL .
A URL is an opaque string with meaning only to the server it addresses .
Apart from splitting the path specification at forward slashes ( which are expressly reserved for providing hierarchy ) you should never change the URL .
You do n't know what it means and you do n't know what it is even when you think you do .
Do not try to correct my URL — you do n't know anything about it !
Further reading
I 'm also working on a full guide to handling URLs , but it is n't ready yet .
Restricting yourself to a super - low calorie diet has been discovered as a way to extend your lifespan by a noticeable number of years , but it comes with a pretty lousy side effect : you do n't get to eat anything .
Not worth it !
I 'd rather die at 70 knowing the sweet taste of ham and cheese Hot Pockets than live to 90 and always be hungry .
But there 's good news : it looks like scientists have figured out why calorie - restricted diets increase lifespans , and they 're going to put that magic in pill form .

It turns out that starving yourself causes your ribosomes ( your cell 's protein factories ) to mutate , which is what leads to the positive effects .
And now some smartypants Biologists at the University of Washington have figured out how to induce the life - extending mutation in ribosomes with a drug that doubles the lifespan of yeast cells .
In this project , the UW researchers studied many different strains of yeast cells that had lower protein production .
They found that mutations to the ribosome , the cell 's protein factory , sometimes led to increased life span .
Ribosomes are made up of two parts — the large and small subunits — and the researchers tried to isolate the life - span - related mutation to one of those parts .
" What we noticed right away was that the long - lived strains always had mutations in the large ribosomal subunit and never in the small subunit , " said the study 's lead author , Kristan Steffen , a graduate student in the UW Department of Biochemistry .
The researchers also tested a drug called diazaborine , which specifically interferes with synthesis of the ribosomes ' large subunits , but not small subunits , and found that treating cells with the drug made them live about 50 percent longer than untreated cells .
Using a series of genetic tests , the scientists then showed that depletion of the ribosomes ' large subunits was likely to be increasing life span by a mechanism related to dietary restriction — the TOR signaling pathway .

Dems ' suspense may be unnecessary
The torrent of speculation about the end game of the Democratic nomination contest is creating a false sense of suspense – and wasting a lot of time of the multitudes who are anxious to know how this contest is going to turn out .
Notwithstanding the plentiful commentary to the effect that the Pennsylvania primary must have shaken superdelegates planning to support Barack Obama , causing them to rethink their position , key Democrats on Capitol Hill are unbudged .

“ I do n’t think anyone ’s shaken , ” a leading House Democrat told me .
The critical mass of Democratic congressmen that has been prepared to endorse Obama when the timing seemed right remains prepared to do so .
Their reasons , ones they have held for months , have not changed – and by their very nature are unlikely to .
Essentially , they are three :
( a) Hillary Rodham Clinton is such a polarizing figure that everyone who ever considered voting Republican in November , and even many who never did , will go to the polls to vote against her , thus jeopardizing Democrats down the ticket – i.e. , themselves , or , for party leaders , the sizeable majorities they hope to gain in the House and the Senate in November .
( b) To take the nomination away from Obama when he is leading in the elected delegate count would deeply alienate the black base of the Democratic Party , and , in the words of one leading Democrat , “ The superdelegates are not going to switch their votes and jeopardize the future of the Democratic Party for generations . ”
Such a move , he said , would also disillusion the new , mostly young , voters who have entered into politics for the first time because of Obama , and lose the votes of independents who could make the critical difference in November .
( c) Because the black vote can make the decisive difference in numerous congressional districts , discarding Obama could cost the Democrats numerous seats .
One Democratic leader told me , “ If we overrule the elected delegates there would be mayhem . ”
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s claim that she has , or will have , won the popular vote does not impress them – both because of her dubious math and because , as another key Democrat says firmly , “ The rules are that it ’s the delegates , period . ”
( These views are closely aligned with Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s statement earlier this year that the superdelegates should not overrule the votes of the elected delegates . )
Furthermore , the congressional Democratic leaders do n’t draw the same conclusion from Pennsylvania and also earlier contests that many observers think they do : that Obama ’s candidacy is fatally flawed because he has as yet been largely unable to win the votes of working class whites .
They point out something that has been largely overlooked in all the talk – the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries were closed primaries , and , one key congressional Democrat says , “ Yes , he does n’t do really well with a big part of the Democratic base , but she does n’t do well with independents , who will be critical to success in November . ”
So , the fact that Mrs. Clinton has shown herself to be a remarkably resilient , tough campaigner , an attribute that the Clintons hope will carry much importance , this Democrat says , “ is irrelevant . ”
This person added : “ Many of the superdelegates are not going to be naïve enough to not realize the handwriting on the wall that this thing is going to Obama ” – barring , he added , some major event like the Wright matter that he can’t seem to manage .
They consider this unlikely .
( There ’s almost always a “ something - might - happen ” factor in elections . )
As for the Wright matter , a key Democrat on Capitol Hill says , “ Though it makes [ his Democratic colleagues ] a little nervous , it ’s not enough to change their minds . ”
Moreover , the Wright matter may be old news come the general election .
At first , a large number of superdelegates planned to announce their support for Obama following Super Tuesday , but he did n’t do well enough to warrant that ; then it was to be after Ohio and Texas ; then after Pennsylvania ; and some Democrats suggest that if Obama wins both Indiana and North Carolina a number of superdelegates will announce for him then .
But the prevailing thinking is to allow the race to play out , avoiding a confrontation with Clinton and her backers , but also letting the pressure grow on her to justify continuing to fight a bloody but lost cause .
This is , the thinking goes , the best and perhaps only way to get the thing wrapped up , as they so desperately want to do .
“ We may have to go to June , and whoever ends up with the most delegates wins , ” a key Democrat says .
“ Meanwhile , the attention will be on the battle she can’t win , so why is she doing this – from here on out she ’s only bleeding the party .
The right way to put it is , ‘ This is a war of attrition and it ’s obvious that the numbers are n’t going to add up , so what ’s the point ? ’ ”
He added , “ The hope is that at some point the superdelegates will get frustrated and join the Obama bandwagon . ”
This pressure may not be enough to get the tenacious Hillary Rodham Clinton to quit the race , but , says a leading Democrat , “ Sometime in June we will make it clear to her that this thing is n’t going to the convention . ”

— Police charged the husband of the victim of an attempted stabbing after he hit the suspect with his vehicle .
A female customer was smoking a cigarette outside Primo's Pizza on Yadkin Road around 10 p.m. Police said Aaron McLeod attempted to rob and stab her , but she managed to break free and run inside the restaurant .
McLeod ran away from the scene down Horseshoe Road , and the victim 's husband , Stanton Moretti Jr. , got in his vehicle to pursue him .
Moretti then struck McLeod with his vehicle , police said .
McLeod was transported to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center , where he underwent surgery .
He was listed in critical condition Saturday afternoon .
Moretti faces one charge of assault with a deadly weapon .
No word was immediately available on whether McLeod will be charged .

College Board Intends to Drop AP Programs in Four Subjects
Officials overseeing the Advanced Placement program have announced that they intend to drop AP classes and exams in four subject areas , in a pullback expected to affect about 12,500 students and 2,500 teachers worldwide .
Following the end of the 2008 - 09 academic year , there will be no AP courses or exams in Italian , Latin literature , French literature , and computer science AB , said officials at the College Board , the New York City - based nonprofit organization that owns the AP brand .
The College Board has in past years withdrawn one undersubscribed AP course at a time , but has never taken so many courses off its table of offerings in the half - century since the program started as a way for students to take college - level courses and potentially earn college credit while still in high school .
Trevor Packer , the College Board vice president who oversees the AP program , said the decision was made at a trustee meeting on March 27 , and that AP teachers in the affected subjects were notified by e-mail April 3 .
“ Of course , it ’s sad for them , ” he said of the teachers .
Resource Allocation
Mr. Packer said the decision was made principally because of demographic considerations .
Only a tiny fraction of the members of underrepresented minority groups who take AP exams take the tests in one of those four affected subject areas , he said .
The College Board has made it a priority to reach such students , including those who are African - American and Hispanic .
“ For us , [ the question is ] , are we able to achieve our mission of reaching a broader range of students ? ”
Mr. Packer said .
He added that no additional AP courses would be cut for at least the next five years .
He said the decision was not connected to results from the recently released national audit of AP course syllabuses .
( " Number of Schools Offering AP Falls After First Audit of Courses , " March 14 , 2007 . )
Mr. Packer noted that the Italian program was 400 percent over budget , owing to the small number of students taking the exams .
The Italian program is the only one among the subjects that would not be represented in some other way in the AP program .
The College Board will continue to offer AP French Language , for example , and introductory - level computer science .
Mr. Packer also held out the possibility that the Italian program might be saved if outside money were forthcoming .
“ This was n’t a situation of us going to the trustees and saying we need to cut costs , ” he said , but a question of deploying resources “ less diffusely . ”
Dropping Courses
The College Board plans to stop offering some Advanced Placement courses and tests after the 2008 - 09 school year .
Mr. Packer said each of the 33 remaining AP programs would see its budget grow .
“ We ca n’t have good supports for all 37 subject areas … and we do n’t want any AP subject area to be deemed a so - called second - class citizen , ” he said .
“ It ’s essential that our top funding requirement should be … professional development and instructional materials . ”

The White House is removing a member of the Federal Election Commission for standing up for clean elections , while trying to install another member whose specialty is keeping eligible voters from casting ballots .
The Senate , which must confirm nominees , should insist that President Bush appoint commissioners with a proven record of supporting voting rights and fair elections .
Mr. Bush is purging the current F.E.C. chairman , David Mason , presumably because he was responsible enough to challenge the funding machinations of Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign .
Mr. Mason shocked his fellow Republicans by notifying Mr. McCain that he might run afoul of the law by switching from public funding to private donations once he secured the party ’s nomination .
The White House proposes to replace Mr. Mason with Donald McGahn , a Republican warhorse .
F.E.C. commissioners are expected to be aligned with a party  one of the new Democratic nominees is a staff member of Senator Charles Schumer of New York  but Mr. McGahn has a particularly partisan background .
He was the party ’s Congressional campaign counsel  and the ethics lawyer for Tom DeLay , the former House majority leader from Texas who left office under multiple clouds .
The six - member commission , which now has four vacancies , has been rendered inoperable .
If it is to perform its role as referee of national elections , it urgently needs a full complement  and it needs commissioners with the sort of professionalism displayed by Mr. Mason .

Building a rainwater collection system involves using a S - bend aluminum downspout to connect your gutter to a large barrel .
There is usually a filter in the downspout to keep leaves and other debris out of the barrel , and there should be an overflow spout near the top of the barrel to prevent the downspout from backing up if the barrel is completely filled .
That means the barrel needs to be on level , well - draining soil to keep the lost moisture away from your house .
A spigot is put on the bottom of the barrel to retrieve the water .

An emotional
Dick Vitale , in his fourth time being nominated for enshrinement into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame , was one of six selected Monday to the class of 2008 .
Normally never at a loss for words , Vitale -- who first revealed his election to listeners of ESPN Radio 's " Mike and Mike in the Morning " -- took several deep breaths before being able to describe what the honor means to him .
" I 'm just in awe I have to tell you , I cried like a baby , " Vitale told listeners .
He also became emotional when interviewed at Monday 's formal announcement in San Antonio , site of the Final Four .
Vitale tried to put into words what being placed among the game 's all - time greats means to him .
" To have my bust up there with people I idolize , people that I 'm in awe of , " Vitale said .
" People like the John Woodens and the Dean Smiths and the Bob Knights and the Mike Krzyzewskis .
All these people like Oscar Robertson and Jerry West I think about the fact that a guy like myself , a sixth grade teacher out of New Jersey , chasing a dream .
Never a great player , did n't have a big name as a coach .
But because of ESPN and George Bodenheimer and all you beautiful people that I work with , have given me an opportunity to do something that I love . "
Vitale admitted that until about a decade ago , he did n't know he could be considered for induction as a contributor to the game .
" Really , all I 've been is a guy with one common denominator , " he said .
" I can't run .
I can't jump .
I can't shoot .
But I 've always had a terrific passion and enthusiasm for whatever I 've tried to do in life .
27.09 . , 23:35 , Exit Marrakech Spielfilm Deutschland Marokko 2013 .
Ben reist in den Ferien zu seinem Vater Heinrich nach Marrakesch .
Der Theaterregisseur arbeitet hier an der Inszenierung eines Stücks und hat für seinen Sohn aus erster Ehe eigentlich gar keine Zeit .
Während das Verhältnis zwischen beiden zunehmend abkühlt , erkundet Ben fernab des väterlichen Luxushotels auf eigene Wege das Nachtleben .
Dabei verliebt er sich in eine junge Marokkanerin , der er in ihr abgelegenes Heimatdorf folgt .
Nach nervenaufreibender Odyssee kann Heinrich seinen verlorenen Sohn endlich aufspüren .
Doch um wirklich zu ihm zu finden , bedarf es einer weit größeren Anstrengung .
Five years ago , starches were persona non grata in the United States .
The Atkins diet was the rage , and prospects for the potato were dim .
As Maine farmer Don Thibodeau sowed another crop of spud seeds and watched wholesale prices fall , he and friend Bob Harkin had an idea .
They launched a distillery using potatoes to make vodka .
" Vodka was first made with potatoes , but as grains took over , spuds were pushed to the wayside , " says Harkin .
But now , the potato is making a comeback , both as a driver of economic development and as an important and nutritious food .
The United Nations has declared 2008 the International Year of the Potato in an effort to raise worldwide awareness of the lowly tuber .
The vegetable has come a long way from its original cultivation in the Peruvian Andes several thousand years ago .
Now , about 350 million tons are grown each year , making potatoes the fourth - largest source of food on the planet behind rice , wheat , and corn .
With the world population expected to grow by some 100 million in the next two decades and with most of that growth in the developing world , the need for a nutritious and fast - growing food is more critical than ever .
A good source of nutrients like vitamin C and potassium and virtually fat free , the potato is also smart : " It 's one of the most efficient ways to convert seed , land , and water into nutrients for human consumption , " says Lee Frankel , president of the United Potato Growers of America .
Barometer .
While some might snicker at the U.N. 's potato PR , there is more to the initiative than conferences and advertisements .
Past U.N. campaigns have included the Year of Rice in 2004 , which successfully raised awareness of that grain 's nutritional value and resulted in more cultivation .
" The potato is a good barometer of developing economies , " says Daniel Gustafson of the U.N. 's Food and Agricultural Organization .
In Europe , potato production has fallen by 1 percent every year for the past two decades , while the developing world — led by India and China — has been increasing production by some 5 percent a year over the same time .
Further , potatoes are largely eaten and processed domestically ; only 6 percent of the global potato output is traded internationally .
We have a winner in the Worst Bad Name Contest .
And after talking to the woman who has this name , I ’m happy to report we have new anecdotal evidence to go with the psychological studies supporting the Boy Named Sue theory : good things can indeed come from a bad name .
It was n’t easy picking a winner from more than 1,000 entries .
Besides Charman Toilette , an early favorite of the judges , there was Chastity Beltz , Wrigley Fields , Justin Credible , Tiny Bimbo , and a girl whose father was an auto mechanic but somehow did n’t realize he was effectively giving her the name of a tire : Michele Lynn .
There were girls named Chaos and Tutu , and boys named Clever , Cowboy , Crash , Felony , Furious and Zero .
There was Unnamed Jones ( pronounced you - NAH- med ) .
There was Brook Traut and his daughter , Rainbow .
There were more names involving genitalia than the judges cared to count .
( Memo to parents : Carefully consider your surname before naming a boy Harry or Richard . )
The grand prize , a copy of “ Bad Baby Names , ” by Michael Sherrod and Matthew Rayback , goes to Kate , a Lab reader who nominated a fellow resident of the Cleveland area : Iona Knipl .
The judges chose it because , in addition to being an embarrassing pun , it also set up an inevitable reply from people imagining they were being wittily original .
I called up Miss Knipl and asked her how many times she had heard someone meet her and reply , “ I own two . ”
“ I got sick of hearing it , but what can you do ? ” Miss Knipl said .
“ My mother never thought about that when she was naming me .
It was her mother ’s name .
I came home from school a couple times crying and my mother said , ‘ Oh , why did I do that ? ’ but it had never occurred to her how people would hear the name . ”
Miss Knipl shed the pun when she got married and began using her husband ’s last name .
But then , after they were divorced , she went right back to her old name .
It might have simpler to keep her husband ’s name , she told me , but by this time she had come to appreciate the advantages of Iona Knipl .
“ In school it bothered me , but now I think it ’s neat , ” she said .
“ It ’s different . ”
I ’m glad to hear that her story , like Johnny Cash ’s “ Boy Named Sue , ” has a happy ending — in fact , I wonder now if I should have called it the Best Bad Name Contest .
Iona Knipl ’s experience jibes with the psychological research I cited in my Findings column , and with the opinion of experts like Cleveland Evans , a psychologist at Bellevue University in Nebraska and a past president of the American Names Society .
Dr. Evans says that while he ’d advise against certain names — he once pleaded with a woman not to name her daughter Tyranny — there ’s plenty of anecdotal and scientific evidence that children turn out fine .
“ Both Ima Hogg and Shanda Lear seem to have done very well with their names , ” he told me , referring to the daughters of a Texas governor and the founder of Lear Jet .
“ I think the biggest factor in whether such a name negatively impacts a child would be the overall nature of their relationship with their parents .
If the child has a warm and loving relationship with the name - giver , the name will probably be shrugged off as a minor nuisance and a conversation piece . ”
Researchers have finally published the results of data recovered from a cracked and singed hard drive that fell to Earth in the debris from the Space Shuttle Columbia , which broke up during reentry on February 1 , 2003 , killing all seven crew members .
The hard drive contained data from the CVX - 2 ( Critical Viscosity of Xenon ) experiment , designed to study the way xenon gas flows in microgravity .
The findings , published this April in the journal Physical Review E , confirmed that when stirred vigorously , xenon exhibits a sudden change in viscosity known as shear thinning .
The same effect allows whipped cream and ketchup to go from flowing smoothly like liquids to holding their shapes like solids .
Although the CVX - 2 results may not change anyone 's life , Robert " Bobby " Berg , the lead investigator for CVX - 2 and a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Md. , says the publication caps a 20 - year research project that has occupied his thoughts daily since 2003 .
" It was a load off my shoulders to finally get it published , " says the 52 - year - old researcher .
The CVX - 2 experiment was designed to measure xenon 's viscosity close to the critical point , or the combination of temperature and pressure at which liquid and vapor are essentially indistinguishable .
Near that point , a gas should " twinkle , " Berg says , as droplets quickly condense and evaporate within the thick fog .
According to the theory behind shear thinning , as an object swishes through these droplets more vigorously , it should begin slicing through individual droplets and hence feel less resistance .
To test for the effect , the CVX team sent up 0.37 fluid ounces ( 11 milliliters ) of xenon sealed in a vessel that contained a thumbnail - size nickel mesh capable of vibrating at a range of amplitudes [ see image ] .
The group downloaded about 85 percent of the data from the 370 - hour experiment while Columbia was in orbit — enough to see that it was working as expected — but the test depended on the full data , which was locked in a nearly 400 - megabyte commercial hard drive ensconced in a metal " card cage " and housed with other electronics in a larger vessel in the shuttle 's cargo bay .
After the reentry , Berg says , when it was not immediately recovered , " we assumed that it fell out of the cage and burned up and that was it . "
But engineers from Johnson Space Center had actually found the apparatus in the hanger at Kennedy Space Center where workers had laid out the Columbia debris , says James Myers of the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland , the project 's lead engineer .
When the Glenn engineers learned that the hard drive had indeed survived , they sent it to Ontrack Data Recovery in Minneapolis to extract whatever data remained in the cracked hard drive disk [ see image ] .
The data came back about 99 percent complete , but the results were so complex that isolating the shear - thinning effect took an additional several years , Berg says .
He notes that the experiment could have only worked in microgravity , to prevent the xenon from settling under its feather - light weight .
With NASA 's priorities shifting away from basic research , he says , " this is the sort of experiment that wo n't be duplicated for a long time , if ever . "

Mr Strauss - Kahn will head IMF talks in Washington .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has warned that potential losses from the credit crunch will reach $ 945bn ( £ 472bn ) and could be even higher .
The IMF says that losses are spreading from sub - prime mortgage assets to other sectors , such as commercial property , consumer credit , and company debt .
It says that there was a " collective failure " to appreciate the risky borrowing by financial institutions .
And it warns that tough measures and government intervention may be needed .
The IMF 's Global Stability Report warns that " despite unprecedented intervention by major central banks , financial markets remain under considerable strain , now compounded by a more worrisome macroeconomic environment , weakly capitalised institutions , and broad - based deleveraging . "
The effects of the credit crunch are likely to be broader , deeper and more protracted than previously expected
IMF Global Stability Report
The IMF , which oversees the global economy , says that the effects of the credit crunch are likely to be " broader , deeper and more protracted " than in previous downturns , due to the " degree of securitisation and leverage in the financial system " .
" Leading indicators point to a tightening of credit conditions across many economic activities , " said Jaime Caruana , head of the IMF 's Monetary and Capital Markets Department , and author of the report .
The report has been released ahead of a gathering of world financial leaders at the IMF 's spring meeting in Washington D.C. this weekend .
On Wednesday the IMF is also expected to downgrade its forecast for the world economy , and accept that a sharp slowdown is likely in the US .
Who 's to blame ?
The report blames lax regulation by governments and poor supervision by banks for allowing the situation to develop .
And it warns that national governments must prepare contingency plans " for dealing with large stocks of impaired assets " if " writedowns lead to significant negative effects on the real economy " .
The report is sharply critical of banks and other financial institutions , which it accuses of " excessive risk - taking " and " weak underwriting " .
It says they were " too complacent " about liquidity risks - the problems that would happen if they ran out of ready cash - and too ready to rely on wholesale money markets and central banks to help them if they got into trouble .
And its says that there was a failure of banks ' risk management systems to appreciate that the new " structured finance vehicles " that they used to offload their risky sub - prime investments were not really viable .
It says that the new instruments increased the danger of a " liquidity spiral " in which markets and institutions ' funding problems reinforced each other .
And it warns that banks will have to concentrate on rebuilding their balance sheets by raising additional funds and limiting future lending .
Tougher regulation
The IMF says that financial sector supervision and regulation " lagged behind the rapid innovation and shifts in business models , leaving scope for excessive risk - taking " and says more fundamental changes are needed in the medium term .
But it warns against " a rush to regulate " which could stifle innovation and make the credit crunch worse .
The supervision of banks has been found wanting , the IMF says However , it says that there should be tougher rules to stop banks putting assets off the balance sheet , and requiring banks to put aside more capital to protect against losses .
It points out that it is not securitisation itself , but " lax underwriting standards in the US mortgage market , the extension of securitisation into increasingly complex and difficult to understand structures based on increasingly lower quality assets " , and low interest rates which led to a situation where " risks were insufficiently appreciated " .
And it suggests that central banks will have to take into account worries about excessive asset prices , such as house price bubbles , when setting interest rates .
Government intervention
In recent days , both the US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and IMF boss Dominique Strauss - Kahn have both urged major changes in international and national financial regulation .
Last week , Mr Paulson proposed a major shake - up of the US system of financial regulation , giving more power to the central bank , the Fed , to intervene to rescue stricken banks and other financial institutions .
And on Monday , Mr Strauss - Kahn said that the need for public intervention to tackle the credit crunch at the global level was " becoming more evident " every day .
This , along with more intervention in the banking sector , would offer a " third line of defence " , Mr Strauss - Kahn said .

If video is going to be streamed in China , the state wants to know about it .
China requires a streaming company to obtain a state license and then avoid airing clips that might inspire fear , contain pornography , or endanger national security .
That 's a huge burden for sites that feature user - generated content , especially when " endangering national security " includes showing video clips of Chinese unrest .
This week , China mounted a crackdown on 62 separate web sites that in violated a new law against showing online audio and video without permits .
When the government first instituted the law back in January , Internet video sites had already become hugely popular in China , and it was widely suspected that the rules would not be strictly enforced .
At first , these suspicions appeared justified , as nothing happened for two months , even to the many sites that never bothered to obtain the state license to broadcast .
But yesterday , authorities penalized 32 sites for infractions , shut down 25 more for not having a license , and referred five cases to another department for follow - up .
It was a fairly gutsy display of central control , one that may have been hastened in part by recent protests in Tibet ( China recently blocked YouTube access over clips from Tibet that were appearing on the service ) .
It 's not that the ruling Communist Party does n't like online multimedia services ; it does .
Even capitalist advertising , which is surging in China , is no problem .
After all , every minute spent watching a squirrel water - ski is a minute not spent thinking about massive economic inequality , rural unrest , corruption , one - party rule , or what might really be going on in Tibet .
Sina.com , the largest portal in China , is reportedly spending millions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure in advance of the Olympics to be held this summer in Beijing , when millions of Chinese users are expected to watch the games over the Internet .
While the games might seem like a perfectly innocuous thing to air , recent calls for international boycotts or protests over Tibet and other human rights issues could politicize the games more than China would like .
The country will also have to drop many of its filtering restrictions in the Beijing area to accommodate an influx of visitors .
Not everyone sees a block on sites like YouTube as no big deal , and China knows it .
Still , it has no plans to back off its aggressive approach to censorship .
Now that it has the largest Internet - using population in the world , China seems more determined than ever to exert control over the new medium , even going so far as to require registration at ' Net cafes .
It has to tread carefully , however .
Regulations last year designed to make bloggers register their real names with the government were abandoned in the face of popular protest , and even this year 's imposition of licenses for Internet broadcast sites included concessions for established ( and popular ) companies .
WASHINGTON , D.C .
-- The American LegislativeExchange Council ( ALEC ) released its 14th edition of the
Report Card on American Education
: A State - by - State Analysis , which covers the schoolyears 1985 - 1986 thru 2006 - 2007 .
This comprehensive guide ranks the educational performance of the school systems in the states and the District of Columbia with Minnesota placing first and the District of Columbia last .
Findings include :
Based on a variety of indicators , ALEC 's 2007 Report Card has found no direct correlation between conventional measures ofeducation inputs , such as expenditures per pupil and teacher salaries , and educational outputs , such as average scores on standardized tests .
For instance , class sizes today are 15 % smaller than they were 20 years ago , yet of the 10 states that experienced the greatest decreases , only one ( Vermont ) is found among the highest performing states in the rankings .
Even with dramatic increases in the amount of educational resources spent on primary and secondary education over the past 2 decades -- expenditures have risen nationally to an all - time high of $ 9,295 per pupil -- student performance has improved only slightly ; 69 % of American eighth - graders are still performing below proficiency in math and 71 % in reading , according to the 2007 National Assessment of Education Progress .
The latest results of comparison among participating nations of the OECD peg American students ’ achievement levels in science below dozens of other countries including Croatia , Latvia , and mainland China .
In fact , the United States scores below the combined average of all countries observed .
Reddit readers are pouring in donations to send flowers to veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas - - over $ 1,140 raised so far .
The reason : Thomas grilling Dana Perino from her front row seat over torture .
This actually is n't the first time that a flower drive 's been started for Thomas 's questioning .

It was a defining moment all right .
Mr. Maliki ’s impulsive and ill - planned attempt to vanquish the militias in southern Iraq loyal to his Shiite rival , the cleric Moktada al - Sadr , was a failure that left Mr. Sadr more secure than before .
Though some Iraqi armed forces were briefly in the lead , others mutinied .
Eventually American and British forces and air power had to ride to the rescue in both Basra and Baghdad .
Even then , the result was at best a standoff , with huge casualties .
The battle ended only when Mr. Maliki ’s own political minions sought a cease - fire .
Mr. McCain was just as wrong about Basra as he was in 2003 , when he said the war would be “ brief ” and be paid for by Iraqi oil revenues .
Or as he was in the 1990s , when he championed extravagant State Department funding for the war instigator Ahmad Chalabi , who ’d already been branded untrustworthy by the C.I.A .
( The relationship between Mr. Chalabi and the former lobbyist Charles Black , now a chief McCain campaign strategist , is explored in a new book , “ The Man Who Pushed America to War , ” by Aram Roston . )
As for Basra , Mr. McCain told Joe Klein of Time in January that it was “ not a problem . ”
He told John King of CNN while in Baghdad last month that Mr. Sadr ’s “ influence has been on the wane for a long time . ”
When the battle ended last week , Mr. McCain said : “ Apparently it was Sadr who asked for the cease - fire , declared a cease - fire .
It was n’t Maliki .
Very rarely do I see the winning side declare a cease - fire . ”
At least the last of those sentences was accurate .
It was indeed the losing side  Maliki ’s  that pleaded for the cease - fire .
Perhaps all these mistaken judgments can be attributed to the fog of war .
But Mr. McCain ’s bigger strategic picture , immutable no matter what happens on the ground , is foggier still .
Like Mr. Bush , he keeps selling Iraq as the central front in the war on Al Qaeda .
But Al Qaeda was not even a participant in the Basra battle , which was an eruption of a Shiite - vs . - Shiite civil war .
( Al Qaeda is busy enough in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the actual central front in the war on terror . )
Mr. McCain is also fond of portraying Mr. Maliki’s “ democracy ” in Iraq as an essential bulwark against Iran ; his surrogate Lindsey Graham habitually refers to Mr. Sadr ’s Mahdi Army as “ Iranian - backed militias . ”
But the political coalition and militia propping up Mr. Maliki are even closer to Iran than the Sadrists .
McClatchy Newspapers reported last week that the Maliki - Sadr cease - fire was not only brokered in Iran but by a general whose name is on the Treasury Department ’s terrorist list : the commander of the Quds force of Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard .

So this is where this latest defining moment in Iraq leaves us : with victories for Iran and Mr. Sadr , and with Iraqi forces that still ca n’t stand up ( training cost to American taxpayers so far : $ 22 billion ) so we can stand down .
The Baghdad Green Zone , pummeled with lethal mortar fire , proved vulnerable once again .
Basra remains so perilous that Britain has had to suddenly halt its planned troop withdrawals .
Tony Blair had ordered the drawdown a year ago , after declaring that “ the next chapter in Basra ’s history will be written by the Iraqis . ”

Silly Sally sullies PFLAG 's account
by Jeremy Hooper
Last week , as you might recall , the Parents , Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ( PFLAG ) organization met last week with Oklahoma 's new face of queer basis , Rep. Sally Kern .
And while PFLAG 's account of the session left us with the impression that Sally had at least made some positive concessions in terms of the hiring and firing of workers based on sexual orientation , Rep .
Kern has taken the opportunity to clarify that in actuality , she 's still just as queer - hostile as we always thought she was .
In a new press release , she says , in part :
While I did meet with PFLAG in what was a cordial and polite meeting , they have taken my statements and have spun them to make it appear that I am backing off my comments that homosexuality is a sin .
As a Christian who believes in the authority of God ’s Word , I will never retract my comments that homosexuality is a sin .
PFLAG has also spun my words to say that I am in favor of “ sexual orientation ” laws .
I unequivocally do not support “ sexual orientation ” laws .
While I do not advocate employers going on a witch hunt to fire homosexual employees who are performing their jobs in a manner just like any heterosexual employee , I do not support laws that would force employers to check their First Amendment rights to freedom of religion , speech , and association at the workplace door .
Since PFLAG has shown their lack of integrity by misinterpreting my statements from our meeting to fit their agenda — thus revealing their purpose of open dialog to be just a means of seeking to weaken my position and strengthen theirs —
I see no benefit in having future meetings with them .
Oh , Sally .
All PFLAG really indicated is that even though you compared us to terrorists , you still support our right to stay employed within our society - wrecking careers .
What they did for you is provide the first signs of a semi- compassionate heart than any of us have seen in the weeks , months , and years that we 've been following your anti-gay exploits .
And now your poo-pooing them for it ?
Good lord , Madame Representative -- what about the Anita Bryant career trajectory appeals to you so much ?!
But whatever , Rep. Kern :
If you wanna side with the movement that is rapidly heading towards its inevitable place in the Annals of Unfortunate Civil Rights History , then you have every right to do so .
Your nutty gays / terrorism - linking comments will certainly provide a great teachable moment for many a future generation .
Sally Kern Rejects PFLAG
Account of Meeting [ AFT ]
*** PFLAG 's Steve Ralls has responded to Kern over on the organization 's blog .
** UPDATE , 4/8 : Now you can decide for yourself how the meeting played out .
PFLAG has uploaded the audio from the session :
Your thoughts

You think this is a big deal ?
I guess you have n't seen the letter Rep. Kern wrote to the Bethany Tribune .
It 's at http://www.bethanytribune.net/opinion.htm and at http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/sally-kern-letter-to-the-editor.pdf

I love when common sense negates bullshit .
" If homosexuality were influenced by genes , it would appear in every culture , but in 29 of 79 cultures surveyed in 1952 , homosexuality was rare or absent . "
1952 was hardly the era of equality for gays , and cultures jailing gays or putting them to death , no wonder homosexuality is n't " present " in every culture , especially in 1952 .

In the table bellow you can see the weather and average settlings per year , but if you are planning a trip or vacation and want to know whether to take a sweater , coat , umbrella or swimsuit you better press the link below and update with up to date Barcelona 's wheatear forecast for the coming days .
The Trip :
Two days after our wedding we took a flight to Barcelona .
A one week ( grossly ) honeymoon trip .
From the material we read and from things we heard about the city , we immediately understood that we will not be able to see all that the city has to offer .
A desire for a calm trip without too much time wasting on the roads , moving from one location to another , from one hand , along with the desire to see the so many beautiful places of the city and to enjoy the variety of attractions from the other hand , brought us to plan our trip to Barcelona in such a way that it will include places , attractions and activities that reflects the unique nature , culture and architecture of Barcelona .
Accommodation :
After landing at Barcelona ( Catalonia 's capital ) international airport at noon , we took a taxi and reached to our hotel  Catalonia Aragon Hotel .
A three stars ranking hotel ( after a full renovation recently ) located in a quiet area , walking distance from the famous Sagrada Familia and from a metro station , which we later on used to go easily everywhere .
Tip :
It is not recommended to stay in the Rambla area in which most of the hotels are old and rooms turn to the noisy ( 24 hours a day ) boulevard .
Food , Restaurants :
Places combine wine and Tapas can be found everywhere .
We are not fans of Tapas and still we have no problem to find other kind of food to eat including any western food .
Transportation :
There is a big variety of transportation means at Barcelona : metro , train , bus , taxi and even bicycle .
The center of Barcelona city is relatively small and pretty convenient for walking .
Free maps of Barcelona can be achieved in any reservation desk of any hotel .
To places that can not be reached by metro , there are comfortable bus lines .
We used the friendly metro .
We bought the T - 10 ticket that allow you 10 rides .
( you can buy also a one day ticket , three days or five days ticket ) .
Note :
There are a number of airlines , both standard and low cost , which offer flights to Barcelona .
If you need help deciding which to choose , you should read flight reviews to find out about other travellers  experiences .
Shopping :
In one word  expensive !!!
You can find everything in Barcelona but ( for our opinion ) it is not a place for people who are looking for bargains and the prices are not cheap .
Tourist Sites :
As already mentioned before , thare is a lot to see and many things to do in Barcelona .
The variety of sights , experiences and activities is big .
We had only one week ( grossly ) .
We visited the following Barcelona tourist sites and attractions :
Already in the first evening , after a short organization , little rest and with a map of Barcelona we received from the hotel front desk , we went out to a short walk in the streets near our hotel in order to aspire fresh air and absorb the local atmosphere .
After a short look at the map , we discovered that the famous church is just a few minutes walking from our hotel and so we went to see it lighted in the evening .
On the next day we came back for an extensive tour .
The place was under constructions ( it is all the time ) but it didnt disturb us to be impressed from the special structure which Gaudi devoted to , more than half of his life .
Along the Rambla :
The famous boulevards , connects the Catalonia plaza , located in the middle of the city , with the Columbus statue , located near the sea .
The left part of the city , when going down towards the sea , is the Gothic quarter , and the neighborhood extended on the right is Ravell .
Quite a lot hours ( and we could more ) we spend in those lively boulevards .
Walking through , at the restaurants , at the markets and museums located in them .
Watching the many stands ( food , birds , painters ) , street artists and shows , the human status and whatnot .
Following are places that we recommend not to miss :
Boqueria Market -
This is the roofed food market , the popular and noisy one , in the heart of the boulevard .
This is the most known and beloved one from all the markets in the long boulevards .
This is a real charming market , full of colors and bustle of tourist and locals , in which you can find all the best and everything is in opulence and in order .

Columbus Monument -
At the end of the boulevard , near the fountain in the entrance to the harbor , the Columbus monument is rising .
At the top of the monument , an image of Columbus is pointing to the sea .
We watched it , took a photo and moved on .

Rial Plaza -
An impressive architectonic enclave , found very near to the Rambla , in the old town .
In the wide square area there are few nice coffee shops and restaurants .
Once again we watch it , took a photo and moved on .

Picasso Museum - Near the Rambla , inside the Gothic quarter , reside the Picasso museum in which you can see the beginning of Picasso road as an artist , lots of sketch from the days he was a young artist and also pictures from his blue era .
We are not a big art fans but we got inside for a short tour and were not disappointed .

Catalonia Plaza -
The central plaza in Barcelona , full of fountains , statues and hundreds of birds .
A beautiful plaza surrounded with known brand stores and in the plaza itself a pleasant nightlife for tourists .
Back to top
Montjuic :
Montjuic ( translated as Hill of the Jews in the medieval Catalan language ) is a low hill watching the city harbour , south - west to the center of Barcelona .
The hill has a long history ( among others it served as a jewish cemetery ) .
Today the hill is one of the beauty places in the city .
On our way to the top of the hill we passed the impressive magic fountain ( Font Magica ) and we climb the stairs to the top of the hill .
At the top of the hill we saw the big national palace ( Palau Nacional ) , the olimpic stadium ( Estadi Olimpic ) and more sports facilities that were part of the Olympic village ( Vila Olimpica ) that was established for the 1992 Olympic games .
And also , you can not miss the shaped communication tower and the mature transportation infrastructure .
We also so at the hill the PuabloEspaniol ( Poble Espanyol ) 
The " Spanish Village " in which copies of different structures from all over Spain were build in it .
Shortening , the entire hill is full with beautiful gardens , interesting buildings and impressive plazas .
It is worth climbing the hill in order to enjoy the city view that is spread till the see , and to walk in the gardens lanes and breathe nature smells .
Park Guell :
The most famous park in Barcelona , designed by the architect Antonio Gaudi .
The park is a green lung with one of the most beautiful lookout points on the city .
There are many ways to reach the park .
We got off on Vallcarca metro station and climb the Baixada de la Gloria .
This is a narrow and especially steep street that in order to relieve the climbing , escalators were build in parts of it .
This is a real nice way to go to the park .
The street brings you to the servants entrance in the back part of the park , so the tour is actually done towards the main entrance .
In the park there is an impressive wide entrance space , a fountain in a dragon shape , the special bench  area and more special decorated buildings , and of course Gaudis house .
And the entrance is free .
Port Olimpic :
When we asked the locals what are the options for a night recreation in Barcelona , we were advice to go to the new marina area  the Port Olimpic .
We were told that this is the new youngsters zone of the city .
In the marina there are many restaurants , coffee shops and clubs , and also stylish night bars and discotheques and not so far we discovered a casino
Shortening , nice area with good atmosphere ( and not just at night ) .
Flamenco Show :
Flamenco show is a must in Spain .
We went to such a show in one of the evenings at the Santa Suzanna farm .
The recreation includes a meal and enjoyable show of professional flamenco dancers , dressed with the best traditional cloths .
Recommended !!!
Football :
How can we talk about Barcelona without mentioning the word 
Football or if to be more acurate , the words FC Barcelona ?
The football in Barcelona is an outstanding recreation option and also the ones who are not fans of the game , must see the exemplary order and the atmosphere at the famous Camp Nou stadium .
The home statium of FC Barcelona .
And so we went to see FC Barcelona with all the stars players playing in the Champion League game in front of 62,000 ( !!!) people .
We bought tickets at the stadium but for a league game it is recommended to buy tickets ahead .
It is possible also at WorldTicketShop .
Barcelona Aquarium :
More than ten thousands of fish spices including sharks in a huge aquarium simulating their natural environment .
In the place there Is also a 80 meters long transparent tunnel .
Impressive !

Outside the city of Barcelona there are many interesting and tempting places to visit .
For instance : And more ...
We decided to dedicate two days ( almost full days but not loaded ) for trips outside the city .
1 ) Montserrat 
We dedicated one day for a tour in the Montserrat .
This monastery is placed 50 km from Barcelona ( about an hour by train ) and indeed its beauty and location in the heart of a granite mountainside justifies the visit there .
2 ) Another day we dedicated to go to Costa Brava ( a little more than an hour by train ) .
There we walked in the little streets of the town , rested in one of the beaches , had a nice lunch , than another short walk along the beach and finally took a train back to our hotel .

" We need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in Germany , in the whole of the European Union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " Seehofer said in an interview to be published on Sunday , April 20 .
Speaking to the mass - circulation Bild newspaper , Seehofer noted that the EU had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares ( 9.4 million acres ) of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
This land should be brought into production once more , he said .
A global problem
Agriculture is a matter of national interest , says Seehofer
The United Nations World Food Program ( WFP ) has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since June 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" We have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " Seehofer said .
With an annual population growth of 80 million people , WFP expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" We have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
Seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions
What will happen to subventions ?
Food prices have spiralled globally but also within the European Union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
German news weekly Der Spiegel reported on Saturday that the German Finance Ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
Seehofer , however , insisted that farming in Europe still had to be protected .
" Agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
In 2006 , European farmers received 50 million euros ( $ 79 million ) from the EU budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
Dire consequences
The UN Food Program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world
Earlier this month , the head of the International Monetary Fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" Thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said Dominique Strauss - Kahn on Saturday , April 12 , at an IMF meeting in Washington .
Skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including Indonesia , Egypt , the Philippines and Haiti .
Some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
High energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
It is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek - Zeul said prior to the IMF meeting .
" The targets for [ fuel ] blends must be put to the test . "

Incomprehensibly the school involved were really excited that they were going to be on telly :
Acresfield Community Primary School BBC Newsnight Brain Gym® screening
During this week and next , Newsnight are presenting a series , over ten days , linked to the Iraq war .
The screening of the item linked to Brain Gym® is not expected during this time .
I think that the Newsnight audience will have increased , as a result of our waiting to see our school on television .
Unfortunately , I have not been informed as yet of when the item will be televised .

I placed a nice piece of electronic cell phone gadgetry up for sale on eBay .
It sold for a bit over $ 500 .
The person who bought it has a relatively new account ( Jun of 2007 ) , with no prior feedback .
They already paid via PayPal , and I initiated transferring the money out of the separate bank account I keep for PayPal stuff .
I am , of course , concerned that this person might be a scammer , so I did a little google stalking to find out about them .
My results were mixed : they have been at the address listed for at least two years , but an old friendster profile has lots of comments congratulating them on being a computer hacker .
So I do n't know if they are trustworthy .
My concern , looking around at horror stories , is that a chargeback will occur after I ship the device , either at they buyer 's request , or because the buyer might have used a stolen credit card .
The good news is that I am eligible for PayPal 's Seller protection policy , as long as I ship with a tracking number and a signature requirement , which I will do .
This should protect me against chargebacks .
But I do n't know what can go wrong with this .
Reading around , it looks like some scammers might be able to reverse charges much later , after the online tracking and signature information have expired .
Does anyone have any experience with this ?
What can go wrong ?
Other than reimbursing the buyer and relisting the item , what can I do to protect myself ?
Community recommendations are becoming all the rage these days .
While , Twitter and FriendFeed are popular ways to get recommendations within your personal networks and within a community , they do n’t specifically cater to finding the most popular content within .
Here are four great sites that give great recommendations of popular content within your own personal community and more !
BlogRize
BlogRize organizes communities around sites instead of the usual organization method based on friends .
Unfortunately , because BlogRize is in “ beta ” , a site must reach a certain amount of members before it can become an open community .
There are currently 4 site communities that are open : Louis Gray , Read / Write Web , Techcrunch , and Lifehacker .
However , you can add your list of sites that you ’d like to see a community built around and pray that others like it just as much as you do .
Within each community ’s page , you ’ll see popular shared items by other fans of the site and what the ratings for each article are .
BlogRize sports a rather unique ratings system that users will benefit from .
You ’re not rating on a scale of 1 - 5 .
Instead , you rate whether an article is interesting , funny , insightful , lame , disagree , or facts wrong .
You may find this more helpful then the lame 1 - 5 stars .
For more in - depth coverage , check out these BlogRize Reviews : BlogRize Builds A Community Around Your Blog and its Readers , BlogRize : Social News Gets Personal
LinkRiver
Last month , I called LinkRiver my personal Techmeme ( Corvida on LinkRiver ) .
I still stand by that statement .
LinkRiver goes the by the standards by allowing you to see what ’s popular amongst those that you are following based on how many people have shared an item through their Google Reader linkblog and also the LinkRiver bookmarklet .
However , it does an even better job of showing what ’s popular amongst the entire LinkRiver community !
On the LinkRiver Popular page , you ’ll find more than enough popular content to get you through the week .
For more in - depth coverage , check out my LinkRiver review “ LinkRiver Is My Personal Techmeme “ .
Social Median
A new comer to content recommendation , Social Median gives you the hottest content from all across the tech community .
Recommendations are based on the number of “ clip its ” an item has received .
You can “ clip ” an item using Social Median ’s “ Clip it ” bookmarklet .
There are various popular networks you can join to get better news recommendations sent to you .
Also , if you do n’t have time to check into the service , you can have Social Median email you the most popular content of the day or at a particular time .
For more in - depth coverage , check out these articles on Social Median : Former Jobster CEO ’s Social |Median Incubating in Alpha , Social|median : Personalized News Filter – 1000 Invites
Blern
Blern is another new comer to the content recommendation niche .
The difference between Blern and the others services is that Blern attempts to learn your reading habits in order to better serve you , instead of basing recommendations entirely off of the community like the others .
You can help Blern learn your reading habits by importing your feeds from services such as StumbleUpon , Del.icio.us , Reddit , etc , and by visiting your recommendations page often to give feedback on recommended content .
When you run out of content , Blern also features buzzword and feeds pages so that you can get the latest items from your feeds and also find popular content from buzzwords of your choice .
For more in - depth coverage , check out these articles on Blern : Blern Makes A Mistake From The Early Nineties , Blern.com – Blogs and Articles Recommended to You
The Power Of “ You ” And “ Community ”
In this day and age , finding content really is a simple as putting in a keyword on Google .
With plenty of filters going around , nothing seems to be the filtering effects of yourself and a great community .
All of these services can help to filter and provide you with better content , better sites , and even better people .

[ darcs - devel ] darcs - 2 performs really well for the " darcs get " use case
Folks :
We use darcs to manage our source code in the http://allmydata.org project ( it is an open source , secure , decentralized file system ) .
Our trunk repository [ 1 ] currently has 2,484 patches in it .
The current version of the source code has 269 files , at a total of 13 MiB bytes ( some of the files are binaries ) and around 48,000 lines in the non-binaries .
The _darcs / patches directory ( which contains all of the patches , gzipped ) takes 40 MiB of disk space .
We have automated builds and tests using buildbot , so this was an opportunity for me to benchmark different versions of darcs .
The buildslave that I used is a Celeron Coppermine at 564 MHz running Ubuntu Dapper [ exhibit 2 ] .
Originally it was running darcs - 1.0.5 ( that 's what comes with Ubuntu Dapper ) , and a " darcs get -- partial " of our source code over HTTP took 286 seconds [ exhibit 3 ] .
Next I installed darcs - 1.0.9 -- the final release in the darcs - 1 line .
A " darcs get -- partial " took 308 seconds [ exhibit 4 ] .
( I did n't try this experiment enough times to determine if the difference between darcs - 1.0.5 and darcs - 1.0.9 was merely jitter in the network or the machine load . )
Next I installed darcs - 2.0.0 .
A " darcs get -- partial " took 93 seconds [ exhibit 5 ] .
Next I configured it to do its darcs get from a hashed - format repository instead of an old darcs - 1 - format repository as described in the darcs manual [ 6 ] .
A " darcs get -- partial " took 6.47 seconds [ exhibit 7 ] .
Next I configured it to use a " global cache " as described in the darcs manual [ 8 ] .
The global cache was not populated yet , of course , so the next " darcs get -- partial " did not benefit from it , and indeed took 7.19 seconds to run and to populate the global cache [ exhibit 9 ] .
Finally , I ran it again with the global cache having been populated in the previous run .
This time " darcs get -- partial " took 3.85 seconds [ exhibit 10 ] .
Morals of the story : 1 . Upgrade from darcs - 1 to darcs - 2 . 2 . Starting using hashed - format repositories .
3 . If you do n't mind having only a partial copy of history , in order to have faster " darcs get " , then use " darcs get -- lazy " ( which is the preferred spelling for " darcs get -- partial " in darcs - 2 ) .
4 . Whether or not you are using -- lazy , enable a global cache .
A global cache can speed up other operations in addition to " get " , including working on different branches .
5 . If you have a workload that is important to you other than " darcs get " , then try an experiment like this one on your workload and report your results to darcs - users at darcs .

Are you and your business looking for an opportunity to patent an idea or an invention that you ’ve created ?
Perhaps you ’re wanting to learn more about the possibility of strengthening the legal side of your business .
Maybe you want to make sure that you ’re protected and want someone that will keep an eye out for companies stealing your idea .
Whatever the case might be , your brand should take the time to invest in a high - quality patent attorney that knows the ins and outs .
Here are several things that you should look for in patent lawyers .
Be sure to consider all of these factors as you search for one .
1. Attorney - Client Cohesiveness
Even the most experienced patent attorneys at the top of their field wo n’t be able to understand an invention that you ’ve created fully .
One of the biggest misunderstandings that clients ( people such as yourself ) have about the process is that an attorney will sort through all the information that you give them .
Many people dump a bunch of different sketches and information on their patent attorneys , expecting them to make sense of it all .
However , you ’re the one that invented it , so you ’re the one that needs to explain how it works .
It ’s your job to explain the invention , and it ’s they ’re job to form a legally - binding patent around it .
For that reason , you want to make sure that you get off to a good start the attorney you end up hiring .
There will be many meetings to discuss the invention , so you ’ll want to make sure you two communicate well .
2. Proper Experience
While it ’s admirable that some people want to give an up - and - coming attorney a try , the patents of your business is n’t a good place to take that type of risk .
You need someone with the experience and the know - how to apply for your patents , as well as survey the market for different aspects you can patent .
The application process is a tedious beast , and you ’ll want to make sure you have an attorney that lists out every possible detail .
Without a patent containing exhaustive detail , companies will be able to use some aspects of your idea without any legal repercussions .
Be sure to set yourself up with a trusted patent law attorney that knows the process , knows the system , and has the track record to prove it !
3. Diligent and Honest Answers to Your Questions
You should never hire the first patent attorney that you come into contact with .
Be sure to give yourself plenty of different options before you reach a decision .
One of the best ways to filter down your options is to perform interviews between you and your top choices .
Make sure to have several questions to ask all of them , then write down their answers and consider all of the different notes that you have from each .
If you ’re drawing a blank of the types of questions that you should answer , then here are several to get you started .
What experience do you have with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) ?
Do you have experience in patent prosecution ?
What kind of firms do you typically represent ?
How do you bill the clients that you have ?
Do you have a list of references that I can call ?
How long have you been working with the USPTO , and what ’s the relationship like ?
4. Their Firm ’s Reputation
Not all organizations are a direct sign of the customer experience that you ’ll have with a specific employee .
For example , you could have a Jiffy Lube that has horrible online reviews , but one car mechanic with over 20 years of car maintenance experience .
However , when it comes to patent law , you ’ll want to stick pretty close to the reputations you find of a particular firm .
Their reputation and practice hold pretty true to the attorneys within the firm .
There are several ways to find the reputation of the firm that you ’re interested in — one of the best methods being to look at online reviews .
While you can only take some reviews with a grain of salt , you can use the consensus of the reviews as your indicator .
For instance , there might be one glaringly - negative review , but if a majority of the rest are positive , you can assume it ’s a good sign .
Let your interview with the attorney determine whether or not you can trust the negative review that you read online .
5. Price
There are two ways that a patent attorney may want you to pay them : hourly or a flat rate .
Depending on the size of your business , one might work better than the other .
If their firm bills by the hour , then make sure to ask them how much their hourly rate is .
Ask the same for their flat rate , and also make sure to clarify how often that flat rate is expected .
Some firms will offer a free consultation to determine what aspects of your idea that they feel they would be able to patent .
Also , if you ’re interested in filing an international patent , then be sure to bring that up in the initial interview .
Make sure they have the capability and experience to file internationally , and they give you an estimate for doing so .
Find the Patent Lawyers for Your Need !
Now that you ’ve seen several key things to look for in patent lawyers , it ’s time to find the right fit for your ideas .
Remember , be sure to interview several attorneys .
However , if there is one that you feel especially good about , do n’t hesitate to pull the trigger !

Silvio Berlusconi is heading for a third term in office Conservative leader Silvio Berlusconi is set to win Italy 's general election , partial results suggest .
The projected results showed Mr Berlusconi 's coalition ahead for both the lower house and the Senate .
The 71 - year old told Italian TV difficult months lay ahead .
His main rival , the centre - left leader Walter Veltroni , has already conceded victory .
The vote was held three years ahead of schedule after the collapse of Romano Prodi 's centre - left coalition .
' Affectionate kiss '
Mr Berlusconi said in a telephone call to public television : " We have difficult months ahead that will require great strength . "
According to Ansa news agency , before ringing off , he added : " An affectionate kiss to all Italians . "
With the economy a key election issue , both men had promised modest tax cuts and reductions in bureaucracy .
PROJECTED RESULTS CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ( 630 SEATS ) : Centre - right bloc 45 % ;
centre - left bloc 39 % ( Rai ) Centre - right bloc 46.5 % ;
centre - left bloc 37.7 % ( Ipsos ) SENATE ( 315 SEATS ) : Centre - right bloc 164 seats ;
centre - left bloc 139 ( Rai ) Centre - right bloc 47.2 % ;
centre - left bloc 38.1 % ( Ipsos ) A projection on RAI state TV showed Mr Berlusconi 6 % ahead in the lower house Chamber of Deputies .
The channel projected that he would win 164 seats in the Senate , compared to 139 for his rivals .
Another projection gave Mr Berlusconi a lead of about 9 % in both houses of parliament .
Official results may not be issued until Tuesday .
If victory is confirmed , billionaire Mr Berlusconi will take up a third term in office .
Neither of the main contenders can hope for an overall majority without the help of their allies or other minor parties , says the BBC's David Willey in Rome .
Tricky coalition talks are expected in the coming days .
The next government faces the task of reviving Italy 's ailing economy , with zero growth forecast for the coming year .
Massive debt Although Italy faces a massive public debt , both candidates promised tax cuts and handouts to voters .
Italy 's economy has been suffering from low productivity and a strong euro , and analysts say young people , pensioners and low - income workers are feeling the pressure .
Mr Veltroni narrowed Mr Berlusconi's lead in polls but it was not enough Some 158 different parties contested the regional and national polls , including Mr Berlusconi 's new conservative People of Freedom ( PDL ) and Mr Veltroni 's recently formed Democratic Party ( PD ) .
At the start of the campaign , opinion polls gave Mr Berlusconi 's bloc a commanding lead , but it had narrowed as the election drew near .
At 80 % , the final turnout appears to have been lower than in the last election , two years ago .
Mr Berlusconi has served two terms as prime minister , last resigning in May 2006 .
One of Italy 's richest men , he is the head of a business empire that spans media , advertising , insurance , food and construction and includes the top flight football club AC Milan .
Mr Veltroni is a former communist who served for seven years as mayor of Rome before taking over the leadership of the centre - left coalition led by Mr Prodi after his government collapsed in January .
The new government will be Italy 's 62nd since World War II .

Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign on Thursday accused Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of purposely distorting her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement , pointing to newly released White House schedules that show Mrs. Clinton attended several meetings on the trade pact while first lady .
In one meeting cited by the Obama campaign , on Nov. 10 , 1993 , Mrs. Clinton spoke to about 120 participants at a Nafta briefing .
On the schedule released by the National Archives on Wednesday , the meeting was described as a “ Nafta Briefing Drop - By ” and was closed to the press .
Three other meetings in 1993 were generically described as Nafta meetings , but the schedules provided few details .
The Obama campaign pounced , eager to change the subject from race and the controversy surrounding Mr. Obama ’s former pastor to questions over Mrs. Clinton ’s character and experience .
Calling for root - and - branch reform of Nato and a new pact drawing the US , Nato and the European Union together in a " grand strategy " to tackle the challenges of an increasingly brutal world , the former armed forces chiefs from the US , Britain , Germany , France and the Netherlands insist that a " first strike " nuclear option remains an " indispensable instrument " since there is " simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear - free world " .
The manifesto has been written following discussions with active commanders and policymakers , many of whom are unable or unwilling to publicly air their views .
It has been presented to the Pentagon in Washington and to Nato 's secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , over the past 10 days .
The proposals are likely to be discussed at a Nato summit in Bucharest in April .
" The risk of further [ nuclear ] proliferation is imminent and , with it , the danger that nuclear war fighting , albeit limited in scope , might become possible , " the authors argued in the 150 - page blueprint for urgent reform of western military strategy and structures .
" The first use of nuclear weapons must remain in the quiver of escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction . "
The authors - General John Shalikashvili , the former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff and Nato 's ex-supreme commander in Europe , General Klaus Naumann , Germany 's former top soldier and ex-chairman of Nato 's military committee , General Henk van den Breemen , a former Dutch chief of staff , Admiral Jacques Lanxade , a former French chief of staff , and Lord Inge , field marshal and ex-chief of the general staff and the defence staff in the UK - paint an alarming picture of the threats and challenges confronting the west in the post - 9/11 world and deliver a withering verdict on the ability to cope .
The five commanders argue that the west 's values and way of life are under threat , but the west is struggling to summon the will to defend them .
The key threats are :
· Political fanaticism and religious fundamentalism .
· The " dark side " of globalisation , meaning international terrorism , organised crime and the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
· Climate change and energy security , entailing a contest for resources and potential " environmental " migration on a mass scale .
· The weakening of the nation state as well as of organisations such as the UN , Nato and the EU .
To prevail , the generals call for an overhaul of Nato decision - taking methods , a new " directorate " of US , European and Nato leaders to respond rapidly to crises , and an end to EU " obstruction " of and rivalry with Nato .
Among the most radical changes demanded are :
· A shift from consensus decision - taking in Nato bodies to majority voting , meaning faster action through an end to national vetoes .
· The abolition of national caveats in Nato operations of the kind that plague the Afghan campaign .
· No role in decision - taking on Nato operations for alliance members who are not taking part in the operations .
· The use of force without UN security council authorisation when " immediate action is needed to protect large numbers of human beings " .
In the wake of the latest row over military performance in Afghanistan , touched off when the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , said some allies could not conduct counter - insurgency , the five senior figures at the heart of the western military establishment also declare that Nato 's future is on the line in Helmand province .
" Nato 's credibility is at stake in Afghanistan , " said Van den Breemen .
" Nato is at a juncture and runs the risk of failure , " according to the blueprint .
Naumann delivered a blistering attack on his own country 's performance in Afghanistan .
" The time has come for Germany to decide if it wants to be a reliable partner . "
By insisting on " special rules " for its forces in Afghanistan , the Merkel government in Berlin was contributing to " the dissolution of Nato " .
Ron Asmus , head of the German Marshall Fund thinktank in Brussels and a former senior US state department official , described the manifesto as " a wake - up call " .
" This report means that the core of the Nato establishment is saying we 're in trouble , that the west is adrift and not facing up to the challenges . "
Naumann conceded that the plan 's retention of the nuclear first strike option was " controversial " even among the five authors .
Inge argued that " to tie our hands on first use or no first use removes a huge plank of deterrence " .
Reserving the right to initiate nuclear attack was a central element of the west 's cold war strategy in defeating the Soviet Union .
Critics argue that what was a productive instrument to face down a nuclear superpower is no longer appropriate .
Robert Cooper , an influential shaper of European foreign and security policy in Brussels , said he was " puzzled " .
" Maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else , but I 'd be wary of saying it out loud . "
Another senior EU official said Nato needed to " rethink its nuclear posture because the nuclear non-proliferation regime is under enormous pressure " .
Naumann suggested the threat of nuclear attack was a counsel of desperation .
" Proliferation is spreading and we have not too many options to stop it .
We do n't know how to deal with this . "
Nato needed to show " there is a big stick that we might have to use if there is no other option " , he said .

The End of Reaganism , or , Three Cheers for the Great Destroyer
JB
All of the presidential candidates seem to be picking up Barack Obama 's theme of change and portraying themselves as agents of change .
If things keep going the way they have been , the 2008 election now looks to be as defining a moment as 1932 , 1968 or 1980 .
( If things keep going , that is .
A lot can happen in ten months ) .
If 2008 turns out to be a pivotal election , defining a new political era , it is important to give credit where credit is due .
Two key reasons for the change will be the crackup of the coalition of the dominant party of the era , the Republicans , and the almost complete political failure of George W. Bush and his chief political adviser , Karl Rove .
Let me begin with the second reason , and then move to the first .
The Bush / Rove strategy of accentuating divisions along partisan lines was a bold gamble that ultimately failed , because it depended on the Bush presidency being successful .
Think of it this way :
If Bush does well at his task , then people at the margins gravitate toward the winning side and the Republican coalition slowly expands over time , rejuvenating the party and producing a post - Reagan vision ( organized , for example , around the War on Terror and the opportunity society ) that extends well into the future .
But if Bush does badly , or as it turned out , very badly , the same strategy that encourages increased partisanship and divisiveness will tend to make Americans believe that these features of political life are also the cause of political failure .
They will seek both change and a sense of unity .
This is precisely what Obama has tapped into , which is why he has been successful so far .
Obama , if you will , is what Bush 's strategy has produced .
Now add to this the President 's remarkable intransigence in the face of his policy failures and his growing unpopularity since 2005 .
President Bush has never been more sure of himself ( at least in public ) than he is today , and , with the aid of his Republican allies in Congress , he has been successful in batting back almost everything the Democratic Congress has sought to do .
The result makes politics appear even more hopeless than it actually is , and this only spurs on the public 's desire for change and for unity .
( And this sense of hopelessness , too , is what Obama has made use of in his rhetoric -- by turning it upside down .
His message is that there is hope because we are and should be united , not divided . )
Bush 's intransigence has heightened the problems his policy failures have created , opening a path for someone like Obama , whether on the Democratic or Republican side .
That would not necessarily be such a bad thing for the Republicans .
It all depends on what they have to offer as an alternative to Bush .
The problem is that Bush has also overseen the cracking of Ronald Reagan 's successful coalition of southern former Democrats , white working class ethnics , defense hawks , free market conservatives , and religious conservatives .
Reagan could appeal to all of these elements of the party , but Bush 's Presidency has been unable to keep all of them happy .
Had Bush 's war on terror ( including the Iraq war ) been successful , he might have kept most of the coalition together even though he simultaneously increased the size of government , downplayed coded racial appeals that brought in the South , supported immigration reform , ran up large deficits , and offered only modest and symbolic achievements to religious conservatives .
But his policy failures made this impossible .
Bush 's failed presidency has left the Republicans scrambling to reconstitute the Reagan coalition .
The wide range of different candidates -- from Giuliani to Romney to McCain to Huckabee to Paul -- offer different solutions .
We do n't yet know how the coalition will be reassembled , and under whose leadership .
However , as of the day of the New Hampshire primary , it looks like putting it back together will be a tall order .
And although the eventual nominee will try to assume the mantle of Ronald Reagan -- and , equally important , not the mantle of George W. Bush -- the Republican party will have been changed forever by the events of the last eight years .
Although Ronald Reagan will still be regarded with fondness by the Republicans for generations to come , George W. Bush will have effectively destroyed Reaganism .
The Republicans will have to start over with a different mix of concerns , agendas and appeals .
This is George W. Bush 's single greatest achievement .
This is one reason , although not the only reason , why he ranks high ( or low ) among the country 's failed presidents -- not only did his policies fail , but he also took the winning coalition that brought him into office down with him .
And that is why , if , like many Americans , you think that change is coming , and you think that this is a good thing , you should tip your hat to George W. Bush and his eventful presidency .
For if Ronald Reagan was the Great Communicator , George W. Bush is the Great Destroyer of Coalitions .
EXCLUSIVE : Bush Says Petraeus ' Timeline for Troop Drawdown Not Open - Ended President also says he plans to attend Olympics to support athletes .
April 11 , 2008  -- President Bush today dialed back on what appeared to be an open - ended time frame for Gen.
David Petraeus , the commander of multinational forces in Iraq , to assess troop needs once the surge is complete at the end of July .
" Sometimes people read what they want to in the president 's words , " Bush said in an exclusive interview with ABC 's senior White House correspondent Martha Raddatz .
" My statement was , in essence , this : If Gen . Petraeus needs 45 days , he 'll have 45 days . "
Watch Martha Raddatz 's interview with the president tonight on " World News With Charles Gibson " at 6:30 ET .
Thursday , in a speech on Iraq at the White House , Bush said Petraeus could " have all the time he needs . "
Critics of the war , including both Democratic candidates , Sens. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , took that statement as saying the president would not be drawing down forces in Iraq anytime soon .
" So you 're not saying it would be just 45 days , or will it go beyond 45 days .
You just do n't know , " Raddatz asked the president outside his office at his Crawford , Texas , ranch .
" I do n't know , " Bush replied .
" But on the other hand , I did say that my hope is that conditions will enable us to continue return on success . "
Bush conceded earlier that before the surge began last year , he was pessimistic about the way the war in Iraq was going .
" How worried were you ? " Raddatz asked .
" I was worried .
Look , I 'm worried any time it looks like we 're going to fail in Iraq , " Bush said .
During that time in 2006 , when many were saying Iraq was in a full - blown civil war , Bush kept his rhetoric upbeat , saying in speeches that We 're winning " and " We have a plan for victory . "
Raddatz asked the president about that , and the president insisted he did it to keep up troop morale .
" That 's as much to try and bolster the spirits of the people in the field as well -- you can't have the commander in chief say to a bunch of kids who are sacrificing that either it's not worth it or you 're losing .
What does that do for morale ? "
Bush said .
The president said that since the surge , Iraq is on a course for political reconciliation , part of what the surge was supposed to accomplish .
" I think you 'll find that the government is functioning a lot better than it was a year ago .
They had passed major laws .
Yes , there needs to be an oil law , but they are sharing oil revenues . …
They have made progress .
And is there more to be done ?
You bet there 's more to be done . "
On Afghanistan , where commanders say they need an influx of at least 10,000 more troops , the president insists they will get those troops despite the strains on the military and the pressure to draw down forces in Iraq by the end of the year .
Thursday the president announced that deployments will be cut down from 15 months to 12 .
" How do you maintain that deployment schedule , send more troops to Afghanistan and keep 140,000 troops in Iraq ?
The math does n't work , " said Raddatz .
Bush credits NATO members , specifically France , which promised to send about 5,000 more troops to Afghanistan last week , as being part of the solution , as well as the 3,200 additional Marines the military is sending over .
" My purpose in going to the NATO summit was to convince others to bolster their presence , and they did .
And you know , will we need more troops in 2009 [ in Afghanistan ] .
I signaled that if that 's the case , we 'll find them , " Bush said .
Bush to Attend Olympics
As pressure mounts for him to boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer , Bush said Friday he plans on attending the Olympics to support the athletes .
" My plans have n't changed , " Bush said .
Later , the White House said Bush was speaking about his attendance at the games , not specifically the opening ceremony .
The president 's aides have been vague about when exactly he will attend .
The president , along with other Western leaders , has come under pressure to skip the ceremony in protest over China 's human rights abuses , particularly in Tibet and Darfur .
Bush said Friday he would continue to address human rights concerns with Chinese President Hu Jintao .
Bush said the message his attending sends to the world is that he's " supporting our athletes . "
" I do n't view the Olympics as a political event .
I view it as a sporting event , " Bush continued , saying that he 's brought up issues surrounding religious freedom and human rights abuses with China before the Olympics , and will continue to do so during and after .
Economic Concerns
With the American economy battling recession , Bush said he still considers himself a " good steward " of the economy but said he takes responsibility for where it is today .
Despite Democratic efforts in Congress for an additional economic stimulus package to boost the ailing economy , Bush wo n't consider a second package until the results of the first one , passed just last month , are evident , he said .
Every town has a Broadway or a Main Street .
And while some are more exciting than others , they all kind of look the same .
Here 's a look at six famous American streets , and what makes them so special .
Canal Street , New Orleans , LA
Do n't let the name fool you ; there is n't actually a canal on Canal Street .
However , there were plans to build one when the town was founded , and a huge median was created to accommodate it .
After the Louisiana Purchase , animosity between the native Creole population and the Americans was common , and the median in Canal Street served as the neutral ground .
Even though the canal never happened , the street has remained unusually wide over the years and now boasts three lanes of traffic in each direction , plus streetcar and bus lanes running down its center .
One of the world 's first successful movie theaters , Vitascope Hall , opened on Canal Street in 1896 , and two classic movie houses survive today as live performance venues .
Now lined with skyscrapers and storefronts , Canal Street serves as the upriver border to the French Quarter and also the heart of the business district .
Following Hurricane Katrina , many of the damaged store fronts on Canal Street were covered with bright graphic panels illustrating the essence of New Orleans , including its food , music and culture .
Delaware Avenue , Buffalo , NY
Delaware Avenue is known as the " Avenue of the Presidents " because three United States presidents each made a historic mark on the mansion - lined street .
Not - so - memorable President Millard Fillmore died there after his term in office .
( His final words spoken at his home were " my only regret in death is that the Whig dies with me . " )
William McKinley was shot during the Pan - American Exposition in Buffalo , and he stayed at the John Milburn home on Delaware Avenue while he recovered .
Eight days later , however , McKinley died of gangrene in the house .
As a result of McKinley 's death , Theodore Roosevelt rushed to Buffalo and took his presidential oath of office at the Ansley Wilcox Mansion , owned by a friend and business partner of Grover Cleveland .
It was at this house that Roosevelt became the only President to take the presidential oath without placing his hand on a Bible .
Aside from its presidential trivia goldmine , the historic mansion - lined stretch of Delaware Avenue was considered to be the richest street in the nation during the late 19th century .
The mansions still stand today , many of them having been turned into businesses or museums .

Las Vegas Boulevard , Las Vegas , NV
Most people know this super - famous street simply as " The Strip , " but it 's actually just a portion of the 37 - mile - long State Route 604 .
The northern end of the road passes through Jean , Nevada , where the last spike of the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad was laid — historic because Las Vegas owes its existence to the railroad .
The road now known as Route 604 has had many names , including 5th Street , the Arrowhead Highway , Los Angeles Highway and Salt Lake Highway .
For many years , it was the only major thoroughfare in Vegas .
Of course , if you visit this street , you probably are n't going to stop by the railroad spike for a photo .
Instead , visit The Strip , four miles of neon signs pointing you to dozens of casinos and attractions , including 18 of the 25 largest hotels in the world and the world 's largest gift shop .
In case you need another reason to visit , The Strip has been designated a National Scenic By - way .
Fifth Avenue , New York , NY
It 's not just for Saks stores , folks !
If you follow Fifth Avenue from its beginning at Washington Square Park to its end at the Harlem River , you will pass many of New York 's legendary landmarks : Rockefeller Center , New York Public Library , Central Park , St. Patrick 's Cathedral and The Empire State Building .
Let 's not forget the museums along Museum Mile , which include the Met and the Guggenheim .
Of course , Fifth Avenue also has a storied legacy as one of the most expensive streets in the world .
On its most pricey stretch between 34th Street and 59th Street , you can find dozens of high - end retail stores like Tiffany & Co. , Burberry and Chanel , as well as the famous glass cube entrance to the underground flagship Apple Store .
One more Fifth Avenue nugget — many streets in Manhattan are divided into east and west variations using Fifth Avenue as a zero - numbering spot , meaning numbers increase in both directions .
Vermont Street , San Francisco , CA
Vermont Street in San Francisco has a bit of a dispute with Lombard Street for the title of " the crookedest street in the world . "
Located in the Protero Hill neighborhood , Vermont Street features a two - block section with seven incredibly sharp turns .
Some sources state that Lombard features more turns , but Vermont Street features a steeper slope with sharper turns .
While less picturesque than the touristy Lombard Street , any cab driver or native resident in San Francisco will tell you that Vermont is the curvier street .
This year it was the new location of the annual Bring Your Own Big Wheel event , which features adults riding the classic children 's toy .
Fortunately for the riders , the twisted section of Vermont Street is paved with concrete rather than the red brick used on Lombard Street .
As for the actual crookedest street in the world , Ripley 's lists Snake Alley in Burlington , Iowa .

Mulholland Drive , Los Angeles , CA
There are a lot of great views of Los Angeles along its scenic roads , but Mulholland Drive provides some of the most popular .
Mulholland Drive follows the Santa Monica Mountains and the Hollywood Hills , offering views of the Hollywood sign , downtown Los Angeles , Burbank and the rest of the San Fernando Valley .
Part of the road is unpaved and not accessible by car , making it popular with hikers and mountain bikers , and leads to a decommissioned Project Nike site that has been converted to a Cold War memorial park .
Due to its scenic curves , Mulholland Drive is also well - known for street races and car accidents .
The street has been nicknamed " Bad Boy Drive " in honor of its notorious bachelor residents , which have included Jack Nicholson , Warren Beatty and Marlon Brando .
In fact , it was at Brando 's Mullholland Drive estate that his son Christian Brando committed manslaughter .
( The estate was purchased by Jack Nicholson , who tore down the famous house because it was becoming derelict . )
And of course , the films Mulholland Drive and Mulholland Falls are both named for the scenic street , which has been the backdrop for many other movies .

The potential losses of the chairman and former chief executive of Bear Stearns must rank up there with the biggest in modern history .
The value of his stake in Bear Stearns collapsed from about $ 1 billion a year ago to as little as $ 14 million at the price JPMorgan Chase offered for the teetering bank on Sunday .
Still , Mr. Cayne was paid some $ 40 million in cash between 2004 and 2006 , the last year on record , as well as stocks and options .
In the past few years , he has sold shares worth millions more .
There should be financial accountability for the man who led Bear Stearns as it gorged on dubious subprime securities to boost its profits and share price , helping to set up one of the biggest financial collapses since the savings - and - loan crisis in the 1980s .
Some might argue that he should have lost it all .
But that ’s not how it works .
The ongoing bailout of the financial system by the Federal Reserve underscores the extent to which financial barons socialize the costs of private bets gone bad .
Not a week goes by that the Fed does n’t inaugurate a new way to provide liquidity  meaning money  to the financial system .
Bear Stearns is n’t enormous .
It does n’t take deposits from the public .
Yet the Fed believed that letting it implode could unleash a domino effect among other banks , and the Fed provided a $ 30 billion guarantee for JPMorgan to snap it up .
Compared to the cold shoulder given to struggling homeowners , the cash and attention lavished by the government on the nation ’s financial titans provides telling insight into the priorities of the Bush administration .
It ’s not simply a matter of fairness , though .
The Fed is probably right to be doing all it can think of to avoid worse damage than the economy is already suffering .
But if the objective is to encourage prudent banking and keep Wall Street ’s wizards from periodically driving financial markets over the cliff , it is imperative to devise a remuneration system for bankers that puts more of their skin in the game .
The vanity - saturated life of a Gizmodo writer means no scars , visible or otherwise , so this breakthrough procedure for appendicitis is a godsend for those among us who still have the vestigial organ .
According to doctors who performed the operation in San Diego , a flexible tube is used to thread miniature surgical instruments down the patient 's throat into their stomach .
At that point , the fun begins — unless you 're an appendix , of course .

Once the tools are safely inserted into the patient 's gut , a tiny incision is made in the stomach wall to get at the appendix .
The inflamed appendix is cut away , grabbed by one of the mini-tools , and bagged in a special mesh pouch .
The organ is then pulled back into the stomach and out of the mouth .
The benefits of this new procedure go beyond aesthetic , as pioneering patient and ex-Marine Jeff Scholtz confirmed in a post - op interview .
" They told me to take it easy but I felt great .
I was eating pizza and doing situps three days later , " Scholtz said .

That 's right , no week - long downtime or months of low - intensity activity , and no more huge scars from huge incisions .
No hernias or infection either , said Santiago Horgan , of the University of San Diego Medical Center .
Doctors say this is the way forward for other procedures , and I 'm inclined to agree , so long as we keep the colonoscopy relegated to the rear where it belongs .

The world thinks of microfinance as a tool to lift its poorest from grinding poverty .
But in an age of pricey fuel and shrinking credit , the entrepreneurial movement that began in Bangladesh is taking off in the richest country of all .
Nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus opened 11 branches of his Grameen Bank in New York City this spring , more than 30 years after he revolutionised foreign aid by delivering the first microloan to a group of rural Asian villagers .
If Yunus is the father of microfinance , his US offspring already are maturing quite nicely .
The spectre of recession , combined with a diverse array of lending models , is sparking a new demand in America for small loans and business counselling .
" Our vendors report a dramatic increase in microloan applications over the past year , " Amy McKenna Luz , who represents nearly 500 microfinanciers as president of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity , said .
" They say it 's a direct result of the banking crisis . "
Luz sees her member groups as rescue workers for small businesses , nurturing economic growth and revival even in the direst circumstances .
When the owner of Tomas Trucking in New York needed to ship more products to absorb the cost of diesel , a bank could not provide the cash infusion needed to buy a new vehicle and save the company .
Microfinance saved the day .
Why has the spotlight shone so brightly on Grameen and not on its industrialised cousins ?
The answer may be culture .
Almost anyone can send a few dollars to Asia that can feed a family for weeks , thanks to Kiva and other groups that turn ordinary Americans into microlenders .
But sending a few thousand dollars to a rural Pennsylvania craftsman is more difficult .
Micro Business Development Corporation , led by Denver lender Kersten Hostetter , has created thousands of jobs and boosted the local economy by more than $ 15 m .
Still , Hostetter is so keen for more investment that she has written a unique job ad seeking a celebrity spokesman for US microfinance .
" We 're the bridge between poverty alleviation and economic development , the guardians of the middle class , " Hostetter said .
" We did n't brand ourselves initially because there was n't a need for it . "
Now the need has arisen , partly due to the arrival of Grameen America .
Thanks to its
Nobel , the bank does not have to rely on Natalie Portman - Hollywood spokeswoman for the international microlender Finca - to create universal appeal .
For its pilot programme , Grameen has targeted immigrant enclaves .
There , the " peer lending " model of requiring clients to attend weekly meetings and monitor each other 's repayments is most likely to succeed .
In more traditional communities , however , microlenders like Galen Gondolfi have had to perform a more complex version of the Bengali approach .
One client came to Gondolfi , a senior loan counsellor at Justine Petersen in St Louis , was persuaded to pull equity out of her home to expand her business during flush economic times .
As global markets fell , her mortgage interest rate went from 6 % to 14 % , new contracts dried up , and she left stacks of bills unpaid .
Gondolfi performed " a triage of sorts " , he recalled , " stopping the bleeding " on her mortgage by negotiating a new rate with her subprime lender while using the house as collateral for an infusion of cash to her company .
Microfinance is not just for the developing world , Gondolfi said : " It 's also for the post - developed world .
I 'm talking about rust belt cities , about urban neighbourhoods I work with that are essentially post- apocalyptic . "
Microfinance is also not just for the political right or left .
Conservatives have embraced it as an alternative to direct foreign aid that can resemble a handout , while Hillary Clinton helped her husband bring Yunus 's ideas to Arkansas in the 1980s .
The failure of the Clintons ' microlending effort , called the Good Faith Fund , has tempered the enthusiasm for a similar grassroots push during the current economic slowdown .
The conventional wisdom says Good Faith proved that microfinance could not work in America .
Richard Taub , a sociology professor at the University of Chicago who helped with the Arkansas programme , called it " kind of a bummer " .
" The cost of the administrative work was very , very high , " he said .
" We used to joke that it cost $ 10,000 to make an $ 8,000 loan . "
Taub was also sceptical of marketing microfinance to immigrants who already lend in small amounts to one another , likening Grameen America to " selling coal to Newcastle " .
In fact , New York already has a microfinance powerhouse .
The local outlet of US - based Accion , headed by Gina Harman , has generated 11,000 new businesses and given $ 77 m in loans since its founding in 1991 .
Harman sees plenty of room for Accion and Grameen to work together in broadening the scope of US microlending .
Her only worry is that the entire movement could be judged on the success or failure of Yunus 's new banks .
" Unfortunately , we 're not microfinance rock stars , " Harman said .
" Right now we 're doing a lot of parrying to try and defend an established track record .
It works . "
The way it works is usually with interest rates of about 12 % , higher than bank loans but far lower than the average US credit card .
The third alternative for struggling small businessmen are so - called " payday lenders " , who charge up to 600 % interest and are barred from operating in several states .
Harman said Accion is also encountering more new clients who are desperately fleeing a debt to loan sharks .
" It 's a very frightening circumstance , " she added .
With the economic outlook keeping large banks on the defensive , the number of struggling Americans not getting help is likely to only increase .
Demand is already too high for some established microlenders to serve everyone .
" The outsourcing of components of a company , downsizing , the loss of middle - class jobs - all of those are push factors " forcing clients into the industry , Elaine Edgcomb , director of microenterprise research at the Aspen Institute think - tank , said .
Other " pull factors " luring clients also are on the rise , chiefly the stunning growth of immigration in the US .
Given such challenges , microfinanciers are not waiting for their Angelina Jolie to emerge from the wings .
McKenna
Luz 's group will host microlenders from around the country at a summit in California later this month .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver are slated to attend , and she is hoping that Nobel winner Yunus can speak as well .
" It 's like Tony Blair trying to make an appearance , " McKenna Luz said .

Many years ago , Howard Rheingold , who was one of the first people to understand the social potential of cyberspace , posed an interesting question : ' Where is the Library of Congress , when it 's on your laptop ? '
To most people at the time , it seemed a meaningless question .
What lay behind it , however , was an attempt to think through a profound consequence of a networked society - what Frances Cairncross later dubbed ' the death of distance ' .
In the old days , libraries were society 's only repositories for the information and knowledge embodied in books .
To get at the knowledge , you had to go to make the physical journey to where it was stored .
That was the basis of our ancient universities - they housed scholars and books , and to access either , students had to journey to where they were .
Rheingold 's question was about how that would change when everything that had ever been printed was available online .
Only a few people took the bait .
One was Eli Noam , a Columbia scholar who published a startling paper , Electronics and the Dim Future of the University , in the October 1995 issue of the journal Science .
But for the most part , Rheingold was ignored because the prospect of universal digitalisation seemed so remote .
People could readily envisage a time when the catalogues of great libraries would be freely available for online consultation .
But access to the actual contents of all those books - well , it was too preposterous to even think about it .
Just for starters , who would bear the unconscionable costs of scanning millions and millions of texts ?
Who indeed ?
Enter Google .
Last week , it announced that it had embarked on what we might call ' Howard 's Quest ' - to make digital copies of some of the world 's largest university library collections and incorporate the texts into its vast web index .
The goal is to enable anyone , anywhere instantly to tap into enormous academic libraries - some with texts dating back centuries .
Google has signed up four major universities - Stanford , Harvard , Oxford and the University of Michigan - plus the New York Public Library , as partners in the programme , which will take six years to scan and index more than 10 million books and periodicals .
At Stanford , Harvard and Oxford , Google will scan only samples - albeit large ones - of the universities ' holdings .
But at Michigan they will do every book and periodical on campus - partly because Google co-founder Larry Page graduated from there , and partly because Michigan has one of the best university collections in the US .
Where the scanned volumes are out of copyright the entire text will be available online ; if they are still in copyright , then searchers will get only sections of text relevant to their inquiry - plus links to booksellers and libraries where the full text can be purchased or consulted .
It 's a staggering project that will cost about $ 10 per volume scanned .
And until last week , it was thought to be impractical .
' Going as fast as we can with the traditional means of doing this , ' said John Wilkin , associate librarian at the University of Michigan , 'it would take us about 1,600 years to do all seven million volumes .
Google will do it in six years .
If we were to do this job ourselves , it would probably cost $ 600 m .
That 's just the human cost of preparing the material for scanning , packing it up and sending it out to vendors and then quality - control checking of the results .
I can't imagine there 's anything out there on this scale .
Nothing has been conceived on this scale .
It 's access to a research collection that we never would have dared imagine possible .
Anyone with an internet connection now has access to a vast research library . '
Which brings us back to Rheingold 's question .
We have not begun to comprehend the implications of what 's going on .
Google has become a vast , global memory prosthesis .
It 's no longer as important to remember details as it used to be .
If I can't remember who wrote a particular song , or the name of the Sherpa who first climbed Everest , or what Mandy Rice - Davies said at the trial of Stephen Ward - well , I can Google it .
Once upon a time , being learned involved holding a lot of knowledge and information in one 's head .
Are we moving towards a world where the important thing is not what you know , but how to find it ?
And what happens when a major chunk of the world 's serious literature is available to anyone with an internet connection , rather than being the exclusive preserve of western elites ?
Will the Google project reinforce the stranglehold of English as the global language ?
If I were Jacques Chirac , I 'd already be negotiating with the company to scan the contents of the Bibliothèque Nationale .
Joyeux Noel to you .
JERUSALEM 
When Hamas blew large holes in Gaza ’s border with Egypt , allowing thousands of Palestinians a chance to stock up on medicines , food and consumer goods , it also blew a large hole in the Israeli policy , backed by Washington , of squeezing the population of Gaza in the hope that they would turn actively against Hamas .
As Israeli leaders pushed Egypt to close the border and fumbled for an effective response , the apparent Hamas success put Egypt into a bind and further undermined the chances that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Fatah faction could succeed in negotiating a peace treaty  let alone by the time President Bush leaves office .
Early efforts by Egypt on Friday to reseal the border failed when Hamas broke through more areas of the border wall with bulldozers , and Palestinians continued to move easily into Egypt on Saturday , sometimes with cars and trucks .
The confrontational tactics of Hamas , the Palestinian branch of Egypt ’s opposition and banned Muslim Brotherhood , also presented a difficult quandary for President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt .
The plight of the Palestinians , especially those in Gaza , is a deeply emotional issue for Egyptians and other Arabs , an issue often promoted and sometimes manipulated by Arab leaders and Arabic satellite channels like Al Jazeera .
Brazilian protesters destroy GM crops : group
by Staff Writers
Sao Paulo ( AFP ) March 7 , 2008
Around 300 women rural residents in Brazil burst into a property owned by the US company Monsanto and destroyed a plant nursery and crops containing genetically modified corn , their organization said .
The women were protesting what they saw as environmental damage by the crops .
They trashed the plants within 30 minutes and left before police arrived at the site in the southern state of Sao Paulo , a member of the Landless Workers ' Movement , Igor Foride , told AFP .
The Brazilian government had " caved in to pressure from agrobusinesses " by recently allowing tinkered crops to be grown in the country , he said .
In Brasilia , a protest by another 400 women from an umbrella group , Via Campesina ( the Rural Way ) , was held in front of the Swiss embassy against Syngenta , a Swiss company that is selling genetically modified seeds in Brazil .
The demonstrators called attention to an October 2007 incident in which private guards working for Syngenta killed a protester taking part in an occupation of land owned by the company .
Via Campesina said in a statement that " no scientific studies exist that guarantee that genetically modified crops wo n't have negative effects on human health and on nature . "
It added that on Tuesday , another 900 of its members had entered a property owned by the Swedish - Finnish paper giant Stora Enso and ripped out non-modified eucalyptus saplings they claimed were illegally planted .

Pentagon Papers leaker decries Iraq war
Daniel Ellsburg calls President Bush a war criminal
by Justin Hughes , staff writer
About 100 people came to see anti-war activist Daniel Ellsberg speak at the Unitarian Universalist Church in San Francisco on March 30 as he condemned the war in Iraq as a “ supreme war crime ”  and warned about the dangers of a future war in Iran .
In 1971 Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers , a classified study of U.S. policy in Vietnam , to The New York Times and other major American media sources .
Ellsberg was a consultant to the Defense Department at the time , risking possible life imprisonment because he felt that the classified information was of great importance to the American public .
Since then Ellsberg has worked as an anti-war activist , establishing the Truth - Telling Project which is intended to expose government corruption and lies and encourage “ patriotic whistle - blowing . ” 
Ellsberg ’s talk was a celebration of the 10th year anniversary of the War and Law League ( WALL ) , a non-profit San Francisco - based organization working to ensure that the U.S. government follows the Constitution , treaties , and international laws in times of war and peace .
Ellsberg condemned Bush and Cheney as war criminals and “ domestic enemies of the constitution , ”  an accusation that brought the entire crowd of people ” ” a vast majority of whom were from the Vietnam War era ” ” to a loud standing applause .
He explained that the invasion and occupation of Iraq was illegal , clearly violating the UN charter .
“ It was a war of aggression without approval from the U.N. security council , ”  he said .
WALL coordinator Jeannette Hassberg agreed that the initial attack on Iraq was a pre-emptive act of aggression that violates the U.N. and international law .
“ The scourge of war is what the U.N. was founded to prevent , ”  she said .
“ This is the very crime that Japanese and Germans were hung for at Nuremberg .
A major theme of the talk was the importance of staying true to constitutional principals .
Ellsberg specifically mentioned Article 1 , section 8 of the Constitution ” ” which gives congress the exclusive power to declare war “ “ explaining that this is essential for limiting the powers of the president .
“ That was a brilliant and profound invention in world history , ”  said Ellsberg .
“ It deserves for us to struggle preserve it . ” 
While congress did vote to go to war in October 2002 , they gave absolute power to the president to declare war on anyone he determined was responsible for the September 11 attacks , according to WALL .
“ The Constitution never assigned to the president the power to police the world , ”  wrote the organization in an official statement .
Ellsberg said that this resolution from Congress basically gave Bush absolute power to engage in unprovoked war , which is unconstitutional .
He added that there was no serious question into the legality of the Iraq invasion .
“ We have gone far from the constitution , ”  he said .
“ As a constitutional matter , Bush does not decide , ”  added Hassberg .
“ He does n’t decide that we will do a regime change in another country . ” 
She added that the administration manipulated the public into supporting the war through twisting of information and irrational appeals to hate and fear .
“ The justification for the war were clear lies , ”  she said .
“ The reasons they gave for the war were false . ” 
In addition , the conduct of the Iraq war has been highly illegal , she added .
She listed a multitude of criminal offenses committed by American troops since the 2003 Iraq invasion , such as the killing of innocent civilians , the bombing of weddings , the killing of journalists , firing into protests , detentions and interrogations without fair trial and search and destroy missions without a clear purpose .
“ We made enemies out of the Iraqis , ”  she said .
“ We came in as murderers and created more hate in the Iraqis by the conduct of the war . ” 
Weapons used by American troops in the Iraq war , including deadly chemicals such as depleted uranium and white phosphorous , which causes a severe burning of the flesh , are severely damaging to civilians as well as the environment , said added .
These weapons have caused a dramatic increase in leukemia and birth defects in the civilian population and induced cancer in American veterans ever since the Gulf War , she said .
“ These weapons are dumped in people ’s neighborhood and people are being exposed to radiation , ”  said Students Against War member Matt Collado , 20 .
“ It is not acknowledged in mainstream media and it is ignored in public discourse .
Whether or not it is legal , it is deeply immoral . ” 
Ellsberg added that the Bush administration ’s use of torture is clearly illegal under international law and “ not just waterboarding , but the whole slew of inhumane procedures that has gone on for seven years now . ” 
Hassberg is frustrated that the mainstream media often overlooks the human cost of the war , especially the psychological and emotional toll taken on Iraq veterans .
“ Young people are used like meat to do the dirty work of this heartless , ruthless administration , ”  she said .
“ It ’s been worse than abusing the troops .
It ’s been taking their lives and wasting it . ” 
She credited the Iraq Veterans Against the War and KPFA March 2008 project “ Winter Soldier , ”  which features firsthand testimonies from Veterans who speak openly about their experiences on the battlefield , and their subsequent challenges adjusting to life after the traumas of war .
Ellsberg added that the Bush administration ’s warrant - less wiretapping of American citizens is a total violation of the fourth amendment of the constitution .
He compared this domestic monitoring to corrupt tactics used in the Nixon administration .
After Ellsberg leaked the classified Pentagon Papers to The New York Times , Nixon ’s administration spied on him and broke into his private records in attempts to blackmail him , he said .
He was tried for 12 felonies and a possible 115 years in prison , but all charges were dropped because of government misconduct against him , which eventually contributed to Nixon ’s impeachment .
Ellsberg stressed the importance of dissent , explaining that acting in the best interest of the country and staying true to constitutional values is “ not synonymous with obeying the president . ” 
He praised Lt. Ehren Watada , who refused to deploy to Iraq in 2006 because of moral opposition to the war .
Watada was the first commissioned officer in the U.S. armed forces to publicly refuse to deploy to Iraq .
“ Watada is the only officer in the U.S. armed forces who has taken seriously his oath to uphold the Constitution , ”  said Ellsberg .
It is absolutely necessary to impeach a president who has violated the constitution as well as the U.N. charter and other international laws , argued Ellsberg .
“ To rule impeachment off the table is very much like ruling the constitution off the table , ”  he said .
Even as a symbolic gesture , impeachment would hold the administration accountable for its crimes and demonstrate that the law applies equally to the president as it does to American citizens , said Hassberg .
She sees this as part of a process of “ truth and reconciliation . ” 
“ It would restore our honor worldwide and show that we believe in our laws , ”  she said .
“ Impeachment is a disgrace and the Bush presidency has been worse than a disgrace . ” 
Although Ellsberg showed concern that an exit from Iraq is unlikely ” ” even as a potential plan among Democratic candidates ” ” he expressed hope that there is a possibility for averting a war against Iran .
“ Iran has not attacked us , and does not have a nuclear weapon , ”  he said , adding that a pre-emptive attack on Iran would be “ nothing but a crime against humanity and a crime against the people . ” 
“ If anything can be more tragic than the war against Iraq , it would be attacking Iran , ”  agreed Hassberg .
“ My hope is that with the War and Law League we can have an impact and we can raise our voices and show our dissatisfaction with the never - ending war policy . ” 

With the controversy over the use of tasers still being hashed out in the media and public , a new device is being created by a company called Lamperd , that uses the same technology that is used in tasers , as a bracelet , to be worn on planes .
EMDT devices use a high - voltage , low power charge of electricity to induce involuntary muscle contractions that cause temporary incapacitation .
The EMD Safety Bracelet is being created by Lamperd with intention of an Airline Security Project , and according to their promotional video , which uses footage of the 9/11 attacks on the word trade center in their beginning scenes , their project is in response to the billions of dollars being spent on airport security .
The video goes on to point out the systems already being worked on to improve security , then they show how critics say those measures wo n't wok effectively .
They lead into their idea by saying " no matter how sophisticated the technology is , the technology is only as good as the people using it " .
They assert that once terrorists have boarded a flight , the pilots and crew are " the last line of defense , " and how an Air Marshall could inadvertently cause more damage when shooting at a suspect by puncturing a hole in the plane or shooting a passenger by mistake , and the video gives illustrations of this happening .
Then comes the question and the point of the whole video , about 3 minutes and seven seconds into it , where they ask , " Is there a solution ? " YES !!
There is , they say .
It starts when a passenger purchases a ticket , saying they can also be fitted with an Electronic ID Bracelet , that they will wear until they disembark the flight at their destination .
The promotional video claims this would make traveling much more convenient for the public , and replace the need to carry a ticket because it would contain all pertinent passenger information .
This bracelet would also allow for tracking a person through the airport terminal , including the passenger 's carry on luggage which would also be coded like the bracelet .
Then comes the kicker and the main purpose of the bracelet , it would also be equipped with an Electro - Muscular Disruption technology , which would allow crew members , using radio frequency transmitters , to " quickly and effectively subdue hijackers " , by overriding the attackers nervous system rendering them completely immobile for several minutes .
Everyone feeling safer ?

Singapore 's cash has bailed out cash - strapped Western banks recently
Singapore 's investment agency GIC has warned that the world is in danger of sinking into the worst recession in 30 years if swift action is not taken .
As the global supply of money shrinks , Tony Tan , GIC 's deputy chairman , said the world faced a period of " extreme uncertainty " .
GIC was formed to manage Singapore 's vast foreign currency reserves .
It has invested billions of dollars recently buying into troubled western banks , including UBS and Citigroup .
Swiss banking giant UBS and Wall Street heavyweight Citigroup have suffered substantially from failed investments linked to the US housing market which has slumped since last August .
Citigroup posted a second massive loss for its latest three month period last week after writing down by $ 12bn ( £ 6 bn ) the value of investments linked to US mortgages and other risky assets .
As a result of the problems , Citigroup said it would cut 9,000 jobs .
The problems afflicting the banks and many of their rivals has resulted in heightened volatility in financial markets , and a freezing up in the supply of money as banks become more risk averse .
" We could be facing a recession which is longer , deeper and wider than any recession we have encountered in the last 30 years , " said GIC's Mr Tan .
Mr Tan defended his purchase of UBS and Citigroup shares : " We regard our investments in UBS and Citigroup as long term investments which will give us good returns when markets stabilise and economic conditions return to more normal levels . "
GIC said it managed assets with a value of " well above $ 100bn " .
Analysts said the fund 's assets could be more than $ 300bn , making it one of the world 's biggest sovereign wealth funds .
Conyers to torture memo author : Testify voluntarily or face subpoena Nick Juliano
Published : Monday April 28 , 2008

Print This Email This House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers has threatened to subpoena several former officials in the Bush administration if they do not agree to testify about their roles in the preparation of the so - called " torture memos " that authorized severe interrogation tactics in the war on terror .
Conyers ( D - MI ) sent letters to former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John C. Yoo , Chief of Staff to the Vice President David Addington , and former Attorney General John Ashcroft .
In each of the letters , Conyers provides a May 2 deadline for response or , he says , " I will have no choice but to consider the use of compulsory process . "
The three officials have offered various excuses as to why they are unable to testify , but Conyers said those excuses are not good enough .
" Today we face a severe national challenge over charges related to the allegedly harsh treatment of detainees in U.S. custody , reportedly done with legal authorization of the Department of Justice and explicit approval from the highest officials in our government , " Conyers wrote to Addington ( .pdf ) .
" These are serious matters that substantially impact our national security , the safety and well - being of our troops around the world , and our nation 's legal and moral standing .
... [ M] ultiple sources place you at the center of these momentous events . "
Conyers goes on to recount reports that Addington helped shape the infamous Bybee memo authorizing harsh interrogation techniques and that he was the author of a legal memo arguing that some provisions of the Geneva Conventions were " quaint . "
In letters to lawyers representing Yoo ( .pdf ) and Ashcroft ( .pdf ) , Conyers said they had provided no basis for refusing to testify about the memos at a planned hearing May 6 , and he said concerns about executive privilege were n't enough to simply turn down the invitation .
" Such issues are properly addressed on a question - by - question basis , as current DOJ officials have done , not by a blanket refusal to testify , " Conyers wrote .
Whether the subpoena threat will have its desired affect remains to be seen , but the Bush administration and its former members have been adept at delaying testimony and ignoring congressional subpoenas .
The House issued contempt of Congress citations against White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former counsel Harriet Miers in February .
Those came six months after Bolten and Miers ignored subpoenas from Conyers ' committee , and the issue is still tied up in court .

I compare two studies today .
One is for the Federal Reserve and is filled with nonsense that tries to see how minimal a reserve we can get away with .
The other is for NBER and is a study examining previous housing boom / busts in the last 30 years .
It , at least , is sort of sensible .
Citigroup has only 7.7 % reserves which is utterly laughable .
They blew through $ 16 billion in reserves this last six months .
They are more or less bankrupt .
But their stock has soared on the absurd assumption that the banking crisis is over thanks to the stupid Federal Reserve using their helicopters to drop trillions of dollars into the grinding maw of asset destruction .
And this is worsening global inflation .
But the Fed pretends they have nothing to do with global inflation .
And truckers in the US are going on strike May first while Russia wo n't sell any more gold in international markets , they are keeping it at home to fight inflation .
Citigroup May Need to Sell Assets to Bolster Capital
Citigroup Inc. shareholders , cheered by a $ 5.1 billion first - quarter loss that was n't as big as some analysts forecast , face growing concern that the bank may have to sell assets , reduce the dividend and attract outside investment to bolster capital .
Citigroup 's so - called Tier 1 capital ratio -- a measure of its ability to withstand loan losses -- fell to 7.7 percent at the end of March , the New York - based bank said yesterday .
Citigroup says it needs a 7.5 percent ratio to provide a margin of safety and preserve its credit ratings .
The bank 's shares surged 4.5 percent yesterday after it reported $ 16 billion of asset writedowns during the quarter , less than some observers predicted .
The writedowns burned through much of the $ 30 billion of capital Citigroup has raised since late last year , leaving it vulnerable to further charges and loan - loss provisions .
There is so much Federal Funny Money ™ floating around the planet right now , strange and stupid things are happening .
The sudden rocket - upwards of the stock markets this week based on what is basically very bad news is typical .
Across the land , in the last few days , there has been much hue and cry about how the massive banking collapse in the West G7 nations is now over and all is well and the previous status quo is now reset and will resume .
The feeling is , we are back in 2003 with super - low interest rates and cheap oil .
And we will now plow ahead , getting richer , faster .
All assets in the G7 community will resume climbing thanks to a new flood of red ink from the central banks .
There is a gigantic fly in all these ointments : unlike in 2003 , we now have global inflation raging .
And the flood of Federal Funny Money ™ is making this worse and worse , rapidly worse .
In 2003 , we could cut taxes because the Federal deficit was ' only ' $ 6 trillion .
Now it is reaching to $ 10 trillion .
We can't run up half a trillion in red ink every year forever .
Like all systems that have a fast growth rate , there is a ceiling .
There is a point in time when it will collapse .
Citigroup is basically bankrupt .
This fictional bank only has ' reserves ' due to the Federal Reserve manufacturing fake money to hand out as ' reserves ' .
And these ' reserves ' are not gold , they are not other nation 's currencies , they are TREASURIES which are debts !
Which we , the US pubic , owes !
Even so , the reserves of this bankrupt bank is only 7.7 % ?
Talk about ridiculous !
Why have any reserves if they are so low ?
Citibank had to go to the Arab oil kings for more funding because their reserves vanished .
The Saudis are getting very steamed about all this .
The Federal Reserve had to assure them , the US is n't out to cheat them .
There is a direct connection between Citibank 's bankruptcy and the fact that Saudi Arabia this week announced they are cutting oil production is very possible .
The Saudis are very angry that Citibank wrote down $ 16 billion which they replaced to keep it from going Bear Stearns .
This article notes that these losses ' burned through ' all the money Citibank got but does n't mention from whom .
The Saudis know how to count .
They are balancing their books by dropping oil production until they make up this extra $ 16 billion Citibank burned .
The other day , there was news about a bank in India that allowed termites to eat up paper stored in their vaults .
Then they told the victims to drop dead , they were not going to restore the lost wealth .
Inflation is a termite colony set out to reduce the debts of the bankers and the ruling elites .
They eat up all the savings and then the losers are told to go starve to death .
Saudi Arabia is now determined to regain their lost Sovereign Wealth via raising the price of oil .
Since the US has cut Iran out of world oil markets , this is laughably easy .
As we all die from high energy costs , just remember : the US wanted this .
Our overlords set up the system that makes this possible .
We are not at the Hubbert 's Oil Peak yet but we are drawing close due to consumption rising .
Every little political disruption will hammer us quite suddenly and ferociously .
Citibank should be forced into receivership .
Saving it by creating hideous global inflation is stupid .
For first time , Central Bank buys gold from producers
MOSCOW .
April 18 ( Interfax ) - For the first time , the Central Bank
of Russia purchased gold for its international reserves from gold
producers , a source in banking circles told Interfax .
Previously the Central Bank had always purchased gold on the
interbank market .
Last year , to boost the dollar , the EU and Switzerland decided to pretend that gold had no value to bankers .
This novel idea has been peddled by debt - raddled empires for centuries .
When an empire is gaining strength , they are pro-gold .
When the debts from endless wars and infinite corruption mount , all empires decide that gold is worthless and they do n't need it .
This infantile approach leads to hideous inflation as well as infinite debts and the results are stark : destruction of the empire , the capital in flames , all is lost .
If the Goddess of History is certain about something , this is it .
It is most interesting that the Russian empire which imploded and collapsed is slowly rebuilding and using the ancient virtues and principles of wealth accumulation .
China , even more so .
China 's pursuit of old banking styles is most impressive .
They admit to inflation and realize that food and fuel inflation is very important .
And they raised the bank ratios to an impressive 16 % .
This is much more than double what Citibank considers to be a good reserve ratio .
Citibank 's ratios in the face of rising and worsening inflation is laughable .
The US government should force all the banks to raise their reserve ratios and to not let them use crummy , illiquid papers as reserves for making loans .
Traditionally , banks had to attract SAVINGS in order to generate more money via the magic of signing on more loans .
Instead , they played this game that excluded savings which is why the US has negative savings .
Back when that dire news hit , I predicted a banking collapse .
Which we are deep into these days .
Savings are NOT improving at all .
Instead , thanks to the super - low interest offered for savings , people are saving even less .
And this is getting worse .
Until interest rates rise above the rate of inflation , savings will collapse .
But if the US lowers reserves so they do n't matter , then the bankers can hand out loans with impunity , of course .
Which is the problem !
Now here is a study commissioned by the Federal Reserve that shows us clearly how stupid they have become .
This is due to being befuddled by modern economic teaching which has replaced intelligent analysis based on real dynamics with this goofy system of making up scientific formulas that ' describe ' situations without UNDERSTANDING them .
This mindless sort of mathematical magician work is hopelessly incapable of explaining relationships and systems .
But it makes for great magic spells !

Staff Reports : Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks : A Comparative Analysis
Abstract
We compare two stylized frameworks for the implementation of monetary policy .
The first framework relies only on standing facilities , and the second one relies only on open market operations .
We show that the Friedman rule cannot be implemented in the first framework , but can be implemented using the second framework .
However , for a given rate of inflation , we show that the first framework unambiguously achieves higher welfare than the second one .
We conclude that an optimal system of monetary policy implementationshould contain elements of both frameworks .
Our results also suggest that any such system should pay interest on both required and excess reserves .
* snip *
Our analysis yields two main results :
First , a pure corridor system cannot achieve very low rate of growth of the supply of reserves .
Second , for rate of growth of the supply of reserves that can be achieved by both systems , the corridor system provides higher welfare .
Using a simple parametrization of the model , we find that implementing a 2 % inflation target with a corridor system induces a welfare gain of about 1 % relative to implementing it with open market operations only .
This result arises from the fact that a CB paying interest on reserves reduces the distortion associated with holding these reserves for any inflation rate .
The first result arises because the CB does not have the authority to tax agents to remove reserves from the economy .
Only the government has the power to tax agents to finance its debt .
However , the CB can require that open market operations be conducted using the governmentís debt ( Treasury securities ) .
By buying some of it , the CB can then ináuence the amount of reserves that is extracted from the economy through taxation .
Hence , the CB can remove reserves from the economy , but only indirectly .
A CB that uses a pure corridor system can reduce the supply of reserves by charging a high interest rate for the reserves it lends .
However , as the rate of inflation becomes su¢ ciently low , the opportunity cost of reserves decreases and agents prefer to hold reserves than using the CBís borrowing facility .
This effect imposes a lower bound on the growth rate of the supply of reserves , which is necessarily higher than the Friedman rule .
And what is the gist of this magical wand waving ?
I fear , it is seeking an excuse to have little to no reserves !
I joke about how the Federal Reserve is neither Federal nor has reserves !
And look !
We do n't !
It is that simple !
The Federal Reserve , unlike the Bank of Japan or the Bank of China , has virtually no reserves !
Both of our competitors have huge dollar reserves .
We have tiny yen and yuan reserves .
China and Russia are building up their gold reserves .
We are not .
Note how this study talks about the government taxing people to remove reserves from the economy !
Is n't that interesting ?
Do our politicians talk about this ?
In wartimes , the government sells bonds in order to soak up excess savings and stop inflation !
But who is going to buy these bonds if inflation is raging out of control ?
This study was probably begun over a year ago back when the goofy idiots in the Fed imagined , thanks to offshoring our industries and reducing wages ruthlessly , the US had no inflation .
When there was inflation in food and fuel , they decreed this did n't count !
So they could pretend there was 2 % inflation when it was well above 5 % .
Now , this paper arrives at Bernanke 's desk right when rampant inflation is raging and there is NO reserves in the populace outside of the top 1 % of the rich , who can ' sop up ' this inflation via taxes !
Indeed , it is so much the exact opposite , it is very painful !
Look at the tax goodies being handed out !
Instead of collecting taxes to cut down on inflation , the Fed and the Fed are both creating more inflation !
Already , I see commercials on TV preparing to lure everyone into stores to buy stuff with this government inflationary handout .
And the government has been inflating for the last 35 years !
Only very briefly , for one year , did this stop .
And it so upset the guys inflating our currency to death , they ran off screaming for tax cuts .
Tax cuts=inflation .
See how simple is that ?
The Fed , itself , admits this .
The sole reason they have these complex magic formulas is so they can find a way of cheating reality .
They hope , if they finesse things enough , they can have their cake and eat it too and not cause huge inflationary stresses .
This stupid and childish desire is at the root of these equations , not a seeking of good systems that are reliable , sane and healthy .
The Fed wants to see how sick they can make our system and not kill it .
But they are killing it .
This is because of the nature of magic formulas : they never work in the end due to simple greed .
Everyone wants infinity .
Now here is a non-Federal Reserve study .
It is actually quite good .
It is from the National Bureau of Economic Research and was outsourced to Harvard .
This sensible study tries to compare a group of different banking collapses to see if we can find a common matrix , a systematic course of events , one thing following another .
Obviously , history is a great guide to the future and they use this tool to peer into our own future :
Is the 2007 U.S. Sub -Prime Financial Crisis So Different ?
An International
Historical Comparison *
Carmen M. Reinhart
University of Maryland and the NBER
Kenneth S. Rogoff
Harvard University and the NBER
The first major financial crisis of the 21st century involves esoteric instruments , unaware regulators , and skittish investors .
It also follows a well - trodden path laid down by centuries of financial folly .
Is the “ special ” problem of sub - prime mortgages this time really different ?
Our examination of the longer historical record , which is part of a larger effort on currency and debt crises , finds stunning qualitative and quantitative parallels across a number of standard financial crisis indicators .
To name a few , the run-up in U.S. equity and housing prices that Graciela L. Kaminsky and Carmen M. Reinhart ( 1999 ) find to be the best leading indicators of crisis in countries experiencing large capital inflows closely tracks the average of the previous eighteen post World War II banking crises in industrial countries .
So , too , does the inverted v-shape of real growth in the years prior to the crisis .
Despite widespread concern about the effects on national debt of the early 2000s tax cuts , the run-up in U.S. public debt is actually somewhat below the average of other crisis episodes .
In contrast , the pattern of United States current account deficits is markedly worse .
At this juncture , the book is still open on the how the current dislocations in the United States will play out .
The precedent found in the aftermath of other episodes suggests that the strains can be quite severe , depending especially on the initial degree of trauma to the financial system ( and to some extent , the policy response ) .
The average drop in ( real per capita ) output growth is over 2 percent , and it typically takes two years to return to trend .
For the five most catastrophic cases ( which include episodes in Finland , Japan , Norway , Spain and Sweden ) , the drop in annual output growth from peak to trough is over 5 percent , and growth remained well below pre-crisis trend even after three years .
These more catastrophic cases , of course , mark the boundary that policymakers particularly want to avoid .
Except for Japan , all the other nations in this study were not world powers .
When a small country does what the US or Japan has done , they are hammered pretty relentlessly by outsiders .
The US is quite different and this study does n't examine the obvious and important differences .
Namely , the entire world outside of a handful of terrorists who are taking great delight in our economic fumbles , the rest of the world runs a huge trade surplus with the US .
So they want to help us keep on our wild misspending and wild overspending !
They will literally move heaven and earth to keep us afloat .
They desire for us to not change course .
They want a strong dollar !
They are not seeking to drop the value of the dollar .
Asia is holding amazing amounts of dollars in order to control US inflation and US banking values .
The oil pumping nations are trying to keep our banking system solvent !
They are not selling us .
Or rather , because they are selling to us , they are letting us skate on very thin ice .
But even China cannot keep the US afloat if we bloat our debts to impossible highs .
There is a limit and then a grinding global collapse will happen .
This study is rather shortsighted because it is not examining the US troubles in light of other GLOBAL EMPIRES .
These have only a stellar few but significant few : the collapse of the Roman empire , the Holy Roman Empire , the Spanish Empire , the Netherlands Empire , the French Empire , the English Empire and the German Empires .
All three of them .
They feature something this study ignores : wars .
Not one of the nations in this study were overspending on futile wars .
ALL empires collapse due to this .
Aside from this caveat , this study is worth reading .
Let 's look at the charts they provided :
All banking collapses follow on the heels of huge runs in creating mortgages .
The more these deadly things are made , the greater the crash .
The faster the loan are lent , the swifter the decline as the army of new debtors give up as housing values collapse .
This is a bad system that has to be avoided .
This is simple : when regulators see housing suddenly climbing in value and numbers , they raise interest rates !
Wow !
We better tell Greenspan and Bernanke !
This chart shows us that running more and more red ink means more and more likely there will be a banking crisis .
Duh .
This simple correlation needs no fancy mathematical formulas .
It is laughably easy to spot .
Too much money spent on stupid wars=bankrupt empires .
Haw !
This could be the a one sentence ' Decline and Fall of Great Powers ' !
And of course , as Professor Kennedy said in his great work , deindustrializing is a certain road to non-great power status !
I will also note that Germany is the most allergic to inflation and they are the world 's # 1 export industrial power !
WOW .
With unions !
WOW .
And communist China is now # 2 and rapidly closing in on Germany 's top status .
The US is below that , we export a lot of stuff .
We just do n't worry about importing twice as much .
Gah .
And none of these studies tie in this vital , utterly important fact !
The red ink is all over the systems !
And NO nation can thrive this way .
NEVER .
As Germany , China and Japan struggle to keep us afloat , we can't float if our boat is filled with nothing but red ink .
End of story .
The debt - riddled US economic system hopes we can avoid going into negative growth numbers .
To achieve this end , we are inflating global systems .
Anyone can grow with global inflation !
This is the definition of inflation !
But there is a problem : the US can inflate the world but this will cause riots , revolutions , wars and utter destruction across the entire planet .
This is STUPID .
The world 's biggest empire should be as allergic to this as Germany seems to be allergic to inflation .
Harvard :
Perhaps the United States will prove a different kind of happy family .
Despite many superficial similarities to a typical crisis country , it may yet suffer a growth lapse comparable only to the mildest cases .
Perhaps this time will be different as so many argue .
Nevertheless , the quantitative and qualitative parallels in run-ups to earlier post - war industrialized - country financial crises are worthy of note .
Of course , inflation is lower and better anchored today worldwide , and this may prove an important mitigating factor .
The United States does not suffer the handicap of a fixed exchange rate system .
On the other hand , the apparent decline in U.S. productivity growth and in housing prices does not provide a particularly favorable backdrop for withstanding a credit contraction .
Another parallel deserves mention .
During the 1970s , the U.S. banking system stood as an intermediary between oil - exporter surpluses and emerging market borrowers in Latin America and elsewhere .
While much praised at the time , 1970s petro - dollar recycling ultimately led to the 1980s debt crisis , which in turn placed enormous strain on money center banks .
3
It is true that this time , a large volume of petro- dollars are again flowing into the United States , but many emerging markets have been running current account surpluses , lending rather than borrowing .
This part of the study had to be included for all the infants and babies who have to read this report .
Why , thanks to the Chinese and Germans and maybe the Saudis , we wo n't have to pay the piper !
If we ignore global inflation , US wars and other horrors , maybe we can have a shallow recession !
Right !
And this is the problem : we can do this only so long as the Chinese want to bail us out of our own messes .
And trust me , they are getting extremely angry about all this .
The push by the US and Europe to dismember China this month has been tremendously dangerous .
It is beyond words : life and death .
This is a great way to start WWIII .
Russia disintegrated peacefully --- except for Chechnya --- and the Europeans promised to not let the US menace Russia and put military bases in Russia .
But we did !
And Europe broke promises and moved NATO forwards to Russia 's front doorstep and sneered at Russian objections as the US parked offensive missiles aimed at Moscow in Eastern Europe !
China knows they can't trust the West even slightly .
The Russians keep forgetting this important lesson .
So we have a financial system built on the good graces of China and Russia being friendly with Europe and the US even as both work hard to destroy Russia and China .
Only the red ink is killing the G7 .
They goofed .
They left out this important consideration .
And they are nervous about the energy issues .
Trapped , they wonder about just making global inflation and this way , destroying China 's economic power and to render the loot sent to the oil pumping nations , worthless .
This is a most dangerous game .
I sense it is evolving into a dynamic whereby the oil nations will declare an alliance with Russia and China .
Already , we pushed Iran in this direction .
Next : Saudi Arabia .
MAY DAY : A Call To Action
UPDATE : The Teamsters Union is also planning a strike .
The Postal Workers are planning moments of silence and work stoppage .

Nearly one hundred Longshore Caucus delegates voted on February 8 to support a resolution calling for an eight - hour " stop - work " meeting during the day - shift on Thursday , May 1 at ports in CA , OR and WA to protest the war by calling for the immediate , safe return of U.S. troops from Iraq .
“ The Caucus has spoken on this important issue and I ’ve notified the employers about our plans for ' stop work ' meetings on May 1 , ” said ILWU International President Bob McEllrath .
Diesel is now a dollar more per gallon than gasoline .
This is totally insane .
Diesel requires less refining !
But the inflation in fuel used for commerce is faster than consumer uses !
This is a VERY BAD SIGN .
This is hammering farmers and truckers .
Since these people also are big Republican supporters , they have to look in a mirror to see who was the fool .
In Europe , truckers have shut down whole nations , hugely .
And the military had to be called out .
Here , I am betting this will have virtually no effect .
Until the guys who do the labor figure out they have been conned , they will flounder and die .
Soon , Mexico will flood us with cheap trucking labor .
This is part of NAFTA .
Note that any anti-NAFTA people running for office have been ruthlessly eliminated by the media .
The giant sucking sound continues .
And it is connected to inflation and to the overspending by our government and our banking system that has no reserves !
Lord help us all .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - AT&T Inc T.N , Verizon Wireless and Deutsche Telekom's DTEGn .DE
T- Mobile USA on Tuesday announced flat rate plans for unlimited calls in the United States , raising investor concerns that a price war could break out and sending shares lower .

AT&T Inc. , Verizon Wireless and Deutsche Telekom 's T - Mobile USA on Tuesday announced flat rate plans for unlimited calls in the United States , raising investor concerns that a price war could break out and sending shares lower .
REUTERS / Enny Nuraheni
Verizon Wireless , a venture of Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L , said early on Tuesday it had started offering unlimited calls for $ 99.99 a month .
AT&T followed with a similar plan , while T - Mobile USA went a step further by including unlimited texts as well as calls for the same price .
While the new offers are not likely to make a noticeable dent in the operators ’ average service revenue , analysts said investors were worried that they would trigger further price cuts that would hurt profit and revenue .
The actions put pressure on Sprint Nextel Corp S.N , the No. 3 U.S. wireless service , to match the plans or risk customers defecting , analysts said .
“ I think this increases the potential for an all out pricing war , ” said Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson .
He said the plans were likely to prompt high - spending customers to downgrade their plans rather than encourage customers to upgrade to unlimited plans .
Shares of Verizon Communications fell 6.26 percent , AT&T fell 5.6 percent , and Sprint fell 2.61 percent .
About 85 percent of U.S. consumers have cell phones , which is increasing pressure on U.S service providers to maintain growth rates .
Sprint Nextel spokeswoman Leigh Horner said the company was continuously evaluating its offering , but she declined to comment on specific plans .
She noted that Sprint was testing plans in four markets with unlimited voice , text and Web access for $ 119.99 and $ 149.99 .
“ It all but forces them to respond , ” said analyst Craig Moffett from Sanford Bernstein .
“ They ’re not going to be competitive if they simply match these prices because their networks are weaker and their brands are not as strong . ”
Smaller wireless companies Leap Wireless LEAP.O and MetroPCS PCS.N offer unlimited calling for customers who do not want roaming capabilities .
Nelson said they should not be threatened as their customers , who pay about $ 40 a month for unlimited services in their local markets , would be unlikely to buy a $ 100 plan .
Leap shares closed up 3 cents on Nasdaq while MetroPCS stock finished down 57 cents at $ 15.54 .
Analysts said they expect a minimal immediate impact on Verizon Wireless ’ average revenue per user ( ARPU ) because only a small percentage of its customers spend more than $ 100 a month on phone calls .
Verizon Wireless ’s ARPU for retail customers was $ 51.59 in the fourth quarter , compared to $ 50.28 at AT&T .
UBS analyst John Hodulik said the new Verizon plan could attract some customers who are now on $ 150 and $ 200 monthly plans .
He said Sprint may have to come out with a more aggressive offering , which could be bad for the industry .
“ A more competitive Sprint combined with increasing pressure on voice ARPU does not bode well for medium - term growth of carriers with significant wireless exposure , ” Hodulik said in a research note .
Verizon Wireless spokeswoman Brenda Boyd Raney , citing third party research , said about 13 percent to 15 percent of U.S. wireless customers had expressed interest in unlimited calling plans .
Soleil Securities analyst Todd Rethemeier said that unlimited price plans were inevitable .
“ I think over the next couple of years the entire industry will be forced to follow suit , ” he said .
Nelson estimated U.S. revenue from mobile calls had fallen to 6 cents a minute in 2005 from 10 cents a minute in 2003 , before flattening at about 5.5 cents a minute in the last two years .
Verizon shares closed down $ 2.49 at $ 35.34 on the New York Stock Exchange .
AT&T shares closed down $ 1.99 at $ 35.89 .
Sprint shares closed down 34 cents at $ 9.23 .
Opposition deputies boycotted the vote to dissolve parliament
Macedonian legislators have voted to dissolve parliament and hold early elections on 1 June amid a row with Greece over the country 's name .
Greece wants the former Yugoslav republic to change its name , saying it implies a territorial claim over its northern province of the same name .
Greece blocked Macedonia 's bid to join Nato a week ago over the name issue .
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said opposition parties had been blocking his plans for reform .
" We remain committed to our goals to join Nato and the European Union , " Mr Gruevski said .
" But the necessary reforms are halted with a blockade of parliamentary procedures . "
Fears of unrest
Seventy of Macedonia 's 120 deputies voted to dissolve the parliament , with 50 opposition members boycotting the vote .
The opposition Social Democrats said early elections could further harm Macedonia 's bid to join Nato .
Nato 's veto has inflamed nationalist feelings in Macedonia
Macedonia 's multi-ethnic government has been in deadlock for months over reforms and rights for the country 's 25 % ethnic Albanian minority .
Some analysts say Mr Gruevski is hoping to secure a stronger mandate for his conservative VMRO - DPMNE party amid an upsurge of anti-Greek sentiment .
Others fear increased Albanian unrest .
In 2001 , Nato and the EU managed to prevent a civil war in Macedonia between security forces and ethnic Albanians separatists by brokering a peace deal which granted more minority rights .
Macedonia 's official name is the Republic of Macedonia , and Skopje wants to use this in international relations , but Athens wants the country to change its name to New or Upper Macedonia .
Athens could use its veto again later this year to scupper Skopje 's bid to start EU membership talks .
There will be fewer incentives for the government to create a multi-ethnic society without the carrot of Nato and European Union membership , says the BBC's European affairs correspondent Oana Lungescu .
I set up Nonjatta in 2007 after a chance encounter with a bottle of Japanese whisky in a supermarket outside Tokyo .
I 'm now mothballing the site .
Nonjatta and the projects springing from it have been covered by media organisations including the Guardian , Reuters , the Los Angeles Times , the New York Times , El Globo and many others .
We 've been nominated for the James Beard Award .
We 've published three great books that have been translated into three languages .
We 've played our part in telling the story of Japanese whisky .
But it 's time to call it a day .
All the content will stay up and you can still contact us , but we 're moving on to new projects .
Nonjatta was n't particularly pioneering .
There was some really useful information online about Japanese whisky before I first posted in 2007 .
I remember Serge Valentin's Whiskyfun.com website being a particular inspiration , Takeshi Mogi 's site ( gone but not forgotten ) was a great source in the early days , and …
SAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 9 — Challenged by strong winds and tides , cleanup crews struggled Friday to contain an oil spill spreading in the San Francisco Bay as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency for the area .
No stranger to natural disasters in California , the governor traveled to the Bay Area on Friday for a briefing on the status of the 58,000 - gallon spill , which started early Wednesday after a 900 - foot container ship rammed into a tower of the Bay Bridge .
The ship was crippled , and oozed the oil that has closed 16 beaches and , at last count , killed more than two dozen water birds .
“ There is tremendous damage on the wildlife and on the beaches , ” Mr. Schwarzenegger said Friday , later adding , “ If mistakes were made , then we will bring them out . ”
Fourteen local , state and federal agencies are now involved with the investigation , recovery and cleanup of the tanker ’s payload , consisting of diesel fuel and dense oil used to power ships .
But the cleanup effort has done little to blunt criticism aimed at those who first responded to the accident on Wednesday .
That was the headline of many of last week 's stories about the paper by Behar and colleagues , drawing upon the Genographic Project African mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) data .
Here 's a quote from the National Geographic Society 's press release :
Previous studies have shown that while human populations had been quite small prior to the Late Stone Age , perhaps numbering fewer than 2,000 around 70,000 years ago , the expansion after this time led to the occupation of many previously uninhabited areas , including the world beyond Africa .
And here 's project director Spencer Wells ' quote in the same release :
Dr. Spencer Wells , National Geographic Explorer - in- Residence and Director of the Genographic Project , said : " This new study released today illustrates the extraordinary power of genetics to reveal insights into some of the key events in our species ' history .
Tiny bands of early humans , forced apart by harsh environmental conditions , coming back from the brink to reunite and populate the world .
Truly an epic drama , written in our DNA . "
Well , that certainly sounds dramatic .
But is it true ?
The paper itself does not provide any tests of the number of ancient humans indicated by the mtDNA phylogeny .
The press release mentions " previous studies " that fix a small initial founding population for Africans , so I went looking through the paper to see which studies they had cited .
I found this passage , which seems relevant :
Different approaches were taken in the attempt to estimate the sub-Saharan Homo sapiens population size in different time frames .
7
OK , that seems like what I want -- estimates of population size in different time frames in sub-Saharan Africa .
So I looked up reference 7 , and found this :
Hawks , J. , Wang , E.T. , Cochran , G.M. , Harpending , H.C. , and Moyzis , R.K. ( 2007 ) .
Recent acceleration of human adaptive evolution .
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 , 20753-20758 .
D'oh !
Now on the one hand , it is very gratifying to be recognized as an expert on the genetic demography of sub-Saharan Africa .
I mean , we did work hard on that paper .
But on the other hand , it seems like we might do a little better than that paper as an examination of the demographic history of sub-Saharan Africa .
And the current paper by Behar and colleagues provides exactly the right kind of information to get that more detailed demographic history .
So I 've put together some notes here on how we can discover whether there was a population bottleneck 70,000 years ago in Africa , using the mtDNA evidence .
I 'm setting aside for the moment the question of population structure -- the " isolation " story that was also made in the press release for the paper .
Population structure and size are not independent of each other , and we will have to consider how they interacted in African prehistory .
But the first issue should be size , because our interpretation of size is based on relatively simple aspects of genetic variation ( at its simplest , the first moment ) , while testing hypotheses about population structure requires higher - order comparisons .
Assumptions
Any estimate of ancient population sizes requires a number of assumptions .
I 'm about to be more explicit about these assumptions than any other analysis of ancient population sizes you 're likely to have seen .
Major assumption : Effective population size is relevant to the actual population size .
I wanted to put that up front , to be perfectly clear that we are going to be dealing with an estimate of the rate of inbreeding , and not a direct signature of the number of individuals .
The two may be related to each other , given other assumptions .
But human genetics has what you might call a Vizzini problem : that word they keep saying , " effective population size , " it does not mean what they think it means .
The " effective population size " is often confused uncritically for the true number of individuals in a present - day or ancient population .
The interpretation of a bottleneck ( e.g. , of the 2000 - individual variety noted above ) is based on the inference that a population in the past had a much higher rate of inbreeding than was true more recently .
Inbreeding , as we will see below , has characteristic effects on the rate of coalescence of gene lineages .
The rate can be converted to an estimate of the effective population size , given other assumptions .
I 'll have a much longer discussion of effective population size in a separate post .
But for the time being , please note that our " population size " estimates are actually estimates of " effective population size , " which for ancient humans must certainly have been smaller than the actual number of people , and may have been smaller than the actual number of people by an order of magnitude or more .
So what other assumptions should we keep in mind ?
1. Mutation model and rate
In this discussion , I will assume the mutation model and rates assumed in the paper by Behar and colleagues ( 2008 ) .
Those may be in error , and the errors will necessarily affect my estimates .
But I do n't have any particular reason to think the errors are in one direction or another -- in fact , I think that the dates given for lineages in the study look reasonable given the evidence from other sources , and are consistent with other recent studies .
2. Panmixia
We 'll assume random mating .
This assumption is certainly false for this sample of mtDNA , as demonstrated by Behar et al .
But we will leave it for additional tests to see how much a more accurate hypothesis of population structure will affect our estimate of effective size .
3 . No selection
That 's an odd thing for you to see me write .
It is actually very likely that some of the relevant mtDNA lineages have been selected during their history .
We ignore that at our peril , since natural selection ( which causes inbreeding ) would invalidate the relationship between effective size ( a measure of inbreeding ) and the actual population size .
The coalescent
The coalescent is a statistical description of the genealogical relationships among a sample of genes taken from a population .
As I will describe it here , the coalescent applies to a Wright - Fisher population model , a random - mating , discrete - generation population model described by a single parameter , N , the number of individuals .
The concept of " effective population size " ( N e ) relates the level of inbreeding in an actual population to that expected in a Wright - Fisher population of N e individuals .
Often we consider a diploid population with 2N gene copies ( chromosomes ) , but because we will be considering mitochondria here , I will use the haploid formulation with N gene copies .
In a Wright - Fisher population , the probability that two randomly chosen gene copies actually descend from a single gene copy in the previous generation is simply 1 / N.
Looking at the genealogy of the genes in a retrospective point of view , this is the probability that the two lineages will coalesce into a single ancestral lineage , and we can call this a coalescent event .
Now , let 's consider a sample if n gene copies .
Any random pair of these copies might share a parent in the preceding generation , with probability 1 / N.
Collectively , if we ignore the chance that two or more coalescent events occur in the same generation , the probability of that n gene copies have only n- 1 ancestors in the previous generation is :
Conversely , the probability that the n copies have n distinct ancestors is 1 - Pr[ n→n - 1 ] .
Now we can ask , what is the mean number of generations between coalescent events ?
The probability of a coalescent event among n copies in generation t -- but not before generation t -- is :
This probability declines as t increases , and is distributed as a geometric decay , so that the expected time that the genealogy has exactly n ancestral lineages is :
The mean time from n to n - 2 is the sum of the means from n to n- 1 and from n - 1 to n - 2 , and the total time to the coalescent of the entire sample is expected to be :
This expression converges toward 2N as n increases to be very large .
Because of this relation , the coalescence time of the sample serves as an estimator of the size of the Wright - Fisher population with similar genetic variation as the sampled population .
The estimate of N thus derived is called the inbreeding effective population size -- " inbreeding " because it depends on the identity - by - descent among the sampled gene copies .
This estimate is a kind of average effective population size , covering the time all the way back to the coalescent of the sample .
It is therefore not very informative about the way that population has changed over time .
If we want to know about the size of the African population between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago , say , we are going to have to find a way to estimate more precisely .
Applied to African mtDNA
If we know that the present - day sample of African mtDNA coalesced to n ancestral lineages 80,000 years ago , and further to n-x ancestral lineages 90,000 years ago , then we can arrive at an estimate of effective population size applying just to that time period .
The mitochondrial equivalent of the Wright - Fisher population size N is the inbreeding effective number of females , N e( f ) .
Assuming this number was constant across the interval from t n to t n-x , then the female effective size is given by the equation :
Helpfully , Behar et al. ( 2008 ) provide the number of ancestral lineages remaining at the beginning of various time periods , from 80,000 to 144,000 years ago , in their Table 1 .
They estimated dates using their model of mutations in the genealogy , so the numbers may be imprecise .
But they make it very easy to derive estimates of the effective number of females in the ancient African population .
Note that these estimate will have an error factor due to the fact that the coalescent events do not match up exactly with the time intervals given in Table 1 .
A substitution of the true estimates for the coalescent dates would eliminate this source of error ; for this post I am sticking with the dates given in Table 1 instead of the supplementary table , just because the numbers of lineages in these intervals have been pre-tabulated and are simpler for readers to cross-check .
At 80,000 years ago , the African sample includes 24 ancestral lineages ; by 90,000 years ago it includes only 22 .
That means 2 coalescent events in this 500 generation span , yielding an estimate of female N e( f ) = 66,000 .
That 's a high estimate , certainly very high compared to the notion that the human population was restricted to fewer than 2000 individuals at that time !
But in a very small population of 2000 individuals , we would expect a very large fraction of the sampled ancestral lineages to have coalesced in a 500 - generation span .
We would expect 24 ancestral lineages to coalesce into only three or four across that time period .
Instead , we find that the African sample had a low rate of lineage coalescence across that span : low inbreeding , and therefore a high effective population size .
I picked the 80,000 - 90,000 year span first because it has relatively few coalescent events .
Earlier and later spans have more coalescent events , and therefore the estimate of effective population size should be smaller .
For example , the period from 90,000 to 100,000 years ago includes 8 coalescent events , from 22 to 14 ancestral lineages , leading to an estimate of N e( f ) = 9600 .
The period between 70,000 and 80,000 ( less accurate because I have to read off Figure 1 instead of a table ) appears to have 7 coalescent events ( counting the multifurcation at the base of L3 as 6 separate events ) .
That leads to an estimate of N e( f ) = 27,000 .
Which of these estimates is more accurate ?
We have to consider :
1 . More coalescent events in an interval should lead to a more accurate estimate , because the major component of error comes from the large variance in the distribution of coalescence times .
Counting several events tends to average out extreme values .
Likewise , the boundaries of these time slices are arbitrary dates in years , not coincident with coalescent events .
Each slice includes some amount of time before and after the included coalescent events , causing more inaccuracy for small numbers of events .
So the interval including only 2 events should result in a much less reliable estimate of effective size .
2 . On the other hand , the population could really have changed in size .
If so , there 's nothing impossible about all the estimates being accurate .
The estimates provide a testable hypothesis of population history .
I tend to think that these estimates by themselves are insufficient to document the fluctuation of the population across this span -- we would want additional evidence from other genes , preferably corroborated by archaeology .
Also , we have to remember that population structure is affecting the inbreeding in a way that we have n't tested yet .
So all in all , I would prefer to assume a constant size , and put the most reliable estimate together .
We can do this by combining the span represented in the paper .
Across the time period from 70,000 to 144,000 years ago , the African sample coalesces from 31 to 7 ancestral lineages , a total of 24 coalescent events .
If the female effective population size were constant across that time span , this would lead to an estimate of N e( f ) = 17,000 .
Taking only the span from 70,000 to 100,000 years ago as a subsample yields an estimate of N e(f ) = 19,000 -- in other words , barely larger .
The effective sizes seem consistent across the span from 70,000 to 144,000 years .
There was no narrow bottleneck at that time , nothing associated with those " megadroughts , " nothing associated with the Toba volcanic eruption .
What does the large African effective size mean ?
Since those estimates are for the female effective size , we can double them to estimate the total inbreeding effective population size for Africa across this time period -- approximately 34,000 individuals .
This is substantially larger than the long - term effective size as estimated from most autosomal genes .
Autosomal genes have a much longer total coalescence time than the mtDNA -- in the Wright - Fisher model , they would have a coalescence time 4 times longer .
And they do tend to preserve ancient diversity from much earlier than 200,000 years ago -- an average around 800,000 to 1 million years , and some much longer .
These times correspond to an estimate of the long term effective size of N e = 10,000 .
If the mtDNA is showing a larger effective size -- around three or more times larger than the long - term value for autosomal genes -- then I would hypothesize that the expansion of the African population had already commenced during this time period .
This corresponds to the late Middle Stone Age , a time of exceptional flourishing of regional technological variation in Africa as well as the innovation of new tool types , hunting techniques ( projectile weapons ) and artistic expression .
It makes sense for the African population to have been expanding at this time , not contracting or undergoing a severe bottleneck .
I am currently working on testing this hypothesis with new SNP data from African populations .
But from the mtDNA alone we have a partial indication that the expansion had begun by 144,000 years ago .
If we look back to the earliest part of the tree , back to the inferred coalescent of the entire mtDNA sample -- a date this study places at 200,000 years ago -- we can estimate female effective size using the same method as above .
The earliest branches of a gene genealogy should be the oldest , because we should wait much longer for a coalescent event among a few sampled lineages than among many .
In fact , in a Wright - Fisher population , half the total time depth of a gene genealogy is expected to be taken up by the final coalescent -- the time span during which only two ancestral lineages remain .
In the tree presented by Behar et al. ( 2008 ) , the tree coalesces from three lineages to two at 180,000 years ago .
All things being neutral and constant , we would expect the final coalescent to take another 180,000 years -- for a total time depth of 360,000 years .
We can observe that that date would accord very well with a female effective size of 18,000 as estimated for later dates in the tree .
But in this tree , the final coalescent takes only 20,000 years .
In fact , the final few coalescent events seem to take substantially less time than would be expected under neutrality .
We can quantify this : taking the population from 7 ancestral lineages at 144,000 years ago back to only 1 ancestral lineage at 200,000 years ago , we estimate N e( f ) = 1600 .
This looks like a small ancestral size for the sample -- but not at 70,000 years ago , but instead well over 140,000 years ago .
If we consider the effective size estimate back to the next - to - last coalescent , 180,000 years ago , we obtain an estimate of N e(f ) = 2500 -- almost as small , but not quite .
This indicates that the apparent increase in inbreeding characterizes not only the final coalescent but the final few .
Pending further investigation , I would say this is probably a real increase in inbreeding .
Is this a bottleneck ?
I think the null hypothesis is that this small effective size represents the same population size as estimated for the long - term autosomal value .
A population effective size of 5000 for the mtDNA is probably not statistically different from a size of 10,000 for the autosomes -- given the small number of coalescent events we are including .
But maybe this early high level of inbreeding does represent a bottleneck , or possibly the rapid differentiation of a mtDNA variant under selection in Africa after 200,000 years ago .
How many people would this mean in the African late MSA ?
I 'm going to post on effective population size in the next few days , because it is a complicated story .
But if you happen to miss those posts , I can give a quick indication of what these numbers mean for the African population .
The inbreeding effective size in ancient humans was likely somewhere between a third of the actual number of individuals anywhere down to a tenth or less .
This means that an estimate of the effective size of 34,000 would likely indicate a true population size of 100,000 up to 300,000 individuals .
This population may have occupied all the parts of Africa for which late MSA assemblages exist .
The evidence for some population structure presented by Behar et al. ( 2008 ) ( as well as earlier work by Gonder et al. 2007 and others ) supports that model : A large and widely dispersed African population , exchanging genes and ideas .
Other phenomena may cause much more inbreeding than expected in a Wright - Fisher population .
Genetic draft , or pseudohitchhiking , is one ; repeated colonization and extinction of small groups is another .
If these factors were important in human evolution , they may have reduced the inbreeding effective size to much less than a tenth of the census population size .
As yet , we have no good estimate of such factors , but they should have become less important as populations grew during the Late Pleistocene .
So a total population size of 500,000 - 1 million is not out of the realm of possibility for the late MSA , especially if some currents within this population made more of a contribution to later populations than others .
The late Acheulean / early MSA population appears likely to have been much smaller , only a third or less the size of that during the later MSA .
Human occupation was widespread across Africa during that earlier time , so the expansion may represent either an increase in the density across the same range or the displacement of some populations ( or genetic lineages ) by others .
I can't finish without noting that many of the key archaeological innovations of the late MSA are also found outside of Africa , in the European and Levantine Middle Paleolithic .
The mtDNA evidence is necessarily telling us about African populations of this period , because the Eurasian mtDNA gene pool is much more recently derived .
But the demographic changes occurring in Africa must have influenced neighboring regions as well , both through gene flow and cultural diffusion .
The most interesting genes are the selected ones .
This improved picture of demographic history in Africa greatly aids our ability to evaluate selection in recent African populations .
As indicated by these data , there was no severe bottleneck in Africa within the last 100,000 years .
The population was quite large ( in evolutionary terms ) across that entire span .
This is reflected by the low level of linkage disequilibrium evident in the Yoruba HapMap and other African population samples .
It means that long LD regions in these samples certainly do not derive from recent bottlenecks .
How could this be wrong ?
Looking back to the underlying assumptions , there are several possible weaknesses in the analysis as it applies to the real prehistoric African population as opposed to an ideal Wright - Fisher population .
1. Nonrandom sampling strategy .
The research article has very selectively drawn mtDNA samples for further analysis by whole - genome sequencing .
In particular , the study attempted to increase our knowledge of the diversity within the ancient L1 and L0 lineages .
But ideally for this kind of demographic inference we would want a random sample of genes , not a highly selected sample .
Still , I do n't think that presents a significant bias in this case .
The entire sample includes several hundred mtDNA copies , so these ancient lineages should have shown up regardless .
Sampling diversity in this way would certainly alter our interpretations of recent divergences ( by underestimating the true inbreeding rate ) but this should have little effect on the ancient parts of the genealogy .
2. Population structure .
Behar et al. ( 2008 ) conclude that their Khoisan and other African samples could not have belonged to a single random - mating population across the span from 80,000 to 100,000 years ago , and possibly more recently .
Generally speaking , population structure tends to increase genetic variation .
But when we consider the rate of coalescent events , the story is more complicated .
Partial isolation would affect the times of coalescent events in the sample across this span : Coalescent events within each sample would be somewhat more likely , while coalescent events including lineages from both samples would be much less likely .
We can test the effect of population structure on our estimate of effective size , by considering each sample separately .
The Khoisan sample includes very few lineages across the entire span ( at most 4 ) , so an estimate of female effective size from this sample will not be very reliable .
Based on the reduction from 4 to 2 ancestral lineages from 80,000 to 144,000 years ago , we can estimate N e( f ) = 6400 .
The non-Khoisan African sample includes many more ancestral lineages across this range : from 20 to 5 .
This yields an estimate of N e(f ) = 11,000 .
The sum of these is hardly different than would be estimated from the whole sample under the assumption of random mating , so this aspect of population structure has relatively little influence on the estimate across this span .
It remains possible that other aspects of population structure ( such as finer geographic structuring ) might be inflating the estimate .
3. Selection .
I am less concerned with selection in this portion of the African mtDNA history than I am in later times .
Clearly , many mtDNA lineages have recently been increased or reduced in frequency by selection .
We see rather large transitions in frequency between ancient and modern samples in some regions , we see health and other phenotypic consequences of mtDNA lineages in living humans , and we see a clear signature of rapid growth for some lineages indicative of selection .
But across the span from 70,000 to 144,000 years ago , there is no sign of large - scale frequency changes among the sampled lineages .
It is possible that some diversifying selection may be maintaining different lineages , but this seems sort of unlikely over 60,000 years or more , also considering the relatively steady rate of coalescent events across the span .
However , the initial period of the genealogy , between 200,000 and 144,000 years ago , may have seen positive selection on a new mtDNA variant .
That hypothesis may be tested by further comparisons with autosomal variability .
Weak purifying selection on coding sites would tend to reduce the length of early branches compared to later branches , as these later branches would include some weakly selected mutations that would not be expected to survive over the long term .
This phenomenon would depress our estimates of effective size early in the tree .
This could be tested by comparing the synonymous / nonsynonymous mutation ratio for earlier and later branches .
4. Mutation model .
The estimates here depend on the mutation model employed by Behar et al .
That model could be wrong .
This is by far the largest potential source of error in the estimate , not only because adjustments to the rate of mutations would cause a linear response in the estimates of female effective size , but also because the evident changes in the genealogy over time will change in date as a result .
If we increased the mutation rate estimated for coding mtDNA mutations by double , we would be looking at a bottleneck around 2000 individuals ending around 70,000 years ago -- pretty much what the press release had claimed .
( It is interesting that you have to double the mutation rate to get to that value ! )
Now , the mutation model used in this paper does agree with results from other recent whole - genome analyses of mtDNA .
And doubling the mutation rate would have other untenable consequences -- for instance , it would move the South Asian appearance of the modern human mtDNA variability down to less than 30,000 years ago , and the population expansion into the New World down to around 7000 years ago .
Still , we might maintain that the later branches have lower effective mutation rates than the early branches .
We should also keep in mind the possibility of error in the other direction , as well .
If our estimate of mutation rate is too high , then effective size estimates are systematically too low .
That would point to an earlier population expansion in Africa .
Conclusion
As you can see , these data allow a direct test of the hypothesis of a 70,000 - year - old bottleneck in Africa , and they refute the hypothesis .
The new data allow a powerful model of ancient African population size to be built , one that comes together with archaeological data to give us a really interesting picture of the early evolution of " modern " humans .
The model can be tested with new , massive sets of information from single nucleotide polymorphisms , as well as a more detailed chronology of late MSA sites .

A Danish company called Agroplast has figured out how to turn pig-piss into plastic and into a cigarette " flavor enhancer " :
Transforming farm waste into plastic precursors is potentially attractive over other bioplastic ideas because the feedstock effectively has no value .
In fact , it has negative value because animal waste must be disposed , which costs money .
Some other bioplastic companies make their resins out of corn starch .
Tøttrup claims that the process could , conceivably , result in plastics that cost a third less than conventional plastics made from fossil fuels .
That 's a big conceivably .
Traditionally , bioplastics made of vegetable matter have cost more than fossil fuel plastics .
Evaluation of the pricing will have to wait until large volumes of this stuff are made .

Casting aside any hesitation about an aggressive interest rate cut , investors sent stocks soaring to their highest gains in five years on Tuesday as shares of financial firms surged in the hopes that the Federal Reserve has finally taken hold of the credit crisis .
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 420 points .
The surge began at the opening bell after two big investment banks , Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs , delivered stronger - than - expected earnings .
It faltered only briefly after the Fed ’s announcement in the afternoon that it would cut its benchmark interest rate by three - quarters of a point , with the Dow tacking on nearly 300 points in the final hour and a half .
At the end of trading , the Dow was at 12,392.66 , a gain of 420.41 points , or 3.51 percent .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index advanced 4.24 percent , its best performance since October 2002 .
It was up 54.14 points , to 1,330.74 .

A juvenile fan of the video game Halo 3 is accused of punching his mother after she forced him to end his game Sunday night and fighting with sheriff ’s deputies as they tried to restrain him , according to reports released Wednesday .
Indian River County Sheriff ’s Deputy Sean Harnage reported responding to the family ’s home at about 11:30 p.m.
Sunday in reference to an “ out - of - control child . ”
The parents told deputies their son was playing Halo 3 , and it was getting late and he needed to shut it off .
When the son refused to turn off the game , the parents reportedly took the air card out of his machine so he could n’t play anymore .
Reports show the son became enraged , went through the house looking for the air card , and then punched his mother , prompting the parents to call the Sheriff ’s Office .
After the boy retreated to his bedroom and locked it , the mother knocked on the door and told him he needed to come out and talk to the deputies , the report stated .
But the juvenile allegedly responded with profanity .
Harnage and another deputy entered the room using a key from the parents to arrest the son , according to the report .
The son fought the deputies - at one time punching Harnage on the lip - until they handcuffed him .
He was later turned over to state juvenile authorities on charges of battery - domestic violence and battery on a law - enforcement officer .
The son ’s and parents ’ names are being withheld because of the juvenile ’s age .

India is now viewed as a very risky market , notwithstanding the robust economic growth prospects , moderate inflation and strong currency .
The sensex declined 8.3 % over the past one month ending March 7 , while DJIA declined by 2.4 % only .
But while almost all emerging markets have crashed , Brazil���s benchmark index Bovespa continues to outperform DJIA ; the index rose 4.7 % over the same period , demonstrating signs of decoupling .
One reason for the contrarian behaviour of the Brazilian market could be the significantly high weight for natural resources companies ��� metals and petroleum ��� on the 64 - member Bovespa .
The sell - off in global markets , triggered by the subprime crisis in the United States , is an exercise in risk aversion on the part of investors .
That begs the question as to why India is seen as a riskier market than the US or Brazil .
Of the three , India is projected to expand the most ; the IMF estimates that India will grow by 8.4 % in 2008 while Brazil may expand by 4.1 % and the US by 1.9 % .
Inflation in both countries is displaying similar trends ; rising again after moderating over the course of the past year .
Again , the global slowdown would hurt both countries ��� while Brazil would see export growth for commodities slow down , India���s manufactured merchandise and services trade are likely to see further moderation .
A minor deceleration notwithstanding , India���s growth story remains intact .
The largely investment - led growth is a reflection of the expectation that domestic consumption is likely to remain robust in the years ahead .
The deep correction in the market that began early January has made valuations of blue - chips very attractive .
There is no reason why Indian markets should continue to track the US or Japanese markets ; the US is said to be already in recession and Japan too is getting close to one .
It is time investors considered the fundamentals of the Indian economy and the strength of corporate earnings .
Institutional investors , particularly mutual funds , need to play a pivotal role in reposing their faith in Indian stocks .
And that is essential if India , like Brazil , has to begin decoupling from the developments in the advanced markets .
A majority of Iraqis expressed confidence in the police
The poll for the BBC , ABC , ARD and NHK of more than 2,000 people also suggests that a majority believe that security in their area has improved since 2007 .
And while most Iraqis still believe US troops are making things worse , the number who want the Americans to pull out immediately has fallen .
But the poll also shows Iraq 's main ethnic groups are deeply divided .
BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson says the continuing divisions make it " pretty meaningless to talk about ' Iraqi ' opinion . "
" What counts is how the individual groupings , Sunni , Shia and Kurdish , feel - and especially the Sunnis , since much of the violence is from that quarter , " he says .
While 55 % of all Iraqis believe that their lives are good , only 33 % of Sunnis are happy with their lives , compared with 62 % of Shias and 73 % of Kurds .
" In spite of all the improvements , the Sunni population of Iraq clearly remains deeply alienated , and deeply hostile , " our correspondent says .
Some 62 % of those polled say security in their own area is good - up from 43 % last year - but exactly half of all Iraqis still rate security as the biggest problem for the country overall .
And Iraqis are still reporting problems with the provision of basic services .
HAVE YOUR SAY Iraqis are never going to get control of their country back if organisations keep telling them what to do Lisa , Cardiff
Large majorities of Iraqis - 88 % , 81 % and 61 % respectively - say that the availability of water , fuel and electricity is " very bad " or " quite bad " .
These results echo the findings of a Red Cross report on the humanitarian situation in Iraq .
The Red Cross found that millions of Iraqis have little or no access to clean water , sanitation and healthcare , with some families spending a third of their average monthly wage of $ 150 ( £ 75 ) just buying clean water .
And Iraqi public hospitals provide only 30,000 beds , less than half of the 80,000 needed , the report says .
Next month , the top US commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , will testify before the US Congress about progress in Iraq since the beginning of the " surge " , when 30,000 extra troops were sent to the country .
One of the stated aims of the surge was to provide enough security to allow Iraqi politicians to hammer out a lasting political settlement .
More Iraqis now feel confident about the government
The poll suggests that Iraqis are sceptical about political progress .
Only 21 % believe that the increase in US forces has made conditions for political dialogue in Iraq better , while 43 % think the surge has made conditions worse .
And 38 % want American forces to leave immediately , compared with 35 % who want the troops to remain until security has been restored .
' Holding together '
The survey suggests that support for the Iraqi government is returning , after a drop - off in recent years .
Just under 50 % of Iraqis now have confidence in the government , up from 39 % in March 2007 .
" Iraq seems to be holding together as a country .
Overwhelming numbers of both Sunnis and the Shia still want it to remain a unified nation , " says John Simpson .
" By comparison the Kurds are the splitters .
Only 10 % of them want to keep the country together . "
Support for Iraqi security forces remains high , with 67 % expressing confidence in the police and 65 % in the army .
In contrast , public confidence in local militias has fallen since last year .
In March 2007 it stood at 36 % , by August it was down to 24 % , and it has fallen another 2 % since then , to 22 % .
Within that , Shia feelings about local militias has fallen the most steeply .
In March 2007 , 51 % of Shias had confidence in militias - now that figure has declined to 28 % , the survey suggests .
The poll is the fifth such survey to be conducted since the beginning of the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The survey was conducted by D3 Systems and KA Research Ltd for the BBC , ABC News , NHK of Japan and ARD of Germany .
More than 2000 Iraqis were questioned across all the provinces of Iraq between February 12 and 20 , 2008 .
The margin of error is +/- 2.5 % .
Viktor 's amazing 4 - bit processor
Beware of programmers who carry screwdrivers .
- Leonard Brandwein
I 've been a software guy all my life .
However , I was always fascinated by electronics , and part of my success as a programmer was due to my thorough understanding of how computers work .
Back in 1999 , I put that understanding to the ultimate test : I actually designed , and built , a simple but functional 4 - bit computer from low - level electronic components ( TTL logic gates . )
Although this machine has less than one tenth of a percent of the speed and one millionth of the memory of a modern Pentium system , not to mention that its " user interface " is just a set of miniature switches and blinking LED lights , I still consider this a proud accomplishment .
If you are interested , you can study a full description of this system , including logic diagrams and more .
Or , if you just want an overview , here 's a photo and , to demonstrate the programming model of this processor , a small program that multiplies two 4 - bit numbers to obtain an 8 - bit result :
00 : F CLF ; Initialize 01 : 7 0 0 AND 00 ; Load 0 to accumulator 04 : 2 E F STA FE ; Set #FE to 0 07 : 1 C F LDA FC ; Load first argument 0A : 5 F 0 AND 0F ; Take low nybble 0D : 2 A F STA FA ; Store at working storage 10 : 1 D F LDA FD ; Load second argument 13 : 5 F 0 AND 0F ; Take low nybble 16 : 2 9 2 STA 29 ; Store as argument to ADD instruction 19 : 1 A F LDA FA ; Load first argument 1C : F CLF ; 1D : E ROR ; Take one bit 1E : 2 A F STA FA ; Store the rest 21 : C E 2 JNC 2E ; If not 1 , no need to add 24 : 1 E F LDA FE ; Load result 27 : F CLF ; 28 : 7 0 0 ADD 00 ; Add second argument ( stored here ) 2B : 2 E F STA FE ; Store result 2E : 1 9 2 LDA 29 ; Load second argument 31 : F CLF ; Multiply by 2 32 : D ROL ; 33 : 2 9 2 STA 29 ; Store 36 : 1 A F LDA FA ; Reload first 39 : F CLF ; 3C : 7 0 0 ADD 00 ; Check for 0 3D : 9 D 1 JNZ 1D ; Repeat loop if necessary 40 : 0 HLT ; Result obtained 41 : 3 0 0 JMP 00 ; Restart FA : 0 0 ; Working storage FC : 3 5 ; Operands FE : 0 0 ; Result
Complex floating point algorithms , such as that of the Gamma function ( my favorite programming example for programmable calculators ) are probably forever beyond the capabilities of this beast ; you 're not going to implement a floating point library in a mere 256 nybbles !
It is , however , possible to implement a simple factorial program , and surprisingly , it does n't even require the use of a multiplication subroutine .
It makes efficient use of repeated additions instead .
This implementation calculates an 8 - bit result , so the highest number it accepts as its argument is 5 , but it still demonstrates a neat solution .
After entering the program , its argument must also be entered at address FE - FF ; the 1 - byte ( 2 - nybble ) result can be read from FC - FD .
00 : 1 E F LDA FE ; Move FE to FC ( argument in FE ) 03 : 2 C F STA FC 06 : 1 C F L1 : LDA FC ; Move FC to 35 09 : 2 5 3 STA L5+1 0C : 1 E F LDA FE ; Decrement FE 0F : F CLF 10 : 8 1 0 SUB 01 13 : 9 A 1 JNZ L3 ; If FE==0 END 16 : 0 HLT ; ( result is in FC ) 17 : 3 6 1 L0 : JMP L0 1A : 2 E F L3 : STA FE 1D : 2 A F STA FA ; Move FE to FA 20 : 1 A F L2 : LDA FA ; Decrement FA 23 : F CLF 24 : 8 1 0 SUB 01 27 : 9 D 2 JNZ L4 ; If FA==0 goto L1 2A : 3 6 0 JMP L1 2D : 2 A F L4 : STA FA 30 : 1 C F LDA FC ; FC=FC+35 33 : F CLF 34 : 7 0 0 L5 : ADD 00 37 : 2 C F STA FC 3A : 3 0 2 JMP L2 ; LOOP

Best Buy has always earned my disdain with their retail price mentality .
But now , the NYT is reporting that the mega chain and Circuit City have both told sales associates that a little haggling to get the sale done is fine .
People in the company are saying this is not new .
But I 'm sure many do n't know about it , so it is to consumers .
Translation : Before you buy , bitch about the prices , Chinatown style .

Some chains , esp in the NY area , have always embraced such methods .
But with internet shopping making price comparisons and deal finding easier than ever , the retail brick and mortars are making back room policies like this one to stay competitive .
[ NYT ]
From a tipster who presumably works at a megachain :
Remember how Mark Mathis , producer of “ Expelled ” , kept going on about how the “ Crossroads ” / Rampant Films thing was what they had in mind while interviewing Richard Dawkins , PZ Myers , Eugenie Scott , and others , then they decided to chuck all that and go with the “ Expelled ” concept ?
It seems that Mathis should have had a session with Ben Stein so that they could make their stories match .
Stein was interviewed by the New York Sun and by the WORLD magazine , and there are several interesting things about the content of his responses .
One of the things that has dogged Mathis is the fact that the “ expelledthemovie.com ” domain was registered at the beginning of March , 2007 , about a month earlier than the invitations for interviews went out to Eugenie Scott and PZ Myers .
No similar domain seems to have been registered by Mathis for the alleged “ Crossroads ” concept .
Ben Stein adds another piece to the burgeoning chronological evidence stack that argues against taking Mathis at his word .
When did Ben Stein get the word that he’d be the front - man for an attack piece ?
According the WORLD interview , that would be sometime in 2006 :
WORLD : How did you get involved with Expelled ?
STEIN : I was approached a couple of years ago by the producers , and they described to me the central issue of Expelled , which was about Darwinism and why it has such a lock on the academic establishment when the theory has so many holes .
And why freedom of speech has been lost at so many colleges to the point where you ca n’t question even the slightest bit of Darwinism or your colleagues will spurn you , you ’ll lose your job , and you ’ll be publicly humiliated .
As they sent me books and talked to me about these things I became more enthusiastic about participating .
Plus I was never a big fan of Darwinism because it played such a large part in the Nazis ’ Final Solution to their so - called “ Jewish problem ” and was so clearly instrumental in their rationalizing of the Holocaust .
So I was primed to want to do a project on how Darwinism relates to fascism and to outline the flaws in Darwinism generally .
Emphasis added .
So , starting sometime in 2006 , Mathis or his fellow producers were engaging Ben Stein with precisely the concept of “ Expelled ” .
There is no mention by Stein of any such thing as “ Crossroads ” or of being intrigued by the “ Crossroads ” concept .
And Stein in the New York Sun interview contributes a little something extra to the discussion over the animation used by the “ Expelled ” project .
Mr. Stein became involved with the film when he was approached by Messrs .
Ruloff and Sullivan during pre-production .
“ They sent me an absolute torrent of information , some of which I read , some of which frankly I did not read , ” Mr. Stein said .
Intrigued by what he did absorb and by a segment of computer animation commissioned by the producers that depicts life at a cellular level in its nearly infinite complexity , Mr. Stein signed on .
“ It just became a gigantically bigger project than I even had the slightest clue it was going to be , ” he said .
So part of what brought Ben Stein aboard the project was being shown an animation of processes occurring inside the cell … a couple of years ago , if Stein ’s statements are in any way consistent .
( Hint to Mark Mathis : you can argue for your version of the past by attacking Stein ’s credibility in recall of when he was approached for this project . )
Now , the whole flap over unauthorized use of the Harvard / XVIVO “ Inner Life of the Cell ” video did n’t get going until around September , 2007 , when IDC advocate William Dembski ’s lecture in Oklahoma revealed its use there to people who recognized the source of the animation .
It was shortly after Dembski was hit with cease - and - desist requests that the projected release date of “ Expelled ” was shifted from around February 12th to April 18th , apparently to give time for the copycat animation to be made and edited in to “ Expelled ” .
So essentially the New York Sun gave these folks a pass when they reported ,
Intrigued by what he did absorb and by a segment of computer animation commissioned by the producers that depicts life at a cellular level in its nearly infinite complexity
There is no evidence that the producers had commissioned any such animation at the time that Ben Stein was recruited .
It appears that the “ Expelled ” producers were using the Harvard / XVIVO product , “ Inner Life of the Cell ” , as a recruiting tool for their project .
There is evidence that the copycat animation was only “ commissioned ” relatively recently , certainly long after Ben Stein was signed on to the project .

Memo Contends That President Can Authorize Torture
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK — A secret memo authored by the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) asserting that President Bush has unlimited power to order brutal interrogations to extract information from detainees was declassified today as a result of an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit .
The memo , written by John Yoo , then a deputy at the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , was sent to the Defense Department in March 2003 .
" Senior officials at the Justice Department gave the Pentagon the green light to torture prisoners , " said Amrit Singh , an ACLU staff attorney .
" It is outrageous that none of these high - level officials have been brought to task yet for their role in authorizing prisoner abuse . "
A similar OLC memo asserting the same kind of unchecked executive authority was sent to the CIA in August 2002 .
In that now - notorious document , torture was defined so narrowly that it encompassed only those methods that result in pain akin to that associated with " death , organ failure or the permanent impairment of a significant body function . "
In many respects , the March 2003 memo released today parrots the advice previously given to the CIA .
In other ways , however , the 2003 memo goes even further .
For example , it argues — without any qualification — that , during wartime , the president 's Commander - in - Chief power overrides the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment .
" The memo shows that the same disgraceful legal analysis that was at the root of the CIA 's illegal interrogation program was also at the root of the Defense Department 's program , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The memo takes an extremely broad view of the president 's power as Commander - in - Chief .
If you believe this memo , there is no limit at all to the kinds of interrogation methods the President can authorize . "
In the memo released today , Yoo writes : " If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network . "
The memo goes on to say , " In that case , we believe that he could argue that the executive branch 's constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . "
The memo was declassified in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU , the New York Civil Liberties Union , and other organizations in June 2004 to enforce Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests for records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
The ACLU has been fighting for the release of the March 2003
Yoo memo since filing the lawsuit .
A few weeks ago , after the court ordered additional briefing on whether the Defense Department could continue to withhold the memo , the government reluctantly agreed to conduct a declassification review by March 31 .
The Defense Department released this memo after conducting the review .
The March 2003
Yoo memo also sheds considerable light on the development of interrogation methods for use at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere .
In a recently published book , Administration of Torture , ACLU attorneys Jaffer and Singh explain that , in early 2003 , a Defense Department working group convened by then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was supplied with the March 2003
Yoo memo and told that it should regard the memo as " definitive guidance . "
Relying on the Yoo memo , the working group ultimately endorsed a slew of harsh interrogation methods , some of which violated U.S. and international law .
Secretary Rumsfeld relied on the working group memo to authorize a new interrogation directive for use at Guantánamo Bay .
General Geoffrey Miller , who was in charge of Guantánamo , was later sent to Iraq to encourage the adoption of abusive methods there .
The Yoo memo can be found online at :
www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/34745res20030314.html
In Administration of Torture , Jaffer and Singh write that interrogation practices sanctioned at the highest levels of the Bush administration led to the system abuse and torture of prisoners in U.S. custody .
More information about the book is available online at :
www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's FOIA lawsuit .
The ACLU has been posting these documents online at :
www.aclu.org/torturefoia
Attorneys in the FOIA case are Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons , P.C. ; Jaffer , Singh and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
Martin Klimas destroys a lot of clay to make his art .
Combining the silence of Eadweard Muybridge ’s horse pictures with the association - rich composition of a still life , Klimas breaks recognizable objects so they become something else , and stops us just at the moment of transformation .
Klimas was born in 1971 in Singen , Germany .

Take us a few steps into your process — I assume producing these images requires an extraordinarily controlled environment ?
Yes , the shooting environment must be controlled and kept consistent .
The lighting is clear and direct , head on .
My background is neutral , but bright enough so that the shattering object completely stands out .
I drop the figurine from the same height in complete darkness while the lens of the camera is open .
When the figurine hits the ground , the sound triggers the lights to go off for a fraction of a second .
I do this procedure many times or until I find the one frame that is just right .
I keep just one such picture for every figurine .
Every attempt yields a unique outcome , so I need to look for the one that best expresses a transformation of the figurine into a new form .
The degree of stillness in your pictures is remarkable , to the point of it being the first thing I notice , followed by the recognition that these objects are being blown apart .
Are you trying to convey something at rest or something in motion ?
In my pictures you see the world through the eye of a high - speed camera .
This way of seeing provides for us something that we normally cannot see , this moment of transformation can really only be imagined by us .
I provide a way for us to see this action differently .
It is an in - between state .
A state where rest and motion can exist together .
I hope this situation can be applied and give us thought in our everyday world .
I wonder , when you look at your own finished work , do you see what you ’ve just destroyed , or what you ’ve made from the transformation ?
The aspect of destroying is not the most important one in my work .
Let ’s say it is a catalyst to unleash and study this transformation .
The hardest part of my work is to smash so many figurines until I find one that truly is showing me something new .
I am in that sense a sculptor , but I have only a 5000th of a second to build my sculpture .
When looking at your work I think of Jackson Pollock , for the sureness of the line , and also some Impressionists , for the composition of a still life .
How much of what results in your pictures is by chance and how much by design ?
When you mean the concept of automating the process of working and only to install a set way that produces the pictures —yes , that is comparable to Pollock .
But my big teachers are Eadweard Muybridge and Harold Edgerton .
The part “ by chance , ” it is a real photographic image because there is not manipulation in it and it shows a singular moment .
The “ design ” part is the selection , the size of printing , the colors and the framing .
Anything prior to that is left up to chance .
What are you working on now ?
You have to wait but I will see it soon .
An aircraft prepares to land at Heathrow airport in London March 11 , 2008 .

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - Flybe has given the term low - fare airline an entirely new meaning : it is paying 172 people to fly back and forth across England and the Irish Sea to help it meet a target for passenger numbers at Norwich airport .
Flybe was narrowly falling short of a target to deliver at least 15,000 passengers on the Dublin - Norwich route in the 12 months ending on Monday , which meant it would have to forego a 280,000 pound ( $ 550,000 ) rebate from the airport .
After the airport rejected a request for a partial rebate for almost hitting the target , Flybe hired 172 temps for 30 - 40 pounds each , plus a free bar and in - flight entertainment , though it admitted “ it probably sounds like an early April fool . ”
But Richard Jenner , managing director of the airport in eastern England , called the British carrier ’s move “ ludicrous ” and said the target had to be met by regular fare - paying passengers .
“ The ludicrousness is on the Norwich side who in essence have tried to hold us to ransom , putting at risk routes into Norwich , ” Flybe Chief Commercial Officer Mike Rutter replied in a joint interview with Jenner on Irish public broadcaster RTE .
On the streets of Miami , Luis Posada Carriles might look like just one of the dozens of nice , elderly Cuban gentlemen who gather outside the Versailles Restaurant for a strong cup of java .
But there is nothing nice or gentle about Posada Carriles .
For starters , he is responsible for the 1976 downing of a Cuban passenger plane with 73 people on board - the first act of aviation terrorism in the Western hemisphere .
In 1997 he orchestrated the bombing of hotels in Havana that resulted in the death of Italian businessman Fabio Di Celmo .
In 2000 he was arrested , and later convicted , in Panama for plotting to assassinate Fidel Castro by blowing up an auditorium full of students .
On a recent trip to Venezuela , I learned of his sordid history of torturing and assassinating suspected leftists when he worked for the Venezuelan secret police .
Jesus Marrero , a student leader in 1973 , painfully recounted how Posada Carriles supervised his torture , including electrodes to his penis .
Brenda Esquivel , captured when she was 8 - months pregnant , says Posada ordered his men to “ destroy the seed before it was born ” –kicking her so brutally that the baby died in her womb .
Her sister Marlene , who was imprisoned with her 20 - day - old baby , was forced to watch as Posada ’s agents burned her baby with cigarettes .
The U.S. Justice Department has called Posada “ an unrepentant criminal and admitted mastermind of terrorist plots and attacks . ” When he was being held in a U.S. immigration detention center in 2005 for having sneaked into the country with a false passport , the Department of Homeland Security said that due to his long history of criminal activity and violence , his release from detention would “ pose a danger to both the community and the national security of the United States . ”
So why , then , does Luis Posada Carriles live freely in Miami , eating lechón asado at the Versailles Restaurant , socializing at the Big Five Club , exhibiting his paintings at the Miami Art Museum ?
Why is n’t he behind bars ?
That ’s the question that was on our mind when six of us from the women ’s peace group CODEPINK went to Miami on January 12 to launch a campaign calling for Posada ’s arrest .
Armed simply with postcards and a banner asking the FBI to put him on the most - wanted list , we were attacked by a violent mob of Posada supporters as our vehicle moved along Calle Ocho in the heart of Miami ’s Little Havana .
The next day we were pelted with eggs and water bottles .
Appearing on a Spanish - language TV program , I was told by fellow panelist Enrique Encinosa that I was “ an enemy of the Cuban - American community ” and that I should n’t be surprised if someone cracked my head open like a coconut .
Posada Carriles and his violent followers who impose their views in Miami through fear and intimidation are relics of the sordid history of U.S. policy in Latin America .
Just as in the anti-Soviet efforts in Afghanistan where the U.S. government nurtured the Mujahadeen “ freedom fighters ” who fought the Soviets , so it trained , financed and provided shelter to those fighting left - leaning governments in this hemisphere , even democratically elected ones .
Posada was trained by the U.S. Army and worked as an operative and asset of the CIA from 1960 to 1976 .
“ The C.I.A. taught us everything .
They taught us explosives , how to kill , bomb , trained us in acts of sabotage , ” Mr. Posada told New York Times reporter Ann Louise Bardach in 1998 .
“ Now they call it terrorism , ” he added .
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’s famous remark about Nicaraguan dictator Somoza - ” he may be a son of a bitch , but he ’s our son of a bitch ” - seems to apply to Posada Carriles .
Indeed , Posada Carriles may be “ our terrorist , ” but allowing him to live freely in Miami makes a mockery of the war on terror .
On February 8 - 10 , CODEPINK ’s anti-terrorist team will return to Miami .
We will distribute cards calling for Posada ’s arrest , show a documentary film on this man ’s violent history , and ask locally elected leaders to join us in calling for Posada to be extradited to Venezuela , where he is wanted on 73 counts of homicide , or detained and prosecuted here in the United States .
Unlike our last visit when the Miami police failed to protect us , this time - having ample warning –we expect the police to guarantee our constitutional right to free speech and free assembly .
Vice President Dick Cheney said that “ Any person or government that supports , protects , or harbors terrorists is complicit in the murder of the innocent . ”
President Bush has repeatedly stated that “ we will not rest until we eliminate the terrorists and rout them out . ”
We understand that some members of Miami ’s Cuban - American community consider Posada Carriles a hero for his anti-communist actions .
But no cause is so noble that it justifies killing civilians .
There is no such thing as good terrorism .
It is time for some moral consistency in this war on terror .
Whether Osama bin Laden or Posada Carriles , we must bring all terrorists to justice .

The planned piece , six weeks in the making , alleges that McCain gave special treatment to a lady lobbyist over pending telecom legislation .
" Rutenberg had hoped to break the story before the Christmas holiday , sources reveal , but editor Keller expressed serious reservations about jounalism [ sic ] ethics and issuing a damaging story so close to an election , " Drudge says .

Hagel : Republican Party hijacked by incompetence Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz
Published : Saturday September 15 , 2007
Print This Email This Bill Maher recently sat down with outgoing Nebraska GOP Senator Chuck Hagel to discuss Iraq , his departure and the fate of the Republican Party .
Maher asks : " Did you decide not to run for President because you just saw that a ( sic ) anti-war Republican could never get the nomination ? "
" No , " responds Hagel , " I was actually looking for some honest work . "
The Republicans , says Hagel , are a party going through a time of " transformation " during a time when the country is struggling with the situation in Iraq .
On the subject of GOP candidates continuing to support what Maher considers to be an unwinnable war , Sen. John McCain in particular , Hagel cites McCain's " charm . "
" The difference between John McCain and I on the war is very clear : We disagree on that point . "
On the prospect of the United States winding down from Iraq , Hagel predicts a " very high toll " taken on the country for a long time ahead .
Adds Hagel , " And I think that 's wrong . "
Maher segues into Iran : " In the speech President Bush gave last night , I noticed that he slipped Iran into the middle of it .
He said 'we have to defeat al Qaeda , counter Iran , and help the Afghan government . ' "
Citing a Times of London article that shows preliminary plans to attack over a thousand targets in Iran , Maher implores the Senator : " Please tell me that Congress does have the power to stop President Godzilla if he decides to stomp on one more country , and that he could not get away with that . "
" As you all know we are at war in two countries , and not doing particularly well in either war , and I 'm not sure the American people are about ready to go to a third war . "
" If the President is inching toward a military confrontation with Iran , then I do think that is where the Congress of the United States draws the line . "
The Middle East is too volatile for a purely military offensive , says Hagel .
Iran is a threat , he says , but it needs to be dealt with strategically and diplomatically .
" I 've heard a lot of Republicans in the last year or so say ' I want my party back , ' " says Maher .
" I imagine you 're somewhat in the same camp .
Do you think the Republican party has been hijacked by incompetents and religious fanatics ? "
" Oh , I think it 's been hijacked by incompetency , " Hagel concedes .
" I think that 's what has driven the Republican Party right off the cliff , and we are not who we say we are . "
" We 've run up the biggest budget debt since FDR , and he had an excuse , and that was the World War and a depression . "

Of all the illegal and dishonest misadventures that the Bush Administration got away with , the least criticized of all might be the 2004 overthrow of Haiti ’s democratically - elected government .
Even human rights groups and left - leaning press that stood up against the Iraq war gave , and still give , Bush a pass on the horror he unleashed on Haiti by kidnapping President Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
Peter Hallward ’s new book Damming the Flood : Haiti , Aristide and the Politics of Containment is a welcome corrective to the false impressions and historical amnesia about Haiti afflicting most of the English - speaking world .
Jonathan Kozol called it , “ A brilliant politically sophisticated and morally infuriating work on a shameful piece of very recent history that the U.S. press has either distorted or ignored .
The most important and devastating book I ’ve read on American betrayal of democracy in one of the most tormented nations in the world . ”
Hallward , a UK - based philosophy professor , was teaching a course in 2003 which involved daily reading of Le Monde and other French newspapers when he noted a systematic demonization of President Jean - Bertrand Aristide and his Lavalas movement .
He subsequently wrote one of the best long articles about the 2004 coup ( “ Option Zero in Haiti , ” New Left Review 27 , May - June 2004 ) shortly after it happened .
Ever since , he seems to have been collecting information for a bill of indictment against the U.S. , France and Canada , the coup ’s principle backers , ever since .
In the process he has also put together a damning critique of liberals and self - described radicals who either through intellectual laziness or lack of cross-class solidarity accepted Bush - approved PR on Haiti .
In his research , Hallward used mostly public sources .
He appears to have read everything written about Haiti in the past ten years , as well as much earlier work .
Interviews with principles ranging from Aristide to several key coup players , and both pro- and anti-Aristide figures , buttress his scholarship .
Hallward puts the country ’s recent violence in the context of 200 years of “ great power ” hostility toward Haitian sovereignty , beginning with the 1804 revolution , the only successful slave revolt in world history .
Hallward excels at showing the means by which Haiti ’s ultra-rich minority worked hand in glove with right - wingers in Washington and Paris to create a case for “ regime change ” that even Iraq war opponents could embrace .
After the first U.S. - backed coup against Aristide in 1991 , when public opinion in the U.S. was still largely sympathetic to Lavalas , Hallward notes , “ Jesse Helms spoke for much of the US political establishment when on 20 October 1993 he denounced Aristide as a ‘ psychopath and grave human rights abuser . ’”
But “ neither Helms nor anyone else could pin a single political killing on the 1991 [ Aristide ] administration .
In the run up to the second coup , incomparably more insistent versions of the same charge would resurface at every turn . ”
As Hallward painstakingly shows , left of center and liberal NGOs were all too willing to accept Washington ’s destabilization program for Haiti .
The smears and propaganda were well - funded and carried out in concert with “ Democracy Enhancement ” and similar programs of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and other U.S. government agencies .
The project recalled what the U.S. did to Nicaragua in the 1980s , as documented by political scientist William Robinson in his excellent study A Faustian Bargain .
Hallward notes that when it comes to “ the supervision of human rights in the most heavily exploited parts of the planet … most of the ‘ neutral , ’ affluent and well - connected supervisors live at an immeasurable distance from the world endured by the people they supervise , and at a still greater distance from the sort of militant , unabashedly political mobilization that can alone offer any meaningful protection for truly universal rights . ”
The helps explain the ease with which Human Rights Watch took anti-Aristide propaganda at face value , then dragged their feet interminably ( as did Amnesty International ) when Aristide ’s government was ousted and the rightist bloodbath began in earnest .
Hallward carefully wades through the accusations of human rights violations leveled at Aristide ’s government .
After an exhaustive examination , he can find no evidence that holds up .
In many cases , he finds that the supposed abuses themselves were greatly exaggerated , if not entirely fabricated .
Damming the Flood ( lavalas means “ flood ” in Haitian Kreyol ) is brilliantly written and extremely thorough in examining the players behind the 2004 assault on Haitian popular democracy and its horrific aftermath .
In the wake of the thousands killed and countless more tortured and raped , it is inevitable that many readers not versed in Haiti ’s past would ask :
Why ?
Hallward does a fine job of answering that question , addressing fundamental structural injustices enforced by U.S. foreign policy .
Aristide emerged as a priest in the tradition of liberation theology , which promotes a “ preferential option for the poor . ”
In Hallward ’s words : “ All through the 1980s and early 90s [ U.S. army intelligence officers ] recognized that ‘ the most serious threat to U.S. interests was not secular Marxist - Leninism or organized labor but liberation theology . ’
Nowhere did the counter - insurgency measures that the US and its allies devised in order to deal with liberation theology in the 1980s and early 90s fall more heavily than they did on the Haiti of Lavalas and the ti legliz ( “ little church ” movement ) .
It ’s no coincidence that the most notorious assassin hired to terrorize Lavalas from 1990 to 1994 , Emmanuel “ Toto ” Constant , first began working for the CIA on a course designed to explain and contain the “ extreme left - wing ” implications of “ The Theology of Liberation , ” which Constant understood as an attempt ‘ to convince the people that in the name of God everything is possible ” and that , therefore , it was right for the people to kill soldiers and the rich . ’”
Hallward continues , “ Haiti is the only country in Latin America that had the temerity to choose a liberation theologian as its president — twice .
If Aristide still remains the defining political figure in Haiti to this day it ’s not because he represents a utopian alternative to the economic status quo , or because he embodies a demagogic charisma that threatens to stifle the development of democracy , or because his followers believe that he made no strategic mistakes .
It ’s because in the eyes of most people he is not a politician , precisely , but an organizer and an activist who remains dedicated to working within what he famously affirmed as ‘ the parish of the poor . ’
It was as such an activist that Aristide disbanded the army in 1995 , and it was as such an organizer that he dedicated the rest of his political life to helping the popular mobilization deal with the new threats and the old antagonisms that soon emerged as a result . ”
The priest turned president threatened to help Haiti ’s poor enough to earn the eternal enmity of the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and both Republicans and Democrats .
His government was denied much - needed international funds ( which in a more sane world would be reparations for past injustices , not loans or aid - with - strings - attached ) , and his poor followers demonized as chimeres , or “ devils . ”
Instead of looking at the structural roots of the exploitation and ecological devastation to which the country has been subjected , foreign journalists took their sound bites from English or French speaking elites at odds with Lavalas ’s commendable , and only moderately leftist , goal to raise the poor “ from misery to poverty with dignity . ”
The scant media coverage of Haiti that exists tends to continue centuries - old patterns of ignoring the perspectives of the poor majority .
In Hallward ’s words , what most English speakers get instead is repetition of “ perhaps the most consistent theme of the profoundly racist first - world commentary on the island : that poor non-white people remain incapable of governing themselves . ”
Though the UN “ peacekeeping ” mission , put in place in 2004 to legitimize the most recent coup , remains in Haiti , Hallward points to ongoing resistance from the poorest neighborhoods as evidence that the story is not over .
While coup forces continue to dominate most ministries of the current government , the 2006 presidential election resulting in Haiti ’s rulers conceding victory to Aristide ’s former Prime Minster Rene Preval shows the unavoidability of some concessions to pressure from the poor majority .
For those who feel a debt to the people of Haiti for inspiring resistance to U.S. slavery , and for setting an example of the true potential of declarations of liberty espoused by the French Revolution , this book is an essential resource .
Damming the Flood will inspire international activists to support the struggles of those Haitians who continue to stand up for their fundamental human rights .
It should be widely read .
A caucus - goer writes :
It 's almost 4 AM Iowa time .
I got home from the Jefferson - Jackson dinner and tuned in C - SPAN to watch it replayed .
A couple of things were clear to anyone in the hall that did not translate to C - SPAN .
1 . The notion that Hillary is a candidate shooting for 50.1 % never seemed fair to me ... until tonight .
The speech tonight was held in the center of an arena .
Every candidate purchased certain sections and seated their supporters .
When they spoke they 'd give the occasional nod to their supporter sections .
Hillary addressed ONLY her sections .
I was seated on the opposite side and all I saw was her back .
She 's in an arena with 9,000 supporters but 95 % of the time she was facing one direction .
2. Obama made the most dramatic speech and he certainly had the most supporters .
BUT , it was noteworthy that by the time he spoke many of his fans in the balcony cheap seats had left .
Does it mean something that so many of them left ?
Will they flake off as Dean supporters did 4 years ago ?
I am one of the undecided Democrats in Iowa .
Nothing tonight swayed me to a candidate .
I was close to sealing the deal with Hillary but her polarizing performance tonight reaffirms too much that you have written about her .
About 45 people were also injured in the incident , police officials said .
A police spokesman told the BBC that the blast happened near an Iraqi army checkpoint in the market town , which is north of the capital , Baghdad .
The blast was reported as US Defence Secretary Robert Gates arrived in Baghdad for talks with US military leaders and Iraqi government officials .
The explosion was caused by a suicide bomber driving a pick - up truck laden with six barrels of explosives , Iraqi police told the BBC .
He blew himself up near a checkpoint manned jointly by Iraqi security forces and local guards recruited to join the drive against al - Qaeda and other radical groups .
" It was a suicide car bomber .
The attack took place at 1630 ( 1330 GMT ) when the market was very busy , " Colonel Issa Ayan , a police official in Salaheddin province , told the AFP news agency .
Some buildings have collapsed and people have been reported missing since the explosion , he said , adding that the death toll may rise as bodies are uncovered from the rubble .
Some reports put the number of dead at 33 .
High - level visit
Mr Gates is in Baghdad for talks on US troop levels in the light of what the US sees as the improving security situation in Iraq .
Mr Gates is in Baghdad to meet with Iraqi and US officials
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad said he is likely to be told that the surge in US troop numbers is paying dividends , with all the indicators of violence and its victims generally down but that sustained military , political and economic effort is needed .
Mr Gates will also start talks on a pact to define the future relationship between Baghdad and Washington .
Mr Gates told reporters travelling with him on the plane from Germany to Baghdad that Iraq 's political leaders are making progress towards reconciliation .
" They seem to have become energised over the last few weeks , " he said , adding that he wants to see " what the prospects are for further success in the next couple of months " .
After arriving in Baghdad , he went into a meeting with Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , the top US commander in Iraq General David Petraeus and American ambassador Ryan Crocker .
US officials attribute improved security to the growth of neighbourhood police units and say basic service provision should get better as the security situation improves .
" What 's necessary to come behind security ... are essential services ... part of that is through the central government 's distribution of funds into the provinces , " US military spokesman Rear Admiral Greg Smith told Reuters news agency .
If you 've ever seen the movie " Airplane " , you might recall a scene in which the jet is being shaken up by turbulence .
The camera zooms in on two mounds of Jello on a plate jiggling like crazy , then pans up to a well - endowed lady 's , erm , endowments jiggling similarly .
It was a funny gag , but we would n't expect the Jello people to start packaging their pudding with the same association .
And they would n't expect us to expect it , either .
Japan is another story , however , and these preposterous puddings come from the land where anything goes .
The packaging is both complex and creative , requiring lots of unfolding and opening - I 'm somewhat surprised buttons or clasps are n't involved .
But I digress ... the point being that someone put a lot of thought into the entire wacky concept .
Thanks to RUKZ.com for these images , by the way !
It 's also curious that a conscious effort was made to provide variety among the various " girls " whose bared bosoms are displayed so brazenly .
Why the blonde , European - looking lady 's are oddly squared - off is beyond me - but hey , Western society has had its own misconceptions about Eastern women so consider it tit for tat .
Reports from those who 've actually tried these puddings report they 're somewhat milky , sweet tasting , and with a vaguely slimy mouth feel .
I 'm guessing the ingredients contain gelatin but since the " display chests " are not refrigerated , figure on a dash or two of preservative to keep the milk from going off .
Eager to try these tasty teats , umm , treats ?
Sure you are , admit it .
They appear to be sold in Japanese supermarkets and / or department stores at prices in the 380 -400 yen range .
That 's about $ 4.00 - or two bucks a bosom .
To borrow a phrase , " betcha ca n't eat just one ! "
Last month I posted about a proposal in Nebraska that would mandate testing to homeschooling families .
Â
Today , thanks to Reason , I read an article in the LA Times stating that homeschooling has been ruled illegal by a California appellate court .
“ Parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children , ” wrote Justice H. Walter Croskey in a Feb. 28 opinion signed by the two other members of the district court .
Hold on .
Â WHAT ?!Â
Excuse me ?Â
Did I read that correctly ?
Â
They do n’t have the constitutional right ?
Â
Pause for a second to digest that .
You know who loves this ruling , right ?
Teachers union officials will also be closely monitoring the appeal .
A.J. Duffy , president of United Teachers Los Angeles , said he agrees with the ruling .
“ What ’s best for a child is to be taught by a credentialed teacher , ” he said .
Credentialed by the State , right ?
Â
No conflict of interest there .
Â Relax Teachers Union people .Â
Good teachers have been in demand since ancient times , way before unions .
Â
They ’ll always be in demand and are in no danger of ever being out of work .
Notice something I ’m not discussing here is religion , which the Times article mentions frequently .
Â
It ’s almost as if they ’re trying to make this a religious issue , which it obviously is n’t .
Â
It just so happens that many people homeschool their children for religious reasons , but that ’s not the only reason .
This will surely be overturned , but is it something the State would be willing to take to the limit .
Â
Are they willing to line up tanks outside of someone ’s home and threaten them with bullets for refusing to send their kids to gov’ment indoctrination camps schools ?
California , if you ’re still wondering why the rest of the country unfairly labels you a bunch of crazies …

More than 26 years after Cambridge company Acorn and the BBC united to produce a computer to help educate the UK about the IT revolution some of the principal creators of the machine have gathered to remember its legacy .
The casings may be slightly worn and the manuals a little dog-eared but a handful of BBC Micros were fired up at the Science Museum on Thursday as part of a Computer Conservation Society event to mark the legacy of the BBC Micro , know fondly as the Beeb .
Four of the architects of the Beeb - Hermann Hauser , Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson who worked at Acorn and former BBC executive producer John Radcliffe - explain in their own words how the BBC Micro came to be created and the impact it had .
STEVE FURBER
In March 1981 we knew the BBC were interested in Acorn .
Hermann Hauser told us that the BBC were coming five days before they arrived but we did n't even have a machine .
But we had built several computers already so we were able to build a prototype for the BBC in five days , which I remember as being five days and four nights .
There was a huge gap between what the BBC wanted and what we had planned to build .
Their technical specification was basically a Z80 ( processor ) machine running CP / M ( an operating sytem ) .
What they contracted from Acorn was a 6502 ( processor ) machine running a proprietary operating system .
We ultimately delivered that through the second processor which could be added to the BBC .
We did get there in the end I think their key reason for wanting that specification was that there was a reasonably established market and they felt that with estimate of 12,000 machine sales they 'd need to fit into an existing market .
The reality to turned out completely at odds to that : BBC sales completely swamped that of Z80 .
More than 1.5 million were sold and the BBC became defacto the computer to build software for .
The BBC Micro was released at the end of 1981 I do n't think anyone at the outset anticipated the scale of the take up .
Clearly once we were talking to the BBC we were aiming for the market they were planning to target their programmes at , which I think was somewhere in schools but also across to more enthusiastic homes .
They were trying to move it out of the geek hobbyist sector because they saw this technology was going to affect everybody , particularly in business .
We very much felt like pioneers ; although we were n't quite the first .
We knew that Apple had come out with the Apple II , which in many ways had a similar position in the US market to the one the Beeb had over here .
They were a couple of years ahead of us .
We had useful technical advantages over the Apple coming later ; we ran the processor twice as fast and of course the Beeb had a lot of interfaces and probably proved to be the most expandable home computer there has ever been .
We had done networking with Atom as an upgrade - which was satisfactory - and that technology was n't built into every machine and this of course was 10 years before general population began to get involved with the world wide web .
Technically the BBC Micro really caused Acorn to grow and was responsible for the development of the ARM processor , which followed very shortly after the BBC Micro .
And the ARM is now the world 's dominant architecture in the mobile embedded space , with absolutely unbelievable numbers .
They have just past their 10,000 million point .
The other legacy which keeps coming back to me is that a generation of people cut their computing teeth on the BBC Micro so I still meet people who say they did their first computing on the Beeb .
Steve Furber is Professor of Computer Engineering at Manchester University .
HERMANN HAUSER
We knew we were in a competition ; there were six firms the BBC talked to and one of them was our arch - enemy Sinclair .
We knew we had to work very hard to come up with a solution that was better than Sinclair .
It was a wonderful rivalry : Sinclair and Acorn at the time were the two key competitors in the space and we egged each other on .
There was a lot of local rivalry attached to it also .
Steve Furber had been working on a machine we called the Proton , although this was really a machine that was still a vision more than any concrete design .
It was quite a specific and worked out vision so when the BBC came with their requirements it was very ambitious as the specification was way above anything that was available at the time .
It was a real stretch but a stretch that a young company enjoys .
One very interesting complaint that I have from lots of computer science departments now is that people do n't learn how to programme at school anymore .
When they use PCs they do n't programme them .
When they used BBC Micro they programmed them themselves because it was so simple to write in BBC Basic .
It was this generation that grew up programming BBC Basic that is partially responsible for the tremendous position we have in gaming .
One of the great advantages of working with the BBC apart from the tremendous publicity , was the specification it gave to us , in terms of graphics , speed and networking .
It 's hard to say if we would have specified a computer similar to the BBC Micro if we had not been approached by the BBC .
The sad part of the story is that we missed a trick .
We were so far ahead of the game - and I remember when Bill Gates visited us and I showed him an operating system that was much more developed than MS DOS at the time .
We thought this was a clear advantage ; not realising that the game had changed and the real advantage was standards .
We would never thought of giving our operating system away ; it was our crown jewels .
The same thing was true of our Econet , our networking system .
We were way ahead with our networking .
I remember Bill Gates marvelling at our networking because he did n't know about networking at the time .
By keeping it proprietary we were fighting Intel and Microsoft on their home turf and there was no way that a little company from England could win that .
In a way the surprise is how long Acorn managed to hold out .
For 10 years we managed to beat Intel and Microsoft with a product that was much more powerful .
Our products were more powerful than PCs for 10 years .
Acorn became the Fairchild of Cambridge ( Chip maker Fairchild spawned Silicon Valley in the US ) .
There are about 100 companies which can trace their origins back to Acorn and some of them - ARM , CSR , Verata - are billion dollar companies which are bigger than Acorn could ever have hoped to be .
Hermann Hauser is the co-founder of Amadeus Capital Partners , a venture capital company .

Hermann had agreed with the BBC to show a prototype of a machine which at that stage was only in my head and we'd only discussed it .
He sequentially rang up Steve ( Furber ) and myself and told each of us that the other had agreed to do it .
Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday we had to draw a circuit diagram of what we were going to build and find all the components and we wanted very specialised things like 4MHz Dram memory chips which did n't really exist at the time ; I had read about it in a data book by Hitachi .
We had things like Hitachi reps showing up with the four Drams that were in the country .
We built early machines by hand but the BBC machine prototype was built in wire wrap .
Hermann knew people in the Cambridge computer lab who wire - wrapped their equipment and we got a man called Ram Banarjee to come and help us .
He was nick - named the fast gun in the West and was a demon at wiring things .
[ Wire - wrap is a simple way to prototype equipment ] .
We built the actual machine Wednesday night , and into Thursday evening and then of course it did n't work and we had to start debugging it .
That debugging took all Thursday evening into Friday morning .
I had to go home and get some sleep because I knew I would have to write some software for the machine .
I came back 6 am Friday morning by which time it was working .
By the time the BBC people arrived at our offices we had an operating system and Basic interpreter running so that we could type on the screen and that stuff could come out .
Before they left we had random graphs showing on the screen .
We were fairly confident we had built something that would stay working during the demonstration .
It was a rush to try and alter things to a state that we thought would be interesting to look at , to show them things they would understand .
It was a massive arms race to build the machine into reality - it meant designing two logic arrays - what we call today system on a chip - one for video and the other for a cassette interface and get all of that ready .
We also had to write the operating system and software to a spec that the BBC wanted .
I think there were five of us in the offices writing the operating system for the machine on the day Charles and Diana got married .
We had a little TV in the office and had a five minute break to watch her walk down the aisle and then we were back programming and soldering .
We realised it was something special because before there were even production machines we were involved in technical help for the TV programmes .
The very first TV programme that came out , Steve and I were there in the studio making sure the machines performed .
Steve to this day says he remembers he had a soldering iron and I was programming busily to make the machines work .
People wanted to know about computers .
It was a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to programme .

JOHN RADCLIFFE
It was very radical and unusual thinking ; we did it because the BBC felt it was necessary .
The BBC looked at it on all sides very cautiously .
BBC Engineering and Engineering Research had a very positive view and the fact they thought it would be educational and beneficial to the BBC technically was a factor which weighed with top management .
We were in the business of developing computer literacy .
We had 10 television programmes but people do n't learn very much from programmes .
There 's nothing like getting your hands on a machine to find out what it can and can't do , what it consists of .
We had this notion that we needed a computer associated with the project , that we could do demonstrations in the studio and that people could go out and buy it and use it in the home .
In order to do that we had to have a standard ; a software standard that ran right through the programmes and that standard was BBC Basic .
That was the underlying rationale of having the Micro .
Seven companies were identified by the Department for Trade and Industry as being possible candidates .
We wrote to them all with our specification and six bid .
We looked at the bids very carefully , with BBC engineers and consultants from outside and we decided that Acorn was the best offer .
We were surprised by the reaction .
We had audiences between 500,000 and 1.2 million late night on BBC One .
We managed to reach 16 % of the adult population with one programme or another ; so our reach was very wide .
We had a basic book , The Computer Book , following the series and 80,000 copies were sold in half a year ; we had a course to learn BBC Basic in 30 hours and 120,000 copies were sold .
The penetration of the project into the population was very great .
This was n't just because of our genius ; it was because it was timely .
There was enormous curiosity about the subject , about computing .

With Diet , Exercise and Friendship , Man Loses 400 Pounds
With the help of a trainer , David Smith dropped more than half his body weight .
Dec. 21 , 2007  --
Four and half years ago , David Smith weighed more than 630 pounds .
He had spent nearly a decade on the couch in his parents ' house eating pizza , raiding the fridge , and drinking soda .
For much of his life he said he " felt like the elephant man . "
Today Smith is enjoying life and the inspiration he gives others .
His remarkable transformation did n't happen overnight .
It took more than two years of total dedication ; tears of disappointment and grins of glory .
Yet his new body is not his greatest gift .
It 's friendship … something Smith never dreamed he'd know .
During the years that he was morbidly obese , he was also imprisoned by shame and social anxiety .
" It got so bad to a point that I did n't leave the house and I did n't even feel comfortable in my own backyard until it was dark out , " Smith said .
Ashamed of his looks , Smith did n't want to go out so he would n't be mocked in public .
Reaching Out for Help
In June 2003 , he finally had enough .
Smith sent an e-mail to Chris Powell , fitness correspondent for Good Morning Arizona , a local news broadcast on KTVK in Phoenix .
Powell paid Smith a visit .
" We were both probably thinking : what are we getting ourselves into right here ?
There would be no way I 'd have anything in common with this guy , " Smith said .
Powell , a former Cosmo magazine bachelor , was socially confident .
But now he was trying to get through to this painfully shy man .
" I did n't know what 600 pounds looked like , " Powell said .
" He could n't really look me in the eye .
He was just so broken .
He really did n't know what to say or what to do . "
Despite their initial awkward meeting , they made a deal .
Smith committed to losing the pounds and Powell agreed to stick with him as long as Smith did n't give up .
The first stop was a truck scale so they could get Smith 's weight .
After that , Powell created a food plan for Smith : six smaller meals to replace Smith 's end - of - the - day megameal .
The meals were carbo - balanced to increase his metabolism , with cheat days thrown in .
In the first month Smith dropped 40 pounds ; then , after just four months of doing simple exercises in the gym , Smith lost 100 pounds .
Powell was pleased .
But Smith was n't too impressed with what he had accomplished .
" He kept telling me , when I look in the mirror , I still feel like the same person .
In fact , I still see 630 pounds , " Powell said .
Revelations
Then one day after a session , Smith handed Powell a letter he 'd written .
As Powell read , it began with a revelation that Smith had never shared with anyone else .
He had been sexually abused by the first friend he had ever made .
" It made me shy away from people , not trust people at all .
And , of course I turned to food because it made me happy .
It did n't hurt me , " Smith said .
Gaining more weight all the time , and lacking social skills , Smith found school to be a nightmare .
" I 've had like sticks and stones and dog feces and , you know , thrown at me and spit on .
I 've had a broken arm and black , black eyes , " recalled Smith .
The emotional and physical abuse took a toll ; he had dropped out of high school at 17 and headed for his parents ' house .
Over the next decade , he would emerge only rarely .
Trapped in a joyless , friendless existence , Smith felt he had no choice but to plan his suicide in a horrific manner .
" I felt like I deserved as much pain as possible if I was to kill myself , to burn myself literally in the desert .
I just decided maybe dousing myself with gasoline and , you know , maybe people could hear my screams and hear all the despair that consumed me for all these years , " Smith said .
Powell was moved when he learned what Smith had been through .
" He 'd never had a chance in life .
And I realized how valuable I was to him not just as a trainer but as the first person in his life who actually believed in him . "
' The Best Night of My Life '
As the exercises got more strenuous and the pounds kept coming off , Powell began to unlock Smith 's personality .
Powell decided to reintroduce Smith to the social world that had treated Smith so cruelly .
He made preparations at a nearby bar , and when they arrived , Smith was treated like a rock star .
" When we got in the car and I 'm driving him home he goes , that was the best night of my life , " Powell said .
As the pounds continued to fall away , Powell knew Smith needed him now more than ever .
All his loose skin gave him the appearance of a deflated balloon .
So he embarked on a series of surgeries to eliminate the excess skin , leaving him with 18 feet of scars .
Powell was there for all the surgeries .
After 26 months , Smith had locked in on his target weight of 229 pounds making his total weight loss a whopping 401 pounds .
He also enhanced his appearance with Lasik surgery on his eyes and some dental work to fix his teeth , destroyed by too much soda .
All of the cosmetic work was donated by Phoenix area doctors .
" I even got some cheek implants .
I needed help ! " laughed Smith .
But there 's one more thing that 's on Smith 's mind right now .
" I have no experience .
I 've never had a girlfriend and I 'm a virgin .
Somebody 's out there .
Somebody has to be out there .
I believed in losing my weight , I believe in so many things and I believe there 's somebody for me , I hope , " Smith said .
Now 31 , Smith has started bodybuilding , working at a gym and studying to become a trainer .
Powell never charged Smith a dime for his services or his emotional support .
What he got in exchange , Powell said , was far more important .
" I was with him through his transformation , but he 's been with me through my own journey over the last couple of years , and that 's the real reason like why we 're so close .
He 's hands down the most genuine person that you 'll ever meet .
He 's got a heart of gold , " Powell said of his newfound best friend .
This holiday season , these two pals will have a lot to be thankful for , and friendship tops the list .
In recent months , some start - up technology companies have died or gone into comas after running out of money , a possible early sign that the resurgence in venture investment may be coming to an end .
File123 is counting its days .
Edgeio was edged out .
TripUp has fallen .
BrightSpot went dark .
Firebrand flamed out and Ezmo is no more .
Industry analysts say this year will bring a big wave of start - up deaths as the credit crisis gripping the financial markets makes investors cautious in other areas .
“ This is the first time since the Internet bubble burst that Internet companies are facing serious challenges , ” said Jessica Canning , global research director for Dow Jones VentureSource .

The slowdown will affect Los Angeles , which has become a technology center for companies that put entertainment and advertising on the Web .
Now such companies are frequently given months , not years , to prove concepts , with wary venture capitalists pickier about where they invest .
“ It ’s more cutthroat now , ” said Adeo Ressi , an entrepreneur who runs thefunded.com , a site that tracks venture firms .
“ If you do n’t show hockey - stick growth , you do n’t make it in this market . ”
The chart pattern Ressi referred to signals impressive growth at a fast pace .
In the last quarter of 2007 , venture capital investments in Southern California companies fell 25 % .
Los Angeles - based information services companies , which include online entertainment and advertising ventures , attracted 13 % less funding than the same time a year earlier .
Only one technology company had an initial public offering in the first quarter of this year , down from nine the same time last year , according to an April 1 report by the National Venture Capital Assn .
The group also found a slide in mergers and acquisitions .

Matt Dusig , who sold online survey operation GoZing for $ 30 million three years ago , needs $ 500,000 to keep his Encino company , File123 , alive .
He has a chief executive ready to take charge but nobody interested in betting on the Web - based file storage manager .
“ We do n’t want to see it die out , ” Dusig said .
The investment slowdown comes after the biggest start - up funding boom since the Internet bust .
Venture funds raised $ 35 billion in 2007 , the biggest hoard since 2001 .
But the volatile stock market has spooked many investors and made it more difficult for companies to find buyers or go public .
“ You ca n’t get an IPO out when there are a lot of investors sitting on the sidelines , ” said Mark Heesen , president of the National Venture Capital Assn .
Without exit opportunities , venture firms need to keep funding older firms at the expense of younger ones , he said .
Investors are making tough choices about which firms to finance and “ which to abandon to its fate , ” said Mark Cannice , an associate professor of entrepreneurship at the University of San Francisco , who surveys venture capitalists ’ confidence .

His most recent survey , in January , found confidence at the lowest point in four years .
Investors ’ new caution could ricochet through the start - up world , which brings new jobs and innovation .
“ These young firms are the engine of growth for the economy , ” said Garth Saloner , director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at Stanford University ’s Graduate School of Business .
Some of the current generation suffer from the same problems that beset those in the last Internet boom -- many are creating near - identical businesses or have only vague ideas of how to generate revenue .
“ Tens of millions of dollars are put into them , but they are n’t sustainable and they ca n’t continue to go back to the well , ” said Jon Fisher , an entrepreneur who sold his most recent company , Bharosa , to Oracle Corp. in July .

The slowdown is stumping some entrepreneurs , including those who found success in the Internet bubble .
Keith Teare , for instance , whose company , RealNames Corp. , sold a stake to Microsoft and almost went public in 1999 , thought he ’d found more success with Palo Alto - based Edgeio , which syndicated classified ads to clients ’ websites .
He launched the company in 2006 with $ 1.5 million and received an additional $ 3.5 million in September 2006 .
At the time , investors valued Edgeio at $ 18 million .
But when he knocked on doors for more money last August , Teare was surprised to discover that the well had almost run dry .
Investors did n’t think Edgeio was worth $ 18 million anymore and offered him a total of $ 400,000 .
Teare closed the company instead .
He now shares his 4,000 square feet of office space in Palo Alto -- paid for until Aug. 31 -- with aspiring entrepreneurs rather than Edgeio employees .
Matthew Gertner expected to get a second round of funding for his Britain - based file - sharing start - up , AllPeers , in November .
It did n’t materialize , so he picked up work on the side while he looked for other investors or a buyer .

He decided to shut down the site at the end of March .
“ There ’s a strong emotional attachment .
It ’s almost like getting divorced , ” he said .
“ There ’s this huge sensation for entrepreneurs to cling to it and drag it out until they ’re absolutely forced to close . ”

Engadget reports that O2 has posted a notice on their website that both the 8GB and 16GB iPhones are no longer available in the UK .
This confirms earlier reports that O2 had end - of - life'd the 8GB iPhone , though it appears even the 16GB iPhone has also run its course .
While the next generation iPhone has been long rumored , most expectations have pointed to an announcement at Apple 's Worldwide Developer 's Conference which is not scheduled for more than a month from now .
Meanwhile , we have heard that U.S. stock for the 8GB iPhone has also dwindled down dramatically with few new shipments coming in .
Even so , Apple continues to list 24 hour shipping for the iPhone in their UK online store .
Update : O2's website is now showing availability for 16GB iPhones , but the 8GB model remains out of stock .
I do n’t doubt for a second President Bush ’s gut support for Israel , and I think it comes from his gut .
He views Israel as a country that shares America ’s core democratic and free - market values .
That is not unimportant .
But what matters a lot more is that under Mr. Bush , America today is neither feared nor respected nor liked in the Middle East , and that his lack of an energy policy for seven years has left Israel ’s enemies and America ’s enemies  the petro-dictators and the terrorists they support  stronger than ever .
The rise of Iran as a threat to Israel today is directly related to Mr. Bush ’s failure to succeed in Iraq and to develop alternatives to oil .
Does that mean Mr. Obama would automatically do better ?
I do n’t know .
To me , U.S. presidents succeed or fail when it comes to Arab - Israeli diplomacy depending on two criteria that have little to do with what ’s in their hearts .
The first , and most important , is the situation on the ground and the readiness of the parties themselves to take the lead , irrespective of what America is doing .
Anwar Sadat ’s heroic overture to Israel , and Menachem Begin ’s response , made the Jimmy Carter - engineered Camp David peace treaty possible .
The painful , post - 1973 war stalemate between Israel and Egypt and Syria made Henry Kissinger ’s disengagement agreements possible .
The collapse of the Soviet Union and America ’s defeat of Iraq in the first gulf war made possible James Baker ’s success in putting the Madrid peace process together .
What all three of these U.S. statesmen had in common , though  and this is the second criterion  was that when history gave them an opening , they seized it , by being tough , cunning and fair with both sides .
I do n’t want a president who is just going to lean on Israel and not get in the Arabs ’ face too , or one who , as the former Mideast negotiator Aaron D. Miller puts it , “ loves Israel to death ”  by not drawing red lines when Israel does reckless things that are also not in America ’s interest , like building settlements all over the West Bank .
It ’s a tricky business .
But if Israel is your voting priority , then at least ask the right questions about Mr. Obama .
Knock off the churlish whispering campaign about what ’s in his heart on Israel ( what was in Richard Nixon ’s heart ? ) and focus first on what kind of America you think he ’d build and second on whether you believe that as president he’d have the smarts , steel and cunning to seize a historic opportunity if it arises .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - China is expected to come under fire in the European Parliament next week over its response to unrest in Tibet with many EU lawmakers calling for some kind of European boycott of the Beijing Olympics .
Several leading assembly members will seek action ranging from a political snub of the opening ceremony to an outright boycott of sport ’s showpiece event by the bloc ’s athletes , parliament officials said on Thursday .
A special sitting of the EU assembly is expected to be convened to discuss China ’s crackdown on protesters in the Himalayan region .
The EU has so far said there is no need to boycott the Games in response to the wave of violence , which Beijing says was orchestrated by the exiled Dalai Lama , an accusation he denies .
The Tibetan spiritual leader has said he does not support the violence and that he backs the Beijing Olympics .
Slovenia , which holds the six - month EU presidency , said on Thursday that a boycott was “ not the right answer ” .
But France ’s foreign minister has said the idea should be considered and there is some support within the European Parliament for European countries to stay away from the Games .
The European legislature has no say over issues such as the foreign policy of EU states but its views can turn a spotlight on issues such as human rights abuses .
Any decision to boycott the Games would have to be taken at national level .
“ From my information , the question now is not whether to have a boycott , but more what type of boycott it should be , ” Edward McMillan - Scott , vice - president of the European Parliament , told Reuters .
OPENING CEREMONY
On Tuesday , EU assembly President Hans - Gert Poettering , a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , said politicians should reconsider attending the opening ceremony of the Games .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said the idea could be considered by EU foreign ministers at a meeting next week .
McMillan - Scott wrote to EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana on Thursday seeking “ an exceptional meeting ” of the bloc ’s foreign ministers on the Tibetan issue before their scheduled informal meeting in Slovenia on March 28 and 29 .
“ The EU can not sit on the fence and watch these tragedies unfolding in Tibet and China , ” he wrote .
“ I urge you to consider ... what stance the EU should adopt on the Beijing Olympics . ”
A spokeswoman for the Slovenian presidency said Tibet was not formally on the agenda of the meeting but if “ the current pace of events continue , it is very likely to be raised ” .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has angered China by agreeing to meet the Dalai Lama when he visits London in May .
“ MEET Showtime , ” said Giovanni James , a musician , magician and inventor of sorts , introducing his prized dove , who occupies a spacious cage in Mr. James ’s apartment in Midtown Manhattan .
Showtime is integral to Mr. James ’s magic act and to his décor , a sepia - tone universe straight out of the gaslight era .
The lead singer of a neovaudevillian performance troupe called the James Gang , Mr. James has assembled his universe from oddly assorted props and castoffs : a gramophone with a crank and velvet turntable , an old wooden icebox and a wardrobe rack made from brass pipes that were ballet bars in a previous incarnation .
Yes , he owns a flat - screen television , but he has modified it with a burlap frame .
He uses an iPhone , but it is encased in walnut .
Even his clothing — an unlikely fusion of current and neo-Edwardian pieces ( polo shirt , gentleman ’s waistcoat , paisley bow tie ) , not unlike those he plans to sell this summer at his own Manhattan haberdashery — is an expression of his keenly romantic worldview .
It is also the vision of steampunk , a subculture that is the aesthetic expression of a time - traveling fantasy world , one that embraces music , film , design and now fashion , all inspired by the extravagantly inventive age of dirigibles and steam locomotives , brass diving bells and jar - shaped protosubmarines .
First appearing in the late 1980s and early ’90s , steampunk has picked up momentum in recent months , making a transition from what used to be mainly a literary taste to a Web - propagated way of life .
Portishead are a band from Bristol , United Kingdom , named after a small coastal town twelve miles west of said musical hotbed , in North Somerset .
They were initially known for their use of jazz samples and some hip - hop beats along with various synth sounds and the hauntingly beautiful vocals of singer Beth Gibbons .
Their current sound drops the samples in favour of a harder , more abrasive edge , but retains Gibbons ' vocals .
The band was formed in 1991 ( then later split in 2005 reforming in 2008 ) , by keyboardist / multi-instrumentalist Geoff Barrow Adrian Utley and singer Beth G …
独立行政法人 産業技術総合研究所（産総研）は、JIS やANSI C規格と互換性を持ち、メモリ安全性を確保したC言語コンパイラ「 Fail -Safe C – release 1」を開発、2008年4月11日に一般公開した。ライセンスはQPL（Q
Public License ）を採用した。
C言語は、通常は機械語を直接用いなければ記述できない低水準のメモリ操作を、高水準言語だけでできるのが大きな特徴だが、この特徴がセキュリティ脆弱性の原因となるバグを引き起こす大きな要因となっていた。一方、メモリ安全性を備えた他言語への移行は、移植コストやプログラマー教育コストなどの問題から、C言語プログラムを変更せずにメモリ安全性を確保できる技術が望まれていた。
産総研が開発し たFail - Safe Cは、仮想アドレス演算などの機構を導入。ANSI/ISO/JISの各規格で定められたC言語のメモリ操作に関する仕様を完全に満たし、再コンパイルするだけでウイルスなどの不正データを受信した際に実行状態の乗っ取りと、それによる不正機械語コードのメモリへの導入を完全防止できるという。
また、実行時キャスト解析などの最適化技術を導入することで、メモリ安全性と実用的な実行速度を両立させた。C言語規格のほぼすべての機能と500以上の安全な標準関数を備え、Linux上でOpenSSL、OpenSSH、BIND9など既存サーバソフトを動作させられる。【鴨沢 浅葱 ／Infostand】

Plenty of inventive ( and desperate ) people have come up with a number of imaginative schemes for sneaking themselves and others across national borders .
On 2003 , Illegal immigrants from India and Pakistan being smuggled from mainland China to Hong Kong were found inside suitcases ) .
On 2001 , a 135 - lb. woman was hidden behind the dashboard of a car .
The “ passenger ” might be quite cramped and uncomfortable and the automobile difficult to maneuver after the modifications , but the ruse would n’t have to be maintained for long — the car could be loaded just out of sight of border agents , driven the short distance to the crossing , and unloaded not far across the other side .

Similarly , another would - be border crosser was caught attempting to enter the U.S. concealed inside a seat occupied by another passenger :
Phil Zimmermann , the coder who created the Pretty Good Privacy ( PGP ) email encryption scheme in 1991 , defended encrypted online webmail company Hushmail 's turning over of the unscrambled emails to the government when given a court order , arguing it is not reasonable to expect that online encrypted email storage is as safe as using encryption software on one 's own computer .
Zimmermann , who sits on Hushmail 's advisory board , spoke to THREAT LEVEL after we published a piece contrasting the site 's promises that it had no access to the contents of customers ' encrypted emails stored on their servers with a court case showing that the Canadian company turned over 12 CDs of readable emails to U.S. authorities .
Zimmermann is also the brains behind Zfone , software that works with VOIP services to make encrypted online phone calls possible .
" If your threat model includes the government coming in with all of force of the government and compelling service provider to do things it wants them to do , then there are ways to obtain the plaintext of an email , " Zimmermann said in a phone interview .
" Just because encryption is involved , that does n't give you a talisman against a prosecutor .
They can compel a service provider to cooperate . "
Hushmail offers two ways to use its encrypted email service – both of which Hushmail now indicates can be eavesdropped on following a court order .
One , the now default , does the encryption work on Hushmail 's server and works largely like regular webmail .
The second , original method uses a Java applet that runs in the user 's browser that takes care of the decryption and encryption of messages on his computer , after the user types in the right passphrase .
In this case , messages reach Hushmail 's server already encrypted .
The Java code also decrypts the message on the recipient 's computer , so an unencrypted copy never crosses the internet or hits Hushmails servers .
The simple webmail version exposes a user 's passkey to Hushmail briefly , explaining how the company is able to comply with legal orders served on the company for users that choose that option .
Though Zimmermann knows nothing of the DEA case or how Hushmail decrypts emails in response to court orders , he said there are technical ways Hushmail could unscramble a customer 's accounts , no matter which way they use Hushmail .
" You could have a different , modified Java applet delivered to the user , for example , " Zimmermann said .
But there are counter - measures a user could take to prevent being served a rogue Java applet , Zimmermann said .
" You could keep a digital signature of it or a cyrptographic strong hash and compare it each time , or you could keep your own copy and hopefully the copy you got before was the proper one , " Zimmermann said .
But , Zimmermann stressed , the company only undoes encryption when given a Canadian court order and is not turning over customer records wholesale to government agencies .
" It would be suicidal for their business model if they did that , " Zimmermann said .
" Their hearts are in the right place but there are certain kinds of attacks that are beyond the scope of their abilities to thwart .
They are not a sovereign state . "
Last week , THREAT LEVEL reported that Hushmail 's architecture does let the company unscramble user 's accounts and may be able to do so even with the version that requires users to use a hefty Java applet in their browsers to do the encrypting and decrypting .
Hushmail , a longtime provider of encrypted web - based email , markets itself by saying that " not even a Hushmail employee with access to our servers can read your encrypted e-mail , since each message is uniquely encoded before it leaves your computer . "
But it turns out that statement seems not to apply to individuals targeted by government agencies that are able to convince a Canadian court to serve a court order on the company .
A September court document ( .pdf ) from a federal prosecution of alleged steroid dealers reveals the Canadian company turned over 12 CDs worth of e-mails from three Hushmail accounts , following a court order obtained through a mutual assistance treaty between the U.S. and Canada .
Zimmermann says it would be a shame to damn Hushmail for this compliance , since it remains a useful tool against many other attacks , including protecting individuals from oppressive foreign governments who will have a tough time convincing a Canadian court to issue a search warrant on its behalf .
" If you are in a hotel room in Khazakstan or Russia and want to check your mail and you have a laptop , you could be running the Java applet or even running it through SSL , " Zimmermann said .
" The behavior of the Hushmail servers is not going to be influenced by the local government where you are sitting in the hotel . "

A custom app for your business is one of the best ways to help your customers access information or use your services .
Yet it ’s also one of the easiest ways to drive them away in favor of your competitors .
To make sure you ’re doing your customers a favor , instead of causing them frustration , you need to avoid some key mistakes during the app - building process .
When you learn from other companies ’ mistakes , you ’ll get results that grow your business and work for your clients .
Here are some top design mistakes to avoid when building an app .
Not Labeling Icons
Icons help app designers save space on the screen because they take up less room than copy does .
According to the Nielsen Norman Group , they ’re also popular because you do n’t have to translate them if you ’re intending to use your app in other countries with other language speakers .
Yet a big problem with using only icons is that some end up being difficult to recognize .
By using labels along with your icons , more people will understand what to click on the first time .
This causes less frustration and helps customers use the app the way you intended .
You can also design walk - throughs for the app so that customers can use the tutorial to guide them .
Many apps start with a walk - through upon download .
You can also build these in as customers access new facets of the app , or a place in your help section that they can go to access them if they feel they need extra help .
Using Vague Error Messages
This is a similar problem to web design mistakes wherein customers see a message that something went wrong but it gives no specifics .
This creates a problem because the customer does n’t know if they did something wrong or if the problem is someone else ’s fault .
If they do n’t know what went wrong , they ca n’t try to fix it .
Instead , offer a little more of an explanation .
It does n’t have to be very much more , but something like “ Something went wrong on our end ” instead of “ Something went wrong ” can provide enough .
Being Inconsistent : Top Design Mistakes
Customers look for consistency throughout the app .
They want a design that looks the same throughout , so they do n’t encounter any surprises .
The layout should be one that considers the target audience and keeps their expectations in mind .
Be consistent with the terms you use , too .
If something is labeled one way in one section of the app and you call it something else in another place , your customers wo n’t understand right away that you ’re referring to the same thing as before .
It will take them longer to figure out .
Not Paying Attention to Loading Time
Fancy graphics and Java scripts look nice , but they do n’t do your customers any favors .
They slow down the app and make it harder to use , especially for people on the go who need it to be responsive .
Use simple graphics and basic coding to help the app run faster and smoother for your clients .
They ’ll appreciate the speed , and minimalist design can work well , too .
Counting on People to Use Their Fingers
Placement of buttons in apps is all about the most intuitive places that people keep their hands when using their phones .
If you keep buttons in the wrong spot , it will be awkward and difficult to press them , and customers wo n’t like using your app .
They may not be able to tell you why they do n’t like it , but you can avoid the whole issue by keeping placement in mind .
Thumb usage , in particular , is important .
Josh Clark in his study on app design found that 75 % of design is based on where people put their thumbs , because they use them the most for app interactions .
Also note that the bottom of the screen gets higher traffic than the top , so consider that location for more buttons and interactive app features .
Making Sign - Up Too Complicated
Apps that make it easy to get started are the winners .
If a customer downloads an app because they want to try it out and see how easy it is to use , they may not even get past the welcome screen if it requires too much at the start .
Try giving them several options for signing in or getting started so that they can choose the fastest way or their preferred method .
This gives them options , including quick ones if that is the most important part of the process for them .
Even if two - factor authentication or the option to sign in with Facebook is more expensive , consider the price and how valuable these features could be for your users .
If it ’s the difference between people using the app and people abandoning it , then the cost is worth it .
Forgetting About Calls - To- Action
Guiding your users through the app means helping them know where to click and what buttons to push .
Invite them through calls - to - action to get started , buy now , and other command - like choices .
They ’ll find the process easier without having to experiment on button clicking and choices throughout the platform .
Designing Customer - Centric Interactions
The top design methods for apps are all about being proactive .
If you start out knowing that you want to avoid the mistakes above , like being inconsistent or disregarding loading time , then the design process for your app will go a lot smoother .
Focus on what will be easiest for the customer .
Even if it means that some things are more complicated on the design side to bring them what they want , you ’ll have more success with the app .

For both self - protection and for humanitarian reasons , Americans should be seriously concerned about the explosion of HIV / AIDS in the Caribbean , where the reality of sex workers and the Global Gag Rule are factors in the continuing spread of the disease .
For both self - protection and for humanitarian reasons , Americans should be seriously concerned about the explosion of HIV / AIDS in the Caribbean .
The Caribbean region is the second worst HIV / AIDS affected regions in the world , after sub Saharan Africa .
Poverty , gender inequalities and a high degree of HIV - related stigma have caused a festering of the epidemic in the region .
Human mobility throughout the Caribbean , between the region and other geographic areas including migration and tourism which brings more than 20 million visitors each year has also been singled out as a major driver of the epidemic .
According to UNAIDS , AIDS remains one of the leading causes of death among people aged 25 to 44 years in the region , and the adult HIV prevalence is estimated at 2.3 % .

The main mode of HIV transmission in this region is unprotected heterosexual intercourse ; unprotected sex between sex workers and clients is a key factor in the spread of HIV , reports UNAIDS .
UNAIDS estimates that 330,000 HIV - positive people live in the Caribbean , about 22,000 of whom are children , with 51 percent of people living with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , being women .
Against this background , there is massive human interaction between the US and the Caribbean , with many Americans attracted to visit the idyllic , sandy and sunny spots in the region .
Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that 14 percent of the 27,351,000 US travelers in 2004 went to the Caribbean .
While bringing much needed revenue to the region , the impact of tourism has seen a rise in sex work , with poor women and men aged between 18 to 44 selling their bodies as a means of survival throughout the Caribbean .
Many American tourists both male and female perceive the Caribbean region as sexually exotic and free - going .
So it 's common that when Americans visit the Caribbean , many end up engaging in sexual activity , in a high HIV risk environment .
According to Avert , an international AIDS charity , the Caribbean 's thriving sex industry , which serves both local clients and many tourists , features prominently in the AIDS epidemics of certain countries , such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica .
Americans , particularly tourists to the Caribbean region , should therefore be concerned that they can easily contract HIV if they do not utilize protective measures .
It is imperative for Americans who engage in sexual unionships in the region to be concerned about the consistent use of protection to avoid HIV and STI infection .
Given the high rates of American visitors to the region , it is conceivable that the epidemic can rebound in the US , if they do not apply protective measures during sexual contact .
More importantly , if the AIDS problem in the Caribbean continues to grow unabated , there is no doubt that it will spiral into the US .
The non-availability of AIDS drugs and treatment in the region may force Caribbean people to illegally migrate to the US where the treatment options are many .
In fact , migration between the islands and to the United States is prevalent in the Caribbean region and plays a key factor in the spread of the disease .
In that sense , Americans need to be seriously concerned because they are vulnerable to both HIV and secondary diseases such as TB that immigrants may bring with them .
Having said that , the decimation of entire populations within the Caribbean can destabilize many of the countries , thereby posing a security risk right in front of the US 's doorstep .
Americans also have a responsibility to ensure that the tools and methodologies that have worked in their country can be exported to the Caribbean region , albeit , in a culturally sensitive manner .
" The epidemic 's full extent is obscured by fear , denial , limited treatment and a lack of public health resources , " the New York Times reported on the impact of HIV / AIDS in the region , " What is certain , however , is that a social and economic catastrophe is imperiling many countries as infections steadily climb and AIDS spreads in the general population . "
For the ordinary American traveler , this could potentially mean that traveling to the sunny and sandy beaches of the Caribbean may be rendered impossible .
It is incumbent upon the Americans to intensify calls for non-judgmental , humanitarian efforts targeted at the region .
The Global Gag Rule which restricts funding for family planning reinstated in 2001 by President George Bush has been a major factor blamed for the restriction of women 's access to contraceptives in the region .
The U.S. President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , precludes anyone who does not condemn sex work from getting the money , thereby dampening efforts to fight the epidemic among the most affected women and girls of the region .
Evidence already shows that restricting access to contraceptives and promoting abstinence only approaches does not work .
Therefore Americans must demand that the US government show leadership through revoking the Global Gag rule which only serves to worsen the situation of already marginalized women in the Caribbean region and other poorer parts of the world .
And , for purely humanitarian reasons , Americans should be concerned about the suffering of fellow human beings infected or affected by HIV / AIDS in the Caribbean region .
US citizens should alleviate the suffering of these people , unconditionally and without any ulterior motive through provision of material support for purchasing medicine and supplies .
Humanitarian aid can go a long way to save lives and support orphaned children in the region , thereby averting full - scale destabilization of the region due to the epidemic .
His interview is priceless .

After shouting from the rooftops for months , regularly aggrevating friends and acquaintences and pestering outright strangers standing in line at the grocery store about the travesty of the 911 attacks , I am encouraged to see that the movement to get to the truth is gaining legitimate traction .
A sober , sensible examination of the events of 911 by a growing number of once - duped Americans is well under way , bolstered by an impressive collection of professionals in a wide variety of fields .
The taboo once attached to questioning your government is fading , and rightly so .
The deliberate , insidious lies and procedures that cloaked the facts about the horrible attacks - and later lured the American public and Congress to support the Iraq catastrophe - shows just what persons of the highest power are capable of - in pursuit of hidden agendas , engaged in the worst kind of group - think and without conscience .
Even as skillfull and determined as the detractors have been , with the presumed legitimacy of a federal government as their chief sponsor , the collective lightbulb about the official obfuscation of the truth , the motives behind - and the actual results of the 911 attacks is beginning to glow brightly .
Any five significant elements of the largest crime and mass murder in US history simply can't pass the smell test of the average eigth grader .
And taken in tandem , the excuses / apologies leading to the massive failures in predicting and preventing the attacks - along with the ' offical story ' quickly presented to the public in the aftermath - would cause a second - rate , drunken defense attorney in an actual trial to laugh hysterically at the presiding judge .
Not one shred of the 911 Commission 's final report was subjected to , nor would pass the most basic of evidentiary scrutiny or verification .
Each and every fact that contradicted the offical story , drawn from an immense body of evidence , had to be carefully and deliberately ignored in order to prop up the official version .
The report is , in it 's very essense , a carefully woven fairy tale created while navigating a minefield of political agendas .
None of them , as is now obvious , were honorable .
The first public announcement from the newly formed 911 Investigative Commission was , " ... we 're not out to blame anyone ... "
George Bush vigorously and repeatedly blocked the formation of any investigation into the attacks of 911 .
Would n't one wonder why ?
He succeeded for over fourteen months until pressure from the 911 victim 's families and the general public caused him to relent .
And the political wrangling that made the investigation of the Iran / Contra debacle look like a grade school prank was on .
Simply stated , the 911 Commission was formed as a body determined from the start to support the ' official version ' of the events on 911 , to the exclusion of volumes of contradictory evidence - and myriad documents and witness testimony to the contrary .
A grand apology , for a grand and extraordinary sequence of utter failures of the political , intelligence and military apparatus of the United States .
Yet a complete list of the nineteen alleged suicide hijackers , their photos and connections to al Qaeda and bin Laden was being broadcast by the mainstream bullhorn across the United States within hours - even though no Arab names were found on any passenger list of the hijacked flights .
Lo and behold , America 's new enemy is quickly indentified and located .
I bought it , and so did you - admit it .
I admit that I did n't have the courage to question , to doubt , to look closely .
Few did at the time .
Immediately following the attacks , we Americans had a brand new enemy to replace the former Soviet Union - this time , a worldwide scourge pre-assembled for our convenience .
Military spending and activity could be restored - even incresed - with new and wonderful weapons systems and places to use them .
With public cohesion restored , we could all surrender a few of our constitutional rights , just a few at first , to insure that our protectors , with wonderful new powers , could weed out the alleged evil residing among us - and abroad .
And the US could begin the long - sought return to the world 's center stage with an attack in Afghanistan , the home base of the accused , and remarkably , a long - recognized area of US strategic interest .
Then , with a solid foothold in , and access to the Caspian Basin 's massive oil reserves secured , a campaign of fear and revenge would soon turn toward Iraq , yet another central US strategic interest .
And Weapons of Mass Destruction are a serious matter to fear and a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda called for revenge ...
I mean justice , of course .
Wait - was it Saddam bin Laden or Osama Hussein ?
No matter - in the end , a mix of fear and revenge is a winning combination for public cohesion , and a sure fire way to make American blood boil .
In fact , with only cursory review , each known , main objective of the members of The Project for a New American Century was miraculously being realized .
Some of the members may be familiar - to include Bolton , Feith , Jeb Bush , Libby , Perle , Armitage , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and of course , Cheney .
What a silver lining hath a terrible attack such as 911 .
A bit of groundwork .
A few crucial facts too long overlooked , seldom connected , that can not be disputed :
The World Trade Center Towers , were in fact , a growing economic disaster widely recognized by inner circles since shortly after their completion in the early 70's .
The substantial construction flaws came to be a major embarrassment and the required repairs and rennovations for these immense structures over the years for safety and infrastructure purposes - including hundreds of millions in costs for upcoming , legally required asbestos removal - was daunting .
Ignoring these fundmental , mounting economic realities may result in missing the reasons that the Trade Center Towers were ' terrorists targets ' - twice within eight years .
President Bush 's younger brother Marvin was a member of the board of directors of the company that furnished security for the World Trade Center Complex .
His company also provided security for Logan International Airport , ( departure point for Flights 175 and 11 , both of which stuck the WTC towers ) , and Dulles International Airport , ( departure point for Flight 77 that struck the Pentagon ) .
His company 's contract was scheduled to expire on September 11 , 2001 .
Numerous long - term , World Trade Center Tower employees described regular , highly unusual , and unexplained construction sounds eminating from distant floors of the buildings , months and weeks before the attacks .
The North Tower experienced an announced , yet unprecedented power disruption , ostensibly for improvements and renovation during most of the weekend before 911 .
Entire security systems were rendered non-funtional and a number of witnesses reported a litany of highly unusual activity by groups of mysterious people , sometimes with large equipment that required wheels to move , often during the night .
No video cameras worked .
On 911 , each of the WTC towers was struck into a floor containing a major , highly secure computer center - having received recent , significant upgrades and repairs .
With warnings systems blinking red , what a time to have your pants down :
The Bush administration had cut anti terror funding soon after assuming the White House , even though the bombing of the USS Cole and the US embassies in Tanzania and Zaire had yet to be addressed .
A stunning array of warnings eminated from no less than eleven foreign intelligence agencies including France , Germany , the UK , Italy , Russia and Syria in the months and weeks before the attacks .
Some that were especially specific , warning of hijackings of commercial jets to be used as missles against US targets .
Richard Clark , the chief counter - terrorism expert under four presidents had been removed from the president 's inner circle months before by the National Security Advisor to the President , Condoleezza Rice .
His daily , documented warnings about " an intelligence warning system blinking red " went ignored .
He was repeatedly denied an audience with the president .
Daily Presidential Briefs , ( daily updated assessments of the most important national security threats ) , including one titled " bin Laden determined to strike inside the United States " , and a variety of similar DPBs were also being ignored on a regular basis .
George Bush was on vacation the entire month of August 2001 .
At least two separate FBI investigations of young , hostile Arab men training at flight schools were halted by their supervisors .
Various mid-level FBI managers instructed entire teams of translators of intelligence documents to allow the system to back up , ostensibly in order to acquire additional funding .
A number of crucial documents were found to have been included in this backlog that clearly indicted an impending , unprecedented attack on US soil .
Several supervisors of the Middle east section of the FBI later admitted to suffering from " warnings fatigue " .
The alleged chief hijacker , Mohammad Atta , received $ 100,000 in funding for the 911 operation weeks before the attacks from a Pakistani Intelligence Chief who was having breakfast with two high ranking US intelligence officials on Capital Hill - at the moment that the airliners struck the Trade Center Towers in New York .
Several of the alleged hijackers implicated in the attacks by the FBI had prior associations with various federal agencies and officials .
Five Israeli intelligence officers that videotaped the 911 attacks in New York from across the Hudson River were arrested , questioned and released by the FBI .
Three of these agents were later interviewed on a Dutch television program and they each admitted to having been sent - days before - to document the event .
In the months before the attacks , George Bush personally intervened , and instructed the FBI to " back off " their ongoing investigations into the bin Laden family .
Dick Cheney calls Tom Daschle during the 911 Commission investigation , ( then , the Democratic Majority Leader in the Senate ) , suggesting that the Democratic party would pay a real price if it attempted to air some of the pre 9/11 intelligence issues in public .
( Daschle did , the democratic party did in the next election and the 911 Commission managed to re-obscure much of the pre 911 intelligence simply by ignoring it ) .
The execution and speaking of Cheney :
Vice - president Richard Cheney , four months prior to the 911 attacks , was granted complete command and control of the entire air defense system in the United States , an unprecedented deligation of presidential authority in US history .
The week - long practice drills being held that day were originally scheduled to begin on October 10th , 2001 .
They were rescheduled to begin September 10th , 2001 .
One of the drills that day required a wide assortment of " false blips " , ghost images - indiscernable to actual aircraft - to be inserted into the entire Federal Aviation Administration 's network of radar screens .
These drills also required the bulk of northeastern US air defensive interceptor jets to be dispatched to far flung areas , leaving the Washington and New York areas undefended - the most sensitive airspace on the planet including the nation 's capital and the central command for all US military forces .
When the attacks began , with President Bush in Florida , Richard Cheney was the acting Commander in Chief of the United States and was in complete control from the White House bunker .
No interceptor jets were dispatched until the last of the four airliners had crashed , and no jets from Andrews Air Force base - only 10 miles from DC were employed .
American Airlines Flight 77 reversed it 's course , traveled east for well over forty minutes , ( after it was known to be a hijacking ) , covering over 300 miles , and the large , lumbering passenger jet managed to evade separate , highly sophisticated military radar and executed a remarkable near circling of the Pentagon before impact .
The Pentagon 's multi-tiered missle system did not function .
Donald Rumsfeld admitted on September 10 , 2001 that nearly $ 2.3 trillion in Pentagon spending could not be accounted for .
Flight 77 struck the area of the Pentagon that housed accounting offices .
The unexplained $ 2.3 trillion losses have not been mentioned by the main stream media , nor by any military or political official in a public venue since .
Three separate video tapes from fixed security cameras , two civilian and one belonging to the State of Virginia , were seized by the FBI within minutes of the impact and explosion at the Pentagon and have been classified .
Countless FOIA requests for their release have been ignored .

The blast hit the army recruiting centre in the small hours
Scene of blast
The centre was empty and no - one was injured in the pre-dawn blast , which smashed a glass window .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the bombing did not appear to be an act of terrorism but the investigation was in its early stages .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the attack on the recruiting office was an insult to US forces personnel .
" The fact that this appears deliberately targeted at the recruiting station insults every one of our brave men and women in uniform stationed around the world , " Mr Bloomberg said at a news conference .
He said New Yorkers would not be intimidated .
" New York City is back and is open for business ...
People are going about their business , shopping , working and sightseeing . "
' Not sophisticated '
New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said a witness saw a person on a bicycle wearing a backpack and acting suspiciously shortly before the blast .
Mr Kelly said the bomb was in a military ammunition case and was " not particularly sophisticated " .
After the explosion in the early hours of Thursday , police cars blocked nearby streets as the bomb squad gathered evidence .
The centre is on a traffic island in the middle of the square and is surrounded by streets , theatres and restaurants .
The recruiting station is one of the busiest in the US and has occasionally been the site of anti-war protests .
Witnesses staying at a Times Square hotel told the Associated Press news agency that they heard a " big bang " and could feel the building shake .
A plume of smoke was also visible after the explosion , they said .
At one point , subway trains passed through Times Square station without stopping but normal service later resumed .
A speech by famed chess player Garry Kasparov was interrupted Saturday by a remote controlled flying penis .
Since many of you are at work or school we ’ll leave all the pictures , videos , and tasteless jokes after the break .
LOLDongs definitely are n’t the main order of business in this office , but we have to admire the child like glee the builder of this contraption must have experienced .
RC helicopters definitely are our expertise as we ’ve covered several mini RC helicopter projects before : using an IR camera for position tracking , quad - copters at CCCamp , and basic building tips , but never anything so… turgid .
While first watching the video , we too were struck by the similarities to the infamous griefing attack on Second Life land baron Anshe Chung in 2006 .
While there does n’t appear to be any hard evidence this was inspired by its virtual counterpart it is interesting to see the crossover into the real world .
In both cases , the end result is the same : a room full of chuckles , an embarrassed speaker , and the blogosphere suddenly becomes dick pundits .
At least we can agree on this : some things just were n’t meant to be airborne .

Has it really been five years already ?
Wow , time really flies with the distractions of life .
So many things going on that sometimes it ’s pretty easy to forget about you .
I remember way back when you were projected to be this little $ 50 - 60 billion " conflict . "
But my how you ’ve grown !
It ’s hard to believe that now you ’re projected total cost is $ 3 trillion ... that ’s a lot of zeros !
Your ability to suck all the resources of this nation is quite something .
The infrastructure of our nation is suffering in innumerable ways because of the lack of available money .
It will likely take near an entire generation to recover from you ... whenever you stop .
And how do we even recover from the human losses and tragedies ?
You know damn well we ’ve created another generation of mentally ill war vets , just like those from Vietnam we all see wandering the streets of our major cities .
Over 200,000 have applied for disability benefits .
Then there ’s the 3990 fatalities in the US forces , and by extension 3990 families that have been changed forever .
So many of them seem to be young parents .
I do n’t want to forget the other 308 coalition deaths , the 29,314 US wounded , or countless Iraqi deaths and injuries .
And by countless I mean countless .
Nobody really knows .
But since they started trying to keep track in 2005 there have been 47,000 fatalities .
So war , I really think it ’s about time you and I went our seperate ways .
I do n’t think I can handle another year of you .
But to be realistic I know how tricky it can be to end these kind of dysfuctional realtionships , so I ’ll just hope that next year at this time we ’ll both have moved on and have started the healing process .
Spore , Mass Effect PC to Require Online Validation Every Ten Days to Function
Original story : BioWare technical producer Derek French has said that the PC versions of both Mass Effect and Spore will make use of copy protection that will require online validation every ten days in order for the games to continue working .
" After the first activation , SecuROM requires that [ Mass Effect PC ] re-check with the server within ten days ( in case the CD Key has become public / warez 'd and gets banned ) , " said French in a post on the BioWare forums .
If customers do not come online after ten days , the game will cease to function .
" After 10 days a re-check is required before the game can run , " added French . " .. An internet connection is not required to install , just to activate the first time , and every 10 days after . "
The check is run when users activate the game 's executable file , with the first re-check coming within " 5 days remaining in the 10 day window . "
According to French , Maxis '
Spore will also make use of the same scheme : " [ Electronic Arts ] is ready for us and getting ready for Spore , which will use the same system . "
French also noted that the online requirement will be clearly labeled on the games ' packaging .
' Awkward moment ' for McCain on DeGeneres Show
Perhaps presidential candidate John McCain should have known what to expect when he appeared Wednesday on the Ellen DeGeneres Show .
In a preview clip that the hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe called an " awkward moment , " DeGeneres raised the topic of her upcoming marriage to Portia de Rossi , saying to McCain , " let 's talk about the big elephant in the room . "
" I think that people should be able to enter into legal agreements , " McCain replied uncomfortably .
" I just believe in the unique status of marriage between man and woman . "
However , he went on to reassure DeGeneres , " We just have a disagreement , and I along with many , many others wish you every happiness . "
" Thank you , " DeGeneres replied .
She added teasingly , " So you 'll walk me down the aisle ?
Is that what you 're saying ? "
" Touche , " McCain acknowledged .
McCain opposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in 2004 , but he later stated that he would support such a ban , and he attacked Romney 's statements of support for gay rights during last winter 's primaries .
There has been recent speculation that he might try to turn the recent California Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage into an issue for the general election .

Is that Salt Lake City or Memphis in the background ?
Tough to tell the difference .
The 787 is a remarkable improvement on efficiency , so it is not as though there is nothing being done on this front .
It was not until the past two years that it became obvious that miles per gallon is going to be the most important thing in a vehicle purchase , but it can take ten years to develop an aircraft .
Unless my math is off , we need to give them another eight years .
3年以上前に過去形で語っている話ですが、かつて自分の作ったバグを記録していたことがあります( http://dev.ariel-networks.com/blog/inoue.php?blogid=2&archive=2004-9-17)。
この時の結論は、バグの大半がAPIの仕様の理解不足から生じていた、でした。ここの「API」という用語は、非常に広義な意味で使っています。21世紀になって自分の作るバグの多くがマルチスレッド絡みになってきたという変化はありますが、APIの仕様の理解不足がバグの要因として大きい事実は変わっていません。
上記の記事では、次のようにも書いています。
当時、言語仕様の理解不足で生じるバグを作ることは無くなっていました。
ほとん どC言語オンリーで、かつ充分に経験を積んでいたので、言語仕様の理解不足で作るバグはありませんでした。
時代の要請か、多くのプログラミング言語を使う機会が増えました。ひとつひとつの言語に対する理解が浅いせいか、今の方が言語仕様の理解不足で作るバグが増えたようです。先日のRubyで作ったバグ(
http://dev.ariel-networks.com/Members/inoue/ruby-and-bugs)も、この例です。
言語が高級になっていることも要因のひとつかもしれません。いくつかはコンパイル型言語でないことも影響しているかもしれません。長らく、コンパイラにバグを見つけさせる技術を磨いてきたので、コンパイラが無いと大きな武器を失った気分になるのです。
今日 はJavaScriptでのバグの話です。実は自分の作ったバグではありませんが、恐いバグだと感じました。
バグには、恐いバグと恐くないバグがあります。バグを作っても、今後、同じようなバグを作らない対策を打てるバグはあまり恐くありません。ある種のコーディングで同じバグを防げることが分かるなら、バグの経験は良い経験です。一方、同じようなバグを作らない対策が、今後気をつける、しか無いバグは恐いです。注意していても忘れるからです。うっかりコードを書いてもバグを防ぎたいのです。ミスはコンパイル時に検出できればベストです。最悪でも実行時にそれと分かりたいのです。このために、いわゆる防衛的なコーディングとして知られる技術があります。
JavaScriptの恐いバグの話に戻ります。
prototype.jsのバージョン1.5.xを使っていたコードでした。そのコードはElement(prototype.jsが定義したクラス)のオブジェクトに独自に select というプロパティを加えていました。用途はフラグ変数でした。
prototype.jsのバージョンをv1.6.0.2に上げた時、問題が発生しました。prototype.js側で、Elementクラスにselectというメソッドが追加されていたためです。フラグ変数を期待していた参照箇所がすべて真になりました。
些細な話と思うのは簡単ですが、ぼくはこの話を聞いて恐いと思いました。外部ライブラリの更新で壊れるコードは、JavaScriptに限りませんが、このケースの場合、決してエラーは起きませんし、防衛するためにどう書けばよいのか分からないからです。
selectはフラグとして名称がおかしいので、selectedにすべきだった、という指摘はもっともですが、プログラマはそんなに予知的ではありません。第一、この指摘は本質的ではありません。selectedというプロパティがprototype.js側で追加されれば同じことだからです。
A former Kuwaiti detainee at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay carried out a recent suicide bombing in northern Iraq , the US military has said .
A spokesman for US Central Command told the Associated Press that Abdullah al - Ajmi took part in an attack in Mosul on 29 April that killed several people .
Ajmi and two other Kuwaitis blew up two explosive - packed vehicles next to Iraqi security forces , media reports say .
The US transferred Ajmi to Kuwaiti custody from Guantanamo Bay in 2005 .
He was later acquitted by a Kuwaiti court of terrorism charges .
According to Kuwaiti and pan-Arab media reports , Ajmi and his two alleged accomplices , Nasir al - Dawsari and Badr al - Harbi , were able to leave Kuwait a month ago without alerting the attention of the authorities because they had wrongly been issued new passports .
They then travelled to Syria , where Ajmi is reported to have told his family of his intentions , before heading onto Iraq .
The families of Ajmi and Harbi reportedly later received anonymous calls informing them that the men had died in Iraq .
Katara is not a vegetarian
I just had a long vacation and got to spend a lot of time with Katara , which is why she 's popping up so much all of a sudden .
I seem to have gotten into Mimi Smartypants mode .
I will return to the regularly - scheduled discussions of programming and mathematics shortly .
But since I seem to have written two articles in a row ( [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) on the subject of telling kids the difficult truth , I thought I 'd try to finish up this one , which has been mostly done for months now .
Also there was a recent episode that got me thinking about it again .
I went to visit Katara at school last week , and stayed for lunch .
I was seated with Katara and three other little girls .
As the food was served , one of the girls , Riley , made some joke about how the food cart contained guinea pigs instead .
This sort of joke is very funny to preschoolers .
My sense of humor is very close to a preschooler 's , and I would have thought that this was funny if she had said that the food cart contained clocks , or nose hairs , or a speech in defense of the Corn Laws , or the Trans - Siberian Railroad , or fish - shaped solid waste .
But she said guinea pigs , and instead of laughing , I mused aloud that I had never eaten a guinea pig .
Riley informed me that " You ca n't eat guinea pigs !
They 're animals , not food . "
" Sure you can , " I said .
" Meat is made from animals . "
Riley got this big grin on her face , the one that preschoolers get when they know that the adults are teasing them , and said " Nawww ! " " Yes , " I said .
" Meat comes from animals . "
Riley shook her head .
She knew I was joking .
A general discussion ensued , with Katara taking my side , and another girl , Flora , taking Riley's .
In the end , I did not convince them .
" Well , " I said , mostly to myself , at the end , " you girls are in for a rude awakening someday . "
Now , I know that not everyone is as direct as I am .
And I know that not all non-vegetarians are as concerned as I am about the ethics of eating meat .
But wow .
I would have thought that someone would have explained to these girls where meat came from , just as a point of interest if nothing else .
Or maybe they would have made the connection between chicken - the - food and chicken - the - farm - animal .
I mean , they are constantly getting all these stories set on farms .
Since three - year - olds ask about a billion questions a day .
they must ask around a thousand questions a day about the farms , so how is it that the subject never came up ?
Katara was accidentally exposed to a movie version of Charlotte 's Web on an airplane , and the plot of Charlotte 's Web is that Charlotte is trying to save Wilbur from being turned into smoked ham .
Left to myself I would n't have exposed Katara to Charlotte 's Web so soon — it is too long for her , for one thing — but my point here is that the world is full of reminders of the true nature of meat , and they can be hard to avoid .
So I was very surprised when it turned out that these two age - mates of Katara 's were so completely unaware of it .
Anyway , Katara has known from a very early age where meat comes from .
Early in her meat - eating career , probably before she was two years old , I specifically explained it to her .
I wanted to make sure that she understood that meat comes from animals .
Because there are serious ethical issues involved when one eats animals , and I think they must be considered .
We may choose to kill and destroy thinking beings to make food , but we should at least be aware that that is what is happening .
I 'm not sure I think it is evil , but I want to at least be aware of the possibility .
I have never been a vegetarian , but I want to try to face the ethical results of that choice head on , and not pretend that they are not there .
I did not want Katara growing up to identify meat with sterile packages in the supermarket .
Meat was once alive , moving around with its own agenda , and I think it is important to understand this .
So I made an effort to bring up the subject at home , and then one day when Katara was around twenty months old we went to a Chinese restaurant that has live fish in tanks at the front of the restaurant , and you can ask them to take one of these fish into the kitchen to be cooked for your dinner .
Katara has loved to eat fish since she was a tiny baby .
We ordered a striped bass , and then I took Katara to look at the fish in the tanks .
I explained to her that these fish swimming in the tanks were for people to eat , and that when we ordered our fish for dinner , a waiter came out and caught one of the fish in a net , took it back to the kitchen , and they killed it and were cooking it for us .
As I said , I had made the point before , but never so directly .
We had never before seen the live animals that were turned into food for us .
I really did not know how Katara would respond to this .
Some people have a very strong negative response when they first learn that meat comes from animals , so negative that they never eat meat again .
But I thought Katara should know the truth and make her own decision about how to respond .
Katara 's response was to point at one of the striped bass and say " I want to eat that one . "
Then she took me to each tank in turn , and told me me which kind of fish she wanted to eat and which ones she did not want to eat .
( She favored the fish - looking fish , and rejected the crabs , shrimp , and eels . )
Then when the fish arrived on our table Katara asked if it had been swimming in the tank , and I said it had .
" Yum yum , " said Katara , and dug in .

Do you call this governing ?
First impeachment is off the table , now filibuster too ?
From a recent New York Times editorial , In Search of a Congress :
“ We support the filibuster as the only way to ensure a minority in the Senate can be heard .
When the cloture votes failed this week , the Democrats should have let the Republicans filibuster .
Democratic leaders think that ’s too risky , since Congress could look like it ’s not doing anything .
But it ’s not doing a lot now . ”
It ’s not like they actually brought a piece of legislation to a vote .
I totally agree with the Times that the Democrats should call the Republican bluff .
I would love a filibuster on the subject of this so - called war on terror .
I ’ll bet it would n’t last a week .
The majority is against this war , the people are against this war .
Can you really imagine all the bushdog Democrats and all the lapdog Republicans spouting their lame support for the war , for days on end .
Only four votes out of fortyfour need to switch to force a vote and really start to wind down this war .
If the Democratic leadership in the Senate does not allow filibuster , then logically they plan to allow this war to continue without end , and they plan to ignore / defy the will of the people .
This so - called leadership will say that filibuster is too risky , a waste of time , there will be a veto anyway .
What they ’re really saying , is that they would rather defy the will of the people then defy this poor excuse for a president and his corrupt administration .
Democrats in Congress are so risk averse , they ca n’t even see the possibility of real rewards .
A bit of wishful thinking perhaps .
Can you imagine if these Democrats actually helped bring a war to an end , restore Habeus Corpus , restore the rule of law , restore the balance of power , restore the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
Can you imagine the goodwill of the people towards the Congress ?
Well , maybe not , but it would be a hell of a good start .

Southern Metropolis Daily , a newspaper based in the delta , reports that abuses remain rampant in factories despite efforts by campaigners in China and abroad .
The abuses might have become worse as wages have begun to rise in recent years , prompting businesses to seek new ways to cut costs .
The newspaper was tipped off by residents living close to the street market .
One local man , Mr Shao , said he had watched children being " sold like cabbages " .
A reporter , posing as a clothing factory manager , was allowed to inspect would - be " employees " by patting their arms and stomachs .
He agreed to pay them 3.5 yuan ( about 50 ¢ ) an hour .
Many had fake papers saying they were over 18 ; when asked , most were between 13 and 15 .
One was seven , another nine .
The newspaper said many came from the same area of Sichuan — Liangshan county — where 76 children have been reported as missing since the Chinese New Year in February .
One of the most disturbing findings was that local officials seemed to be complicit .
A foreman , who produced officially stamped documents concerning the children , said : " We have the complete right to manage them , by any means .
You only need to sign a work agreement with us . "
The newspaper was told stories of hundreds of children being sent to electronics and toy factories across southern China .
Although run by the local government , Southern Metropolis Daily is encouraged to make money and breaks genuine stories to do so .
Its staff have paid the price in the past , with a number being jailed on dubious bribery charges .
On this occasion , some of the allegations have been confirmed by state mouthpieces , the China Daily and Xinhua news agency .
The China Daily reported more than 1000 children were found toiling in factories in Dongguan .
Police had so far rescued more than 100 children , the paper reported , as it carried a photo of a young girl crying after emerging from her place of work .
Authorities had set up a task force to rescue all the other children and prosecute those behind the illegal labour ring , local authorities were quoted as saying .
In a similar case last year , hundreds of young men were found working as slave labour in a string of brick kilns across northern China .
Lured with promises of high wages , they were locked up and , in some cases , beaten to death .
That prompted the passing of a long - awaited labour law aimed at better protecting workers ' rights .
Some of the foremen in the latest case have been arrested .
TELEGRAPH , AFP KEY POINTS
■ Children sold as slave labour at 50 cents an hour .
■
Officials complicit in trade in children as young as seven .
■ Factories export electronics and toys .
Are Fear and Pain Making Your World Smaller and Smaller ?
Trapped In A World of Pain
Do you remember as a child , when the world seemed endless , and every stone was full of possibility ?
And whatever we knew of the world , was only a beginning — a glimpse of endless knowledge that we could only dream of .
What happened to that world ?
It seems so far away .
Do you feel that some or all of the possibility of youth is gone ?
Has your inner world become full of pain ?
Has it grown small , hard , and closed ?
Do you feel at the mercy of a hundred little forces that move you to act in ways that you ’re not proud of ?
You ’re not alone .
Injury and Healing
When an area of the body is injured , it often swells to contain that damage , and accelerate healing .
That swelling is a temporary protection .
If an area of skin is irritated , again and again , it ca n’t heal .
Instead , the body builds up thick skin , a callus , in that place .
The callus is stronger than regular skin , but much less sensitive .
The body gives up the sensitivity , in exchange for strength .
Something similar happens with our emotions .
We suffer emotional injury .
But sadly , we ’re not very good at healing emotional pain .
Many of our emotional injuries remain open wounds .
We continue to encounter situations , people , and challenges that strike at our emotional injuries , and revive or increase the pain .
Often the strongest pain comes when we face our own failures , contradictions , hypocrisy , and lies .
Unable to heal our pain , we try to hide from it .
We hide from the things that expose , and deepen our pain .
And from situations that remind us of parts of ourselves that we would like to forget .
We develop a network of mental and emotional habits which form an armor or thick skin to protect an ever - growing collection of sensitive spots .
We become harder , colder , and less sensitive .
We become less thoughtful about who we are , what is possible for us , and how we are ignoring that possibility .
As we stagger under the weight of our emotional pain , it seems sensible to build up armor against the world ’s dangers , and against pain .
Through the cloud of our pain , the world ’s extraordinary possibility seems distant .
We are ready to abandon that possibility to escape our pain .
But our armor fails us , falls away , and our sensitive spots are exposed .
We are haunted , by our contradictions and lies , and the extraordinary possibility within us .
The thicker the armor , the more we hurt when the weak spot is irritated .
It feels to us like someone stuck a needle in an infected wound .
Is it any surprise , as we strike out to protect ourselves , that our emotional reactions are wild , negative , and cruel ?
Beyond Pain and Comfort
As a machine is used , it inevitably collects dirt and grime .
As we grow old , arteries get clogged , and organs weaken .
And as we age , we collect limiting and destructive habits and beliefs and fears .
Someday science will learn to clean and rejuvenate our bodies .
Until then , physical decay is inevitable .
But even today , the common personal decay within us that crushes possibility is not inevitable .
This decay of the spirit can be stopped , and even reversed .
But , not through hiding from the pain , and pretending that it does n’t exist .
When we feel emotional pain , we often seek comfort .
Sometimes that comfort is the comfort of sleep — erasing every pain , and every challenge .
At other times , we are prepared to live with our pain .
But we look for another sort of comfort .
We want to find meaning in that pain , or at least meaning somewhere else in our lives .
We look for meaning through relationships , children , success , community , religion , spirituality , etc .
I have to find something outside of me that seems more important than I am .
I need to find a big something that I can call myself a part of .
If I can find that meaning , then all of the pain might be worth it .
Forever Young
The search for meaning is a wonderful quest .
But is there meaning only outside me ?
Where is the meaning within me ?
I believe that our greatest opportunity to live a meaningful life is born when we choose possibility over pain .
The love of possibility overpowers the escape from pain .
This is the road to personal development .
Can we love the truth again ?
Can we find the courage to accept what we have done with our lives so far ?
Can we release an inexhaustible thirst to see where we are , and accept our pain ?
When we find that thirst , the little habits of mind and heart that bind us , lose most of their power .
Opening our eyes means that we will be confronted with our personal history .
At first this is troubling , as the pain of our history seems to overshadow everything else .
We need to see clearly where we have been , so we can see where we are .
And seeing our history clearly is only a small part of what we want from clear vision .
I want to look to a place that now seems far away , at the edge of a strange world .
I want to look for the full measure of who I can be .
It may have been a long time since I was willing to see the endless possibility that lies deep within me .
My eyes may have grown weak from living in a place far away from light .
The endless light may seem blinding and frightening .
Whatever I think I am , is only a shadow of what I can be .
My inner self may seem old and weak .
But deep within me , my light and my possibility , and my ability to become someone great is forever young .
That possibility will not be denied forever .
The government has argued that the changes are a women 's rights issue , while opponents have said they are indicative of the Islamization of Turkish society .
The final vote on the constitutional reform package received 411 " yes " votes in the 550 - seat parliament .
The two proposed amendments needed a two - thirds majority , or 367 votes , to pass .
Constitutional Issue
The package amends the constitution to read that everyone has the right to equal treatment from state institutions such as universities and that no one can be barred from education for reasons not clearly laid down by law .
Turkey 's ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) submitted the amendments under a deal with the opposition National Movement Party ( MHP ) .
The proposals were passed in an initial parliamentary vote on February 6 .
The Islamic - rooted government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan must now prepare legislation to change parts of the law on higher education for the ban to be lifted .
But the main opposition party , the Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) , has vowed to go to the Constitutional Court in an attempt to block the changes .
In a final appeal today , CHP parliamentary group Chairman Kemal Anadol urged lawmakers to avoid a move that will " lead to chaos in society . "
Tens of thousands of people gathered in central Ankara to voice their opposition to the reform .
" They [ the government ] are playing an evil game with Turkey , " said Abdullah Gulen , who attended the protests .
" That is why we gathered here to stop this evil game .
We all , as enlightened people , want to stop this evil game . "
A similar demonstration a week ago in the capital drew tens of thousands of people at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the founder of the Turkish republic who entrenched secularism .
The government argues the ban means many girls are denied an education , and points to public - opinion polls that show that two - thirds of Turks support lifting the ban as evidence that the moves are democratic .
Establishment groups such as the judiciary , business organizations , and academics have all condemned the plan to lift the restrictions , saying this is a first step to allowing Islam to figure more prominently in public life .
The military has refused to get involved in the debate but has made it clear they are watching events carefully .
Compromise Deal
To allay concerns , and as part of the compromise deal with the nationalists , the legislation places limits on the freedom to wear a head scarf at universities .
The ban will remain in other areas of public life , including civil service .
And the changes allow only the traditional head covering , which is more or less loosely knotted under the chin , while excluding the wrap - around version .
A strict head - scarf ban has been in force in Turkish universities since the late 1990s .
But the situation has become increasingly ambiguous with some rectors declining to enforce the ban .
We 're all familiar with news talk shows where two individuals , both with impressive credentials , argue for completely incompatible positions .
Unfortunately , these sorts of arguments are n't limited to social or political issues , but have increasingly extended into the scientific and medical realms .
Aside from providing an indication that you can find someone with an M.D. or Ph.D. that 's willing to say nearly anything ( see infomercials for further evidence ) , these disagreements are likely to leave the public confused over where to find credible scientific information .
Separating the scientific wheat from the chaff
The importance of quality information was driven home by a recent study that revealed a tendency for false or misleading information regarding breast cancer to appear on web sites devoted to alternative medicine .
So , how is the public supposed to identify quality scientific information ?
The recent American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting included a session devoted to understanding how the public receives and evaluates scientific information .
Carl Bialik , The Wall Street Journal 's numbers guy , discussed the problems the public has in terms of receiving decent numerical information .
Bialik cited various examples of news stories that pushed numbers with phony precision , originated from invalid samples , or presented inappropriate statistical measures .
Bialik suggested that part of the problem is with readers and viewers , who like to have concrete numbers to hang on to but rarely care enough to explore how those numbers are generated .
On the production side , a lot of the unexpected statistics get played as human interest stories , drawing someone other than a qualified science reporter .
Pressed for time , the stories go out without a detailed examination .
Bialik 's solution involved researchers working with journalists to ensure that numbers are presented properly ; the American Statistical Association also keeps a list of members willing to work with the press .
For the public , the message seemed to be that a story should n't be trusted simply because it had numbers attached to it .
David Goldston , the former staff director for Congress ' House Committee on Science , focused on the challenges of communicating scientific information to lawmakers .
His message was that , contrary to popular opinion , most members of Congress like science and want to be informed .
Scientists , however , have a lot to learn about reaching them on their terms .
The first issue is where to reach them .
Scientists , like everyone else , get a buzz out of visits to the Hill , but Goldston argued that they should visit members of Congress in their home district if possible — they 'll be competing with fewer people for attention there .
Once the visit starts , scientists should expect to be treated with respect , but they need to remember to return that ; most members of Congress and their staffs do have the ability to understand scientific issues if they 're well explained .
As for the actual communications , Goldston emphasized that researchers need to delineate when they 're talking about science , and when they 're talking about policy .
As he put it , policy is acting despite residual scientific uncertainties , and the most reasonable action can't be determined scientifically , so it needs to be made clear when someone drifts into personal opinion .
The science has to be conveyed in clear terms that make sense to a nonscientific audience .
" Only use metaphors when what they 're substituting for is actually confusing , " Goldston said , " and make sure they are n't more confusing than the issue . "
What to do when expertise does n't matter
With the press and politicians covered , Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control talked about a public issue that never used to be contentious : vaccination .
She cited estimates suggesting that public vaccination efforts have saved the US $ 43 billion and prevented 1.8 million cases that would have led to tens of thousands of deaths .
Despite the lack of evidence for harm , however , vaccines are getting the blame for a variety of childhood ailments , and more parents are deliberately opting out of vaccination programs .
In the US , about 0.3 percent of parents are now opting out ; Schuchat says that these families cluster , demonstrating how opting out is a largely social phenomenon .
Unfortunately , it also enhances the risk of disease outbreaks .
Schuchat mostly discussed how personal concerns fed in to vaccination decisions .
" Fifty years ago , disease was very real to parents , " she stated , noting that parents put forward 1.8 million schoolchildren to take part in testing of the polio vaccine simply because polio was a concrete risk , while the risks of the vaccine were abstract and minor in comparison .
Now , with most vaccine - targeted diseases existing only in the memories of older family members , the risks of vaccination — discomfort , a rare adverse reaction , even unfounded rumors of an autism link — seem more concrete than the disease itself .
How do medical authorities overcome these perceived risks ?
Simply speaking from a position of authority is n't enough , Schuchat argued .
She cited surveys indicating that , for credibility assessments in areas of " low concern " ( she suggested Tsunami risk in foreign countries as one example ) , US citizens are happy to defer to expertise , rating it as accounting for 85 percent of their assessment .
When the topic shifts to areas of personal concern like family medicine , the importance of expertise vanishes .
Schuchat said that it drops to where it accounts for only 15 percent of the decision , equal to a sense of honesty and openness , and far below the value of empathy , which accounts for roughly half of the decision .
The message was pretty clear ; for the public , how decent medical information is conveyed counts for more than the quality of the information itself .
The clear message of the session was that a command of facts is never going to be good enough to convince most segments of the public , whether they 're parents or Congress .
How the information is conveyed can matter more than its content , and different forms of communication may be necessary for different audiences .
As became clear in the ensuing discussion , most of the public act as consumers of information , with journalists acting as middlemen .
To connect with the public , scientists have to work with the press to ensure that two things happen .
Reporters have to overcome their ingrained aversion to the uncertainties of science , and have to avoid presenting uncertainties as a matter of balance that 's addressed via material from crackpots with credentials .
May 1st was RSS Awareness Day and while I have a seriously vested interest in this topic , I chose not to observe it .
Why ?
In short , I was busy on other business but also I ’ve had this subject gnawing at me and it just took a few days to compose my thoughts .
Let ’s take a look at the main areas that RSS companies , like NewsGator , focus on and score the success :
Blog syndication :
This is game over , RSS is the prevailing mechanism by which blogs are syndicated , and a great many people consume blog and traditional media content through dedicated readers or start pages that have generic RSS capabilities .
Enterprise : Success here has been more elusive .
We are doing a robust business in the enterprise but selling a generic RSS platform into large companies is laborious and time intensive .
As I have noted before , there is a broad disconnect between IT organizations and how users actually employ technology , RSS is a great example of this divide .
Widgets : Strong success here , we have been deploying a widgets / data service to media companies that is entirely built on RSS technology .
We are currently delivering 200 million widget impressions a month at this point , suggesting that RSS powered widgets are a bright spot .
Media :
Too many media sites put out partial text feeds , this impairs the ability of companies to build next generation consumption applications that rely on some degree of keyword / entity extraction for semantic features .
Start pages : Great RSS use case here , it is estimated that about 60 % of the activity in popular start pages is reading RSS feeds .
Authenticated Feeds :
In a nutshell , this is a disappointing area because the overwhelming majority of applications that could deliver personalized and user / password protected feeds just do n’t .
These applications include all of the popular enterprise applications and even popular on - demand apps like Salesforce.com .
Feed Monetization : Mixed results here , FeedBurner enables dropping in of contextualized advertising but it ’s not apparent that many people are doing this with great success .
The problem with putting ads in feeds is that it ’s to easy for client applications to strip out the ad units automatically .
Desktop Client Apps :
Of course we enjoy market dominating success here but it ’s not shocking to suggest that desktop RSS apps appeal to a core heavy use audience and growth will be minimal to moderate at best .
Mobile RSS :
There are apps for mobile devices but none have really broken out as success stories .
It ’s my observation that applying a desktop RSS consumption mode to a mobile device is a nonstarter .
Attention Streaming :
This is something I am intensely interested in .
We , as in a small group of leading companies , are just starting to get some momentum here so prognosis is good .
APML : A promising initiative but while a lot of apps are generating it , very few are actually consuming it .
I would also wager that a lot of potential developer partners are probably waiting for APML to move into a traditional standards process before committing .
I think this was a failing of OPML as well , lacking a third party to move it forward it just plateaued .
A lot of applications use OPML , for sure , but it ’s all manual … imagine how much farther along we would be if there was a common feed store that enabled all applications that can consume subscription information to access a subscription , rather than having to update every application with new subscription information manually ?
# 10 is where I want to start with in terms of continued discussion .
Basically the entire RSS market has been built around a use mode of subscribe - then - read , and that is likely to continue as an exclusive model for many users or in parallel to other use modes .
The weakness in this approach is that you only know what you know , as in you have know about a feed before you can subscribe to it … and I generally work off the approach that it ’s far more likely that the best content on any keyword is not necessarily found in my OPML .
There are an increasing array of companies that are working on a next generation of feed consumption use model , built not around the explicit subscribing of feeds and chronological consumption of content .
In order for RSS to get to the next level of mainstreaming we have to think in terms of behavioral filtering of content and discovery of new content sources based on explicit preferences or inferred preferences derived from behaviors .
This is exciting for me as a user .
I think one of the reasons why Techmeme has proven to be a consistent favorite is that this next generation model is partly how Gabe built the system .
Through using Techmeme I am essentially outsourcing feed discovery to the service and consuming content not based on subscriptions but topics .
As a users , ordinary or power , I would like to have a personal Techmeme that delivers content based on my consumption habits , or put another way , my attention streams .
To further develop this model , I would like to see a social dimension develop that pushes up / down content based on a collaborative filter that takes into account my social graph and what they are consuming and rating , explicitly or otherwise .
The problem with rating that we need to overcome is that a very small percentage of people will actually score content , so that ’s why the attention streams become valuable , through activities they are effectively scoring content .
For enterprises this is nothing but goodness , but unfortunately it will likely be that enterprise users are the last to benefit from these advances because they are dependent upon IT .
It will happen but the use cases we have to build to will be specific and in some cases tedious in an effort to get a flywheel spinning that elevates RSS in the enterprise to a strategic focus .
Lastly , RSS is an ideal syndication technology for publishers to take advantage of to expand audience and monetization of content .
The missing link up until recently is widget technology , because inserting ads directly into feeds is a nonstarter in my opinion .
Charlene Li said it best when she said “ wigets are RSS in a dress ” .
Charlene , who attributed the quote to someone else , was n’t being facetious or otherwise inappropriate , she was observing something deceptively simple , widgets present a use mode that average users like because it puts them in control while presenting a visually compelling experience .
With traffic acquisition costs being what they are , media sites are unlikely to see significant growth in site traffic using linear techniques like adding more pages and / or better SEO .
“ Going viral ” is popular to say but hard to do , widgets offer a simple and low cost mechanism for publishers to use to drive additional site traffic not by getting site traffic but by dispersing content to a variety of destinations , including social networking pages , blogs , start pages , and non-affiliated websites .
On balance RSS has been an exciting area to mine away in , with a diverse range of target markets , use cases , and a broad array of interesting companies .
It ’s here to stay but at the same time is begging for a new interaction model to drive broad mass market adoption ; it ’s still too geek .
RSS in media is the ideal syndication technology and with newer technologies like widgets , finally able to be monetized .
Sicklerville , NJ – Even if President Bush wo n’t admit it , Americans know a recession when they ’re in it .
And things could get worse .
As bank interest drops , stuffing the mattress with bills becomes more attractive every day .
Sam Willis ’ patented Money Mattress is selling fast .
“ The traditional method of stuffing cash between the mattress and box spring can leave bills musty , ” said Willis .
“ Our patented intra-mattress money box keeps currency fresh while providing the security of knowing your stash is safe at home . ”
The Money Mattress hit the market last June , at the same time as Sealy ’s Dreaming for Dollars .
However , Willis’ Money Mattress has outsold Sealy ’s model four to one thanks in part to his ingenious detailing .
Every Money Mattress features unique and custom staining through the use of vintage materials .
“ They ’ve achieved real authenticity with body fluids and bed bug blemishes , ” said mattress market analyst Mark Windsor .
“ No way anyone would suspect there ’s money hidden in one of these . ”
Willis cautions against keeping US dollars in the mattress , advising on Euros , gold and silver pieces , or yen , which tend to hold their value better .
“ With the prices rising so sharply on the average American ’s household purchases , you ca n’t be too careful . ”
In the Rhine Valley city of Mannheim , the glittering minaret of Germany 's biggest mosque overshadows what was once the region 's most vibrant church , testifying to Muslims ' new confidence as Christian churches are closing down .
Years ago , 180 sisters of the Catholic order of the Sisters of the Divine Savior were the pulse of the city .
Today , eight remain .
Every weekend , roughly 150 Roman Catholics attend mass at the Liebfrauen Church , while up to 3,000 Muslims throng the Yavuz - Sultan - Selim mosque .
Since the mosque was opened in 1995 , Muslim shops and youth centers have become a magnet for the Muslim community .
Mannheim is not unique .
Across Europe , the Continent 's fastest - growing religion is establishing its public presence after decades in basements and courtyards , changing not only the architectural look of cities , but also their social fabrics .
Hailed by many as a sign of Muslim integration , the phenomenon is also feared as evidence of a parallel Islamic world threatening Europe 's Christian culture .
" Muslims have come out ... and have become visible , " says Claus Leggewie , a political scientist at Germany 's University of Giessen who wrote a study on the evolution of the mosque landscape in Germany .
" By building expensive , representative mosques , they 're sending a message : we want to take part in the symbolic landscape of Germany .
We are here and we 'll stay here . "
Major mosque projects from Cologne , Germany , to Amsterdam to Seville , Spain , have met with fierce opposition and fears that they will serve as breeding grounds for terrorists .
Family members of two of the suspects in the Glasgow , Scotland , car bombings this month said the men had been radicalized by Tablighi Jamaat , an Islamic revivalist group with plans for an 18 - acre complex near London 's 2012 Olympic stadium that would house Europe 's largest mosque .
A local debate in Wiesbaden
Such a structure is a far cry from the dark , cramped basement that hosted Halif Kuzpinar 's Friday prayers for 33 years after he left his native Turkey to work on Frankfurt 's roads .
Then , the Muslim group he belongs to bought a vacant supermarket in a residential neighborhood of Wiesbaden , a city in central Germany .
" There are parking spots .
Children can come .
There are better facilities for the youths , " says Mr. Kuzpinar .
" We want to build something nice so that people can come and see what we 're doing . "
With a place of its own , Milli Gorus – an Islamic Turkish rights group watched by the German government – is looking for something it never had : public recognition in a country its members consider theirs .
But it also ignited vehement protest .
" This was to be sold as a supermarket , not as a mosque , " says Wolfgang Kopp , who owns an apartment across the street .
Along with other neighbors , he succeeded in , at least temporarily , stopping the parcel 's rezoning for religious purposes .
" Sooner or later there will be problems , " he says .
Under the German Constitution , all religious groups can have prayer facilities .
While Muslims have had prayer rooms , says Klaus Endter , an ecumenical specialist for the Protestant Church in Hessen , " the question is ... whether a courtyard is the right place to exercise a religion . "
Guest workers worship more openly
Since coming to Germany , Muslim migrant workers like Mr. Kuzpinar have held prayer meetings in dark nooks that reflected the precarious situation of a people often torn between their adopted and their home countries .
But the " guest workers " who helped drive the economic boom of postwar Germany stayed .
They set up organizations to run prayer , youth , and senior activities .
They moved up the economic ladder , increasing their financial contributions to the groups , and receiving funds from pan-European Muslim organizations supporting the Muslim diaspora .
And now , the third generation is building domed mosques with minarets .
Only a handful existed 10 years ago , but today 159 mosques dot Germany today , with 184 under construction , according to the Central Institute for Islamic Archives in Söst .
Aachen , for instance – a German city of 257,000 on the Belgian border with a 9 percent Muslim population – just gave the green light to a domed mosque with a minaret .
That 's a sign , says Mayor Jürgen Linden , " that Muslims have become a part and parcel of society . "
But many see the arrival of mosques as a threat , with fears and conflicts worsening since 9/11 , argues Mr. Leggewie , the mosque specialist .
Grass - roots initiatives have sprouted that try to thwart mosque projects .
" I have the responsibility to protect our society , our democratic principles , ... our values , " says Regina Ebenich , who leads an antimosque effort in Wiesbaden .
Why , for instance , she asks , ca n't Muslim girls take part in swimming lessons or attend class field trips ?
" A mosque is never a religious place only , " says Willi Schwend , head of the antimosque National Association of Citizens ' Initiatives .
" A mosque is a caldron of political agitation .
The goal of Islam is to spread the principles of Islam into society , to change society , to bring about sharia [ Islamic law ] . "
Mr. Schwend 's call finds an echo in eastern Berlin , where plans for a mosque with a 40 - foot - high minaret have enraged a 6,500 - inhabitant neighborhood .
Although Berlin has numerous mosques , this would be the first in the former communist part of the country .
There , argues Leggewie , the absence of a tradition of immigration , combined with strong right - wing feelings , explain why fears of Islam run deep .
A conflict of cultures
But even in Cologne , in the western part of the country , plans for what would become Germany 's biggest mosque – with two 170 - foot minarets slated to accommodate 2,000 people – has ignited a conflict of cultures .
With more than 100,000 Muslims living in Cologne , Germany 's fourth - largest city , many religious and political leaders have rallied around the mosque plan .
But Ralph Giordano , a prominent writer and Holocaust survivor , rekindled fears of a radical Islam threatening German society .
" The integration of Muslims has failed , " Giordano told the media .
Endter says Germany 's mainstream population can no longer afford to ignore that it lives in a country of immigrants .
" You can't say , on the one hand , " We invite you to work , come over , ' and on the other hand say , " Yes , you can pray , but only in courtyards , basements , in the shadow of society , ' " he says .
" We are in a phase of upheaval .
The Muslim communities want to integrate .
They do n't want to live in the shadow anymore . "
When abortion was legalized for whatever reasons it was first legalized , it was only a matter of time before abortion required little to no reasons at all and / or could be legitimized for a myriad of reasons .
Who agrees on which reasons are and are n't valid will always vary .
Which reasons or financial capabilities will work to secure an abortion at the moment of a woman 's movement across the threshold of a clinic will also always vary .
In fact , on an individual level , the only decision about abortion that carries any weight is the decsion you make at the time , whether it brings relief , numbness , haunting sorrow , or whatever .
Because of this , abortion is at once a public and private subject ; it gets media attention and divides people , yet it can also divide the person herself ( and himself , not to exclude the fathers here ) into a dual person , speaking in two voices , maybe more .
As usual , all I can say is what I think .
Once abortion is legal , the reasons seldom really matter .
They suffice doctors , if certain criterion apply , so that they feel confident that you are in the right state of mind .
They further categorize and divide society 's stand on this issue .
They complicate and simplify the whole subject at once .
What follows is simply inevitable .
Choosing to not carry a baby that will be born deformed in a variety of ways in the benefit of all those involved is now a choice that pretty much any of us can make , and I would n't doubt that the medical field will aid us , even support us in our decision .
This same attitude can be spread to the medical profession : if you feel that you are being screwed with the bill from your visit to the E/R , what makes you think that money is n't a factor in abortions as well ?
The more advanced we become in medicine , as we constantly strive to be , the more specific every stage of our human development will become , the more control we will have .
This has its good and bad sides , its pros and cons .
I can't say that preventing a child 's birth whose life will be significantly limited by its physical or mental deformity is wrong in and of itself .
As I said , we can rationalize damn near anything because the act itself is condoned .
But that is NOT to say that any parent , whether they knew beforehand of their child 's disabilities , has done anything wrong by bring that child into the world .
Children with disabilities are often a burden , but they are often loved just as much if not more , and are valid humans who deserve a chance .
Many parents do not have the option of knowing ahead of time and like all parents , simply take what they are given and make the best of it , as ALL parents have the option of doing .
NOTfnordian 's node , like mine perhaps , seems to wander from the point of the title 's statement .
She went off on many tangents that have less to do with abortion and more to do with parenting , which seemed to detract from her point .
While I welcome anyone who feels the desire to legitimize what ( s ) he does , abortion is different to me .
Not many people would know , theoretically , that you 'd had an abortion unless your actions or words made it known ( we humans can hide anything if we try hard enough ) , hence the need to provide reasons would only result after the act had been made known , more or less , by that individual .
No reason is right enough or good enough to convince an audience about abortion if it has preconceived judgements ready to fire .
Even my reasons are , perhaps , not good enough .
Perhaps no reason is good enough to have an abortion , but we often feel the need to provide reasons for the things we do that are in any way questionable .
Just as we have the right to an abortion , we have the right to say whatever we want to about it .
But , in today 's society , seeking to make reasonable arguments is kind of like preaching to the choir .
Sure , there are anti-abortion leagues , but there always will be , because , guess what , they have the right to speak too .
I 'm sure that NOTfnordian did n't necessarily feel the need to adamantly provide reasons , and despite my addtion , I say again that her reasons are just as valid as mine or anyone else 's , but I would n't say any reason is any better than another .
People can dispute me on that , and that 's fine .
We are all , at times , broken , confused , scared and alone .
And I 'd say we 're all equally responsible for where our actions take us and where they inevitably take society .
Voting safeguards measure fails in House Associated Press
Published : Tuesday April 15 , 2008
|
Print This Email This TRENTON , N.J. - Legislation sponsored by a New Jersey congressman that would have reimbursed states wanting to adopt voting safeguards before the November presidential election failed to win approval Tuesday in the U.S. House of Representatives .
The bill , dubbed the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections
Act of 2008 , fell short of the two - thirds majority it needed to pass , even after clearing a House committee unanimously .
The vote was 239- 178 in favor , with all but two Democrats supporting it and all but 16 Republicans opposed .
The two Democrats who voted nay on H R 5036 were Reps. Dennis Kucinich and Nick Rahall .
The 16 Republicans who voted in favor of the bill were Reps. Vern Buchanan , Steve Chabot , Tom Cole , Tom Davis , Charlie Dent , Lincoln Diaz - Balart , Mario Diaz - Balart , Jim Gerlach , Dean Heller , Tim Murphy , Marilyn Musgrave , Jon Porter , Jim Ramstad , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , Chris Shays , and Chris Smith .
The bill would have allowed states and jurisdictions to be reimbursed by the federal government for converting to a paper ballot system , offering emergency paper ballots or conducting audits by hand counts .
The measure was designed to ensure that every vote is properly counted .
Voters in all or parts of 20 states including New Jersey now cast ballots electronically without backup paper verification , according to the bill 's sponsor , Rep. Rush Holt , D - N.J .
The bill would have provided reimbursements for states to provide voter - verified , audited balloting for the general election , but it would not have mandated standards for the states .
Republicans opposed the bill because of the cost .
The White House on Tuesday noted that a 2002 election reform act had authorized $ 3 billion to help states upgrade their voting systems , and that about one - third of that money was still available .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of the legislation at $ 685 million , but supporters said that applied only to a worst - case scenario where many states opted to change their systems .
Holt said he was disappointed and somewhat surprised at the result .
" This increases the likelihood around the country that there will be unaudited elections and lingering questions in many jurisdictions about the validity of the vote , and no way to answer the questions , " Holt said .
" There is no reason this should n't have passed . "
Elections officials in many states are grappling with their voting systems .
Concerns have been raised over the security and reliability of electronic voting machines , and voting rights advocates in New Jersey and elsewhere have pushed for a return to paper balloting .
Some states have scrapped electronic voting machines .
Among them are Florida and New Mexico , which switched to paper ballots that are counted by optical scanners .
Holt 's bill would have reimbursed states for making a similar switch by November .
New Jersey recently acknowledged it would not meet a June deadline for retrofitting 10,000 touch - screen voting machines with paper printers .
That means millions of New Jerseyans will cast ballots in November without paper receipts .
Six counties reported problems with electronic voting machines after the presidential primary in February .
The number of votes tallied in dozens of machines did not match the number counted by the machine 's internal control .
The manufacturer , Sequoia Voting Systems , has resisted efforts by voting rights advocates to have the machines tested independently .

White House 2008 ' Europeans Would Probably Get along Best with Obama '
Regardless whether the next president is named McCain , Clinton or Obama , POTUS 44 will have a long list of demands for Europe -- especially if the White House goes to the Democrats , says Stephen Szabo .
In an exclusive interview , the foreign policy expert discusses future US foreign policy and the person he believes Europeans would prefer as president .
WASHINGTON  Nancy Larson ’s most difficult conversation was , by far , the one with Chelsea Clinton .
“ It was just heartbreaking , ” said Mrs. Larson , a Democratic National Committee member from Minnesota and , more to the point , a superdelegate who had initially pledged herself to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
This was last Saturday , after the former first daughter learned that Mrs. Larson would be shifting her allegiance to Senator Barack Obama .
“ She is a delightful young woman who loves her mother very much , ” Mrs. Larson said .
“ She was really pushing me .
She kept asking me why I was doing this .
She just kept asking , ‘ Why ?
Why ? ’ ”
It is a question many in the Clinton camp are asking these days , sometimes in conversations far less civil than that one .
After nearly two decades building relationships with a generation of Democrats , Mrs. Clinton has recently suffered a steady erosion of support for her presidential campaign from the party stalwarts who once formed the basis of her perceived juggernaut of “ inevitability . ”
Some of it is just business , practical politicians putting aside ties to the Clintons to follow the will of the voters in their states or making a calculation about who seems best positioned to win .
LONDON–Come next year , smoking a joint in Britain might not seem so funny anymore .
Britain's home secretary says she plans to increase punishments for the use of marijuana , raising the maximum prison time for possession from two years to five .
The move by Jacqui Smith reverses the easing of penalties that took place under former Prime Minister Tony Blair .
It also goes against the recommendation of the government 's own advisory commission , which suggested that the law should remain unchanged .
But Smith says she wants to send a strong message to the public – particularly young Britons – that the drug is dangerous .
She says evidence shows an increase of binge - smoking by young people – and the use of stronger varieties of cannabis , called skunk .
Smith says she wants to leave no doubt that the more powerful form of cannabis is illegal and harmful .
In order to take effect , the change must be ratified by both the House of Commons and House of Lords .
The Home Office , Smith 's ministry , says it expects the reclassification of marijuana to take effect in early 2009 .
Cannabis had been downgraded from class B to class C – the lowest of Britain 's three drugs classifications – in 2004 under Blair .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown ordered a review of the decision ; Smith now proposes to undo the earlier change .
Smith told MPs today that skunk accounted for four - fifths of the cannabis seized on the streets and the drug was more than twice as potent as in 1995 .
But the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs reported that the health dangers from marijuana did not justify placing it back in the higher category .
It said the scientific evidence pointed to a ``probable , but weak , causal link between psychotic illness , including schizophrenia , and cannabis use . "
Smith , however , insisted that tightening the restrictions was necessary .
" There is a compelling case for us to act now rather than risk the future health of young people , " she said .
An Appeal to Admiral Fallon on Iran Dear Admiral Fallon , Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly I have not been able to find out how to reach you directly , so I drafted this letter in the hope it will be brought to your attention .
First , thank you for honoring the oath we commissioned officers take to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies , foreign and domestic .
At the same time , you have let it be known that you do not intend to speak , on or off the record , about Iran .
But our oath has no expiration date .
While you are acutely aware of the dangers of attacking Iran , you seem to be allowing an inbred reluctance to challenge the commander in chief to trump that oath , and to prevent you from letting the American people know of the catastrophe about to befall us if , as seems likely , our country attacks Iran .
Two years ago I lectured at the Naval Academy in Annapolis .
I found it highly disturbing that , when asked about the oath they took upon entering the academy , several of the “ Mids ” thought it was to the commander in chief .
This brought to my mind the photos of German generals and admirals ( as well as top church leaders and jurists ) swearing personal oaths to Hitler .
Not our tradition , and yet … I was aghast that only the third Mid I called on got it right – that the oath is to protect and defend the Constitution , not the president .
Attack Iran and Trash the Constitution
No doubt you are very clear that an attack on Iran would be a flagrant violation of our Constitution , which stipulates that treaties ratified by the Senate become the supreme law of the land ; that the United Nations Charter – which the Senate ratified on July 28 , 1945 , by a vote of 89 to 2 – expressly forbids attacks on other countries unless they pose an imminent danger ; that there is no provision allowing some other kind of “ pre-emptive ” or “ preventive ” attack against a nation that poses no imminent danger ; and that Iran poses no such danger to the United States or its allies .
You may be forgiven for thinking :
Is n’t 41 years of service enough ; is n’t resigning in order to remove myself from a chain of command that threatened to make me a war criminal for attacking Iran ; is n’t making my active opposition known by talking to journalists – is n’t all that enough ?
With respect , sir , no , that ’s not enough .
The stakes here are extremely high and with the integrity you have shown goes still further responsibility .
Sadly , the vast majority of your general officer colleagues have , for whatever reason , ducked that responsibility .
You are pretty much it .
In their lust for attacking Iran , administration officials will do their best to marginalize you .
And , as prominent a person as you are , the corporate media will do the same .
Indeed , there are clear signs the media have been given their marching orders to support attacking Iran .
At CIA I used to analyze the Soviet press , so you will understand when I refer to the Washington Post and the New York Times as the White House ’s Pravda and Izvestiya .
Sadly , it is as easy as during the days of the controlled Soviet press to follow the U.S. government ’s evolving line with a daily reading .
In a word , our newspapers are revving up for war on Iran , and have been for some time .
In some respects the manipulation and suppression of information in the present lead - up to an attack on Iran is even more flagrant and all encompassing than in early 2003 before the invasion of Iraq .
It seems entirely possible that you are unaware of this , precisely because the media have put the wraps on it , so let me adduce a striking example of what is afoot here .
The example has to do with the studied , if disingenuous , effort over recent months to blame all the troubles in southern Iraq on the “ malignant ” influence of Iran .
But Not for Fiasco Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman , Adm . Mike Mullen , told reporters on April 25 that Gen. David Petraeus would be giving a briefing “ in the next couple of weeks ” that would provide detailed evidence of “ just how far Iran is reaching into Iraq to foment instability . ”
Petraeus ’s staff alerted U.S. media to a major news event in which captured Iranian arms in Karbala would be displayed and then destroyed .
Small problem .
When American munitions experts went to Karbala to inspect the alleged cache of Iranian weapons they found nothing that could be credibly linked to Iran .
News to you ?
That ’s because this highly embarrassing episode went virtually unreported in the media – like the proverbial tree falling in the forest with no corporate media to hear it crash .
So Mullen and Petraeus live , uninhibited and unembarrassed , to keep searching for Iranian weapons so the media can then tell a story more supportive to efforts to blacken Iran .
A fiasco is only a fiasco if folks know about it .
The suppression of this episode is the most significant aspect , in my view , and a telling indicator of how difficult it is to get honest reporting on these subjects .
Meanwhile , it was announced that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki had formed his own Cabinet committee to investigate U.S. claims and attempt to “ find tangible information and not information based on speculation . ”
Dissing the Intelligence Estimate Top officials from the president on down have been dismissing the dramatically new conclusion of the National Intelligence Estimate released on Dec. 3 , 2007 , a judgment concurred in by the 16 intelligence units of our government , that Iran had stopped the weapons - related part of its nuclear program in mid-2003 .
Always willing to do his part , the malleable CIA chief , Michael Hayden , on April 30 publicly offered his “ personal opinion ” that Iran is building a nuclear weapon – the National Intelligence Estimate notwithstanding .
For good measure , Hayden added : “ It is my opinion , it is the policy of the Iranian government , approved to the highest level of that government , to facilitate the killing of Americans in Iraq . …
Just make sure there ’s clarity on that . ”
I do n’t need to tell you about the Haydens and other smartly saluting generals in Washington .
Let me suggest that you have a serious conversation with Gen. Anthony Zinni , one of your predecessor CENTOM commanders ( 1997 to 2000 ) .
As you know better than I , this Marine general is also an officer with unusual integrity .
But placed into circumstances virtually identical to those you now face , he could not find his voice .
He missed his chance to interrupt the juggernaut to war in Iraq ; you might ask him how he feels about that now , and what he would advise in current circumstances .
Zinni happened to be one of the honorees at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention on Aug. 26 , 2002 , at which Vice President Dick Cheney delivered the exceedingly alarmist speech , unsupported by our best intelligence , about the nuclear threat and other perils awaiting us at the hands of Saddam Hussein .
That speech not only launched the seven - month public campaign against Iraq leading up to the war , but set the terms of reference for the Oct.
1 , 2002 National Intelligence Estimate fabricated – yes , fabricated – to convince Congress to approve war on Iraq .
Gen. Zinni later shared publicly that , as he listened to Cheney , he was shocked to hear a depiction of intelligence that did not square with what he knew .
Although Zinni had retired two years earlier , his role as consultant had required him to stay up to date on intelligence relating to the Middle East .
One Sunday morning three and a half years after Cheney ’s speech , Zinni told “ Meet the Press ” : “ There was no solid proof that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction . … I heard a case being made to go to war . ”
Gen. Zinni had as good a chance as anyone to stop an unnecessary war – not a “ pre-emptive war , ” since there was nothing to pre-empt – and Zinni knew it .
No , what he and any likeminded officials could have stopped was a war of aggression , defined at the post - WWII Nuremberg Tribunal as the “ supreme international crime . ”
Sure , Zinni would have had to stick his neck out .
He may have had to speak out alone , since most senior officials , like then - CIA Director George Tenet , lacked courage and integrity .
In his memoir published a year ago , Tenet says Cheney did not follow the usual practice of clearing his Aug. 26 , 2002 speech with the CIA ; that much of what Cheney said took him completely by surprise ; and that Tenet “ had the impression that the president was n’t any more aware of what his number - two was going to say to the VFW until he said it . ”
It is a bit difficult to believe that Cheney ’s shameless speech took Tenet completely by surprise .
We know from the Downing Street Minutes , vouched for by the UK as authentic , that Tenet told his British counterpart on July 20 , 2002 , that the president had decided to make war on Iraq for regime change and that “ the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy ” Encore : Iran Admiral Fallon , you know that to be the case also with respect to the “ intelligence ” being conjured up to “ justify ” war with Iran .
And no one knows better than you that your departure from the chain of command has turned it over completely to the smartly saluting sycophants .
No doubt you have long since taken the measure , for example , of Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
So have I . I was one of his first branch chiefs when he was a young , disruptively ambitious CIA analyst .
When Ronald Reagan ’s CIA Director William Casey sought someone to shape CIA analysis to accord with his own conviction that the Soviet Union would never change , Gates leaped at the chance .
After Casey died , Gates admitted to the Washington Post ’s Walter Pincus that he ( Gates ) watched Casey on “ issue after issue sit in meetings and present intelligence framed in terms of the policy he wanted pursued . ”
Gates ’ entire subsequent career showed that he learned well at Casey ’s knee .
So it should come as no surprise that , despite the unanimous judgment of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran stopped the weapons related aspects of its nuclear program , Gates is now saying that Iran is hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons .
Some of his earlier statements were more ambiguous , but Gates recently took advantage of the opportunity to bend with the prevailing winds and leave no doubt as to his loyalty .
In an interview on events in the Middle East with a New York Times reporter on April 11 , Gates was asked whether he was on the same page as the president .
Gates replied , “ Same line , same word . ” I imagine you are no more surprised than I .
Bottom line : Gates will salute smartly if Cheney persuades the president to let the Air Force and Navy loose on Iran .
You know the probable consequences ; you need to let the rest of the American people know .
A Gutsy Precedent Can you , Admiral Fallon , be completely alone ?
Can it be that you are the only general officer to resign on principle ?
And , of equal importance , is there no other general officer , active or retired , who has taken the risk of speaking out in an attempt to inform Americans about President George W. Bush ’s bellicose fixation with Iran .
Thankfully , there is .
Gen. Brent Scowcroft , who was national security adviser to President George H.W. Bush , took the prestigious job of Chairman , President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board when asked to by the younger Bush .
From that catbird seat , Scowcroft could watch the unfolding of U.S. policy in the Middle East .
Over decades dealing with the press , Scowcroft had honed a reputation of quintessential discretion .
All the more striking what he decided he had to do .
In an interview with London ’s Financial Times in mid-October 2004 Scowcroft was harshly critical of the president , charging that Bush had been “ mesmerized ” by then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon .
“ Sharon just has him wrapped around his little finger , ” Scowcroft said .
“ He has been nothing but trouble . ”
Needless to say , Scowcroft was given his walking papers and told never to darken the White House doorstep again .
There is ample evidence that Sharon ’s successors believe they have a commitment from President Bush to “ take care of Iran ” before he leaves office , and that the president has done nothing to disabuse them of that notion – no matter the consequences .
On May 18 , speaking at the World Economic Forum at Sharm el Sheikh , Bush threw in a gratuitous reference to “ Iran ’s nuclear weapons ambitions . ”
He said : “ To allow the world ’s leading sponsor of terror to gain the world ’s deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations .
For the sake of peace , the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . ”
Pre -briefing the press , Bush ’s national security adviser Stephen Hadley identified Iran as one of the dominant themes of the trip , adding repeatedly that Iran “ is very much behind ” all the woes afflicting the Middle East , from Lebanon to Gaza to Iraq to Afghanistan .
The Rhetoric is Ripening
In the coming weeks , at least until U.S. forces can find some real Iranian weapons in Iraq , the rhetoric is likely to focus on what I call the Big Lie – the claim that Iran ’s president has threatened to “ wipe Israel off the map . ”
In that controversial speech in 2005 , Ahmadinejad was actually quoting from something the Ayatollah Khomeini had said in the early 1980s .
Khomeini was expressing a hope that a regime treating the Palestinians so unjustly would be replaced by another more equitable one .
A distinction without a difference ?
I think not .
Words matter .
As you may already know ( but the American people do n’t ) , the literal translation from Farsi of what Ahmadinejad said is , “ The regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the pages of time . ”
Contrary to what the administration would have us all believe , the Iranian president was not threatening to nuke Israel , push it into the sea , or wipe it off the map .
President Bush is way out in front on this issue , and this comes through with particular clarity when he ad - libs answers to questions .
On Oct. 17 , 2007 , long after he had been briefed on the key intelligence finding that Iran had stopped the nuclear weapons - related part of its nuclear development program , the president spoke as though , well , “ mesmerized . ”
He said : “ But this – we got a leader in Iran who has announced he wants to destroy Israel .
So I ’ve told people that if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems you ought to be interested in preventing them from have ( sic ) the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon .
I take the threat of Iran with a nuclear weapon very seriously . ”
Some contend that Bush does not really believe his rhetoric .
I rather think he does , for the Israelis seem to have his good ear , with the tin one aimed at U.S. intelligence he has repeatedly disparaged .
But , frankly , which would be worse : that Bush believes Iran to be an existential threat to Israel and thus requires U.S. military action ?
Or that it ’s just rhetoric to “ justify ” U.S. action to “ take care of ” Iran for Israel ?
What you can do , Admiral Fallon , is speak authoritatively about what is likely to happen – to U.S. forces in Iraq , for example – if Bush orders your successors to begin bombing and missile attacks on Iran .
And you could readily update Scowcroft ’s remarks , by drawing on what you observed of the Keystone Cops efforts of White House ideologues , like Iran - Contra convict Elliot Abrams , to overturn by force the ascendancy of Hamas in 2006 - 07 and Hezbollah more recently .
( Abrams pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of misleading Congress , but was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush on Dec. 24 , 1992 . )
It is easy to understand why no professional military officer would wish to be in the position of taking orders originating from the likes of Abrams .
If you weigh in as your ( non-expiring ) oath to protect and defend the Constitution dictates , you might conceivably prompt other sober heads to speak out .
And , in the end , if profound ignorance and ideology – supported by the corporate press and by both political parties intimidated by the Israel lobby – lead to an attack on Iran , and the Iranians enter southern Iraq and take thousands of our troops hostage , you will be able to look in the mirror and say at least you tried .
You will not have to live with the remorse of not knowing what might have been , had you been able to shake your reluctance to speak out .
There is a large Tar Baby out there – Iran .
You may remember that as Brer Rabbit got more and more stuck , Brer Fox , he lay low .
A “ Fox ” Fallon , still pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States , cannot lie low — not now .
Lead .

Walnuts
Blueberries
Dark Chocolate
Honey
Oats
Salmon
Nuts are an excellent source of protein , fiber and vitamin E. Walnuts are the only nuts that contain a significant amount of omega - 3s , and are known for their high antioxidant activity .
Eat them by the handful , toss them on salads .
Sweet blueberries do n't just make your smoothies and cereal taste better ; they contain high levels of antioxidants .
Some research has shown blueberries can slow degenerative diseases associated with aging and improve motor skills .
Still other studies have shown the fruit to improve urinary tract health .
The good news : Dark chocolate is a potent antioxidant and can help reduce blood pressure .
The potentially bad news :
You should still keep your daily chocolate intake low , due to the fat and calories .
Remember that darker is better because processing strips chocolate of some of its health benefits .
Honey is n't just for tea .
You 've probably relied on honey in the past to soothe an aching throat , but did you know it has been used to treat wounds and gastrointestinal problems ?
Honey acts as an antioxidant , a substance that can prevent the effects of free radicals , which we 're exposed to from environmental toxins such as tobacco smoke or radiation and which can contribute to disease .
Honey also contains oligosaccharides , which increase the number of good bacteria in the colon .
Ten years ago , the FDA approved a label publicizing the association between a diet high in oat fiber and the reduction of cholesterol .
Further research has proven this claim to be true :
The fiber in oats lowers total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol , or the bad type of cholesterol .
With every 1 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol , heart - disease risk is lowered 1 to 3 percent .
Oats also contain plant chemicals that have antioxidant properties .
Salmon is a tasty fish that 's chock - full of omega - 3 fatty acids , which are beneficial fats that can improve heart health .
Salmon is also protein rich .
Choose wild over farmed salmon , which has been shown to contain elevated levels of contaminants and is artificially colored .

In our recent coverage of the Firefox 3 beta releases ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , we have noted performance improvements and a significant reduction in memory consumption relative to Firefox 2 .
The enormous amount of effort that developers invested in boosting resource efficiency for Firefox 3 has paid off , and the results are very apparent during day - to - day use .
During intensive browsing with approximately 50 tabs , I have found that Firefox 3 generally consumes less than half of the memory used by Firefox 2.0.0.12 .
Firefox 3 is also snappier and more responsive when switching between tabs and performing other operations that typically lag in Firefox 2.0.0.12 when the browser is experiencing heavy load .
Mozilla developer Stuart Parmenter has written an overview of the tactics that were used to reduce Firefox 's memory footprint and also reveals the results of a memory benchmark he performed to compare Firefox 3 with other browsers .
The memory benchmark , which uses the Talos framework and was conducted on Windows Vista , replicates real - world usage patterns by automatically cycling pages through browser windows and then closing them .
Firefox 3 used less memory than Firefox 2 , Internet Explorer , and Opera , and it also freed more memory than the other browsers when pages were closed .
Safari 3 and Internet Explorer 8 could not be benchmarked because they crashed during the test .
The results of this experiment , which others have been able to consistently reproduce using the same tools , represent a big victory for Firefox , which has previously faced widespread criticism for its high memory consumption .
To achieve that victory , developers approached the problem from many different angles .
To reduce memory fragmentation , the developers attempted to minimize the total number of memory allocations , particularly during startup .
The developers also adopted FreeBSD 's jemalloc allocator , which helped reduce fragmentation and improve performance .
Another big improvement is the new XPCOM cycle collector , which automatically detects unused objects that are persisting as a result of mutual references .
Parmenter notes that the cycle collector has notable implications for extensions because it will be able to proactively eliminate certain kinds of memory leaks introduced by Firefox extensions that manipulate Firefox 's internals .
Caching behavior has also been improved so that it is less wasteful , and decompressed image data is no longer stored .
Mozilla evangelist Christopher Blizzard , who also wrote about the memory improvements , offers readers another insightful take - home message : the small memory footprint in the latest Firefox 3 beta , he says , is proof that Firefox is ready for mobile environments .
" What it shows to anyone who looks is that we 're able to hit the kinds of memory and performance requirements that mobile platforms demand , " wrote Blizzard .
" Users who use our software on mobile devices can expect web sites that just work , access to add - ons all balanced against the hardware limits imposed by mobile devices .
In essence , we can bring that no compromises approach to mobile , just as we 've done it with the desktop . "
The upcoming Firefox 3 release has much to offer in addition to a smaller memory footprint , including an improved user interface , new themes that increase visual platform integration , a completely revamped bookmark and history system that uses an SQLite database , a Cairo - based rendering backend , full - page zoom , support for JavaScript 1.8 , and many other new features .
These improvements will likely continue to push Firefox 's climbing market share .

Modern science began several hundred years earlier than we have come to imagine .
It got going in the twelfth century — and with it , the long - standing rift between reason and faith .
The popular caricature locates the origins of modern science in the natural philosophies of ancient Greece and the rediscovery of their spirit during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment .
It passes decorously over the intervening period , deemed to be a hotbed of superstition .
In fact , the notion of a Universe governed by laws accessible to human reason — the precondition for science — emerged in Western Europe largely during the twelfth century , several hundred years earlier than we have come to imagine .
“ The eleventh - century Christians , ” says historian Georges Duby , “ still felt utterly crushed by mystery , overwhelmed by the unknown world their eyes could not see . ” 1
By 1300 , the foundations of a scientific world view were in place .
The architects of this new philosophy attempted to reconcile their perspective with the pervasive religious sentiment of the Middle Ages .
But in so doing they opened the schism between faith and reason that has since widened to a chasm .
From around 1120 , an influx of classical texts revitalized European thought .
These had been translated previously into Arabic within the Islamic world , and were now rendered in Latin by energetic scholars working at the volatile boundaries of Christendom and Islam .
Most of these books were scientific texts by writers such as Euclid , Aristotle , Archimedes and Ptolemy .
Empirical skills combined with the new philosophy to create the high Gothic style .

There was more to the ' twelfth - century renaissance '2 than the recycling of ancient learning .
Islamic scholars such as Averroës , Al - Khwarizmi and Avicenna made original contributions of their own in subjects ranging from mathematics to medicine .
So too did some of the medieval Europeans often depicted now as mere translators .
Strangely , although Christian Europe showed little prejudice against learning from Muslims , it was reluctant to accept new ideas from its own people .
The very antiquity of old knowledge was thought to make it more reliable .
One of the most active translators , the Englishman Adelard of Bath , was a start - lingly original and perceptive thinker .
Rueing how difficult it was to get his ideas accepted , he wrote : “ Our generation ... refuses to accept anything that seems to come from the moderns .
Thus when I have a new idea , if I wish to publish it I attribute it to someone else . ”
3
This is why so many of the works of natural philosophy from antiquity to the Renaissance have apocryphal attribution : a book apparently by Pliny or Aristotle was more likely to be read .
The progressive thinkers of the early Middle Ages hid their new wine in old flasks , so that others would take them seriously .
The translations guided scholars towards a mode of inquiry governed by scepticism and reason rather than by the search for validation in the Bible or St Augustine .
In his book Sic et Non , the combative Frenchman Peter Abelard pointed out that the writings of the Church Fathers were not always consistent .
These inconsistencies , he urged , should be reconciled using logic .
Sic et Non is something of a sceptic 's manual : “ We seek through doubt , ” Abelard wrote , “ and by seeking we perceive the truth . ”

Natural questions
A rationalist position was also nurtured at the cathedral school of Chartres ( see ' Rationality in stone ' ) .
From around the 1120s , this school acquired several chancellors with a deep interest in natural philosophy .
These included Bernard of Chartres and his brother ( or possibly pupil )
Thierry , arguably one of the true founders of Western science .
The Chartres scholars were platonists : they believed that the mundane world is underpinned by a transcendental realm governed by order and geometry .
Thierry attempted to show how platonic ' physics ' could be used to comprehend the world systematically , and even to interpret the biblical creation in Genesis .
Another Chartres scholar and teacher , William of Conches , got into trouble for pushing the rational agenda even harder .
His Philosophia Mundi provided twelfth - century Europe with its first comprehensive treatise on the physical world .
He argued that natural phenomena arise from forces that , although created by God , act under their own agency .
William insisted , echoing Plato , that the divine system of nature is coherent and consistent , and therefore comprehensible : if we ask questions of nature , we can expect to get answers , and to be able to understand them .
That is a necessary belief for one even to imagine conducting science .
If everything is subject to the whim of God , there is no guarantee that a phenomenon will happen tomorrow as it does today , therefore there is then no point in seeking any consistency in nature .
But William of Conches could not countenance a Creator who was constantly intervening in the world .
He saw the Universe as a divinely wrought mechanism : God simply set the wheels in motion .
It is in the twelfth century that the first references to the Universe as machina begin to appear .
With God as ultimate architect , the workings of the Universe were now open to rational study .

Some conservative theologians denounced this attempt to develop a Christian platonic natural philosophy .
They felt that taking too strong an interest in nature as a physical entity was tantamount to second - guessing God 's plans .
As everything was surely determined moment to moment by the will of God , it was futile and impious , they believed , to seek anything akin to what we now regard as physical law .
The quest for laws of nature was also condemned because it seemed to limit God 's omnipotence .
As the eleventh - century Italian cleric Peter Damian insisted , one could not know anything for certain , as God could alter it all in an instant .
William of Conches did n't try to deny God 's absolute power ; he argued that it was n't the issue .
“ Certainly God could make a calf out of the trunk of a tree , as country bumpkins might say , but did he ever do so ?
Therefore show some reason why a thing is so , or cease to hold that it is so .
” 3 Adelard of Bath , another Chartres student , agreed : “ I do not detract from God .
Everything that is , is from him , and because of him .
But [ nature ] is not confused and without system , and so far as human knowledge has progressed it should be given a hearing .
Only when it fails utterly should there be recourse to God . ”
Adelard 's book Quaestiones Naturales reveals a mind full of curiosity about the world .
Why do some animals see better at night ?
Why do n't babies walk as soon as they are born ?
Why can sound pass through walls ?
In addressing these questions , he offers perhaps the most elegant and dignified defence of science ever written : “ If we turned our backs on the amazing rational beauty of the universe we live in , we should indeed deserve to be driven therefrom , like a guest unappreciative of the house into which he has been received . ”
4
These things were said by deeply devout men in an age that could not contemplate a world without God .
How narrow and theologically immature they make the dogmas of contemporary religious fundamentalists seem by comparison .
The twelfth - century trust in reason and interest in nature for its own sake flourished in the following century .
This was particularly so in the aristotelianism of Thomas Aquinas , Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon .
Their emphasis on attention to detail and careful observation signals the beginnings of an experimental approach — something that was unlikely to emerge from the abstract platonism of Chartres .
Crudely speaking , Plato focused on the generalities , Aristotle on the particulars .
The backlash begins
But the golden age of rationalism in the early thirteenth century instigated a theological backlash , a kind of medieval Counter - Reformation .
This culminated in the papal declaration of 1277 condemning many propositions in Aristotle 's works .
It was a metaphysical power struggle : was the world ruled by God 's whims or Aristotle 's laws ?
Could God contradict Aristotle ?
The battle was also more prosaic : did the universities ' theology faculties have more authority than the arts faculties ?
The Condemnation of 1277 forced some scholars to compromise on the inelegant ' dual truth ' we are still struggling to expunge .
' Scientific truth ' was right about the world , but they had to concede that theological truth , with its mysteries and miracles , could overrule it .
Nevertheless , the efforts of scholars such as Aquinas eventually legitimized logic and natural philosophy on religious grounds almost to a counterproductive extent .
Indeed , by the Renaissance it became almost a heresy to challenge Aristotle .
Opposition to medieval rationalism was motivated in part by valid concerns about the dangers of bringing science into scripture .
When , for example , William of Conches was denounced for seeking physical explanations for the creation of Eve from one of Adam 's ribs , conservatives were right to voice dismay at this apparent transformation of the Bible into a work of science .
Read as a kind of moral mythology , holy books may have some social value .
Deeming them sources of natural facts must lead to the absurdities of today 's creationism .
By making God a natural phenomenon , the medieval rationalists turned Him into an explicatory contingency for which there has since seemed ever less need .
By degrees , such secular learning was found to have so much explanatory power that it rivalled , rather than rationalized , theology itself .
The consequent rift between faith and reason has now left traditional religions so compromised they are susceptible to displacement by more naive and dogmatic varieties .

The emergence of Western science as a branch of humanism should thus be properly located in the high Middle Ages , not , as is traditional , in the Renaissance .
It was in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that the Universe ceased to be a forest of symbols designed by God for humankind 's spiritual edification , and became instead a source of intrinsic intellectual value and fascination , governed by logic .
One can see this even in the shifting religious imagery of the time , such as the transformation of the sculpted flora of the Gothic churches from stylized forms to identifiable plant species .
Art , theology , philosophy , social structures — all felt the influence of this altered perspective as we began to find our true place in the world .
Box 1 : Rationality in stone
The twelfth - century renaissance gave rise to the artistic style now known as Gothic .
In architecture this is characterized by hierarchical , orderly structures based on symmetry and proportion .
Vaults and spires soar to unprecedented heights , yet the masonry , linked into a web of delicately balanced forces , seems almost weightless , flooded with light from immense coloured windows .
Some historians — most influentially Erwin Panofsky in the 1940s4 — have suspected a link between this style and the emerging belief in cosmic order .
If a medieval church was in some sense a representation of heaven on Earth , they argue , then changes in church design must have something to tell us about how the Middle Ages conceptualized the cosmos .
If the world was “ God 's discourse to man ” , in Umberto Eco 's words , then cathedrals “ actualized a synthetic vision of man , of his history , of his relation to the universe ” .
Panofsky proposed that the nascent French universities and academies in and around Paris influenced the Gothic architecture that originated here .
Both architects and scholars , he said , used division and subdivision “ to make the orderliness and logic of their thought palpably explicit ” 4 .
In the 1950s , historian Otto von Simson gave Panofsky 's argument greater force when he scrutinized the role of geometry in the relationship between the intellectual and architectural worlds .
Von Simson argues that the first Gothic “ marks and reflects an epoch in the history of Christian thought , the change from the mystical to the rational approach to truth ” 5 .
Historian of technology Lynn
White agrees : “ The transition from Romanesque to Gothic charts the passage from an age indifferent to the investigation of nature to one deeply concerned with it . ”
Today many historians consider Panofsky 's argument to have been overstated , even misplaced .
Some identify socioeconomic conditions as the principal force behind Gothic church building .
Others say that geometry in architecture amounted to little more than convenient rules of thumb , lacking mathematical foundation .
The truth probably lies somewhere in between .
A link between building and theology was sometimes explicit .
To the scholars of Chartres , God was the great architectus , who used geometrical schemes to construct the Universe .
Some medieval writers distinguished between the ' theoretical ' geometry of the cathedral schools and universities , governed by mathematical proof , and the ' practical ' geometry that could be used mechanically for constructing pillars and vaults .
Builders probably had little need of mathematical understanding : they could draw and interpret plans encoded in sequences of operations that could be learnt by rote and passed on orally .
Chartres Cathedral may reflect an appreciation of cosmic order .

A fifteenth - century builders ' handbook gives prescriptions for how to construct regular polygons , or to find the centre of a circle from an arc , with compass and ruler , with no indication that the writer knew of , or felt the need for , Euclid 's proofs .
Yet classical geometry and pythagorean symbolism do sometimes emerge in masonry .
For example , medieval sculptors often used a lens - shaped figure called the vesica piscis to frame Christ seated in majesty .
The shape is found in Ars geometriae et arithmeticae by the early sixth - century Roman writer Boethius as the overlap between two equal circles whose circumferences pass through one another 's centres .
Boethius explains that this construction , which can be made with a pair of compasses , may be used to make the most ' perfect ' of triangles , the equilateral .
So the shape would have been used to frame the figure of Christ not simply because it was pleasing and convenient but for its symbolic connotations .

OIL PROFITS OIL PROFITS
The head of a congressional committee failed Tuesday to get executives from the five biggest U.S. oil companies to promise they will invest 10 % of their earnings in alternative energy development .
The executives appeared before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , where they were the target of the ire of members being hammered by constituents about record gasoline prices and global oil prices $ 100 a barrel at the same time oil companies are reaping record profits .
The five companies — ExxonMobil ( XOM ) , Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSA ) , BP ( BP ) , Chevron ( CVX ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP ) — earned a combined $ 123.3 billion last year , or 8.4 % , on sales of nearly $ 1.5 trillion .
The American Petroleum Institute trade group says the overall industry average in the fourth quarter was 7.4 % of revenue , in line with 7.1 % for companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average .
Committee Chairman Edward Markey , D - Mass. , especially flayed ExxonMobil for investing what he said was " one - half of 1 % " of earnings on non-petroleum research .
Stephen Simon , senior vice president of the biggest oil company , told the panel that the company 's " best and brightest " engineers and scientists have probed alternatives but found none able to replace significant quantities of oil in the near future .
" We need to have a breakthrough , world - changing technology . "
A piqued Markey said , " You can't be nickel - and - diming renewables and at the same time reporting $ 40 billion in profits . "
Repeating a goal he laid out at the beginning for all five of the companies , he said to Simon , " Exxon should make a commitment to put 10 % of its profits into renewables , " and demanded , " Are you willing to make that commitment ? "
" We will do that , " Simon said , " if we can identify an area where we think it will have that ( big ) impact . "
ExxonMobil is giving $ 100 million to the Global Climate and Energy Project at Stanford University .
The contributions began in 2002 and are spread over 10 years , according to Exxon spokesman Gantt Walton .
He noted that Exxon spends more than $ 1 billion a year on research and development but would n't break out a total for alternative energy .
Oil companies generally refuse to disclose investment details , saying they are " proprietary information . "
Exxon has been involved for two decades in lithium - battery development and last year perfected a film to keep the batteries cool .
Lithium batteries are expected to be used for future electric and plug - in hybrid electric vehicles .
Keeping the batteries cool is a major issue .
Chevron spokesman Donald Campbell said the company plans to spend $ 2.5 billion from 2007 through 2009 on " renewables , alternatives and energy efficiency services . "
Robert Malone , president of BP America , told the hearing that BP will spend $ 30 billion in the next five years for research on oil to solar panels .
Referring to legislation passed by the House in February that would raise taxes on just the five companies at the hearing by $ 17.7 billion to be spent on renewable energy , he cautioned that " taxing one form of energy to encourage production of another " would only lead to " even higher prices at the pump " as oil companies raised prices to cover higher costs .
The House has passed similar legislation previously , but it has failed to pass in the Senate .

In a confidential memo , a long - time Republican operative who has served in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad for the past year says the State Department 's efforts in Iraq are so poorly managed they " would be considered willfully negligent if not criminal " if done in the private sector .
" We have brought to Iraq the worst of America -- our bureaucrats , " writes Manuel Miranda in the memo , which was addressed to U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and cc'd to " ALCON " or " all concerned " at the State Department .
" You are doing a job for which you are not prepared as a bureaucracy or as leaders , " Miranda writes .
" The American and Iraqi people deserve better . "
Asked to respond to the allegations made in Miranda 's memo , State Department spokesman Tom Casey said Miranda is entitled to his opinion , but " We think Ambassador Crocker and his team are doing a very good job under extremely challenging circumstances .
We have great confidence in their ability to carry out their mission . "
Miranda previously held senior Republican leadership positions on Capitol Hill , including counsel for then - Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist .
While on Capitol Hill , Miranda was embroiled in a controversy when he obtained a confidential memorandum written by Senate Democrats and leaked it the press .
Democrats accused Miranda of hacking into their computer systems .
Miranda said the Democratic staffers had left the memo on a computer server accessable to all Senate staffers .

The Supreme Court gave prosecutors a powerful tool Monday to attack the spread of child pornography online , ruling that people who send messages over the computer offering or seeking sexual images of children can be sent to prison , even when no such pornography exists .
The 7 - 2 ruling , which upheld a 5 - year - old law , rejected the claim that such messages were protected as free speech .
“ This will be a big help , ” said Patrick Trueman , a Virginia lawyer who led the Justice Department ’s anti-obscenity unit during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations .
“ You do n’t have to prove the underlying material is illegal .
The criminal offense is the speech that offers to sell or trade in illegal material . ”
Monday ’s ruling goes a long way toward overturning the effect of a 2002 decision that shielded computer - generated pornography .

The justices said then that since no real children were involved in producing such images , the material deserved protection as a form of free speech .
Prosecutors then faced a practical problem .
How could they prove that realistic images of child sex scenes involved actual children ?
Defendants could assert they were “ virtual ” pornography .
In reaction , Congress passed a law in 2003 making it a crime to exchange online messages about “ any material or purported material ” that would cause “ another to believe ” it depicted a minor engaged in sex , whether “ actual or simulated . ”
Violations call for at least five years and as much as 20 years in prison .
The fate of the law remained in doubt until Monday because of legal challenges .

Two years ago , a U.S. appeals court in Atlanta ruled the law unconstitutional because it was overly broad .
It could apply , in theory , to a grandfather who sends an e-mail titled “ Good pics of kids in bed ” to describe a photo of sleeping toddlers , the appellate judges said .
Other critics said the law could ensnare those who touted a Hollywood movie that contained simulated sex scenes .
In Monday ’s opinion , the high court dismissed those objections as “ fanciful hypotheticals ” and upheld the law .
“ Child pornography harms and debases the most defenseless of our citizens , ” said Justice Antonin Scalia .
Advertisement
“ We hold that offers to provide or requests to obtain child pornography are categorically excluded from the 1st Amendment , ” he added .
Scalia knocked down each of the objections to the new measure .
No prosecutor or jury would believe that a grandfather was offering children engaged in “ sexually explicit conduct ” when he sends an e-mail describing “ kids in bed , ” Scalia said .
The statute does not apply “ where the material at issue is a harmless picture of a child in a bathtub , ” he added .
He said that those who advertise or sell movies were not in danger either .
“ We think it implausible that a reputable distributor of Hollywood movies , such as Amazon.com , believes that one of these films contains actual children engaging in actual or simulated sex on camera . . . ” he said .
“ The average person understands that sex scenes in mainstream movies use nonchild actors , depict sexual activity in a way that would not rise to the explicit level necessary under the statute , or , in most cases , both . ”

Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented .
They questioned the court ’s retreat from the ruling that protected “ fake ” child pornography from prosecution .
The Justice Department brought 1,209 child pornography cases in 2006 , and in 95 % of them , the defendant pleaded guilty , Souter said .
“ The government . . . seems to be selling itself short ; it appears to be highly successful in convicting child pornographers , ” he said .
“ Perhaps I am wrong , ” Souter added .
“ But without some demonstration that juries have been rendering exploitation of children unpunishable , there is no excuse for cutting back on the 1st Amendment . ”

The decision in U.S. vs. Williams restores the conviction of a Florida man who told an FBI agent online that he had photos of his own 4 - year - old daughter engaged in sex .
Agents raided his home and found child pornography on his computer , but not the photos that he had described .
He pleaded guilty to child pornography charges , but challenged the law ’s so - called pandering provision as unconstitutional .

Click to viewSome of the greatest science fiction TV shows of all time have vanished , almost without a trace .
They do n't get DVDs or listed in articles on the " Top 50 Science Fiction Shows Of All Time . "
Despite achieving true greatness , they do n't even get as much praise or critical attention as Alf .
Here 's our countdown of the ten greatest unappreciated masterpieces of science fiction television .
We 're focusing on really unsung series here , which means the list does n't include shows like Babylon 5 , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine or Blake 's 7 , which get plenty of love .
Also , we 're not including any shows currently on the air , on the theory that they could still get more love .

10 . Space Island One ( 1998 )
Why it 's unsung :
This German / Canadian co-production is n't out on DVD , and all of the websites about it have been down for a few years .
There are n't even any clips on YouTube .
Why it rules :
This is one of the most hard - science - focused SF shows .
The crew of a corporate - funded space station mostly deals with scientifically plausible problems ( with a couple of exceptions ) and the stories focus on the ethical problems that come with profit - focused science .
Yes , some episodes are a tad slow - moving , but the best dozen eps feature high drama and high weirdness .
Sample plot lines : a lonely old NASA astronaut spends thousands of dollars calling 900 sex lines from the space station .
The station gets the world 's last sample of smallpox for safe - keeping , and the crew debates whether to destroy it .
9. Star Cops ( 1987 )
Why it 's unsung :
This show about a police squad in the " Wild West " of space stations and moonbases suffered from a cheesy title and a ridiculous ELO - esque theme tune .
( Which I 've sort of gotten to love , for some dumb reason . )
Why it rules : Series creator Chris Boucher wrote some of the best episodes of the original Doctor Who , and then masterminded the scripts for Blake 's 7 .
Several Star Cops episodes feature tons of Boucher 's trademark razor - sharp dialog , plus the show fumbles towards a space - noir aesthetic , with the cop squad including a bribe - taker and a thuggish slob .

8. Surface ( 2005 - 2006 )
Why it 's unsung : Cancelled after just one season , this show about undersea intrigue failed to rope in the kind of audiences who were devouring Lost 's tangled mysteries .
Why it rules : Dude , it had sea monsters !
And there was a government coverup !
And we had a strong female character — a scientist , even — investigating the emergence of a new and potentially world - ending form of sea life .
And we never got to learn what was really going .

7. Odyssey 5 ( 2002 )
Why it 's unsung :
This Canadian show about space shuttle astronauts who witness the destruction of Earth never got enough publicity during its initial U.S. run on Showtime .
It felt like an attempt to do a mature extended - cable show like Big Love , only with a science fiction premise , and it failed to reach either audience .
Showtime did n't even bother to show all of the first season , until 2004 .
Why it rules :
The main characters are all well - rounded and flawed .
And the show 's set - up , in which an alien sends their consciousnesses back in time five years to try and avert the world 's destruction , generates tons of potential .
The show is appearing intermittently on Sci Fi , and it 's worth catching despite the inconclusive ending .
The show was created by Manny Coto , who went on to mastermind the final season of Star Trek : Enterprise .

6. Journeyman ( 2007 )
Why it 's unsung :
The first few weeks this time - travel show was on , its nickname was : " Gah , post - Heroes buzzkill ! "
The drama of Kevin McKidd struggling to hold onto his job and his marriage , while he kept slipping into the past , just felt a bit too draggy .
But then something funny happened : Heroes started being the pain we endured to get to the reward of Journeyman .
Why it rules :
The mystery of why Dan Vasser is traveling in time gets more intriguing , once a weird physicist starts spouting about wormholes .
And all of the characters get more nicely complex as the show goes along .
Most of all , though , all of Dan 's meddling in the timestream has consequences he can't predict — and they only pile up more alarmingly over time .
5. Lexx ( 1997 - 2002 )
Why it 's unsung :
At least in the U.S. , this Canadian show never quite crossed over and gained a broader audience .
Why it rules :
Just the fact that they 're in a planet - eating bug ship is good enough for me .
Not to mention the weird robot head with the love - slave programming implanted in it , while the cluster lizard / slavegirl who was supposed to get the programming runs free .
It 's a weirdly campy show , but actually has moments of genuine greatness .

4. Star Trek : The Animated Series ( 1973 - 1974 )
Why it 's unsung : I know : How can a Star Trek series be unsung ?
But this one really is .
It only recently got a DVD release , and people often skip over it in discussing Trek lore .
Why it rules :
Thanks to a writer 's strike that did n't apply to animation , the show managed to get some decent science fiction writers to contribute scripts , including Larry Niven and Larry Brody , plus original series veterans like David Gerrold and D.C. Fontana .
The episodes are pretty fast - paced , thanks to their 22 - minute runtimes , but that does n't stop them dealing with ambitious ideas like antimatter universes , an " ultimate weapon " and time paradoxes .
Advertisement
3. Farscape ( 1999 - 2004 )
Why it 's unsung : Even for a Sci Fi Channel series whose name does n't rhyme with " cattle car , " Farscape flew under the radar .
The muppet - esque Henson animatronic character probably made a lot of people think it was a kids ' show .
Why it rules : Farscape had smart writing , good science and believable aliens — plus , it featured Scorpius as a villain Crichton 's head long before BSG ever did the head - villain thing .
Plus , we love the Moya , the living ship that Crichton finds himself on .
The Sci Fi Channel is supposedly going to make 10 webisodes , but their status is uncertain .

2. Adventures of Brisco County , Jr. ( 1993 - 1994 )
Why it 's unsung :
This sci-fi Western ran in the " Friday night death slot , " and breathed its last after only one season .
Like many of the shows on this list , it has a cult following , but seldom gets much props as a science fiction show .
And star Bruce Campbell in general deserves way more accolades than he ever gets .
Why it rules :
It smudged genre lines with total abandon , and you never knew what sort of crazy gadgets would turn up , from an otherworldly superpowered orb to the Mobile Battle Wagon and the Amazing Rocket Car.
Co-creator Carlton Cuse now works on Lost .
1. Max Headroom ( 1987 -1988 )
Why it 's unsung :
It 's still not out on DVD , except for an out - of - print DVD of the original UK TV movie .
The show has a cult following , but not as much as it deserves .
Why it rules :
This cyberpunk show was prophetic in so many ways — TV ads feel so geared to short attention spans and DVR - skipping , they might as well be " blipverts . " — and paranoia and corporate dystopias have seldom been so entertaining .
Ten years ago around this very time — April through June 2008 — our intrepid Microsoft guru Peter Bright evidently had an identity crisis .
Could this lifelong PC user really have been pushed to the brink ?
Was he considering a switch to ... Mac OS ?!?
While our staff hopefully enjoys a less stressful Memorial Day this year , throughout the weekend we 're resurfacing this three part series that doubles as an existential operating system dilemma circa 2008 .
Part one ran on April 21 , 2008 , and it appears unedited below .
A couple of Gartner analysts have recently claimed that Windows is " collapsing " — that it 's too big , too sprawling , and too old to allow rapid development and significant new features .
Although organizations like Gartner depend on trolling to drum up business , I think this time they could be onto something .
" Collapsing " is over - dramatic — gradual decline is a more likely outcome — but the essence of what they 're saying — and why they 're saying it — rings true .
Windows is dying , Windows applications suck , and Microsoft is too blinkered to fix any of it — that 's the argument .
The truth is that Windows is hampered by 25 - year old design decisions .
These decisions mean that it 's clunky to use and absolutely horrible to write applications for .
The applications that people do write are almost universally terrible .
They 're ugly , they 're inconsistent , they 're disorganized ; there 's no finesse , no care lavished on them .
Microsoft — surely the company with the greatest interest in making Windows and Windows applications exude quality — is , in fact , one of the worst perpetrators .
The unfortunate thing about this is that there is a company that 's not only faced similar problems but also tackled them .
Apple in the mid-1990s was faced with an operating system that was going nowhere , and needed to take radical action to avoid going out of business .
And so that 's what Apple did .
Apple 's role in the industry has always been more prominent than mere sales figures would suggest , but these days even the sales numbers are on the up .
There are lessons to be learned from the company in Cupertino ; I only hope they will be .
A little background
I 've never been a Mac user .
I 've used Macs from time to time , of course , but never owned one myself .
As with many Brits d'un certain âge at school I was brought up on a diet of Acorn Archimedes and RISC OS .
RISC OS brought with it many notable features : it had a spatial file browser done properly , its menu bar was optimally located , it used bundles for applications , and it had a taskbar / dock before anyone else did .
The Archimedes was , however , a footnote in the history of computing , and the only computers I 've ever owned have been PCs .
I got my first PC in 1997 .
It was a Dell Pentium II with Windows 95 .
I got it because I was interested in computers and I wanted to learn how to program them , so I picked up a student edition of Visual Studio 97 and duly learned C++.
At that time , Windows was really the only game in town ;
Macs were ever so expensive and , as everyone knows , there was no software available for them .
Microsoft was pretty good to me at the time .
The Windows OS was fast and reasonably stable .
We did n't have to worry about allocating memory to applications or rebuilding our desktops , and although the preemptive multitasking and protected memory were not perfect , the system was obviously more stable than any Mac .
I got cheap student copies of Visual Studio 6 and Office 97 .
I bought the Windows 98 upgrade on the day of its release , wowed by its sleek new look ( gradients in the title bars ! ) .
Microsoft sent me copies of an exciting new operating system called " Windows NT 5 Beta 2 " which I eagerly installed and ran as my primary OS until it expired ; Microsoft even sent me a copy of Windows 2000 for my trouble .
That OS was bullet - proof ; it was quick , it ran all the applications I wanted , it supported my software — what more could someone ask for ?
I began working in late 1999 as a software developer , writing all sorts of programs in Java , Visual Basic 6 , C++ , SQL Server , and whatever else I had to use .
Again , I felt well - treated by Microsoft .
MSDN Library was an invaluable developer resource ; Microsoft was open about what it was doing , giving out betas of Windows XP ( or Whistler , as it then was ) to all and sundry , and it felt like the company knew what it was doing .
Redmond had a roadmap of Whistler and Blackcomb ; it had a plan .
This was attractive to someone who programmed for a living .
Developers felt valued , like the company cared about them .
I enjoy programming , and I enjoy writing software .
I did then ; I do now .
So for me , this is really a key piece of what a platform has to offer .

A brief history of Macs
The Mac at this time was still struggling with its archaic OS and its underpowered hardware , and the entire platform felt stagnant .
In 2001 , Apple just about managed to get OS X out the door — dragging Mac software kicking and screaming into the 21st century — but had so little confidence in the thing that it still made the computers default to Mac OS 9 .
Even Mac proponents regarded OS X as little better than a beta .
But it was the start of a big change in the fortunes of the Mac platform .
Although OS X was slow and buggy , it also hinted at being something more ; a platform for the future .
The infrastructure was sound , and Quartz was downright modern .
Its Cocoa API and Objective - C were an exciting development platform offering interesting new features like " System Services . "
Part of this was by accident .
If Apple 's Copland project had come to fruition , it probably would n't have happened at all .
Apple 's intent was to update the aging OS piecemeal , adding protected memory and preemptive multitasking , and , piece by piece , update the core OS libraries to better support these modern features .
Eventually this would become sufficiently advanced that the " Gershwin " OS would be " fully modern , " whatever this meant ( even Apple was n't sure ) .
Feature creep and mismanagement resulted in the cancellation of Copland .
Instead of developing a new OS from the existing one , Apple decided to purchase a modern OS and use that as the basis for its future operating system .
This resulted in the purchase of NeXT , and NeXTstep went on to form the basis of Mac OS X .
NeXTstep was pretty radical in its day ; it 's thanks to NeXTstep that OS X uses Objective - C and has an Objective - C library .
Display Postscript in NeXTstep became Display PDF in OS X. NeXTstep had the same combination of Mach and BSD code that became MacOS X's Darwin kernel .
Obviously , this still left Apple with a lot of work to do ; NeXTstep could n't run Mac apps , which was obviously a big problem for a MacOS successor , so Apple devised the " Classic " virtual machine to provide support for legacy applications .
New applications would use the new Cocoa or Carbon APIs .
This approach — forced on it due to screwing up the Copland project — put Apple in a strong position .
The new OS was free of many of the legacy constraints that the Copland approach would have caused ; the clumsy old APIs were restricted to the Classic environment , and they did n't form a part of the modern OS core .
Although the new APIs were not entirely new — the Obj - C Cocoa API was based on the NeXTstep API , and Carbon was similar to the old MacOS API — they were cleaned up , allowing bad decisions of the past to be fixed .
The New York Times Company , the parent of The New York Times , posted a $ 335,000 loss in the first quarter  one of the worst periods the company and the newspaper industry have seen  falling far short of both analysts ’ expectations and its $ 23.9 million profit in the quarter a year earlier .
The company did break even on a per-share basis , compared with the average analyst forecast of earnings of 14 cents , down from 17 cents in the first quarter of 2007 .
The company ’s main source of revenue , newspaper advertising in print and online , fell 10.6 percent , the sharpest drop in memory , as the industry suffers the twin blows of an economic downturn and the continuing long - term shift of readers and advertisers to the Internet .
In a conference call with analysts , Janet L. Robinson , president and chief executive , said it was “ a challenging quarter , one that showed the effects of a weaker economy , ” compounded by “ a marketplace that has been reconfigured technologically , economically and geographically . ”

From a Clinton campaign email list :
The Iowa caucus process is a broken and flawed process .
It was designed to allow for the active party Dems generally known to one another to assign delegates and was not designed to handle a flood of students and independents .
It was a system designed to give more power to Dem party loyalists .
In the tension over whether the candidates should be chosen by the party or by the general public , the Iowa caucus was designed to give the party the advantage .
For this reason , the Iowa system failed on Thursday .

Sooner or later , almost everything goes digital : cameras , camcorders , music players , TV , books , you name it .
So far , though , there ’s been no successful electronic version of the input device beloved by reporters , students , lyricists and claims adjusters : good old pen on paper .
There have been efforts .
Pens based on Anoto technology ( sold by Logitech and others ) and Leapfrog ’s Fly Fusion pen work the same way : you write on special paper that ’s been printed with millions of nearly invisible microdots .
By watching those dots , a tiny camera in the pen tip learns its position and a microchip converts your pen strokes into digital ink .
Such pens can transfer the results to a PC and do basic handwriting recognition .
Jim Marggraff , a veteran of both Anoto and Leapfrog , is now at a new start - up company called LiveScribe .
This month , it introduced the Pulse smartpen , which Mr. Marggraff says is the final step in his vision for “ paper - based computing . ”

That being said , I thought I had gotten over this whole going bald thing .
It started my senior year in college , about a year after I cut off my long hair .
A friend , Jon , was on a staircase above me at a party , while I was getting stupid drunk below , and he said , " Yo , I think you might be losing your hair man . "
As is my nature , I started to obsess on the subject .
After a few years of many hours spent holding mirrors behind my head , I started Rogaine .
I can't remember exactly what time period this was - maybe when I was 23 or so .
I was not a satisfied customer .
Rogaine is icky , greasy , expensive stuff that leaves stains on your future inlaws couch ala Eric LaSalle in Coming to America .
When my head started itching all the time , I quit the hair sauce .
Cold turkey .
I was never convinced it worked anyway .
Since I 'm getting the classic male pattern bald formation my two choices are A ) go bald gracefully , wait for the inevitable spread to the front of my head , and finally go the way of the razor , or , B ) find religion , judasim or islam or something and wear a yarmulke or skull cap until I go the way of the razor .
Plan B is starting to sound tempting .
Why ?
Why , you ask ?
Because people suck .
Apparently when you are struggling with the first stages of baldness , all people want to do is let you know .
Like it 's some fucking public service .
I 'm at a wedding , having a good time getting plowed and minding my own business , but my head attracts the attention of a bridesmaid who casually drops this line to Jon - " Oh , that 's Ed ?
Next to the shiny head guy ? "
A dollar goes to the reader who can guess who the shiny head guy was .
That 's right .
Me. Fuck .
Of course , this comment was n't addressed to me , though that bitch would have to be half - retarded to think I would n't hear about it .
So enter my coworker Fatty McTactless .
I 'm in a meeting with about twenty people .
They called me in to complain about shit , which is their right as fuckwits , but as a master of fuckwit manipulation I have them in awe of my splendor in no less than 15 minutes .
At 20 minutes I ask to leave the meeting , as I am done with them .
On my way to the door Fatty says , " Hey , looks like you 're starting to go bald . "
In front of the whole room and three people in on video screens in the london office .
I turned ready to lunge and beat him dead , but only mustered the following half - assed comment " Must be the job . "
This was one of those unfortunate time machine moments , where you come up with no less than ten great retorts five minutes too late .
As I do not own a time machine , I left the room , never to return , tail between my legs , mind on my head .
Later that day another coworker comes into my office as I am rubbing my eyes and pulling my hair in frustration .
She asks me what 's wrong , and I mutter something and put my head down on my desk .
She asks " Is it because you 're losing your hair ? "
She was n't even in the meeting .
And there was not an ounce of spite in her voice .
It was sympathy mixed with concern .
I felt like puking .
Two comments in one day .
I must look like Mr. Clean .
So if you ever meet me , keep this in mind - YES , I KNOW I AM LOSING MY HAIR .
I KNOW .
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME .
ONLY AN IDIOT COULD BE LOSING HIS HAIR AND NOT REALIZE .
YOU ARE AN ANNOYING COCKWEASEL .

Which is better , giving more food to a few hungry people or letting some food go to waste so that everyone gets a share ?
A study appearing this week in Science finds that most people choose the latter , and that the brain responds in unique ways to inefficiency and inequity .
The study , by researchers at the University of Illinois and the California Institute of Technology , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to scan the brains of people making a series of tough decisions about how to allocate donations to children in a Ugandan orphanage .
The researchers hoped to shed light on the neurological underpinnings of moral decision - making , said co-principal investigator Ming Hsu , a fellow at the U. of I.’s Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology .
“ Morality is a question of broad interest , ” Hsu said .
“ What makes us moral , and how do we make tradeoffs in difficult situations ? ”
An interest in such issues kept the study subjects in the scanner , despite the pain of grappling with difficult choices , Hsu said .
“ Quite a few came out saying : ‘ This is the worst experiment I ’ve ever been in .
I never want to do anything like this again ! ’ ”
The subjects were told that each child would start out with a monetary equivalent of 24 meals , an actual gift from the research team to the orphanage .
An undetermined number of meals would have to be cut from some children ’s allotments , however .
The number of meals cut and the individual children who would be affected depended on how the subjects selected from options the researchers presented .
Every decision pitted efficiency ( the total number of meals given ) against equity ( how much the burden of lost meals was shared among the children ) .
One could choose to take 15 meals from a single child , for example , or 13 meals from one child and five from another .
In the first option the total number of meals lost would be lower .
Efficiency would be preserved , but one child would bear the brunt of all the cuts .
In the second option more children would share the burden of lost meals but more meals would be lost .
The equity was better – but at a cost to efficiency .
“ This dilemma illustrates the core issues of distributive justice , which involves tradeoffs between considerations that are at once compelling but which cannot be simultaneously satisfied , ” the authors wrote .
The study was designed to address the psychological and neurological dimensions of two longstanding debates about distributive justice .
First , is equity or efficiency more critical to our sense of justice ?
And second , are such questions solved by reason alone , or does emotion also play a role ?
In the experiment , subjects watched an animation on a computer screen .
In the animation , a ball traveled from right to left toward a lever that could direct the ball toward one or the other option .
Photographs of the affected children represented each option , with numbers for the number of meals that would be lost to those children if that option were selected .
By moving the lever , the subjects steered the ball to the option they preferred .
At the end of each trial , the subject ’s choice was highlighted in red .
In these trials , subjects overwhelmingly chose to preserve equity at the expense of efficiency , Hsu said .
“ They were all quite inequity averse . ”
The findings support other studies that show that most people are fairly intolerant of inequity .
The animation , in conjunction with the fMRI , allowed the researchers to view activity in the brain at critical moments in the decision - making process .
After analyzing the data , they found that different brain regions – the insula , putamen and caudate – were activated differently , and at different points in the process , Hsu said .
Activation of the insula varied from trial to trial in relation to changes in equity , while activity in the putamen corresponded to changes in efficiency , he said .
In contrast , the caudate appeared to integrate both equity and efficiency once a decision was made .
The involvement of the insula appears to support the notion that emotion plays a role in a person ’s attitude towards inequity , Hsu said .
The insula is known to play a key role in the awareness of bodily states and emotions .
Studies have shown that it is activated in people experiencing hunger or drug - related cravings , and in those feeling intense emotions such as anger , fear , disgust or happiness .
Other research has implicated the insula in mediating fairness .
The putamen and the caudate are activated during reward - related learning .
“ You ’re seeing the signal in the insula and the putamen initially , ” Hsu said .
“ When they hit the lever you see the insula activation .
And when the ball gets to the end you see ( activation of ) the caudate . ”
“ The putamen is responding only to the chosen efficiency , which is how many meals get taken away from the kids or how many meals they end up with , ” Hsu said .
The insula , however , responded to how equitably the burden of lost meals was distributed .
Together , the results “ show how the brain encodes two considerations central to the distributive justice calculus and shed light on the cognitivist / sentimentalist debate regarding the psychological underpinnings of distributive justice , ” the authors wrote .

As losses mount , US banks cut thousands of jobs
By David Walsh
19 April 2008
Banking and other financial firms in the US continue to report enormous financial losses , inevitably accompanied by mass layoffs .
While present and former executives of these companies are well insulated from the disaster over which they have presided , tens of thousands of their employees are not so fortunate .
A number of major US banks reported first - quarter earnings this week , and more will do so next week .
On April 17 , investment bank and the world ’s largest brokerage Merrill Lynch announced a loss of $ 1.96 billion in the first three months of 2008 , a turnaround of more than $ 4 billion from the same period a year ago ( when it made a profit of $ 2.11 billion ) .
Merrill Lynch announced it was eliminating another 2,900 jobs , bringing the total of its proposed job losses for 2008 to 4,000 .
The following day , banking giant Citigroup reported a $ 5.1 billion loss in the first quarter , a change in fortune of $ 10 billion from the first three months of 2007 ( when its profits amounted to $ 5 billion ) .
Forbes.com remarked that the earnings “ were even more dreadful than the miserable results investors had expected . ”
Citigroup has said it will lay off some 9,000 employees in the next 12 months .
This comes on top of 4,000 cuts announced in January .
This is unlikely to be the end of the firm ’s layoffs .
Vikram Pandit , Citi ’s chief executive , indicated Thursday that the bank would be seeking to slash costs by as much as 20 percent .
The comment , noted the Financial Times , had the effect of “ deepening fears that Wall Street and the City of London are about to be hit by tens of thousands of additional job losses . ”
The business paper suggested that analysts are anticipating the elimination of some 25,000 jobs “ in the next few months ” at Citigroup .
The bank is not out of the woods yet .
Moody ’s Investors Service warned that because of “ Citigroup ’s complexity , its significant exposure to the global capital markets , and current illiquidity and volatility of some of those markets , additional marks in its investment bank cannot be ruled out . ”
JPMorgan Chase announced April 16 that its earnings had been cut in half in 2008 ’s first quarter due to problems with mortgages and other bad loans .
JPMorgan ’s recent purchase of bankrupt Bear Stearns will undoubtedly lead to slashing the latter ’s workforce of 14,000 .
The Wall Street Journal reported April 12 that the “ emergency takeover ” is expected to cost at least half of the jobs at Bear Stearns .
Other large US banking firms , such as Washington Mutual ( a $ 1.14 billion loss and 3,000 layoffs ) , Wachovia ( a $ 393 million loss and hundreds of layoffs ) and Wells Fargo ( a decline of 11 percent in profits ) , have also reported grim first quarter earnings .
Bank of America is not expected to have anything good to report next week .
There is no end in sight to the financial and employment bloodletting .
Financial firms globally have taken some $ 200 billion in write - downs ( reductions in the book value of assets because they are overvalued compared to their market value ) since the middle of 2007 .
Citigroup alone has now taken write - downs totaling nearly $ 39 billion since the crisis began ; JPMorgan has taken about $ 10 billion .
After the announcement of Merrill Lynch ’s most recent earnings , John Thain , its new chairman and chief executive , called the first three months of 2008 “ as difficult a quarter as I ’ve seen in my 30 years on Wall Street . ”
Merrill Lynch executives indicated that March was “ a significantly more difficult month ” than January or February .
In an interview with the New York Times April 17 , Thain sounded “ a more negative note than some of his Wall Street colleagues , saying he did not think the downturn was near its bottom . ”
Thain told the Times that thus far “ the slowdown has been finance - driven .
...
What we have n’t seen yet is the impact on the consumer of falling house prices , rising energy prices , higher food prices and higher unemployment . ”
Floyd Norris , the Times ’ chief financial correspondent , writes April 18 that “ Since the big banks first realized last fall that their capital situations were perilous , more than $ 100 billion has been poured into them .
Without all that cash , the system would be in horrid shape , and there would be a lot more blood on the Street . ”
Norris takes note that bank chief executives “ now profess to see light at the end of the tunnel , and they may be right .
...
The trouble with such assurances is that the bosses of Wall Street have been repeatedly blindsided by newly discovered risks that their firms — and others — had taken . ”
Norris ends on a pessimistic note : “ With credit hard to come by , the real economy may be in for rough times , creating more loan losses .
Wall Street may not need to beg for any more capital , but it is a good bet that its layoffs are only starting .
There is not much need for the people who put together securitizations when there is virtually no market for such deals . ”
The estimates on potential job losses in the banking and wider financial arena vary , but they are all substantial .
On April 1 financial research firm Celent LLC issued a report suggesting that some 200,000 of the US commercial banking industry ’s 2 million jobs could be lost over the next 12 to 18 months .
That would be an unprecedented number .
But Octavio Marenzi , the head of New York - based Celent ’s financial consultancy unit , argued that the economic situation was without precedent .
“ The banking industry over the past 40 years has never seen a downturn in its revenue growth , ” Marenzi told the Associated Press .
“ In 2008 , it looks like it will decrease for the first time in living memory .
They ’re going to have to respond with severe cost cutting .
It ’s not an environment they ’re entirely used to . ”
In addition , global securities firms have announced 20,000 job cuts , 6,000 of them in New York .
Financial companies in total have slashed at least 70,000 positions in the US and Europe .
Data provider Experian estimates the final number by the end of 2008 could be 240,000 .
A recent headline in BusinessWeek asked , “ How Deep Will Wall Street Cut ? ”
It reported that Wall Street has announced plans to slash 34,000 positions over the past nine months , but noted that the number of layoffs might not be as great as in recent recessions due to the fact that “ after the dot - com debacle , ” only 74 percent of the jobs that had been lost were filled .
Precisely because “ There is not a lot of fat to cut , ” as one economist puts it , the upcoming job slashing will be more damaging .
“ What ’s worrisome , ” writes BusinessWeek , “ is that companies may have to cut into the meat of their operations . ”
Many positions have been eliminated permanently with improvements in technology , “ helping to keep a lid on costs and head counts in recent years .
Since those ranks remain relatively thin , firms now may have to whack analysts , traders , and dealmakers .
That ’s not good for the island of Manhattan , where many of these high - paid employees work ; banks and brokerages account for 35 percent of the city ’s wages . ”
While workers in the industry suffer the consequences of the economic slump , their employers face no such prospect .
Apparently whether their firms prosper or not , or even go under , banking executives have organized things so they will be paid fabulous amounts .
Citigroup ’s Charles Prince and Merrill Lynch ’s Stanley O’Neal , who stood at the helm of their companies as they lost billions on risky investments in mortgage - backed securities , made off with $ 68 million and $ 161 million , respectively , when they resigned or were forced out .
Former Bear Stearns chairman James Cayne dumped his entire stake in the failed bank for a mere $ 61 million in late March , a fraction of what his stake in the company had once been worth .
We need n’t worry too much about Mr. Cayne .
He made $ 38.31 million in 2006 in total compensation and $ 155.26 million over five years .
There are no indications that he plans to give any of it back .
BusinessWeek last November took note of some of the fantastic “ exit packages ” that CEOs have organized for themselves .
Richard Fuld Jr. , for example , CEO of Lehman Brothers , “ has nothing to worry about — his exit package is valued at $ 299 million , putting him close to the record for any such package . ”
Bank of America ’s chairman and CEO , Kenneth D. Lewis , stands to walk away with $ 120 million , down from an estimated value of $ 136 million at the end of 2006 .
While much of the country is suffering from some combination of job losses , gas and food prices , disappearing benefits and pensions , soaring medical costs and declining house prices , the super - rich are doing quite nicely .
The BBC headlined a recent piece “ Manhattan property defies gravity , ” and pointed out that property prices in New York ’s wealthiest borough had soared 41 percent over the course of the past year .
On average a Manhattan home costs $ 1.6 million , an increase from $ 1.1 million a year ago .
Prices in primarily working class Queens and Staten Island dropped by 5 percent and in the Bronx by 1 percent .
In Brooklyn , which has seen its share of ‘ gentrification ’ and housing speculation , prices rose by 3 percent .
The Real Estate Board ’s Steven Spinola commented , “ Manhattan ’s luxury market for high - end properties continues to remain untouched by the slowing economy . ”
In fact , Spinola suggested that several luxury developments had just become available to meet the “ pent - up demand . ”
For the working population , the situation continues to deteriorate rapidly .
Mass layoffs have been announced in recent days , in addition to those at Merrill Lynch and Citigroup , at AT&T ( 5,000 jobs ) , Volvo Trucks ( 1,100 ) , Asahi Glass ( 900 in the US and Canada ) , Harley - Davison ( 730 ) , Lehman Brothers ( 600 ) , Siemens Energy and Automation ( 477 ) , AMD ( 420 ) , Valley Health System ( 396 ) , Newark Morning Ledger ( 367 ) , Skybus Airlines ( 365 ) , Greenville Hospital in Jersey City , New Jersey ( 356 ) , Aramark Sports and Entertainments ( 303 ) , Baja Marine Corp ( 283 ) , Dutch Housing ( 250 ) and Summit Production Systems ( 200 ) , among other firms .
Meanwhile , paychecks of those who have a job are getting smaller as hours and overtime decline .
The New York Times reported April 18 that “ the reduction of wages and working hours ... has become a primary cause of distress , pushing many more Americans into a downward spiral . ”
From March 2007 to March this year , the average workweek fell slightly from 33.9 hours to 33.8 , with the slippage greater in manufacturing .
Nearly 5 million workers were working part - time at the end of March “ because their companies had cut hours in the face of slack business . ”
That number had jumped 400,000 since November .
Average income declined in March , after accounting for rising prices , the sixth consecutive month “ that pay failed to keep pace with inflation . ”
While the increase in average hourly earnings from February to September 2007 barely kept pace with inflation , that is no longer the case .
From November through March 2008 , as employers began to reduce their operations , “ wage growth fell below the pace of inflation , meaning that paychecks were effectively shrinking . ”

Limbaugh went off the racist / violent rails again when he discussed his " Operation Chaos " plan and sang a little tune about it .
The dream end of this is that this keeps up to the convention and we have a replay of Chicago 1968 with burning cars , protests , fires , literal riots , and all of that .
That 's that 's the objective here . "
This jerk is asking for violence in the streets and the blood to flow .
Responding to this lunacy today --- Rush Limbaugh had to cut off the phone on caller Lisa after she slammed him over his racist and hateful comments that he made about hoping for " riots " in America .
During today 's show ( 4/23 ) Rush made the statement that he is dreaming / hoping for riots after the Dems convention if they choose Hillary over Obama .
He even sang his statment to the " I'm Dreaming of a " WHITE " Christmas " tune .
It appears to me that he is hoping African - Americans will revolt if Obama does n't win and in his dreams we would riot and wipe each other out so that he can indeed have a " white " Christmas / country .
And he said this also : " Riots in Denver , the Democrat Convention would see to it that we do n't elect Democrats , " Limbaugh said during Wednesday 's radio broadcast .
He then went on to say that 's the best thing that could happen to the country .
Here 's the audio of caller Lisa really pouncing on Mr. Viagra : ( it 's a rough transcript )
Download
Lisa :
You were saying that you were hoping for a White Christmas if the Democrats choose Hillary over Obama and you even kind of sang your statement to the tune of White Christmas or did you mean a white country ?
What exactly did you mean by that statement yesterday ?
Rush :
Ho ho ho .
Lisa : Because I feel like all Americans , the American people want is what 's best for this country .
Rush :
No , they do n't .
Lisa :
Why does this have to be a hate - filled comment from you and other radio hosts ?
Rush : Lisa , there 's nothing but love for people , care and concern for people .
Lisa :
It did n't sound that way yesterday .
Rush :
Well , you 're picking a selective moment .
How often do you listen to the show ?
Lisa : I listen almost every day .
Rush :
You do ?
Lisa :
Yes I do .
So I was a bit surprised should I say shocked that you were so blatant with that comment .
Rush : I 've made the comment before .
Lisa :
Who wishes for riots , who wants that to happen in this country ?
Rush :
Who wishes for riots ?
I did n't get the ball rolling , it is Democrats like Al Sharpton that there will be ....
Lisa : Rush .
Rush :
You need to be calling Rev. Sharpton ...
Lisa : I 'm calling the gentlemen who made the comment yesterday and sang to the tune of I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas .
What , what was that about ?
Rush :
It was about nothing .
You are , you are taking ...
Lisa :
You are an intelligent man and I do n't think anything you do is about nothing ...
Rush : Lisa .
Lisa : Everything you say and do on your radio show has a purpose .
I 've been listening long enough to pick up on that , Rush .
Rush :
What 's happening here is that your own racism and your own projection of racism is forcing you ..
Lisa : I have never wished for riots in my country .
Rush :
You are reading my mind .
Between the two of us , you are the racist Lisa : I 'm tired of gas prices , I 'm tired of truck drivers not being able to get to deliver goods .
I 'm tired of people getting kicked out of their homes .
I 'm tired .
I just want what 's best for this country for everybody -- white --- black -- Chinese --- and I NEVER wished for riots .
Rush : I see Americans , you see colors and races ...
Lisa : I did n't say White Christmas or white country , which one ?
< laughter >
Lisa : I wish you would take your comments back and just really start from scratch .
Republicans , Democrats , we need to do away with both parties and what think what 's best for this country and all that would do is put Rush out of business with his hate filled discussions every day ...
Rush :
We need to put liberals out of business , Lisa .
We need to put mush minds out of business like you .
Lisa :
Why am I a mush mind ?
Why are you resulting to name calling , sir ?
He had enough and ended the call .
She forced him to blame Al Sharpton and then called her a " mush mind . "
That 's real intelligent discussion , folks .
I was waiting for him to call her a poopy head or something .
See , he got caught making a fool of himself and knew it , so he stumbled through that call .
Sure , it 's all the liberals fault that this country is so screwed up .
Heck , we 've had the White House since 2000 ...
Oh , sorry , I forgot that Limbaugh and his conservative cronies have run the country into the ground and never lifted a finger to do anything to stop it .
Rush and BushCo. only ushered in and then enabled its demise .
And he was the head cheerleader of the conservative meltdown .
At least he helped expose the country to the destructive principles and practices we receive as a nation led by Conservatives .
The Cat's Diary
Day 983 of My Captivity
My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects .
They dine lavishly on fresh meat , while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets .
Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear , I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength .
The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape .
In an attempt to disgust them , I once again vomit on the carpet .
Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet .
I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts , since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities .
However , they merely made condescending comments about what a " good little hunter " I am .
Bastards !
There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight .
I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event .
However , I could hear the noises and smell the food .
I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of " allergies . "
I must learn what this means , and how to use it to my advantage .
Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking .
I must try this again tomorrow , but at the top of the stairs .
I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches .
The dog receives special privileges .
He is regularly released , and seems to be more than willing to return .
He is obviously retarded .
The bird must be an informant .
I observe him communicate with the guards regularly .
I am certain that he reports my every move .
My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell , so he is safe .
For now ...

If confirmed , the move would represent the biggest step towards peace on the divided peninsula since the Korean war armistice in 1953 .
Less than a year after North Korea tested its first nuclear bomb , the two cold war enemies said they had made substantial progress during bilateral talks in Geneva at the weekend .
In a statement , the North Korean foreign ministry confirmed US reports that it had agreed on measures to neutralise Pyongyang 's existing nuclear facilities within the year .
" In return for this the US decided to take such political and economic measures in compensation as delisting [ North Korea ] as a terrorism sponsor and lifting all sanctions that have been applied according to the Trading with the Enemy Act , " said the statement carried by the state - run Korean Central News Agency .
North Korea has been on Washington 's terrorism list since 1987 , when one of its agents admitted placing a bomb on a South Korean airliner that exploded with a huge loss of life over Burma the same year .
The economic consequences have been dire for an impoverished nation that is unable to feed its own people .
Under the US Trading With the Enemy Act , there is a ban on arms sales and certain types of aid for nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism .
In addition to these formal sanctions , businesses are discouraged from investment and trade with a nation classified as having pariah status .
Korea watchers said a change in designation would be a historic breakthrough .
" Relations with the US are now at their best level since North Korea was invented , " said Glyn Ford , an MEP who played a central role in talks between the European Union and Pyongyang .
" If things continue in this direction on both sides , we could see the world 's last cold war curtain come down . "
Hopes for an end to the conflict surged earlier this year after North Korea shut down its Yongbyon nuclear plant and readmitted inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Six -nation talks aimed at resolving the conflict have made progress , and foreign donors have responded quickly to the disaster appeal that followed last month 's floods .
The European Union has also arranged an economic reform seminar in Pyongyang in October .
The following months could also see a major breakthrough when the South Korean president , Roh Moo-hyun , meets North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong - il , in only the second summit between the two sides in more than half a century .
But it remains to be seen whether concrete action will follow the encouraging rhetoric .
There have been many false dawns in the past .
TUNICA , MS – Floor managers , dealers and players present in the Grand ’s poker room last Thursday all confirm that a severely intoxicated holdem player experienced great difficulty separating the similar yet distinct realities of online and physical poker .
The drunk , identified by casino staff as Michigan tourist Evelio Alderdice , first drew attention to himself by asking players to stop “ hiding their numbers ” .
When pressed , Alderdice explained “ I should be able to see their numbers , their chip numbers .
They ’re hiding them , that ’s cheating .
Waitress ! ”
Other players were at first confused , and allowed the comment to pass as Alderdice sunk back into inebriated silence .
After the next outburst however , player Justin Lowry put two and two together .
“ He started going off , very loudly and like , out of fucking nowhere , about how he had ‘ clicked post ’ before he went to the bathroom and so he should ’ve be dealt in , ” recalled Lowry .
“ It did n’t really hit me until he said something about having a time bank and how he could totally piss in under 2 minutes .
Then I was like shit , this guy thinks he ’s playing online . ”
As the evening progressed , Alderdice displayed even clearer signs of his inability to distinguish between the online and physical versions of the game , including yelling ‘ raise any ’ , ‘ call any ’ , and ‘ fold to any bet ’ before action was anywhere near him ; becoming frustrated when his chips did not move themselves to the center ; not tipping the dealer and constantly wandering over to the cage to see how much money he had left in his ‘ account ’ .
“ On one hand , I felt kind of bad for the guy , ” said player Mike Hutton , “ but on the other hand , it was pretty fucking funny .
I mean , here ’s this guy who just keeps poking the rail like there are buttons there , who keeps talking out loud to himself and gets shocked when other people can hear him … man . ”
“ I ’ve been pretty drunk before at a poker table , ” Hutton continued , “ and like sometimes I ’ll forget what game I ’m playing , like I ’ll confuse limit with no limit or forget I ’m in a tournament .
But I ’ve never been so drunk that I tried to intentionally disconnect to activate all in protection in a live game . ”

If you have been following my blog , you might have noticed that almost all of my projects use the SQLite database engine .
My projects are relatively tiny , low traffic and data is mostly queried , not written .
Such characteristics make SQLite the perfect database for my projects .
If you did not know , the SQLite database is self contained within a single file !
There are no configuration woes , no network security to worry about , no hundreds pages of documentation .
It 's just a single file !
See Distinctive Features of SQLite and Appropriate Uses for SQLite pages to find other points when SQLite is a good fit and when not .
Here is the lecture by Richard Hipp , the author of SQLite :
Here are some interesting facts from the lecture :
[ 02:50 ] SQLite is designed to be embedded , it 's less than 250 KB in size .
[ 08:00 ] Uncommon SQLite uses ( this got me most interested ) : stand - in for client - server DBMS during testing / debugging .
Local database caching .
Implementing complex data structures .
Sorting large amounts of data .
Configuration files .
IPC via database .
Application file formats .

SQLite is very convenient to use as a tool to teach basics of SQL , as it just works .
[ 19:32 ] Unusual features of SQLite : SQLite ignores data types for columns ( you can store string in an integer column , for example ) .
SQLite does type affinity on data inserted in columns .
Table ' sqlite_master ' stores information about tables .
Attaching to multiple databases simultaneously via ATTACH command .
You can join or copy across multiple open databases ( for example , hot backup the database ) .

A few notes from me .
The usage of ' manifest typing ' really confused me in this lecture , because I , and most of the people I have talked to , uses this term for ' static typing ' .
The author of SQLite uses it to mean ' dynamic typing ' .
Do n't know why ...
An SQLite database can be managed via the sqlite ( or sqlite3 ) command line tool or GUI tool such as SQLite Browser ( primitive ) , SQLiteSpy ( advanced ) and SQLite Manager ( as a FireFox Add-on ) .
Finally , here are a few articles you should read if you are interested in more advanced SQLite details :
I hope you enjoyed it and have fun using SQLite for your next project !
In retrospect , I believe that my upbringing in a socialist - oriented family steeped in a class struggle view of society taught me that authorities would often have a different view of right and wrong than mine .
First , if you do not know the experiment ( video ) : a " learner " would be strapped to a chair in the next room -- so they could be heard , but not seen -- and would be asked to remember words from a pair .
If he got it wrong , the professor would tell the tester to operate a machine that would remotely administer electric shocks .
In reality , the thing was staged ; it was really an experiment to see if the tester would submit to authority : " please continue administering the shocks .
" Most " testers " continued to shock as long as the professor told them to , even though they could hear the learner howling in horrible pain .
Perhaps they thought the scientist had some safeguards from actual death , who knows .
But the results show that people are sheep given the right power structure .
This article is by one who refused to continue giving shocks .
His reasons for stopping are interesting :
He goes on to detail the origins of a default suspiciousness of authority :
Like all soldiers [ in WWII ] , I was taught to obey orders , but whenever we heard lectures on army regulations , what stayed with me was that we were also told that soldiers had a right to refuse illegal orders ( though what constituted illegal was left vague ) .
In the early 1950s , I [ the Chairman of the New Haven Communist Party ] was harassed and tailed by the FBI , and in 1954 , along with other leaders of the Communist Party in Connecticut , I was arrested and tried under the Smith Act on charges of " conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the government by force and violence . " ... I believe these experiences also enabled me to stand up to an authoritative " professor . "
...[ the professor ] insisted that I continue [ giving shocks . ]
I refused , offered to give him back the five dollars , and told him that I believed the experiment to be really about how far I would go , that the learner was an accomplice , and that I was determined not to continue .
and his battles with the government : I have a personal bias against communism , so I 'm skeptical of this answer .
By invoking communism / socialism , he is implying that he has a higher sense of rightness than others might , and some attachment to the common man that made him not want to proceed with hurting the guy on the other end of the shocks .
Before you read further , read his quotes again and see if you agree with my assessment .
But here 's why he refused :
He did n't stop because of moral courage ; he stopped because he thought he was being played .
The distinction is extremely important .
His life experiences did n't make him strong against against authority , but to be suspicious that authorityan authority .
And so again , narcissism , though in this case resulting in a " healthy " outcome because it heightened his perception of games and manipulation .
I 'm not criticizing this man -- what he did in this experiment is n't generalizable to other circumstances precisely because he thought it was n't real .
A more interesting question would be how much further he would have gone if he did n't think it was a trick ; when would moral courage as opposed to indignation have taken over ?
Let 's be clear that there is a difference between not playing because you think it 's rigged , and playingit being rigged , doing the best you can anyway , because that is what life is ...
Jumping into Action
Fresh off the assembly line , the leapfrogging , stealthy F - 35B fighter jet prepares for liftoff
Many of you ask me for reports of my evil twin brother Tyrone , but of course I demur because I am too embarrassed to pass along his doings .
They get worse and worse .
Nonetheless ,
Tyrone said he was going public with this one , so I thought the damage was done in any case .
The sad news is that Tyrone is now an active proponent of QAnon .
How can he fall for such fallacies and stupidities ?
He sent me this letter to explain his decision :
Dear Tyler :
You have yourself blogged about the import of child abuse , and asked why it is not condemned more widely , most of all among elites .
You even wrote that the right wing ignored the issue — I thought it is time to remedy that !
We needed a right - wing movement to protect the world ’s most vulnerable citizens , and it turned out that looked like QAnon .
Besides , who is more of an elite than I am ?
To be sure , the QAnon movement has its excesses , but do not all social movements ?
At least it attacks criminals rather than defending them .
The key question is whether social movements shine a light on abusive practices that need further scrutiny , and there QAnon passes with flying colors .
QAnon truly has attracted attention — just look at all the complaints about Facebook enabling it .
In this world you have n’t arrived until someone can turn a criticism of you into a criticism of Facebook .
Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of …stuff … and the world ’s elites continued to treat him as normal and to take his money and fly on his plane .
He was n’t cancelled .
Roman Polanski had a successful and feted career after repeatedly doing very bad … stuff .
The sexual abuse of children has turned out to be rampant in the Catholic Church and also in Hollywood .
I saw the new HBO documentary Showbiz Kids : “ In my experience , I know a lot of kids that grew up in the industry .
And what surprised me when I got older was finding out that pretty much all of the young men were abused in some way , sexually . ”
French intellectuals — and was there ever more of an elite than them ?
— petitioned to repeal age of consent laws so they can do …bad stuff … with less fear of the consequences .
( See ? Petitions really are wrong ! )
By the way , Berlin authorities placed children with pedophiles for thirty years .
And that is in Germany , a country with relatively responsible governance .
This is all so sickening I ca n’t go on any further , and we have n’t even discussed all that goes on over the internet .
There is in fact an epidemic of child abuse , it ruins or seriously damages many millions of lives , and elites are complicit in covering it up and refusing to address the preconditions that generate so much of it .
These same elites often downplay or discourage the elevation of social conservatism , one of the few possible regulatory mechanisms society might have .
In the very worst situations , these elites are directly complicit in covering up the abuse of children .
Many of the elites partake in it themselves .
Which group has done more to publicize these failings than QAnon , the worthy successor to The Jerry Springer Show ?
Yes , Yes I know .
I do not endorse all of their hypotheses concerning political economy .
Maybe Donald Trump will not in fact set all things straight , and perhaps the apocalypse is not around the corner .
No , the molesters do not worship Satan , but given their behavior they might as well .
Should we lock up all those journalists ?
I do n’t know .
Comet Ping Pong was never as good as Pupatella anyway .
But look — this is what you get when you build a mass movement .
The message does get dumbed down and the crazies climb on board , just as we have Antifa and some other weird groups and demands connected to what are otherwise valuable social marches .
Tyler — you have to get used to this new world of internet communications !
Walter Cronkite is gone .
Either compete or give up , and I ’m not willing to do the latter .
For whatever structural reason , elite media seem less obsessed with child abuse as an issue than is “ non-elite media . ”
That is simply a reality we need to work with , and our unwillingness to discard traditional canons of journalism has led to the perpetuation of these abuses for centuries , indeed dating back to the very founding of the American nation .
Have n’t you read Marcuse on repressive tolerance ?
And come on , this very serious guy just wrote this , but not about QAnon :
“ But actually diving into the sea of trash that is social science gives you a more tangible perspective , a more visceral revulsion , and perhaps even a sense of Lovecraftian awe at the sheer magnitude of it all : a vast landfill — a great agglomeration of garbage extending as far as the eye can see , effluvious waves crashing and throwing up a foul foam of p=0.049 papers .
As you walk up to the diving platform , the deformed attendant hands you a pair of flippers .
Noticing your reticence , he gives a subtle nod as if to say : “ come on then , jump in ” . ”
The rot runs much deeper than the fallacies of QAnon .
Besides , it seems that the guy behind QAPPANON ( do n’t ask ) is “ a New Jersey man in his forties with prominent roles in technical analysis and IT security for the banking sector . ”
Could there be a more reliable source ?
And Tyler , I know your criticize me for following these conspiracy theories .
But you yourself have written of the need to imagine a future very different from the present and then bring it about ?
Is that not what a conspiracy tries to do ?
Do we not need to counter these evil conspiracies with some more benevolent plans ?
Most of all , when it comes to evaluating social movements , you can only elevate so many victims at once .
Is n’t the notion of children as the true victims the most universal and indeed the only vision that can unify this great nation ?
People complain about the truth - stretching in QAnon , and OK I get that , but is n’t their real worry the revolutionary re-appropriation of which groups in society can be granted true , # 1 victimhood status ?
Just as Christianity accomplished a similar revaluation way back when ?
( And look at some of the wacky stuff that they believe — ever read The Book of Revelation Tyler ? )
I do n’t want QAnon to be in charge , but what other tool do we have to force elites to deal with this issue ?
Are n’t these just Saul Alinsky tactics ?
QAnon is n’t going to control Congress anyway .
Besides , is not apophenia one of the roots of creativity ?
Have not Millenarian movements played key and sometimes beneficial roles in Western history ?
Is not Christianity itself a Millenarian movement ?
How about all that weird ass shit on the back of your dollar bill ?
Child abuse is the # 1 issue in society right now so …pick your side !
If you do n’t like it , stop your silly blogging and come up with a better anti-child abuse movement .
John L. Allen Jr.
CNN Sr. Vatican Analyst
Vatican Correspondent , National Catholic Reporter
Three days ago , I got an e-mail from a fellow journalist telling me that Bernie McDaid , a victim of priestly sex abuse whom I had met in 2003 in Rome , wanted to reach me .
At the time , I was overwhelmed with coverage of the first day of Pope Benedict XVI ’s trip to America , and inclined to file the e-mail under “ things that can wait . ”
My colleague ’s teaser that “ you ’ll want to hear this , ” however , stirred me to make the call right away .
I sensed something might be up , because two weeks earlier I had interviewed the Vatican ’s ambassador in the United States , Archbishop Pietro Sambi , who told me that a meeting between the pope and sex abuse victims while Benedict was in America remained “ within the field of possibility . ”
I also understood that such a meeting would be historic , since no pope had ever before sat down with victims to hear their stories , offer his apology , and solicit their advice as to how the church might respond .
As it turns out ...
McDaid was among a handful of victims invited to meet with Benedict XVI in a strictly private encounter at the Vatican embassy in Washington on Thursday afternoon .
McDaid shared that information with me on the basis of strict confidentiality until it actually happened , saying the victims had been warned that any advance disclosure could result in the meeting being cancelled .
For any journalist , sitting on a story of the magnitude of the pope ’s meeting with victims was obviously frustrating .
Nevertheless , those were the conditions McDaid and the other victims imposed .
We understood that premature disclosure could also wreck the opportunity for the event to occur at all .
McDaid had reached out to me because of his experience in Rome five years ago .
Along with two other victims from the Boston area , McDaid had come to Rome without any appointments or introductions from anyone , looking to get someone in the Vatican to listen .
Though he did n’t succeed in seeing the pope on that occasion , he did meet with a senior aide , and the event put McDaid on the Vatican radar screen .
As the Vatican correspondent of the National Catholic Reporter , I profiled McDaid at the time , impressed by his dogged efforts to knock on Vatican doors until someone took him seriously .
Wednesday and Thursday , both CNN and my newspaper , the National Catholic Reporter , mobilized to be ready to move when the time came .
In the end , the news broke on CNN ’s Situation Room and on - line on NCR ’s web site just instants after the Vatican issued a statement confirming that the meeting took place .
In a TV exclusive just hours later , McDaid and two of the other victims , Olan Horne and Faith Johnston , told their stories to CNN ’s Campbell Brown and Anderson Cooper .
Listening to all three describe the abuse they suffered , and what meeting the pope meant to them , made for some powerful television .
As things move forward , there will be legitimate questions about whether Pope Benedict ’s strong language and gestures about the sex abuse crisis will result in new policies or structural changes in the church .
But for those who thought it was time to just stop talking about it , Pope Benedict ’s record this week certainly points to a very different approach .
Even if we had to wait a couple of days , that ’s a story worth telling .
AMERICAN science is in trouble , and if you wonder why , just go to the movies .
Popular culture is gradually turning against science , and Ben Stein 's new movie , " Expelled , " is helping to push it along .
" Intelligent Design , " the relabeled , repackaged form of American creationism , has always had a problem .
It just can't seem to produce any evidence .
To scientists , the reasons for this are obvious .
To conservative Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer , Intelligent Design is nothing more than a " phony theory . "
No data , no science , no experiments , just an attempt to sneak a narrow set of religious views into US classrooms .
Advocates of Intelligent Design needed a story to explain why the idea has been a nonstarter within the scientific community , and Ben Stein has given it to them .
The story line is that Intelligent Design advocates are persecuted and suppressed .
" Expelled " tells of this terrible campaign against free expression , and mocks the pretensions of the closed - minded scientific elite supposedly behind it .
There are many things wrong with this movie .
One example : Viewers are told that Dr. Richard Sternberg lost his job at the Smithsonian Institution because he edited a paper favorable to Intelligent Design .
Wrong .
Sternberg was n't even employed by the Smithsonian ( he had no job to lose ) , and had resigned as journal editor six months before the paper was published .
In fact , the irony is that neither Steinberg nor any of the other people featured as martyrs in " Expelled " lost jobs as a result of their advocacy of Intelligent Design , while many others who supported evolution have .
In 2007 , Chris Comer , the director of science education for Texas schools , was fired for having done nothing more than forwarding an e-mail announcing a pro-evolution seminar .
The movie also uses interviews with avowed atheists like Richard Dawkins , author of " The God Delusion , " to argue that scientific establishment is vehemently anti-God .
Never mind that 40 percent of the members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science profess belief in a personal God.
Stein , avoiding these 50,000 people , tells viewers that " Darwinists " do n't allow scientists to even think of God .
Puzzled , the editors of Scientific American asked Mark Mathis , the film 's co-producer , why he and Stein did n't interview such people , like Francis Collins ( head of the Human Genome Project ) , Francisco Ayala , or myself .
Mathis cited me by name , saying " Ken Miller would have confused the film unnecessarily . "
In other words , showing a scientist who accepts both God and evolution would have confused their story line .
Despite these falsehoods , by far the film 's most outlandish misrepresentation is its linkage of Darwin with the Holocaust .
A concentration camp tour guide tells Stein that the Nazis were practicing " Darwinism , " and that 's that .
Never mind those belt buckles proclaiming Gott mit uns ( God is with us ) , the toxic anti-Semitism of Martin Luther , the ghettoes and murderous pogroms in Christian Europe centuries before Darwin 's birth .
No matter .
It 's all the fault of evolution .
Why is all this nonsense a threat to science ?
The reason is Stein 's libelous conclusion that science is simply evil .
In an April 21 interview on the Trinity Broadcast Network , Stein called the Nazi murder of children " horrifying beyond words . "
Indeed .
But what led to such horrors ?
Stein explained : " that 's where science in my opinion , this is just an opinion , that 's where science leads you .
Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place .
Science leads you to killing people . "
According to Stein , science leads you to " killing people . "
Not to cures and vaccines , not to a deeper understanding of nature , not to wonders like computers and cellphones , and certainly not to a better life .
Nope .
Science is murder .
" Expelled " is a shoddy piece of propaganda that props up the failures of Intelligent Design by playing the victim card .
It deceives its audiences , slanders the scientific community , and contributes mightily to a climate of hostility to science itself .
Stein is doing nothing less than helping turn a generation of American youth away from science .
If we actually come to believe that science leads to murder , then we deserve to lose world leadership in science .
In that sense , the word " expelled " may have a different and more tragic connotation for our country than Stein intended .
Kenneth R. Miller , a biology professor at Brown University , is author of " Only a Theory - Evolution and the Battle for America 's Soul , " which will be published next month .

It seems that not even the trusty curtain is safe from the future .
Apart from automating the opening and closing of the curtains themselves you would n’t think there was much to be done in terms of truly modernising window coverings .
Well , it appears there ’s definitely room for curtain evolution .
Here are a few curtain developments that even a geek would be intrigued by .
Liquid Crystal Curtains
According to Japanese company Micro Reactor Co Ltd , the future of curtains is …… plastic .
That is , a plastic which changes from clear to opaque at the touch of a button .
In between the 2 flexible plastic panels which form the covering sit liquid crystal molecules which switch as an electrical current passes through .
The result is an intriguing and surreal window that can change appearance in seconds .
Magnetic Curtains
Designer Florian Kräutli decided to invent a new breed of window covering simply by adding dozens of small magnets to the material , the result being an incredibly versatile and moldable curtain that seems to stick to whatever shape you desire .
This immediately negates the need for cords to both open / close the curtains and gives an impressively modern look to any room .
A simple but brilliant re-invention .
ASCII Curtains
To find an example geekier than this incredible ASCII curtain by designer Nieke Sybrandy would require some serious effort .
Printed on the fabric itself is the silhouette of a tree branch , in itself nice but certainly not geeky , however if you look closely you will notice that the branch has been created using ASCII characters .
A worthy addition to any technology lover ’s room .
Wiimote - Controlled Curtains
If you ’re the kind of person who spends the majority of their time in front of the Wii , locked away from the outside world , the chances are you also can’t find the time or effort to rise from a seated position in order to open curtains .
Help is on its way in the form of Wiimote controlled curtains as seen in the clip above .
Energy Curtains
The Energy Curtain , developed by Swedish research projectSTATIC !
in 2005 , is a window covering created using ‘ a combination of textile , solar - collecting and light - emitting materials ’ .
The amazingly effective result is a curtain that stores solar energy during the day only for it be used at night in the form of a gentle , power saving light source on the surface of the fabric .
Why these are n’t already being used on a wide scale is baffling .
Educational Shower Curtains
Finally : Shower Curtains .
I ’ve been in the shower countless times and wished for some educational reading material , only to be deterred by the thought of soggy textbooks .
If only I ’d known about these shower curtains from TILCO .
Printed on the material is enough information to keep you amused for at least an extra 10 minutes .
Curtains currently available include French Vocabulary , Spanish Vocabulary , Geography , Maths and The Periodic Table .
Scrub ‘ n’ Learn indeed .
In a stunning admission last Friday , President Bush told ABC's Martha Raddatz that it's " probably true " the next terrorist attack on America is being planned and plotted right now in Afghanistan / Pakistan .
Download Download
Remember the good old days when Bush " listened to the advice of commanders on the ground " ?
It 's a shame he's not listening to Admiral Mullen , who is pretty damn worried about the deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan .
Bush says : " We 've got plenty of firepower to take out al Qaeda cells in Afghanistan . "
Adm .
Mullen says : " The Taliban is growing bolder .
Suicide attacks are on the rise , and so is the trade in illegal narcotics .
Requirements exist there that we simply can not fill , and wo n't likely be able to fill , until conditions improve in Iraq . "
It 's simply stunning that the President can sit there and admit with a straight face that the next attack is " probably " brewing in Afghanistan , and that 's he 's unwilling to devote more resources there even though his top military commander says he needs them .
Simply .
Stunning .
Readers of my deeplink on safeguarding your laptop and digital devices from warrantless searches at the border responded with both questions and answers .
Some readers wondered whether you have an obligation not to destroy information on your laptop .
Others pointed out that U.S. citizens may be detained , but not turned away , at the U.S. border .
Many technologists wrote to offer cryptographic solutions , or warnings about encryption schemes that are not as secure as they should be .
In this post , I answer the question about destruction of information and reproduce or summarize , with permission , others ' suggestions about protecting your laptop from arbitrary searches .
I have n't done any independent analysis of these techniques or tools , so your mileage may vary .
Duty to delete ?
A complete discussion of the federal law of destruction of evidence , and of state law on the topic , is beyond the scope of this post ( see here for a textbook on the subject ) .
However , individuals who are not anticipating being sued and who do not know they are under criminal investigation generally have no obligation to preserve information on their laptops .
If you have notice of an impending civil suit or government investigation , then you are obligated to preserve relevant material .
Failure to preserve evidence for a civil suit can result in any of the potential sanctions for discovery violations , including fines and adverse jury instructions .
Under federal criminal law , knowing destruction of evidence relevant to a pending judicial proceeding or administrative investigation can be punished with up to twenty years in prison .
Further , destroying evidence in furtherance of an illegal scheme may also be aiding and abetting , or conspiracy .
In sum , international travelers trying only to protect privileged information , trade secrets or private communications or photos , have no obligation under federal law to preserve these documents on a laptop so that they may be reviewed by border guards .

Whit Diffie 's advice to Mac users :
Do n't allow passphrases for encrypted disk files to be saved on your keychain .
Crypto pioneer Whitfield Diffie observes that while the Mac Disk Utility encryption offers perfectly fine AES128 encryption , you must opt out to avoid having the key you give stored on you keychain , i.e. , encrypted in your login password .
Since login passwords are rarely more than a few characters long the effect is render your encrypted file vulnerable to a forensic study of the disk .
Once a key has been written on the disk , you have to scrub the whole disk very carefully before you can be sure it is gone .
Do n't allow passphrases for encrypted disk files to be saved on your keychain .
Gone but not forgotten : EFF co-founder John Gilmore warns that merely deleting files will not remove them from your hard drive .
You must overwrite the file contents .
Macs have a " Secure Erase Trash " and Linux machines have " shred - u " , that also overwrites the file contents and the file names before removal .
A variety of Windows secure wipe utilities are available online .
John adds that secure erasure does n't work on flash drives ( which have an extra layer of data allocation software to do " wear leveling " so that lots of writing to particular parts of the chip do n't wear out that part prematurely ) .
There are technical ways to physically erase some parts of some flash drives , but I do n't know any file systems that can actually do it .

Truecrypt : Finally , many people wrote in about Truecrypt and its provision of " plausable deniability . "
A user can have an encrypted partition ( which can be hidden as any file on your hard drive ) and within that partition hide another partition .
One password will reveal one partition and another separate password will reveal the other .
Because of the way Truecrypt encrypts the partition table itself , an observer cannot detect a hidden partition even if she has access to the " regular " encrypted share .
This gives a traveler something to decrypt if a Customs official asks , while keeping the rest of your information secure .
Remember , however , that lying to a federal law enforcement officer about material facts is a crime , so if you choose to answer a question about whether there are additional encrypted partitions , you are obligated to answer truthfully .
I hope these pragmatic tips help people keep their data secure from arbitrary searches at the border .

Yesterday , there was a lot of buzz about how the RocketBoom founder put his Twitter account up for sale on eBay .
When I last checked , the account with 1,500 followers was going for $ 1,125 .
How about those that have twice as many friends on Facebook ?
Technically , selling your profile would theoretically violate Facebook ’s terms of service since it would be a misrepresentation of the person using the profile .
Then again , you could switch the email address and photo and it would n’t be that person ’s profile anymore .
While I have n’t inquired into Facebook , my guess is that any sold profile would be immediately banned .
Such a situation also make one wonder which profile is more valuable , a Facebook profile with 1,500 friends or a Twitter account with 1,500 followers .
In my own opinion I think Twitter could be more influential but then again leveraging friends lists on Facebook can accomplish the same goals .
Ultimately , I ’m not sure that you can sell any social profile .
People add you as a friend on social sites because they actually know you or have similar interests .
There is n’t much value once the person you wanted to connect with is not active .
What do you think ?
Self - Righteousness in the State Capitols
The mantra of almost all conservatives — it makes no difference what political party they belong to — is to keep government out of their lives .
But , they do n’t mind government interference when it plays to their biases and bigotry .
For example , it ’s perfectly acceptable for the government to enter one ’s bedroom if the purpose is to ban homosexual activity and — horrors ! — gay marriage .
In Pennsylvania , political conservatives and religious fundamentalists thought the existing state law against same - sex marriage was vulnerable to a constitutional challenge , and wanted something more permanent — a constitutional amendment to “ preserve ” the sanctity of marriage .
Having heard the call — and an opportunity to score with his constituents — State Sen .
John Gordner unleashed his horse and charged into battle , thrusting his sword of righteousness into every hole that could allow for same - sex marriage .
The proposed amendment sailed through the judiciary and appropriations committees , of which Gordner is a member , and onto the Senate floor where the Republican - dominated Senate was expected to pass it and forever preserve what they believe is the sanctity of marriage .
“ We do not want to take away any existing rights that gay and lesbian partners have , ” said the senator from Pennsylvania ’s rural northeast .
Nonsense , said Sen. Vincent Fumo of Philadelphia .
“ When you enter this language into the Constitution , you ’re begging to overthrow Devlin and everything else , ” said Fumo .
Devlin v. Philadelphia assured that same - sex rights were permissible as long as there was nothing to create a “ functional equivalent of marriage . ”
A constitutional amendment could eliminate all benefits , Fumo pointed out .
With tongue - in - cheek reasoning , Fumo thrust home his concern by suggesting an amendment to the proposed amendment .
If same - sex marriage destroys the institution of marriage , why not ban all divorce , he suggested .
As a windstorm of protests emerged , the senators ran for the shelter of political expediency .
Since the state ’s House of Representatives probably would n’t waste its time on such an outrageous display of public pandering , the Senate tabled the bill and blamed the House .
This is the political “ two - step . ”
The senators could continue to spout moral and religious bigotry while blaming some else for the problem .
A week after the Pennsylvania Senate ’s blunderbusses blew up in their face , California became the second state , after Massachusetts , to throw out a state law against same - sex marriage .
California ’s law was passed in 2000 by 61 percent of the voters .
In an overview of the issue , Chief Justice Ronald M. George , a Republican , noted , “ [ An ] individual ’s capacity to establish a loving and long - term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individual ’s sexual orientation . ”
In his majority opinion , George cited a 1948 California case that overturned a law that banned interracial marriage .
“ An individual ’s sexual orientation — like a person ’s race or gender — does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights , ” he wrote .
This is not an activist / liberal court that conservatives so frequently blame for what they see as all of the nation ’s problems .
“ The decision was a bold surprise from a moderately conservative , Republican - dominated court that legal scholars have long dubbed ‘ cautious , ’ ” noted the Los Angeles Times .
The religious right and conservative movements are n’t bending over and taking their defeats .
They ’re gathering signatures to place onto the November ballot a constitutional amendment to forbid same - sex marriage .
That amendment would be more powerful than any state law .
Ironically , such a constitutional amendment may be unconstitutional .
Twenty - six states have laws that ban same - sex marriage , and Florida already has a proposed constitutional amendment ready for the November election .
For conservatives , apparently , there is n’t enough governmental intrusion when it comes to continuing bigotry .
Last week , Michael V Bhatia became a casualty of the US Army 's " human terrain " programme .
Studying for a political science doctorate at Oxford , he was serving as a civilian with the 82nd Airborne Division when he was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan .
Faced with the long conflict there and in Iraq , the US military has realised that sheer firepower is not enough .
The Pentagon has discovered the " human terrain " or what General David Petraeus calls the " cultural terrain " and has been recruiting anthropologists and social scientists to map it and advise commanders on local social networks .
Despite an outcry from critics , academics have been joining the Defense Department 's " human terrain system " ( HTS ) teams out of a sense of patriotism or for the reputedly high salaries on offer .
Bhatia himself is reported to have strongly defended the programme .
The HTS , according to the military , is " designed to address cultural awareness shortcomings by giving brigade commanders an organic capability to help understand and deal with ' human terrain ' - the social , ethnographic , cultural , economic and political elements of the people among whom a force is operating " .
The Bush administration is just trying to buy more time , says John Kelly , chair of the University of Chicago 's high - ranked anthropology department and joint organiser of a conference on anthropology and global counterinsurgency held there last month .
Objections to the HTS programme range from the inherent secrecy of mission - oriented research to , as eminent anthropologist Marshall Sahlins observes , " manipulating local culture , imposing [ our government 's objectives ] on them , transforming anthropologists into spies , and putting people you work with [ in the locale ] at risk " .
Last November , the executive board of the American Anthropological Association ( AAA ) formally discouraged its members from taking part in HTS programmes .
Hugh Gusterson , of George Mason University , Washington and David Price , of St Martin 's University , Virginia formed the Network of Concerned Anthropologists to urge colleagues to pledge " non-participation in counter - insurgency " .
Over 1,000 anthropologists in the past six months have signed the pledge .
Proponents of the HTS programme , such as anthropologist Montgomery McFate , a senior adviser to the HTS system , argue that savvy , integrated systems yield humane and streamlined combat operations .
" The ultimate goal , " Sahlins retorts , is merely " better aim " - more pinpointed killing .
" They call it humane because they want to target people better . "
Others fear the more insidious distortion of scholarship by Pentagon money .
" The HTS teams are , in some ways , the easy case , " says Gusterson .
" The hard case is the constant , slow , military infusion of resources into the academy . "
There are several examples .
The Minerva Consortia Project is a Pentagon - funded incentive for universities to promote research on certain areas of interest to the military .
The National Research Council advised the Pentagon to double its research budget for behavioural and social sciences , in order to ådevise " important specific applications addressed to military needs " .
HTS advocates declined invitations to the Chicago conference , but scholars such as Brian Selmeski , at Air University , Alabama , and Kerry Fosher , of Marine Corps Intelligence Activity showed up to make spirited cases for " working within the system " .
The conference also dissected the Counterinsurgency Manual , a military document that became a US bestseller .
The manual implies " an endless future of counterinsurgency interventions , " Kelly notes .
" It contains no section on withdrawal . "
Given that the one thing scholars - for - hire cannot say is that the mission abroad is a bad idea , how can they really be scholars ?
What is the point of helping the government " perform a bad mission better " ?
someone asked .
What should anthropologists do to help ?
The AAA says anthropologists are " obliged to help improve US government policies through the widest possible circulation of anthropological understanding in the public sphere " .
" Anthropology works best when it is in conversation , " said Kelly , who praised the military participants at the conference for their candour and courage .
" We have to discuss and do real research and find things we do n't already know . "

The final death toll is expected to reach at least 50,000 Chinese President Hu Jintao has voiced his gratitude for the international aid following Monday 's massive earthquake .
" I express heartfelt thanks to the foreign governments and international friends , " Mr Hu was quoted as saying by the state - run Xinhua news agency .
Offers of help in the relief effort from home and abroad have now surpassed $ 860 m ( £ 440 m ) , Chinese officials say .
The number of confirmed deaths of the quake in the south - western Sichuan province has now risen to 32,477 .
More than 10,600 people are believed to be still trapped , Xinhua said , citing regional officials .
They put the number of injured at 220,109 .
The final death toll following the 7.9 - magnitude quake is expected to reach at least 50,000 people , Chinese officials estimate .
Nuclear facilities in the affected area have been confirmed to be safe , the ministry of environmental protection 's Nuclear Safety Department said , Xinhua has reported .
China has a research reactor , two nuclear fuel production sites and two nuclear weapon facilities in Sichuan , all between 60 and 145 km ( 40 - 90 miles ) from the epicentre , according to the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety .
Aftershocks Rescue efforts resumed in Beichuan , after the entire city was evacuated amid fears that it could be engulfed by a river bursting its banks .

The city - that lies near the epicentre of the quake - was reduced to ruins .
But the search was halted on Saturday as rumours of a flood saw a stampede of people fleeing to higher ground .
Several people were dug out of the rubble on Saturday , including a 31 - year - old woman in Deyang city , and a 33 - year - old miner in Shifang , both about 124 hours after being buried .
The region shuddered again as a strong aftershock - measured by the US Geological Survey at 6.0 - struck at 0108 Sunday local time ( 1508 GMT Saturday ) .
There have been hundreds of aftershocks since Monday 's quake , some causing landslides which have made conditions even more difficult .
Rescue work has also been hampered by heavy rain in some areas .
Mass graves
The Chinese government has organised a massive search and rescue effort .
It released figures on Saturday demonstrating the scale of the operation .

It said 220,109 people had been recorded injured , not just in Sichuan , but in Gansu , Shaanxi , Chongqing , Hubei , Henan , and Guizhou provinces .
It said some 181,460 tents , 220,000 quilts , and 170,000 cotton - padded garments had been despatched to the disaster area .
The first aid supplied by the US has arrived , with an air force plane loaded with tents , lanterns and 15,000 meals landing in Sichuan 's provincial capital , Chengdu .
Rescue teams from South Korea , Singapore and Russia have joined Japanese and Taiwanese experts taking part in the massive search .
Uncertain times for survivors
Dams pose flooding risk Life in tent city However , a British rescue team standing by in Hong Kong is returning home after being refused permission to travel to the earthquake zone .
The specialist teams are equipped with sniffer dogs , and fibre - optic cameras and heat sensors to detect people buried under the rubble .
But experts say the chances of finding people alive are diminishing , and increasingly it is dead bodies which are being retrieved .
The authorities have resorted to burying the bodies in mass graves .
People in the quake zone are being told to wear face masks and disinfectant teams are out in force , even though the World Health Organisation says there is little significant risk of disease from unburied bodies .

Give an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters , the theory goes , and they will eventually produce prose the likes of Shakespeare .
Give six monkeys one computer for a month , and they will make a mess .
Researchers at Plymouth University in England reported this week that primates left alone with a computer attacked the machine and failed to produce a single word .
" They pressed a lot of S's , " researcher Mike Phillips said Friday .
" Obviously , English is n't their first language . "
A group of faculty and students in the university 's media program left a computer in the monkey enclosure at Paignton Zoo in southwest England , home to six Sulawesi crested macaques .
Then , they waited .
At first , said Phillips , " the lead male got a stone and started bashing the hell out of it .
" Another thing they were interested in was in defecating and urinating all over the keyboard , " added Phillips , who runs the university 's Institute of Digital Arts and Technologies .
Eventually , monkeys Elmo , Gum , Heather , Holly , Mistletoe and Rowan produced five pages of text , composed primarily of the letter S. Later , the letters A , J , L and M crept in .
Phillips said the project , funded by England 's Arts Council rather than by scientific bodies , was intended more as performance art than scientific experiment .
The notion that monkeys typing at random will eventually produce literature is often attributed to Thomas Huxley , a 19th - century scientist who supported Charles Darwin 's theories of evolution .
Mathematicians have also used it to illustrate concepts of chance .
The Plymouth experiment was part of the Vivaria Project , which plans to install computers in zoos across Europe to study differences between animal and artificial life .
Phillips said the experiment showed that monkeys " are not random generators .
They 're more complex than that .
" They were quite interested in the screen , and they saw that when they typed a letter , something happened .
There was a level of intention there . "
When you get caught doing something you 've campaigned fervently against , it looks really bad .
Just ask Eliot Spitzer , and maybe Sony's ( NYSE : SNE ) and Bertelsmann 's Sony BMG music label .
A small French company has alleged that Sony BMG pirated its software .
According to sources like Wired News , a small French software company named PointDev is after Sony BMG for pirating its software .
Apparently , it was found on four of the company 's servers .
PointDev has said it is n't interested in " an amicable settlement " with Sony BMG , on account of principle .
According to translations of the original article reporting the situation , Sony BMG even tried to convince French news source La Provence not to release the story .
I 'm not the first and certainly not the last to think this story is steeped in irony .
Sony BMG is one of the high - profile members of the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , a trade group that also includes major labels from Warner Music Group ( NYSE : WMG ) , EMI , and Vivendi's Universal Music Group .
And of course , it 's not lost on anybody that the RIAA has been hard at work for the last couple years suing the pants off consumers for piracy .
But I guess that 's different ?
Not really .
And of course , its zeal to stop piracy in its tracks led to the rootkit controversy a couple years ago , too .
Sony BMG planted what many considered the equivalent of spyware on customers ' machines when they loaded up some of its CDs onto their PCs .
When I 'm considering stocks to invest in , I like to take a look at how the companies deal with customers and the world , and I like to try to avoid the ones that seem to teem with hubris or the implication that a company feels it can play by different rules than everybody else .
And of course , the ongoing RIAA lawsuits have always struck me as a poor way to treat your fans when industry innovation would likely make everybody happy .
And it 's not like there is n't innovation and experimentation taking place -- take Nine Inch Nails ' recent move .
Sony BMG may be only a small part of electronics and media giant Sony , but this type of story , with what appears to be a heaping dose of hypocrisy , gives us investors a textbook look at how companies should not conduct themselves .
WASHINGTON  Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign is in a troubled stretch , hindered by resignations of staff members , a lagging effort to build a national campaign organization and questions over whether he has taken full advantage of Democratic turmoil to present a case for his candidacy , Republicans say .
In interviews , some party leaders said they were worried about signs of disorder in his campaign , and if the focus in the last several weeks on the prominent role of lobbyists in Mr. McCain ’s inner circle might undercut the heart of his general election message : that he is a reformer taking on special interests in Washington .
“ The core image of John McCain is as a reformer in Washington  and the more dominant the story is about the lobbying teams around him , the more you put that into question , ” said Terry Nelson , who was Mr. McCain ’s campaign manager until he left in a shake - up last fall .
“ If the Obama campaign can truly change him from being seen as a reformer to just being another Washington politician , it could be very damaging over the course of the campaign . ”
The ousters of some of the staff members came after Mr. McCain imposed a new policy that active lobbyists would not be allowed to hold paying jobs in the campaign .
Most people agree that emotions can be caused by a specific event and that the person experiencing it is aware of the cause , such as a child 's excitement at the sound of an ice cream truck .
But recent research suggests emotions also can be unconsciously evoked and manipulated .
Psychologists Kirsten Ruys and Diedrick Stapel of the Tilburg Institute for Behavioral Economics Research at Tillburg University in The Netherlands have uncovered the first empirical evidence to suggest humans do not need to be aware of the event that caused their mood or feelings in order to be affected by it .
The scientists hypothesized that , since humans have evolved to respond quickly and unconsciously to stimuli , they should be able to react to an emotional event without full awareness : " You are likely to live longer if you immediately stop moving at the sight of a growling grizzly bear and do not need full awareness for such a response to be instigated , " explained Ruys and Stapel .
The researchers measured people 's thoughts , feelings and behavior to determine whether specific emotions were induced without awareness of their cause -- a study based on the theory implying that , due to natural selection , humans should be able to detect specific emotion - evoking information automatically .
Participants were separated into three groups and were told that very short flashes would appear on a computer screen .
They were then instructed to press the ' R ' key if it appeared on the right side of the screen or the ' L ' key if it appeared on the left .
In actuality , the ' flashes ' were subliminal images selected to elicit fear , disgust or no emotion at all .
The images flashed at varying speeds making it impossible for the participants to be fully conscious of their presence .
In other words , the participants were unaware that they were viewing images of growling dogs and dirty toilets or even neutral images , such as horses or chairs .
The participants then underwent three tests to measure the effect of the images on their cognition , feelings and behavior .
For the cognitive measure , they completed word fragments with a variety of words including those that expressed disgust , fear , anger , generally negative , generally positive and neutral feelings .
Next , participants rated the overall positivity or negativity of their mood and the extent to which they felt fearful , disgusted , satisfied , relieved , proud , angry , shameful and joyful on 7 - point scales .
During the behavioral measure , participants were asked to take part in either a ' strange food test ' or a ' scary movie test , ' assuming that , for example , those who were exposed to the disgusting images would want to avoid the possibility of eating something unpleasant .
At the end of the study , the researchers asked gradually more specific questions about the subliminal images to gauge the participants ' awareness of the study 's purpose and intent .
The intriguing results , which appear in the April issue of Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , strongly support the psychologists ' theory .
Those participants who viewed only the disgust - inducing subliminal images were more likely to use disgust words in the word - completion task , to describe their feelings with the disgust words and to choose to take the ' scary movie test . '
The same held true for those who viewed only the fear - inducing images -- they also were more likely to use words related to fear and to take the ' strange food test . '
The psychologists also found that after quick ( 120 ms ) speed exposures to emotional stimuli , a general , negative mood developed accompanied by a specific emotion , such as fear after seeing fearful pictures .
After the super - quick ( 40 ms ) speed exposure , only a general negative mood was induced without a specific emotion involved .
These empirical findings are the first to demonstrate that specific emotions can be evoked without awareness of the cause and that a person 's global mood can develop into a specific emotion .
And while the study did not investigate how an individual eventually becomes conscious of their emotions , the scientists did pose an additional hypothesis :
" When emotions are full - blown , people become aware of their emotions by perceiving their own actions and bodily reactions ; likewise , when emotions are weak , people fail to notice their weakly - related actions and bodily reactions . "

The new rules will affect more than 2,500 businesses in the area
New rules have been passed in the San Francisco Bay Area that will require businesses to pay fees for the amount of carbon dioxide they emit .
The rules , due to come into effect on 1 July , could cost big emitters more than $ 50,000 ( £ 25,000 ) a year , but most firms will pay less than $ 1 ( 50 p ) .
Backers say the move sets an important precedent for the rest of the US .
But opponents say it may interfere with plans to introduce much tougher emissions targets across California .
The state 's governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , signed a landmark law designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change in 2006 .
The California Air Resources
Board is due to release its preliminary proposals to implement the law next month , with a final plan to be approved later this year .
Opposition San Francisco's new fees , voted in by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and said to be the first of their kind in the US , will cover more than 2,500 businesses in nine counties .
Companies will have to measure and report their own emissions before being charged 4.4 cents ( 2.2 p ) per ton of carbon dioxide they release .
The biggest payers will be a handful of power plants and oil refineries in the region .
The charges are expected to generate some $ 1.1 m in their first year , which will help pay for programmes to measure and control local greenhouse gas emissions .
Many Bay Area firms have opposed the move , saying it may make it more difficult and expensive to do business in the region , the Associated Press reports .
Cathy Reheis - Boyd , chief operating officer for the Western States Petroleum Association , told the AP that a broader state - wide plan was needed to address climate change .
" We believe it 's premature for local air districts to design local programmes before we have state programmes , " she said .
The Bay Area is home to some seven million people and is among the wealthiest regions of the US .

TOKYO  The Dalai Lama said Thursday that he supported Beijing ’s hosting of the Summer Olympics , but he insisted that pro-Tibet demonstrators had the right to voice their opinions during the international torch relay as long as they refrained from violence .
During a brief stopover in Japan on his way to the United States , the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , told reporters no one should try to silence demonstrators who are protesting Chinese rule in Tibet .
But he struck a conciliatory tone toward Beijing , apparently distancing himself from calls in the West for a boycott of the Olympic opening ceremony .
“ We are not anti-Chinese , ” he said at a news conference at Tokyo ’s main international airport in Narita .
“ Right from the beginning , we supported the Olympic Games . ”
Speaking of pro-Tibetan protesters , he said nobody “ has the right to tell them to shut up . ”
He faulted Beijing for suppressing antigovernment unrest in Tibet last month , saying its use of violence was “ an outdated method ” that did not solve the underlying problems .
That unrest , the most severe in the region in two decades , and the resulting Chinese crackdown have touched off sympathy protests around the world , with demonstrators demanding greater freedom in Tibet .

[ xmonad ] xmonad is one year old today
Happy first birthday xmonad !
On this day in 2007 , Spencer comitted the first prototype code into our xmonad darcs repository , starting off a year long adventure that has been xmonad development .
Tue Mar 6 17:35:27 PST
2007 Spencer Janssen * Initial import .
We 'd long been frustrated with the limits of dwm and wmii , and were looking to make a nicer , more extensible window manager .
A year later , we seem to have pretty much accomplished those original goals !
Some other nice commits from the early days .
Tue Mar 6 22:42:23 PST
2007 Spencer Janssen * Plan for statusbar Tue Mar 6 22:45:39 PST
2007 Don Stewart * focus left and right ( mod-j/ mod -k ) Wed Mar 7 03:12:47 PST 2007 Don Stewart *
Add support for multiple workspaces
Yes , that 's right , for a day there xmonad only suppored one workspace :)
Wed Mar 7 17:04:24 PST 2007 Don Stewart * Add Alt - Shift - [ 1..5 ] , to move the current client to a new workspace 2 days after the first commit , our now extensive QuickCheck testsuite was in place , Thu Mar 8 04:05:21 PST 2007 Don Stewart * forgot to add Properties .hs Leading to 1000s of window manager tests now run on every commit !
And building a culture of testing and reasoning -- we 're perhaps the first window manager ever to use static analysis , type theory ( the zipper structure ! ) and theorem proving to improve code quality !
Since there there 's been 7 releases , and thousands of commits .
A total of more than 50 developers have contributed code .
Thank you all !
Looking back on the year , it feels amazing -- it does n't feel like 12 months have past .
With nearly 300 people on the mailing list here , 100 in the #xmonad irc channel , and binary packages for almost every distro .
The extension library , which is now 8 times larger than xmonad itself , came as a big surprise , and turned out to be critical in keeping the project flexible and robust .
Spencer and I are looking forward to another exciting year , with more great innovations in the extension suite , and improved flexibility in the core system .
Let 's keep tiling window manager innovation fresh and exciting !
And thanks to all the developers who 've made this possible :

“ Facebook boosters say social networking represents the future of online activity .
Advertisers are attracted to these sites because they offer an opportunity to aim ads at particular users who are likely to be interested in their product or service . ”
— Brad Stone , New York Times
“ Clearly , Facebook is another uber - capitalist experiment : can you make money out of friendship ?
Can you create communities free of national boundaries — and then sell Coca - Cola to them ?
Facebook is profoundly uncreative .
It makes nothing at all .
It simply mediates in relationships that were happening anyway . ”
— Tom Hodgkinson , the Guardian
I recently read that Facebook sold 1.6 % of its shares to Microsoft for , I think , 240 million dollars ( we all gasp , ‘ Why did n’t I think of Facebook ! ’ ) .
This leaves Facebook ’s total ‘ value ’ at something insane like $ 15 billion .
One cannot quite comprehend how this could be , in a world of such disparity .
Then again , what better place ?
I never got Facebook at all .
I clicked on to join from being asked quite a few times and barely knew how to write messages or anything else .
And I have no illusions that my life is at all private in this day and age of uber - technology .
Yet no matter how brutal or intrusive the world may be ( and we allow it to be ) , I remind myself , there remains that beautiful symbiotic treasure known as the heart and mind .
Halelujah !
People try to change it , push it , hurt it , twist it , torture it and destroy it , but nobody else can own it ( not even Facebook ) .
It is yours .
FACE( RECOGNITION ) BOOK
As for Facebook , my girlfriend read this article from Tom Hodgkinson in the Guardian called With friends like these … and decided she did n’t want to be on Facebook anymore ( she had never really been on it anyway , except from the urging of friends ) .
Having a lot of that sheep - like nature the owners of Facebook are compelled to manipulate , I was more than happy to follow her lead and delete myself from the system , too ( you can check out any time you like but can you ever leave ? ) .
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH INTELLIGENCE
Read the article for yourself , of course ( notice the CIA stock involvement — and if you feel your heart can take it , read about the CIA a little more in The Shock Doctrine ) .
The piece in the Guardian describes some objectives ( and perhaps natures ) of some of the principle shareholders of Facebook .
I have no real idea about the deep intentions of the founders and owners of Facebook , but some of their quotes in the article are alarming if predictable .
I actually hope for them in the future great wisdom and joy ( to go with their money ) , and a shift in their certainty of how things are .
An excerpt from the Hodgkinson article , with a take I do not agree with in its entirety — for instance I do not want to sit around with friends in a pub , virtual or otherwise — but the information is useful :
Although the project was initially conceived by media cover star Mark Zuckerberg , the real face behind Facebook is the 40 - year - old Silicon Valley venture capitalist and futurist philosopher Peter Thiel …
But Thiel is more than just a clever and avaricious capitalist .
He is a futurist philosopher and neocon activist [ whether he calls himself a neo - con , I do n't know ] .
A philosophy graduate from Stanford , in 1998 he co-wrote a book called The Diversity Myth , which is a detailed attack on liberalism and the multiculturalist ideology that dominated Stanford .
He claimed that the “ multiculture ” led to a lessening of individual freedoms [ one can only ask , of course , freedoms for whom ? ] .
While a student at Stanford , Thiel founded a rightwing journal , still up and running , called The Stanford Review — motto : Fiat Lux ( “ Let there be light ” ) .
Please , yes , and may it be full of wisdom , compassion and understanding of both the beauty and difficulty ( and potential ) of being human — as opposed to a light that blinds the unready citizen into terrorised paralysis .
Thiel is a member of TheVanguard .
Org , an internet - based neoconservative pressure group that was set up to attack MoveOn.org , a liberal pressure group that works on the web .
Thiel calls himself “ way libertarian ” .
The term Vanguard was also well - used by Vladimir Lenin , for the record .
Lenin believed utterly in the Vanguard of the proletariat — a few people who control the many , who are ‘ free ’ but need to be controlled due to their stupidity .
Is there not a similarity here with the Facebook fellas ’ viewpoint ?
Indeed , laissez - faire actually means laissez - faire for the respective vanguards .
Hardly original .
This little taster from [ The Vanguard ] website will give you an idea of their vision for the world : “ The Vanguard .
Org is an online community of Americans who believe in conservative values , the free market and limited government as the best means to bring hope and ever - increasing opportunity to everyone , especially the poorest among us . ”
Fair enough … but has anybody noticed the bipolar clash lately between the ideology of Conservatives in power over the last , say , forty years ( yes , including Reagan ) , and conservative values based on anything close to the original meaning of the term ?
Could these ‘ Conservative ’ US leaders of the last quarter of the 20th century up to today , with their vast subsidized - by - the - tax - payer spending , possibly have found any better way to make a bigger State ?
The debt , the war , the trough of subsidies ( handouts ) to countless companies , from Agribusiness to Weapons to Securities , is a manipulative , Orwellian scam , and has nothing to do with a so - called free - market — nor has it ever , as far as I can tell .
Hodgkinson continues :
Their aim is to promote policies that will “ reshape America and the globe ” .
The Vanguard describes its politics as “ Reaganite / Thatcherite ” .
The chairman ’s message says : “ Today we ’ll teach MoveOn [ the liberal website ] , Hillary and the leftwing media some lessons they never imagined … ”
When Hillary — with her grand ties to all the massive multinational corporations that these guys adore , by definition — is seen as a problem , an outsider , by the Facebook neo-cons ( as they are described ) , the word extreme comes to mind .
Exactly what massive ‘ Conservative ’ corporation would Hillary not have to be sold out to to be in line with the TheVanguard ?
PARTY POLITICS
Further , does not the idea of teaching people “ lessons they never imagined … ” have a disconcerting Nazi ring to it ?
Anybody wise knows that surely even within the so - called “ leftwing media ” there are some important ideas .
To not see this is to be profoundly unoriginal and deeply predictable — which does not mean that one still ca n’t possess exorbitant amounts of power and influence .
By the way , if the “ leftwing media ” , as it is disparaged , was truly in control , there would n’t be a war — let alone a war that has enriched the multinational Vanguard and pushed several nations and their citizenry into inconceivable debt .
Individuality is profoundly complex , and to not recognize the strengths and beauty of those outside one ’s own way of thinking is anything but libertarian or small ‘ c ’ conservative .
Perhaps , though , it is Reaganite / Thatcherite , which suddenly , in spirit , resembles the Bolsheviks , Stalinists , Troskyites and Marxist - Leninists — to return to the Vanguard idea .
To confuse ‘ the freedom to maximize profit regardless of human dignity ’ with ‘ freedom to be one ’s self ’ — and consider the former libertarian — is to be , it seems to me , totalitarianly confused .
So , Thiel ’s politics are not in doubt .
What about his philosophy …?
Thiel ’s philosophical mentor is one René Girard of Stanford University , proponent of a theory of human behaviour called mimetic desire .
Girard reckons that people are essentially sheep - like and will copy one another without much reflection .
This , of course , has truth in it .
‘ People do appear to follow trends , ’ I said , aware of the understatement .
And Girard ’s ideas ( which I do not know well ) , about the source of desire after our basic desires are met , are interesting , but far from definitive .
A THEORY ON A THEORY
I have no idea if what I am about to say is valid , but let me suggest that if we humans are essentially sheep - like with our desires , then there are , with great variation , of course , three possible options .
They are , one : to not realise this fact of our sheep - like nature .
Two : to realise this fact and exploit those who do not realise this fact .
Three : to realise this fact , and be in service of those who remain in ignorance .
I use the word service in the most conscious sense of the term .
The first two options are so predictable as to be unoriginal .
Could the third way , perhaps , offer some transcendence from our greedy and ignorant sheep - like natures ?
The grandest ignorance of all , however , might be to believe that one can somehow be in control of his or her situation — all the more by controllng others .
Death ultimately proves this fallacy .
Everybody alive today , wildly possessed by all of these problems , will be dead within a hundred and twenty years .
Everybody .
In the meantime , even birth for countless billions , into brutal , seemingly unchosen conditions , might also to some suggest how little control we have .
THE ORIGIN OF NATURES
In short , what Facebook strategists possibly do n’t understand is that they , too , are followers — even with their immense power and wealth .
They are following , like sheep ( or maybe pack wolves ) , a philosophy that says ‘ people are sheep , and the only thing left to do is maximize the exploitation of said sheep . ’
If one chooses a Darwinist worldview ( or it chooses them ) , perhaps exploitation is intelligent .
But is social Darwinism the truth of our being here ?
And following its core value is many things , but original is not one of them .
THE COMPANY’S COMPANY
Hitler ( and Lenin and others ) and Burson Marstellar etc work on similar beliefs .
Hitler said something to the effect , “ It is fortunate for leaders that people do not think . ”
Fair enough .
I prefer to think that I would like as many people as possible around me , including myself , to learn to think more , for the sake of each other , for the planet , for everyone .
Instead of exploitation , why not , as the song says , try a little tenderness ?
Why not create , say , video games that actually increase a person ’s knowledge , decrease sheep - like tendencies and increase deeper - thinking solidarity , instead of hand - eye coordination for mindlessly shooting people one has never met ?
If you ’re so brilliant , owners of Facebook , create that .
Create beauty .
If Thiel and his co-sheep herders find a salvation ( and perhaps they do ) in their ability to manipulate sheep , I would suggest that says as much about Thiel and co. as the sheep .
Were a person with such desires able to transcend that desire , that nature , would not the result be stunning and expansive originality ?
To quote Pindar , if one does n’t transcend such disdain of people , they risk “ becoming like that which they hate . ”
Of course , those disdaining will have money and be celebrated and have the freedom to sit around slapping each other ’s backs and see the world as a chess game , but they still remain their own cynical race of sheep — and they do n’t even know it .
Well , here ’s to the sheep - like irony of human nature .
Because one can bash someone else ’s brains in , it does n’t make one better by therefore doing so .
Perhaps one is ‘ better ’ by actually considering that another person ’s life , their desire to live , to be free and so on , like their own desire , has meaning .
For those who believe in exploitation , manipulation is simple .
Why ?
Well , most people , I think , tend to figure others are generally on the up - and - up — although that belief may be diminishing too .
Hence , kids never go out in the city alone , gated communities etc .
The article continues :
The theory would also seem to be proved correct in the case of Thiel ’s virtual worlds : the desired object is irrelevant ; all you need to know is that human beings will tend to move in flocks .
Hence financial bubbles .
Hence the enormous popularity of Facebook .
Girard is a regular at Thiel ’s intellectual soirees .
What you do n’t hear about in Thiel ’s philosophy , by the way , are old - fashioned real - world concepts such as art , beauty , love , pleasure and truth .
And you most likely never will .
Humans are of different natures .
We follow that nature .
Disdain for the masses , cynicism , maximizing profit is not original , it is the sheep - like response to following one ’s — some would suggest unfortunate — nature .
Exploitation is not original !— although it is clearly seductive and addictive .
And to be fair , a given method of exploitation may be original .
But exploitation itself is as old as hello .
The internet is immensely appealing to neocons such as Thiel because it promises a certain sort of freedom in human relations and in business , freedom from pesky national laws , national boundaries and suchlike .
The internet opens up a world of free trade and laissez - faire expansion .
Thiel also seems to approve of offshore tax havens , and claims that 40 % of the world ’s wealth resides in places such as Vanuatu , the Cayman Islands , Monaco and Barbados .
Fair enough .
No taxes ?
Great .
But does it matter at all where that money comes from ?
It has been suggested that 8 % of the world ’s wealth is from narco - trafficking .
Great .
You ’re rich .
Congratulations .
And the banking lobbies continue to do all they can to avoid laws or bills being passed that try to uncover the origins of this dirty money , let alone stopping it from going through their system .
As the Chinese leader recently said about Darfur : “ Business is business . ”
And on the news every night , the sheep - that - we - are listen to the travails of the War on Drugs — which is , in sum , kept alive by an endless repeated barrage of propaganda and lies because certain Vanguards here and there think it ’s a good thing to maximize profit by exploiting and manipulating the sheep .
Congratulations .
To finish :
I think it ’s fair to say that Thiel … likes the globalisation of digital culture because it makes the banking overlords hard to attack : “ You ca n’t have a workers ’ revolution to take over a bank if the bank is in Vanuatu , ” he says .
Lenin for all his rhetoric also hated the worker ’s desire for standard rights — and from there came the Soviet Union .
Very original ?
Not so much .
The full article is here .
Say No To Facebook , if only to celebrate your own non -sheep - like mysterious beauty , while the wolves circle .
And anyway , wolves are beautiful too , they just do n’t know it yet .
Once in a while , armed with yoga , one has to stand and fight .
Love , freedom , creativity and true originality to you and yours ,
Pete

Reader Daniel pointed our attention to this photograph of a military trailer , carrying Humvees and headed towards Manhattan on Flatbush .
He noticed that the center one was " outfitted with the so - called non-lethal Active Denial System . "
What 's the Active Denial System , you ask ?
Here 's how the AP described ADS in 2007 : " The military calls its new weapon an ' active denial system , ' but that 's an understatement .
It 's a ray gun that shoots a beam that makes people feel as if they are about to catch fire . "
As for why the Humvees were in the city , maybe they were shipped to the Red Hook Container Terminal and will be used to ... help protect the Pope !
The small crowd she attracted in rural South Dakota on Thursday was quiet and polite , with none of the exuberance that usually greets Mrs. Clinton at her campaign stops .
( A campaign aide suggested it could have been due to the cultural mores of South Dakotans . )
In Oregon on Friday , her first event , staged in a house in a quiet residential neighborhood , was described as a round - table discussion on the economy .
Mrs. Clinton , surrounded by six people at a dining - room table , frequently drifted back to telling stories of economic woe and despair .
She told the story of a couple she met in Ohio who faithfully mailed in their mortgage check every month , only to have their home taken away from them in a home - foreclosure scam .
Mentioning the federal government , Mrs. Clinton said , “ There ’s such a sense of paralysis . ”
“ Here we are , the greatest nation in the world , the greatest problem solvers , but we ’re not solving our problems , ” she said .
Largely absent from her swing through South Dakota and Oregon , two of the four states ( plus Puerto Rico ) that have yet to hold primaries , was any mention of her opponent .
On Thursday , she mentioned Mr. Obama only when she defended him from Mr. Bush ’s remarks that implicitly compared him to appeasers of Nazis .
The Clinton campaign began running three more television advertisements on Friday in Oregon and Kentucky , none of which criticized Mr. Obama directly .
An aide said that in the coming days , Mrs. Clinton planned to focus on the economy and avoid directly criticizing Mr. Obama .
She cut short what was scheduled to be a two - day visit to Oregon , where Mr. Obama is expected to win , deciding instead to fly to Kentucky late on Friday .
She will spend four days there , make an election - night speech on Tuesday and then return to Washington later that day .
C&L creator , John Amato , appeared on MSNBC Friday to talk about GOP presidential candidate , John McCain 's new ad , and the free pass he 's received from the mainstream media during the primary season .
We 've covered the media 's love affair with the aging Arizona Senator , and as John points out , all he has to run on is his war record and the media has been all too happy to help him out :

" Well , of course the only thing that John McCain can run on is that he 's the military man and the media helps him out .
I mean , he has this gaffe , he does n't know who 's in Iran , are they Iraqi , a Shiite , or an extremist and the media lets him off the hook so he does n't need these commercials because the media 's helping him out already . "
Amato also brings up the escalating violence in Basra and Baghdad , which shows how the crumbling surge could hurt John McCain , but he was cut off by MSNBC host Mark Mullen -- who seemed more interested in talking about Al Gore jumping in the Democratic primary race -- which proves John 's point , as Mullen gives McCain a free pass on the one issue he 's staking his entire candidacy on .
Last week , we learned from a leaked memo that Time Warner Cable is preparing to roll out usage - based broadband service tiers to new customers in Beaumont , TX .
The company has since confirmed its plans , with monthly bandwidth caps set at 5GB , 10GB , 20GB , and 40 GB .
Customers who exceed their cap would be hit with an undetermined per-gigabyte charge , but Bell Canada 's overage fees , which range from CAN $ 1.00 to CAN$ 7.50 per gigabyte , may give some inkling of where Time Warner 's overage fees will end up .
Usage caps are a short - sighted response to capacity constraints , one that 's likely to hurt the company more than it will help in the long run—especially with new broadband options on the horizon .
Time Warner 's plans have received a mixed reception , to say the least .
Public interest groups such as Public Knowledge have praised the move , with PK president Gigi Sohn calling it a " welcome development for consumers and for the cable industry . "
At the other end of the spectrum are high - bandwidth users and companies who are concerned that low caps will slow down the pace of innovation on the Internet .
The idea behind usage - based billing is to charge consumers who use the most bandwidth accordingly .
And telling customers that they have X GB of data to burn through each month is better than the kinds of nebulous caps some cable subscribers have bumped into .
Still , I 'd argue that Time Warner and any other cable company considering bandwidth caps is taking a short - sighted view of the problem .
Time Warner is n't the only US cable company to contemplate usage caps .
Light Reading reports that Charter has plans to go a " usage - based solution , " while Comcast director of communications Charlie Douglas told me that Comcast " continuously evaluates " a number of pricing models , including " consumption - based billing . "
Unsurprisingly , Verizon — whose PR people in the CES press room never hesitated to talk smack about the cable industry to me last week — has no plans to trial bandwidth caps with either its plain DSL or FiOS service .
" I think this is Time Warner 's response to the cable companies ' problem in a shortage of bandwidth , " a Verizon spokesperson recently told BusinessWeek .
" We do n't think that we are in a position that we need to do that . "
Ever since the Federal Communications Commission started on its deregulation rampage under former Chairman Michael Powell , US Internet users have been faced with a paucity of choice when it comes to broadband .
If they 're lucky , those wanting broadband have two providers to choose from : one for cable and one for DSL .
Some ( like me , even though I live in Chicago ) , have only one viable option .
Others are stuck with satellite broadband with its usage caps and poor latencies , or , still worse , dial - up .
Competition on the horizon
But the broadband landscape is finally primed for change , and companies like Time Warner that decide to cap bandwidth use run the risk of consigning themselves to a broadband ghetto , a place where a service 's limitations makes it unattractive compared to newly available alternatives .
Those alternatives should begin arriving as soon as this spring , when Sprint officially opens its Xohm WiMAX network for business .
Our experience with Xohm ( admittedly in a very controlled environment ) leads us to believe that it could be a legitimate contender to DSL and lower - speed cable .
I saw speeds of 2.5 Mbps with very acceptable latency during a demo on the Chicago River last summer , and the experience of surfing the ' Net on WiMAX was akin to using wired DSL .
Although pricing and service tiers have yet to be announced , Sprint has said it will be priced competitively with wired broadband and will not have usage restrictions .
Looking a bit further ahead , there 's the 700M Hz spectrum that 's going to be auctioned off beginning this week , and the possibility of " white space " wireless broadband service .
None of that spectrum will be available until the end of analog television transmissions in February 2009 , and it will be a little while after that before networks are built that can take advantage of the spectrum .
There 's also LTE ( Long Term Evolution ) , a 4G wireless broadband spec current undergoing preliminary testing .
Recent trials carried out by Nokia saw speeds of 173 Mbps , but the technology is still at least two years from deployment .
On the wired front , cable companies are facing competition in select areas from Verizon 's FiOS and AT&T's U - Verse deployments .
AT&T 's service is less attractive by virtue of its use of copper wiring for the connection between its network cabinets and homes , which has led the company to cap speeds at 6 M bps .
FiOS , on the other hand , topped a recent Consumer Reports ISP satisfaction survey and is causing geeks to relocate to get in on its fiber - to - the - home goodness .
All of that is to say that cable and DSL wo n't always be the only games in town .
If wireless solutions are able to deliver on their promises of high speeds with no usage limits , capped cable broadband service like Time Warner has planned is likely to be unattractive , to say the least .
Instead of developing plans designed to discourage consumers from feeding at the bandwidth trough , cable companies would be better served in the long run by making investments in new technologies like DOCSIS 3.0 and the kind of infrastructure improvements necessary to meet bandwidth demands .
Those kinds of expenditures can be unpopular with shareholders unwilling to see earnings suffer in the short term so that a company can better position themselves to compete in the long term .
But it 's a better alternative to positioning your company as the Dollar Store of broadband providers .
Sorry for the long hiatus , School has kept me quite busy , I ’ll get right back into it though .
Check below the fold .
Religion in general seems to be about this god fellow .
An apparently invisible superforce who willy - nilly screws around with life on our particular blue marble .
Fundies think he ’s male , hates gays and anyone who disagrees with them , and is locked in near - endless battle with the forces of evil .
Some people think that there are lots of these toddlers gallavanting around in the cosmos , harrassing each other , messing with peoples lives , and generally frakking things up pretty good for the rest of us .
But what is god ?
I am a firm believer in the following three facts .
Let me start by stating the following : logic is infallible within it ’s realm .
This is a big statement for someone like me .
Especially since it may seem that I believe in the same things I condemn , that is , in complete infallibility .
However , look closer , I did n’t say that logic was completely infallible , only that it was so within it ’s realm .
Pure logic cannot address every question , for to do so it would have to be what ’s known as a “ complete ” system , and a mathematician named Kurt Godel showed that it was impossible to have a system which was both complete and infallible , in the mathematical world , we call this infallibility “ consistence . ”
Godel ’s proof boils down to the first fundamental fact I believe in .
There cannot exist a logical system that is both complete and consistent simultaneously .
I believe this because it is a proven result of consistent logic [ 1 ] , so it ’s not really a matter of belief or disbelief , it ’s a matter of acceptance .
Which leads me to the following fact :
When we prove a fact true in consistent logic , it is unequivocably true .
That is ,
If proposition A implies proposition B , it will do so today , tomorrow , and forever .
Mathematical Truths are immutable .
Another bold statment , but really , it ’s just a restatement of the idea of consistent logic , and it ’s a tradeoff , that axiom says , fundamentally , that we cannot address every question , that there will always be things we simply cannot talk about using our logic , but it does guarentee that everything we say , assuming we ’ve not broken any logical rules , will be true .
Finally , I believe the following :
Everything that exists , materially or otherwise , must follow the rules of logic .
Further , anything that interacts with us materially , must be bound by the laws and rules of material physics .
In short , you cannot cheat , you must play by the set of rules for whatever “ game ” you play .
This is the only axiom I am really accepting here , the first two ideas were definitions or theorems , this is an assumption I make about reality , that everything , including god , if such a thing exists , is bound to play by the rules of logic .
Not Science , Science cannot address god , science is a study of the material world , the supernatural is outside it ’s purview .
However , everything must be logical , and that is the truly fundamental assumption I make .
The second clause gives what I feel is really a corollary to the first clause , that is , it would be illogical for a creature to not be affected by gravity without some kind of physical adaptation or apparatus preventing gravity from acting upon it .
Effectively , I am assuming that there is no such thing as magic .
There is no way for me to do something that is inherently without reason , I ca n’t just stop obeying the laws of gravity , I have to have a reason .
So , whats this all about ?
Why should you care about this ?
Well ,
God is an interesting character , many different groups of people believe he can do many different things .
Some believe he is omniscient , some believe he is omnipotent , others , omnipresent .
My question is this , Under the assumption a god did exist , what would he look like ?
What supposed attributes hold up under logical scrutiny .
I do n’t kid myself , true believers who think their particular god is omnipotent or omniscient wo n’t stop just because a silly thing like logic or proof get in the way .
Really this is an exercise in philosophy , something which I enjoy , and I think people like me might enjoy .
It is interesting to think about a god , whether or not he exists .
It ’s a thought experiment about whether or not we can prove or disprove the existence of god [ 2 ] , and if we can prove , or at the least cannot disprove , the existence of god , what kind of god would he be ?
I intend to do a few of these posts , try to reason through some of the big attributes , many of them will be structured as informal proofs .
Many of them will also be conditional , that is , it may be possible for god to have attribute A , but having A might preclude him from having attributes B or C , etc .
I look forward to working on these a bit .
[ 1 ] Godel proved , using consistent logic , that any logic of sufficient expressive power could not be complete .
This implies that any complete logic cannot also be consistent .
So there is no circular reasoning problem , proving things about logic with logic is done quite often , and it does work , I promise , and I can prove it . 🙂
[ 2 ]
It is my opinion that this is an , unfortunately , impossible feat of logic .
For reasons to be explained in a later post .

Scientists at the heart of one of the greatest scandals in modern science made a dramatic leap forward in stem cell research without realising it , an investigation into their work revealed yesterday .
Hwang Woo-suk , a leading stem cell scientist , from South Korea , fell from grace last year when an official inquest found he had faked data on human cloning .
The fraud severely dented hopes for treatments based on embryonic stem cells , which in principle can grow into any tissue in the body .
But it appears he has inadvertently achieved a world first , according to researchers who studied his work .
Dr Hwang 's team had succeeded in extracting stem cells from human eggs forced to undergo parthenogenesis , where eggs develop into early - stage embryos despite not being fertilised by sperm .
The feat has been a much sought goal for stem cell scientists , since it paves the way for the creation of human tissues that are genetically identical to those of the egg donor .
Replacement organ tissues or nerve fibres grown from a woman 's stem cells could be used to treat serious diseases or injuries without fear of rejection from the immunity system of the recipient .
A team of experts , including researchers at Harvard and Cambridge universities , analysed stem cells created by Dr Hwang 's group , and found that some stem cells must have come from an unfertilised human egg alone , and not from a cloned embryo as Dr Hwang originally claimed .
Some animals , such as Komodo dragons and hammerhead sharks , can deliver healthy offspring via virgin births , the outcome of unfertilised eggs becoming embryos .
Very rarely human eggs divide without being fertilised , but the embryos are flawed so rejected in the womb .
The latest study , led by George Daley at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute , clears up the mystery of how Dr Hwang 's stem cells were created .
Details of the study appear in the journal Cell Stem Cell .
Dr Daley noted : " They might represent a favourable source for tissue replacement therapies . "
Last month , a team of US and Russian researchers said they had derived embryonic stem cells from unfertilised eggs .
Miodrag Stojkovic , the professor who , in 2005 , created Britain 's first cloned human embryo , said stem cells from eggs could make a substantial impact on medicine .
" They offer hope for patient - specific stem cells because they contain only the woman 's DNA so are genetically identical to [ her ] , " he said .
The US military said the soldier 's actions were an isolated incident
An American sniper has been sent home from Iraq for using a copy of the Koran for target practice at a shooting range near Baghdad , the US military says .
The Muslim holy book was found riddled with bullet holes last week by Iraqi police , who also discovered offensive graffiti inside its cover .
A US military spokesman said the soldier had been removed from his unit , sent home , and would be disciplined .
He was unnamed , but was reportedly a staff sergeant in a sniper section .
US military spokesman Colonel Bill Buckner said the incident was " both serious and deeply troubling " , but stressed it was an " isolated incident and a result of one soldier 's actions " .
The US army 's commander in Baghdad , Major - General Jeffery Hammond , made a personal apology to local Sunni Arab leaders in Radwaniya , CNN reported .
On arrival , he was met by hundreds of protesting tribesmen .
" In the most humble manner , I look into your eyes today and I say , please forgive me and my soldiers , " Gen Hammond said , according to CNN .
The military presented the elders with a new copy of the Koran .
An Iraqi community leader said Sunni Arab tribal units who fought alongside US forces had threatened to quit , but that the US apology had assuaged their anger .
" I was feeling bitterness , but as long as they apologised we are okay with them .
Our anger has cooled , " Saeed al - Zubaie told Reuters .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. commanders in Afghanistan have recently urged expanding the war effort , possibly including U.S. attacks on indigenous Pakistani militants inside Pakistan ’s tribal areas , The New York Times reported in Sunday editions .
Citing U.S. officials , the Times reported the requests had been rebuffed for now following internal Bush administration deliberations in which U.S. officials expressed fears that attacks on Pakistani radicals could foment anger within Pakistan ’s new government , which has been negotiating with the militants , and destabilize security there .
One Bush administration official said the Washington discussions involved President George W. Bush ’s top national security aides and took place earlier this year .
White House and State Department spokesmen declined to comment , as did a spokeswoman for the U.S. ambassador in Pakistan , Anne Patterson , the Times said .
Officials said the U.S. proposals included possible limited cross - border artillery strikes into Pakistan , missile attacks by Predator aircraft or raids by small teams of CIA paramilitary forces or Special Operations forces , according to the Times .
The newspaper reported that U.S. commanders preferred that Pakistani forces conduct such attacks , but that Pakistani military operations in the tribal areas had declined as negotiations with the militants played out .
U.S. officials in Afghanistan urging attacks in Pakistan had discussed possible targets with Patterson , the Times said .
The U.S. commanders ’ requests for attacks were described by officials who were briefed on the discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity , the newspaper said .
The Times said that while Pakistan had given the CIA limited authority to kill Arab and other foreign operatives in tribal regions , it had placed greater restrictions on U.S. operations against indigenous Pakistani militant groups , including one thought to have been behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last December .
It was not clear whether senior Washington officials were part of the debate on authorizing attacks , the Times said .
U.S. officials said they had not ruled out striking Pakistani militants in the tribal areas , the report said .
“ It ’s certainly something we want to get to , but not yet , ” the Times quoted an administration official as saying .
The European Commission laid out its views in Strasbourg on Tuesday , May 20 .
The project is open to all EU member states as well as countries from North Africa , the Middle East and the Balkans and includes the Palestinian authorities .
This is an initiative to reinforce , to reinvigorate our relationship , " EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner said at a press conference .
" The more we can develop the region in the South , the less illegal migration there will be …The more prosperity we can give , the less terrorism , the less criminality will be there . "
Potential tasks for the new union will be to open new sea traffic routes , clean up Mediterranean waters , improve maritime security and exploit solar power in Northern Africa to help meet Europe 's energy needs .
Slight to Sarkozy ?
The new Union could help better regulate Mediterranean waters
But the association described by the EU falls short of what France -- and in particular French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- had envisioned .
Sarkozy had hoped for a much more tightly knit alliance restricted to territories with Mediterranean shores .
He had touted his vision as a potential avenue for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and had hinted it might be offered to Turkey as an alternative to EU membership .
But those plans were scaled back after objections by powerful EU states not actually bordering the Mediterranean , including Germany .
Sarkozy was unable to win over the rest of the EU
Turkey also only agreed to participate , if offered assurances that the Union was not being put forward as an alternative to joining the EU -- something the Commission explicitly stated on Tuesday .
" This project is not directed against Turkey , " Ferrero - Waldner said .
The EU also scaled back the bureaucracy for the Union and the frequency with which it will meet , making it essentially a new umbrella organization for an already existing Euro - Mediterranean partnership known as the Barcelona Process .
The inaugural summit for the new bloc is scheduled for mid-July in Paris .

Deaths from violence are still high but down from a year ago
At least 633 civilians died , according to data from several ministries - up from more than 460 deaths in January .
The increase was mainly due to two attacks in Baghdad and one near Karbala that killed at least 150 people .
The sharp rise reverses a six - month trend of fewer casualties , but it is still down from 1,645 civilians killed in February 2007 , according to Reuters .
The February 2006 bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra triggered a wave of violence in Iraq that peaked with 1,992 deaths in January 2007 , according to AFP news agency .
The trend of decreasing civilian deaths from violent attacks is being attributed to an increase in US troop numbers , a ceasefire from the Mehdi army Shia militia , and the growth of Sunni Arab neighbourhood security units .
Pilgrims targeted
The two attacks in Baghdad , which took place on 1 February , were the deadliest for months in the capital and were initially blamed on two mentally disabled women .
Iraqi security forces were ordered to detain beggars and mentally disabled people found on Baghdad 's streets after fears that al - Qaeda in Iraq were attempting to recruit them .
A US military official later said that the two women who had carried out the bombings had undergone psychiatric treatment for depression and schizophrenia .
A third suicide bombing in Iskandariya , south of Baghdad , took the lives of at least 50 Shia pilgrims who were making their way to a religious festival in Karbala on 24 February .
It 's about time that United States elite academic institutions finally got around to not only using open - source software , but also teaching it .
In the April 2008 edition of Harvard Business Review , Harvard gives its MBA students a taste of the decision facing every company that leverages technology as part of its business ( namely , everyone ) :
Should I embrace or fight open source ?
In the case study , " Open Source : Salvation or Suicide , " HBR tags along with Evan and Martina ( " Marty " )
Dirweg as Evan tries to persuade Marty that her successful business will become even more so with open source , rather than as a proprietary software / hardware vendor .
Marty 's dilemma is palpable , as open - source competitors ( who grew up on her company 's technology but have now opened it up to the world ) start to eat her lunch :
...[ Marty ] challenged [ Evan ] to come out with it :
What could be wrong with the company 's so - far highly successful strategy of jealously guarding its intellectual property ?
Why should she open the software in Amp Up , as he had so casually suggested on the phone ?
Why should she invite the open - source community into the company vault , so to speak , and allow it to play with the crown jewels ?
on open - source software ....
" Marty , these guys are n't going away .
The point is , it 's no longer just individuals hacking into your hardware and software or making game controllers of their own or writing code for themselves and their friends .
It 's companies now , too .
Companies with real money behind them .
These people are passionate about the user community that you created four years ago by bringing Amp Up into the world .
And they 're just as passionate about the idea that the user and developer communities should be based on open source , with developers being able to freely swap and write software to fashion applications as they see fit . " ( 2 )
As with all Harvard case studies , there is no resolution to the dilemma - just the open question ( pun intended ) :
To open source or not to open source ?
Not open sourcing , as the case study implies , is a losing game .
There is simply too much interest in open communities created to develop software in the image of those communities , and not in any single vendor 's image .
But the case study also implies that how to make a business in open source is not necessarily easy .
The case study suggests support as a winning strategy , but those of us who have been down that road will tell you that while part of an overall open - source revenue story , it can't be the only chapter .
The reality is that there are some very compelling ways to make money in open source , including Red Hat's , IBM's , Zimbra's , etc .
But we 'll let the Harvard MBAs spend two years noodling on what many of us get to live .
With Deadlines Past and Looming , Intense , Often Acrimonious , Background Negotiations Underway Between All Involved Firms
While Both Clients and Employees Are Kept in the Dark ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/20/2008 , 5:49 pm PT
On Sunday , April 13th , following our Thursday April 10th exclusive investigative report revealing that the nation 's 4th largest voting machine vendor , Hart InterCivic , was on the verge of a successful hostile takeover of the nation 's 3rd largest voting machine company , Sequoia Voting Systems , in order to become the nation 's 2nd largest powerhouse in the " election industry , " Sequoia quietly issued a press release on their website , publicly confirming our report .
The release is not linked from their main page , but we were able to trip across it this morning nonetheless .
We post it in full at the end of this article since Sequoia 's website has been frequently hacked at times of late , and the company also has a history of revising , scrubbing and doctoring officially published material on their website without noting those changes .
While officials at both Hart and Sequoia have now confirmed our report , Sequoia has yet to fully inform its voting system clients around the country --- or even its own employees --- as to what 's actually going on , even while a " high - priority " company - wide email was distributed immediately after our report went public , attempting to instruct employees to field no " calls from the media " ...
Sequoia 's confirmation of the attempted takeover comes as officials inside of both companies were forced to do so in the wake of our detailed exclusive , as published here at The BRAD BLOG ( along with a greatly condensed version filed at ComputerWorld ) .
Yet , in the ten days since our report was filed , no other media outlets have covered the potential merger , despite the fact that jurisdictions across the country --- including New York state , which is in the middle of a $ 100 million deal with the company --- could be adversely affected by the takeover of the cash - poor Sequoia , whose equipment currently controls elections in some 20 % of the United States .
( Hart now controls some 8 % of that market . )
The clients with whom Sequoia has contracts , and pending contracts , were wholly unaware of the possible merger prior to our report .
As well , they had no idea that they might soon find themselves in business with Hart --- a company currently facing federal fraud litigation --- instead of their chosen vendor , Sequoia .
While Sequoia 's CEO and President Jack Blaine was forced to give an explanation to some of those clients who became quite curious after reading details of the attempted takeover here at The BRAD BLOG , Blaine failed to disclose to them the full depth of Sequoia 's woes , complete details of the possible merger , and that the fact that the company , in its current form , may not be long for this world .
Sequoia 's clients are not the only ones caught off - guard by the potential sea change coming in the election industry .
The majority of the company 's employees , whose jobs hang in the balance , had similarly been left in the dark , even about Sequoia 's planned move out of Oakland , which had been in the works for some time .
Our report came as news to most of their employees , who may find themselves soon out of work , whether or not the company is able to fend off the Hart takeover .
We had revealed , in that April 10 story , the company 's plan to shut down their Oakland , CA , headquarters in order to move their full base of operations to their Denver hub .
Facing a severe cash crunch , made even worse by the Hart takeover attempt , the move to Denver is currently underway as Sequoia 's lease on their Oakland office space is up at the end of May .
A smaller space will be sought in Oakland for a number of company engineers , but it 's currently unclear --- since Sequoia has failed to inform workers --- how many of the California employees will find themselves out of a job after the move .
As previously reported , last Tuesday , April 15th , was " Match Day " at Sequoia .
That was the deadline for the consortium of company executives --- incorporated as SVS Holdings , Inc. last year in order to claim " ownership " of Sequoia in the wake of a Federal investigation of their parent company Smartmatic , a foreign - based consortium with ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez --- to offer a " match " to the proposal Hart had given to Smartmatic .
The deal would give control of SVS Holdings ' $ 2 million note , currently being held by the off - shore firm , to Hart .
Our report caused a subsequent panic at Sequoia , leading company VP , part - owner , and press spokesperson Michelle Shafer to issue a company wide email , just minutes after the report was published here , instructing employees within the company not to respond to media inquiries on any aspect of the impending deal .

We had sent a number of queries to Shafer for comment , in regard to our report , prior to publication .
She failed to respond at all , unlike Hart 's spokesperson Peter Lichtenheld , who had the courtesy to reply , at least , with a " no comment . "
Shafer , who lists her address as being in Oakland , does n't actually have an office there , so she 'll not have to worry about moving anything when the Oakland site shuts down .
She works largely out of her Texas home , where she was based while working for her former employer ... Hart InterCivic .
The press release issued Sunday by Sequoia echoes both the sentiment from Shafer 's email and the generally secretive nature of the company which controls the votes of millions of Americans .
In the release , they promise , " We will have more information to share in the coming weeks .
However , until that time , we do not expect to have further comment on this matter . "
Despite the attempted media lock - out , over the past week The BRAD BLOG has been able to learn the companies , Hart , Smartmatic , and Sequoia / SVS , have been engaged in brutal , and often contentious , inside negotiations , as SVS tries desperately to stave off losing control of the company to Hart .
While no official actions have yet been taken , at least publicly , the next key date in the matter will likely be May 15th , the currently set " closing day " for the proposed deal , when either Hart or SVS will have to " pay Smartmatic $ 7 million on closing , as well as 40 % of the net income of [ the company ] for the next 5 years , with a promise to pay at least $ 9 million in those 5 years , " according to court documents obtained by The BRAD BLOG [ PDF ] during the reporting of our original story .
As we also reported at the time , the office of Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) has told us they are keeping a close eye on the possible deal , since the Congresswoman was instrumental in bringing the original concerns of Smartmatic 's ownership and control of Sequoia to the attention of federal investigators at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) .
That commission is responsible for overseeing foreign ownership of key domestic infrastructure , such as our election system , and their investigation of Smartmatic / Sequoia 's shadowy ties to Venezuela had prompted Smartmatic 's apparent divestiture of the company .
The proposed Hart deal , however , as the Delaware court papers describe the potential business arrangement , reveals that Smartmatic still retains direct control of both the Intellectual Property of the Sequoia firm , as well as rights to strike an agreement with Hart that they are " not to compete with Smartmatic ( who remain in the election business ) in Latin America , the Philippines , and Belgium . "
In light of the possible compact , questions may return for Maloney and federal investigators , as to whether or not Smartmatic truly divested from the company last year when they had claimed to , or whether it was a deal ' on paper only ' in order to bring an end to the CFIUS investigation which had been getting close to the root of Smartmatic 's true ownership .
The sale of Sequoia to SVS was successful in ending the CFIUS review at that time , prompting Sequoia / SVS to boast , in a November 2007 announcement of " New Corporate Ownership " for the firm , resulting in a " 100 % American - Owned and Independent Company . "
Though Smartmatic is carefully referred to as their " former parent company " in Sequoia 's press release last week , the foreign firm clearly retains --- and is in the process of exercising --- the ability to determine far - ranging aspects of both Sequoia 's future , and those of American elections in the bargain .
We will , of course , continue to follow developments in this story .
Sequoia 's quietly posted press release , issued just after , and confirming , our original report , follows in full below ...
SEQUOIA VOTING SYSTEMS RESPONDS TO QUESTIONS ON FUTURE OWNERSHIP DIRECTION DENVER - April 13 , 2008 - Hart InterCivic has made an offer to purchase the outstanding loan and earn - out provision agreement that Sequoia Voting Systems maintains with its former parent company .

We will have more information to share in the coming weeks .

Three weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks , former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld established an official military objective of not only removing the Saddam Hussein regime by force but overturning the regimes in Iran , Syria , and four other countries in the Middle East , according to a document quoted extensively in then Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith ’s recently published account of the Iraq war decisions .
Feith ’s account further indicates that this aggressive aim of remaking the map of the Middle East by military force and the threat of force was supported explicitly by the country ’s top military leaders .
Feith ’s book , War and Decision , released last month , provides excerpts of the paper Rumsfeld sent to President George W. Bush on Sept. 30 , 2001 , calling for the administration to focus not on taking down Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaeda network but on the aim of establishing " new regimes " in a series of states by " aiding local peoples to rid themselves of terrorists and to free themselves of regimes that support terrorism . "
In quoting from that document , Feith deletes the names of all of the states to be targeted except Afghanistan , inserting the phrase " some other states " in brackets .
In a facsimile of a page from a related Pentagon " campaign plan " document , the Taliban and Saddam Hussein regimes are listed as " state regimes " against which " plans and operations " might be mounted , but the names of four other states are blacked out " for security reasons . "
Gen . Wesley Clark , who commanded the NATO bombing campaign in the Kosovo War , recalls in his 2003 book Winning Modern Wars being told by a friend in the Pentagon in November 2001 that the list of states that Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz wanted to take down included Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , Sudan , and Somalia .
Clark writes that the list also included Lebanon .
Feith reveals that Rumsfeld ’s paper called for getting " Syria out of Lebanon " as a major goal of U.S. policy .
When this writer asked Feith after a recent public appearance which countries ’ names were deleted from the documents , he cited security reasons for the deletion .
But when he was asked which of the six regimes on the Clark list were included in the Rumsfeld paper , he replied , " All of them . "
Rumsfeld ’s paper was given to the White House only two weeks after Bush had approved a U.S. military operation in Afghanistan directed against bin Laden and the Taliban regime .
Despite that decision , Rumsfeld ’s proposal called explicitly for postponing indefinitely U.S. air strikes and the use of ground forces in support of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in order to try to catch bin Laden .
Instead the Rumsfeld paper argued that the U.S. should target states which had supported anti-Israel forces such as Hezbollah and Hamas .
It urged that the United States " [ c ] apitalize on our strong suit , which is not finding a few hundred terrorists in caves in Afghanistan , but in the vastness of our military and humanitarian resources , which can strengthen the opposition forces in terrorist - supporting states . "
Feith describes the policy outlined in the paper as consisting of " military action against some of the state sponsors and pressure  short of war  against others . "
The Rumsfeld plan represented a Pentagon consensus that included the uniformed military leadership , according to Feith ’s account .
He writes that the process of drafting the paper involved consultations with the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Henry Shelton and incoming chairman Gen. Richard Myers .
Myers helped revise the initial draft , Feith writes , and Gen. John P. Abizaid , who was then director of the Joint Staff , enthusiastically endorsed it in draft form .
" This is an exceptionally important memo , " wrote Abizaid , " which gives clear strategic vision . "
In a message quoted by Feith , Abizaid recommended to Myers that " you support this approach . "
After the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 , Abizaid was promoted to become chief of CENTCOM , with military responsibility for the entire Middle East .
Neither Myers nor Abizaid , both of whom are now retired from the military , responded to e-mails asking for their comments on Feith ’s account of their role in the process of producing the Rumsfeld strategy .
Rumsfeld ’s aides had also drafted a second version of the paper , as instructions to all military commanders in the development of " campaign plans against terrorism . "
That instructions document was a joint effort by Feith ’s office and by the Strategic Plans and Policy directorate of Abizaid ’s Joint Staff .
It followed the broad outlines of the paper for Bush , arguing that the enemy was a " network " that included states that support terrorism and that the Defense Department should seek to " convince or compel " those states to cut their ties to terrorism .
The Pentagon guidance document called for military commanders to assist other government agencies " as directed " to " encourage populations dominated by terrorist organizations or their supporters to overthrow that domination . "
That language was adopted because the campaign planning document was issued as " Strategic Guidance for the Defense Department " on Oct. 3 , 2001  just three days after the Rumsfeld strategy paper had gone to the president .
Bush had not approved the explicit aim of regime change in Iran , Syria , and four other countries proposed by Rumsfeld .
Thus Rumsfeld adopted the aggressive military plan targeting multiple regimes in the Middle East for regime change even though it was not White House policy .
The Defense Department guidance document made it clear that U.S. military aims in regard to those states would go well beyond any ties to terrorism .
The document said that the Defense Department would also seek to isolate and weaken those states and to " disrupt , damage , or destroy " their military capacities  not necessarily limited to WMDs .
The document included as a " strategic objective " a requirement to " prevent further attacks against the U.S. or U.S. interests . "
That language , which extended the principle of preemption far beyond the issue of WMDs , was so broad as to justify plans to use force against virtually any state that was not a client of the United States .
The military leadership ’s strong preference for focusing on states as enemies rather than on the threat from al - Qaeda after 9/11 continued a pattern of behavior going back to the Bill Clinton administration ( 1993-2001 ) .
After the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa by al - Qaeda operatives , State Department counter - terrorism official Michael Sheehan proposed supporting the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against bin Laden ’s sponsor , the Taliban regime .
However , senior U.S. military leaders " refused to consider it , " according to a 2004 account by Richard H. Shultz Jr. , a military specialist at Tufts University .
A senior officer on the Joint Staff told State Department counter - terrorism director Sheehan he had heard terrorist strikes characterized more than once by colleagues as a " small price to pay for being a superpower . "

The resignation of Marina Silva as the environment minister of Brazil is a blow to the very future of the planet .
Five years ago , she was appointed guardian of the Amazon but , in that time , she has fought an uphill battle against the loggers and ranchers of Brazilian agribusiness .
Indeed , she often seemed a lone voice in the Brazilian government -- outvoted on the introduction of genetically modified grains , on the construction of a new nuclear power plant and on massive infrastructure projects , including two big hydroelectric dams and a major new road in the rainforest .
She has finally quit , worn down by ill health and the appointment of a rival minister to speed the approval of energy projects .

It is easy for rich nations to condemn an emerging economy that succumbs to commercial pressures and abandons the environment .
But this is not one country 's problem .
Climate change is the greatest market failure the world has seen ; those who pollute are generally not the ones who pay .
The Amazon is a precious resource for the whole world , and one for which we must all take responsibility .
Tropical rainforests are the lungs of the planet .
They generate most of the world 's rainfall and form a precious cooling band around the equator , which acts as the Earth 's thermostat .
Photosynthesis makes them a massive absorber of carbon , regulating the global climate .
Cutting down these forests causes two problems .
It removes that carbon sink .
And , because trees are mostly cleared by burning , it sends vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere ...

In Iraq , in Afghanistan , and at home , the position of the globe 's " sole superpower " is visibly fraying .
The country that was once proclaimed an " empire lite " has proven increasingly light - headed .
The country once hailed as a power greater than that of imperial Rome or imperial Britain , a dominating force beyond anything ever seen on the planet , now can't seem to make a move in its own interest that is n't a disaster .
The Iraq government 's recent offensive in Basra is but the latest example with -- we can be sure -- more to come .
In the meantime , the fate of that empire , lite or otherwise , is the subject of Howard Zinn today at Tomdispatch , and of a new addition to his famed People 's History of the United States .
The new book represents a surprise breakthrough into cartoon format .
It 's a rollicking graphic history , illustrated by cartoonist Mike Konopacki , that takes us from the Indian Wars to the Iraqi " frontier " ( with some striking autobiographical asides from Zinn 's own life ) .
It 's called A People 's History of American Empire .
It 's a gem and it 's being published today .
In honor of publication day , Tomdispatch offers the equivalent of a little online extravaganza .
Below , you can read Zinn 's essay on how he first learned about the American Empire ; and you can also click here for two special treats .
You can view an animated video , using some of the book 's art , with voiceover by none other than Viggo Mortensen .
( Think of it as Lord of the Rings , Part IV : The American Mordor Chronicles . )
Finally , if you look below the video on that same page , you 'll see an autobiographical section of the new book , focusing on Zinn 's early years .

I was conscious , like everyone , of the British Empire and the other imperial powers of Europe , but the United States was not seen in the same way .
When , after the war , I went to college under the G.I. Bill of Rights and took courses in U.S. history , I usually found a chapter in the history texts called " The Age of Imperialism . "
It invariably referred to the Spanish - American War of 1898 and the conquest of the Philippines that followed .
It seemed that American imperialism lasted only a relatively few years .
There was no overarching view of U.S. expansion that might lead to the idea of a more far - ranging empire -- or period of " imperialism . "
However , the very idea that the United States was an empire did not occur to me until after I finished my work as a bombardier with the Eighth Air Force in the Second World War , and came home .
Even as I began to have second thoughts about the purity of the " Good War , " even after being horrified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki , even after rethinking my own bombing of towns in Europe , I still did not put all that together in the context of an American " Empire . "
With an occupying army waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan , with military bases and corporate bullying in every part of the world , there is hardly a question any more of the existence of an American Empire .
Indeed , the once fervent denials have turned into a boastful , unashamed embrace of the idea .
I recall the classroom map ( labeled " Western Expansion " ) which presented the march across the continent as a natural , almost biological phenomenon .
That huge acquisition of land called " The Louisiana Purchase " hinted at nothing but vacant land acquired .
There was no sense that this territory had been occupied by hundreds of Indian tribes which would have to be annihilated or forced from their homes -- what we now call " ethnic cleansing " -- so that whites could settle the land , and later railroads could crisscross it , presaging " civilization " and its brutal discontents .
Neither the discussions of " Jacksonian democracy " in history courses , nor the popular book by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , The Age of Jackson , told me about the " Trail of Tears , " the deadly forced march of " the five civilized tribes " westward from Georgia and Alabama across the Mississippi , leaving 4,000 dead in their wake .
No treatment of the Civil War mentioned the Sand Creek massacre of hundreds of Indian villagers in Colorado just as " emancipation " was proclaimed for black people by Lincoln 's administration .
That classroom map also had a section to the south and west labeled " Mexican Cession . "
This was a handy euphemism for the aggressive war against Mexico in 1846 in which the United States seized half of that country 's land , giving us California and the great Southwest .
The term " Manifest Destiny , " used at that time , soon of course became more universal .
On the eve of the Spanish - American War in 1898 , the Washington Post saw beyond Cuba : " We are face to face with a strange destiny .
The taste of Empire is in the mouth of the people even as the taste of blood in the jungle . "
The violent march across the continent , and even the invasion of Cuba , appeared to be within a natural sphere of U.S. interest .
After all , had n't the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 declared the Western Hemisphere to be under our protection ?
But with hardly a pause after Cuba came the invasion of the Philippines , halfway around the world .
The word " imperialism " now seemed a fitting one for U.S. actions .
Indeed , that long , cruel war -- treated quickly and superficially in the history books -- gave rise to an Anti-Imperialist League , in which William James and Mark Twain were leading figures .
But this was not something I learned in university either .
The " Sole Superpower " Comes into View
Reading outside the classroom , however , I began to fit the pieces of history into a larger mosaic .
What at first had seemed like a purely passive foreign policy in the decade leading up to the First World War now appeared as a succession of violent interventions : the seizure of the Panama Canal zone from Colombia , a naval bombardment of the Mexican coast , the dispatch of the Marines to almost every country in Central America , occupying armies sent to Haiti and the Dominican Republic .
As the much - decorated General Smedley Butler , who participated in many of those interventions , wrote later : " I was an errand boy for Wall Street . "
At the very time I was learning this history -- the years after World War II -- the United States was becoming not just another imperial power , but the world 's leading superpower .
Determined to maintain and expand its monopoly on nuclear weapons , it was taking over remote islands in the Pacific , forcing the inhabitants to leave , and turning the islands into deadly playgrounds for more atomic tests .
In his memoir , No Place to Hide , Dr. David Bradley , who monitored radiation in those tests , described what was left behind as the testing teams went home : " [ R ] adioactivity , contamination , the wrecked island of Bikini and its sad - eyed patient exiles . "
The tests in the Pacific were followed , over the years , by more tests in the deserts of Utah and Nevada , more than a thousand tests in all .
When the war in Korea began in 1950 , I was still studying history as a graduate student at Columbia University .
Nothing in my classes prepared me to understand American policy in Asia .
But I was reading I. F. Stone 's Weekly .
Stone was among the very few journalists who questioned the official justification for sending an army to Korea .
It seemed clear to me then that it was not the invasion of South Korea by the North that prompted U.S. intervention , but the desire of the United States to have a firm foothold on the continent of Asia , especially now that the Communists were in power in China .
Years later , as the covert intervention in Vietnam grew into a massive and brutal military operation , the imperial designs of the United States became yet clearer to me .
In 1967 , I wrote a little book called Vietnam : The Logic of Withdrawal .
By that time I was heavily involved in the movement against the war .
When I read the hundreds of pages of the Pentagon Papers entrusted to me by Daniel Ellsberg , what jumped out at me were the secret memos from the National Security Council .
Explaining the U.S. interest in Southeast Asia , they spoke bluntly of the country 's motives as a quest for " tin , rubber , oil . "
Neither the desertions of soldiers in the Mexican War , nor the draft riots of the Civil War , not the anti-imperialist groups at the turn of the century , nor the strong opposition to World War I -- indeed no antiwar movement in the history of the nation reached the scale of the opposition to the war in Vietnam .
At least part of that opposition rested on an understanding that more than Vietnam was at stake , that the brutal war in that tiny country was part of a grander imperial design .
Various interventions following the U.S. defeat in Vietnam seemed to reflect the desperate need of the still - reigning superpower -- even after the fall of its powerful rival , the Soviet Union -- to establish its dominance everywhere .
Hence the invasion of Grenada in 1982 , the bombing assault on Panama in 1989 , the first Gulf war of 1991 .
Was George Bush Sr. heartsick over Saddam Hussein 's seizure of Kuwait , or was he using that event as an opportunity to move U.S. power firmly into the coveted oil region of the Middle East ?
Given the history of the United States , given its obsession with Middle Eastern oil dating from Franklin Roosevelt 's 1945 deal with King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia , and the CIA 's overthrow of the democratic Mossadeq government in Iran in 1953 , it is not hard to decide that question .
Justifying Empire
The ruthless attacks of September 11th ( as the official 9/11 Commission acknowledged ) derived from fierce hatred of U.S. expansion in the Middle East and elsewhere .
Even before that event , the Defense Department acknowledged , according to Chalmers Johnson 's book The Sorrows of Empire , the existence of more than 700 American military bases outside of the United States .
Since that date , with the initiation of a " war on terrorism , " many more bases have been established or expanded : in Kyrgyzstan , Afghanistan , the desert of Qatar , the Gulf of Oman , the Horn of Africa , and wherever else a compliant nation could be bribed or coerced .
When I was bombing cities in Germany , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , and France in the Second World War , the moral justification was so simple and clear as to be beyond discussion :
We were saving the world from the evil of fascism .
I was therefore startled to hear from a gunner on another crew -- what we had in common was that we both read books -- that he considered this " an imperialist war . "
Both sides , he said , were motivated by ambitions of control and conquest .
We argued without resolving the issue .
Ironically , tragically , not long after our discussion , this fellow was shot down and killed on a mission .
In wars , there is always a difference between the motives of the soldiers and the motives of the political leaders who send them into battle .
My motive , like that of so many , was innocent of imperial ambition .
It was to help defeat fascism and create a more decent world , free of aggression , militarism , and racism .
The motive of the U.S. establishment , understood by the aerial gunner I knew , was of a different nature .
It was described early in 1941 by Henry Luce , multi-millionaire owner of Time , Life , and Fortune magazines , as the coming of " The American Century . "
The time had arrived , he said , for the United States " to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence , for such purposes as we see fit , and by such means as we see fit . "
We can hardly ask for a more candid , blunter declaration of imperial design .
It has been echoed in recent years by the intellectual handmaidens of the Bush administration , but with assurances that the motive of this " influence " is benign , that the " purposes " -- whether in Luce 's formulation or more recent ones -- are noble , that this is an " imperialism lite . "
As George Bush said in his second inaugural address : " Spreading liberty around the world is the calling of our time . "
The New York Times called that speech " striking for its idealism . "
The American Empire has always been a bipartisan project -- Democrats and Republicans have taken turns extending it , extolling it , justifying it .
President Woodrow Wilson told graduates of the Naval Academy in 1914 ( the year he bombarded Mexico ) that the U.S. used " her navy and her army ... as the instruments of civilization , not as the instruments of aggression . "
And Bill Clinton , in 1992 , told West Point graduates : " The values you learned here will be able to spread throughout the country and throughout the world . "
For the people of the United States , and indeed for people all over the world , those claims sooner or later are revealed to be false .
The rhetoric , often persuasive on first hearing , soon becomes overwhelmed by horrors that can no longer be concealed : the bloody corpses of Iraq , the torn limbs of American GIs , the millions of families driven from their homes -- in the Middle East and in the Mississippi Delta .
Have not the justifications for empire , embedded in our culture , assaulting our good sense -- that war is necessary for security , that expansion is fundamental to civilization -- begun to lose their hold on our minds ?
Have we reached a point in history where we are ready to embrace a new way of living in the world , expanding not our military power , but our humanity ?

Substituting chicken , fish or vegetables for red meat can help combat climate change , a new study suggests .
In fact , putting these foods on the dinner table does more to reduce carbon emissions than eating locally grown food , researchers report in the May 15 issue of the journal Environmental Science & Technology .
Environmental advocates and retailers urge customers to purchase goods from local sources to minimize environmental impacts .
The idea is that food grown locally requires less fuel for shipping to the store .
The new study does not argue that point .
Yet few studies have compared greenhouse gas emissions from food production to those of transportation .
The production phase is responsible for 83 percent of the average U.S. household 's greenhouse - gas burden with regard to food , while transportation accounts for only 11 percent , the new study found .
The production of red meat , the researchers conclude , is almost 150 percent more greenhouse - gas - intensive than chicken or fish .
The study , by Christopher L. Weber and H. Scott Matthews of at Carnegie Mellon University , was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Science Foundation .
" We suggest that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household 's food - related climate footprint than ' buying local , ' " the researchers write .
“ Shifting less than one day per week 's worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken , fish , eggs , or a vegetable - based diet achieves more greenhouse - gas reduction than buying all locally sourced food . "
Weber and Matthews acknowledge that consumers choose food based on many other criteria , including taste , freshness and a desire to support local farming .
Over the next two weeks , a first group of 16 countries – starting with Bahrain and Ecuador – will have their records scrutinized , as part of the Review , one of the reforms which differentiate the Council from the Commission on Human Rights , which it succeeded in 2006 .
The Review meetings will feature interactive discussions between the States in question and a working group comprises all of the Council ’s 47 members , according to a UN spokesperson .
The discussions will be based on national reports and information from a variety of sources , including treaty bodies , Special Rapporteurs – independent experts on specific topics that report to the Council – non-governmental organizations , national human rights institutions and academics .
Algeria , Argentina , Brazil , Czech Republic , Finland , India , Indonesia , Morocco , the Netherlands , the Philippines , Poland , South Africa , Tunisia and the United Kingdom are the other countries being reviewed over the next two weeks .
Under the Review ’s work plans , 48 countries are scheduled to be reviewed each year , so that the UN ’s complete membership of 192 countries will be reviewed once every four years .
Last month , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon urged the Council to assure that all countries were scrutinized equally .
“ The Review must reaffirm that just as human rights are universal , so is our collective respect for them and our commitment to them , ” he said .
S.F. on verge of $ 4 - per- gallon gas SIGN OF THE TIMES : San Francisco on verge of becoming first big city to hit that average

The age of $ 4 gasoline has arrived .
And it 's forcing Bay Area residents to change the way they live .
Sometime in the coming week , San Francisco is expected to become America 's first major city to pay an average of $ 4 for a gallon of regular gas .
The citywide average , tracked by the AAA auto club , stood at $ 3.96 on Thursday .
It 's the latest milestone in a four - year run-up at the pump , fueled by crude oil prices that have climbed to their highest levels ever .
When gas prices began their current climb in early 2004 , the run-up looked more like a nuisance than anything else , costing commuters an extra $ 5 to $ 10 per week .
Now , the amount drivers pay to fill up has doubled , and it 's enough to hurt .
In response , drivers in the Bay Area and elsewhere are re-examining the ways they live , work and shop .
Some longtime car commuters have switched to BART , Caltrain or Muni .
Others have ditched one of their family cars , traded in their gas - hog for a compact or - in the case of a determined few - said goodbye to the automobile altogether .
They have turned to telecommuting and combining all their weekly errands into a single outing .
And the results are measurable .
Gasoline sales in California have fallen for two years in a row , according to state data .
Mass transit ridership is rising in the Bay Area , while traffic on the region 's toll bridges has shrunk .
" I think the temporary response to the price shock is past , " said Rod Diridon , head of the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University .
" People are beginning to move to different habits now .
There are a lot of people looking for a permanent way to cut back on gas . "
Cutting back on luxuries
Not everyone can .
For those people , escalating prices have forced a different kind of change .
They 're finding ways to spend less on other parts of the monthly budget .
" It 's the luxuries we all have - it 's movies , dinners , stuff like that , " said Michael Feeley , a landscaper who lives with his wife in Berkeley .
" We do n't actually sit down and say we 've got to cut something out , but we 're definitely more frugal . "
Feeley used to spend less than $ 200 per month on gas for his Toyota Tacoma truck , which he uses to haul employees , equipment and supplies to job sites .
Now he pays $ 500 .
" When people say everyone 's driving a gas - guzzler , well , some of us do n't have a choice , " Feeley said .
" I can't run this business driving a Prius . "
Many people , however , do have a choice .
The Bay Area , unlike much of the country , has a well - developed web of mass transit lines , linking cities via bus , ferry , subway and train .
Their ridership is booming - particularly on regional systems such as BART and Caltrain that are heavily patronized by commuters .
BART has seen a 6.7 percent increase in the number of passengers through this week compared with the same period a year earlier , said BART spokesman Linton Johnson .
Average weekday ridership is at 365,463 , with riders taking almost 23,000 more trips on BART each weekday than they did a year earlier .
Bill Buehlman , who lives in San Francisco and works for the city 's Homeless Outreach Team , has started relying on BART and Muni to commute and get around town .
He estimates he 's cut his driving from about 1,000 miles per month to 500 miles .
While Buehlman said he despises the oil companies , he 's grateful that soaring gas prices are prompting him and others to reduce the amount they drive .
" I look at it as a gift , a blessing , " he said .
" The profiteers are giving us the opportunity to make a decision to do something better for our planet , for our community . "
Mary Ann Buggs , who lives in Berkeley and works near San Francisco 's AT&T Park , switched to BART and Muni after years of driving across the Bay Bridge .
So did her husband .
But she 's a reluctant convert to transit .
" I 'm not particularly enjoying it , " she said , " because Berkeley to SoMa by the ballpark is expensive ( in transit fares ) and nowhere near as comfortable as a car ride .
But it is cheaper than spending $ 60 twice a week in gas station excursions . "
Buggs and her husband are among a growing number of people avoiding the bridge .
According to the Bay Area Toll Authority , the number of drivers crossing the region 's seven state - owned toll bridges this fiscal year has dropped 2 percent compared with the previous year .
Six of the bridges have seen falling traffic counts - from a 1 percent decline at the Bay and Dumbarton bridges to 4 percent at the Antioch and Carquinez bridges .
Only the Benicia - Martinez Bridge , which received a new three - lane span last fall , has seen an increase in traffic .
While some people rely more on mass transit to avoid high gas prices , others have gotten rid of their least - efficient cars .
For Kim Howard and her husband , Edison Peinado , that meant selling their Jeep Cherokee .
The sport utility vehicle got 11 miles per gallon in city driving - not good considering the couple lives north of the Golden Gate Park Panhandle in the middle of San Francisco .
Now Peinado , a pilot with SkyWest Airlines , takes BART to and from the airport when he can .
Otherwise , he and Howard must split the use of their one remaining car , a 12 - year - old Audi .
It 's a juggling act .
Howard drives to Campbell for her job as marketing director for the Infonetics tech - industry research firm , but she 's able to telecommute much of the time .
Peinado gets the car when his return flight to San Francisco arrives too late at night for BART .
" It was more painful in the beginning , but we 're getting used to it , " Howard said .
" It 's like most things - you adapt . "
She says the change is worth it , both to save money and help the environment .
But it 's a trade - off , with the couple sacrificing convenience to make it work .
Trying telecommuting
Like Howard , many Bay Area residents have tried telecommuting as gas prices rise .
Barbara Heninger manages a team of technical writers at the Synopsys software firm , with five writers in Sunnyvale and three in India .
One of her local employees lives in Santa Cruz and comes to the office once a week .
Another , who lives in San Jose , averages three days in the office each week .
They work from home the rest of the time .
" This last year or two has been the first when employees cited concerns about the environment and commute costs as some of the reasons for working at home , " Heninger said .
The arrangement works , she says , as long as telecommuters make a point of communicating regularly with their co-workers .
If gas prices keep rising , she said , she expects more people to try telecommuting .
" It will either be that , or people will really start considering how far away they want to live from where they work , " said Heninger , who lives in Los Altos .
" When I started in the tech industry , it was n't that unusual to have people commuting here from Danville , because they wanted the big house on the hill . "
Still , there remain people who have to drive for work .
In some cases , they must drive a lot .
San Francisco cab driver Jorge Perez now spends about $ 50 per day on gasoline .
In addition , he has to pay $ 100 per day to lease his cab , he said .
" What happens on top of that is what I make for the day , " he said .
" Sometimes it 's difficult to make that much . "
It does n't help that Perez drives a Ford Crown Victoria , which gets about 15 miles per gallon .
" They 're good cars for the hills of San Francisco , " he said , " but they are n't known for their fuel efficiency . "

John McCain has dropped the ' R ' bomb .
At an Associated Press forum in Washington , D.C. Monday , the Arizona Republican senator said that he believes the country is in a recession .
 Americans are hurting today ,  McCain said at an Associated Press forum , according to a transcript of his remarks in The Hill .
 These are very , very tough times in America . 
" While McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , said he thinks the country is in a recession , " the paper adds , " he noted that he is more worried about helping people who are facing ' enormous challenges , ' rather than figuring out what the technical definition of a recession is .
McCain recently made news when he said he did n't think troubled homeowners should be bailed out , but later reversed his position amid criticism .
More of McCain 's comments during the forum appear on video below -- including his responses to questions on a journalist shield law , and on his age , during which he pretends to fall asleep .
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast Apr. 14 , 2008 .
Improv Everywhere is the cosmic balance to Gawker : a group of real - world performance artists who generally make people feel like the world is a magical place .
And in this clip that 's been making the rounds , they turn a little league baseball game into a major league match , with an NBC sportscaster , a Jumbotron , and I wo n't ruin the rest .
See below .
Man , it 's like those scenes at the ends of family movies I 'd see as a kid where everything works out really well and I would get so thrilled that I 'd be embarrassed for having such a pure uncynical emotion .
God , I just realized where my lifelong unhappiness started .
Anyway read the mission recap , which explains how the improv group got NBC to help out .
‘ The imf is back , ” declared the International Monetary Fund ’s managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , at its annual spring meeting earlier this month in Washington .
And not a moment too soon either .
To hear the organization ’s economists tell it ( as they mingled in five - star hotels , long black limos and posh restaurants with bankers , businessmen and finance ministers from around the globe ) , they ’ve arrived on the scene just in time to help solve the world ’s financial crisis .
But despite the bravado , the reality is that today ’s IMF is not what it once was .
These days , the world ’s most famous deficit police force is running a whopping small - country - size $ 400 - million annual deficit of its own and is being forced into some of the same kinds of “ structural adjustments ” it used to impose on indebted Third World nations .
In just the last four years , the IMF ’s total loan portfolio has shrunk from $ 105 billion to less than $ 10 billion ; over half of the current portfolio consists of loans to Turkey and Pakistan .
To cut costs , the agency is reducing staff and closing offices .
The IMF ’s loss of influence is probably the most important change in the international financial system in more than half a century .
Until just a few years ago , the IMF -- originally created at the Bretton Woods conference on international economic cooperation in 1944 -- was one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world and the major avenue of influence for the United States in developing countries .
This was n’t so much a result of the money that it lent -- the World Bank loans much more -- but because of its position at the top of a hierarchy of official creditors .
Until a few years ago , a developing - country government that did not meet IMF conditions risked being economically strangled .
The World Bank , regional banks such as the Inter - American Development Bank , rich lender governments and sometimes even the private sector would withhold lending until the government reached agreement with the IMF .

At the top of this powerful creditors cartel sat the U.S. Treasury Department , which holds a formal veto over many of the IMF ’s decisions and is an informal power within the organization that marginalizes even the other rich countries .
Developing countries -- the ones that have historically borne the brunt of IMF decisions -- have little or no effective voice in the decision - making of the organization , where the majority of votes of the 185 member nations are assigned to the rich members .
But the IMF lost credibility after presiding over a series of economic disasters .
Latin America , for example , suffered its worst long - term growth failure in modern history under the IMF ’s tutelage since 1980 .
The IMF ’s “ shock therapy ” program in Russia vastly underestimated the time it would take to transition from a planned to a capitalist economy in the early ‘ 90s .
The result was a lot of shock and no therapy , and tens of millions were pushed into poverty as the economy collapsed .
The Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s was a tipping point .
The IMF and the U.S. Treasury helped cause the crisis by pushing for the removal of important regulations on foreign capital flows .
Then they made it worse with their policy recommendations , prompting economist Jeffrey Sachs -- now head of Columbia University ’s Earth Institute -- to say that “ the IMF has become the Typhoid Mary of emerging markets , spreading recessions in country after country . ”
Some of these mistakes were because of incompetence ; others were driven by ideological or special interests .
But the result was that developing countries began voting with their feet , piling up international reserves so that they would never have to borrow again from the IMF cartel .

The IMF - supervised Argentine disaster from 1998 to 2002 , which pushed the majority of Argentines below the official poverty line in a country that was previously one of the richest in the region , further sullied the fund ’s reputation .
Argentina then defied the IMF , refused its conditions , got no international help and rapidly transformed itself into the fastest - growing economy in the hemisphere .
This too was noticed .
The collapse of the IMF creditors cartel has been a huge blow to U.S. influence .
It was most pronounced in Latin America , where most of a region that used to be referred to as the United States ’ “ backyard ” is now governed by states that are more independent of Washington than Europe is .
The problem is that poorer developing countries , especially in Africa , remain dependent on foreign aid from the IMF ( and the World Bank and other sources ) to fund their basic budget and import needs .
This can be harmful to their development and their people .
In recent years , the IMF -- insisting that such measures are necessary to hold down inflation -- has imposed conditions that limit their public spending and , according to the fund ’s own internal evaluation , have prevented these countries from spending aid money on urgent needs , such as healthcare and education .
These countries need to join the rest of the developing world in breaking free of the IMF ’s policy conditions .
The U.S. Congress may consider legislation that would pressure the IMF to use some of its huge gold reserves for debt cancellation and to limit the IMF ’s control over policy in poor countries .
These would be important steps forward for the world ’s poor .
Rep. Vern Ehlers Steps Briefly Off the Reservation at Recent Congressional Hearing , as Election Integrity Advocates Condemn the Privatization and Outsourcing of America 's Electoral System
VoterAction 's John Bonifaz Testifies : ' Growing Influence by Private Companies in How We Conduct Elections Puts Democracy at Serious Risk '...
Brad Friedman Byon
4/15/2008 , 8:05 pm PT
Last week our friends , voting rights attorney John Bonifaz of VoterAction.org and Greg Moore of the NAACP National Voter Fund , testified at a U.S. House Administrative Committee hearing on the 2008 Presidential Primaries and Caucuses and " What we 've learned so far . "
What we 've learned , as Bonifaz explained in his opening statement ( written version here [ PDF ] , full video at the end of this article ) is that " jurisdictions across the country are increasingly outsourcing , to private vendors , key election functions , and in the process , compromising the transparency and public control of our elections . "
While all of that is likely old hat , by now , to readers of The BRAD BLOG , where our hair has been on fire about same for many years now , there was an interesting moment during the Q&A with a Republican congressman and panelists Moore and Bonifaz , as seen in the very short exchange ( just under two minutes ) in the video clip posted above left .
The Congressman --- at least momentarily --- stepped off the GOP reservation , to admit that the private corporations that fail in their outsourced election duties " should be fired " ...
Leading up to that admission , ranking member Vern Ehlers ( R - MI ) had hauled out the tired old Republican talking point that voter registration organizations have become a problem in the election process .
While they may , in fact , have become a problem for Republicans , who would prefer most folks do n't vote --- and thus , they 've have been on a years - long , well - funded , highly - organized , and even DoJ- politicized , attack against voter registration groups such as ACORN , in a never - ceasing attempt to discredit , outlaw , and / or put them out of " business " however they can --- such non-profit organizations are hardly the problem our electoral system currently faces .
As Bonifaz pointed out , in response to Ehlers , the problem with our registration system , as one primary and caucus after another so far in '08 has demonstrated , is the ever - increasing rate of privatization and outsourcing of voter registration rolls to corporations that face little or no actual oversight .
In a surprising follow - up comment , in reply to both Moore and Bonifaz , the Republican Congressman admits that voting machine / registration companies ( presumably those such as ES&S , who failed so miserably to manage the voting rolls in the recent New Mexico Democratic primary , and Diebold , whose untested , uncertified e-pollbook machines failed so spectacularly in Georgia 's primary this year ) " frankly , they should be fired . "
Though following that refreshingly uncharacteristic point of candor , Ehlers quickly returned to the GOP reservation by adding ( faithfully ) , that " Outsourcing is not necessarily the problem .
Outsourcing to good companies is the answer . "
He failed to speak to how such " good companies " might be found , or how it is that oversight can be brought to them by citizens and / or public officials .
Bonifaz , in his opening statement [ PDF ] , however , minced no words in regard to the problem .
In the statement , VoterAction 's Bonifaz warned that due to " growing influence and control by private companies in how we conduct our elections in this country , our democracy remains at serious risk . "
He also noted ( as we have ourselves many times ) the importance of " citizen - led monitoring of our elections , " before going on to condemn the U.S. EAC ( as we have ourselves many many times ) for utterly failing in their " statutory duties as set forth by Section 202 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 " to act as " a national clearinghouse and resource " for voting system problems .
Bonifaz then summarized as follows in his powerful conclusion ...
When private companies deny independent investigation and review of their voting systems --- as they 've recently done in New Jersey and in Florida --- the integrity of the election process is undermined .
When voting systems , including privatized voter registration databases and electronic poll books , are found to be unreliable , election officials ought to discontinue their use and employ safer and more accurate systems .
When questions repeatedly emerge every election as to whether votes are being properly counted – as they have in the past several election cycles , rigorous and mandatory audits ought to be required with voter - marked paper ballot systems that are , in fact , auditable .
More than a century ago , the United States Supreme Court stated in the case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins , that the right to vote is " a fundamental political right " which is " preservative of all rights . "
In 2008 , we must remain ever - vigilant in protecting this most basic right .
Democracy demands no less .

If you think gas is expensive , be thankful you ’re not a trucker .
Filling up their 18 - wheel , 80,000 - pound leviathans can cost more than $ 1,300 these days .
Because of short supply , the price of diesel has gone up more than twice as much as gasoline in the last year , reaching a U.S. all - time high this week of an average of $ 4.33 a gallon .
With little hope of a near - term decline -- oil futures rose $ 2.17 to settle at a record $ 126.29 a barrel Friday -- the run-up is causing panic and prompting radical cultural and technological shifts in the struggling trucking industry .
Instead of obsessing over chrome trim or the latest cab amenities to ease life on the road , truck owners and operators who are fed up with getting 5 miles per gallon are delving into long - ignored subjects such as aerodynamics , cruising speeds and tire efficiency .
Engineers and manufacturers are furiously developing fuel - friendly technology .
And commercial fleets are using high - tech software to calculate every aspect of their drivers ’ routes , down to where they should fill up and where they should stop for the night .

Bill Rethwisch , an independent long - haul trucker , recently traded in his Peterbilt 379 for a new Kenworth T660 rig .
Although he prefers the traditional looks of the Peterbilt , with its boxy hood , flat , chromed grille and towering exhaust pipes , he knows it was aerodynamically flawed .
The $ 119,000 Kenworth , marketed as the company ’s most aerodynamic truck ever , has a streamlined wedge shape and eliminates projections such as the smokestacks .
The result , Rethwisch said , is an increase from 4.5 mpg in the Peterbilt to the Kenworth ’s 6.5 mpg , which saves him upward of $ 2,000 a month at the pump .
“ The Peterbilt is the classiest and coolest - looking truck around , ” said Rethwisch , who hauls dairy products from Wisconsin to California and goes home loaded with produce .
“ But cool only goes so far when fuel prices are so high . ”
The shift is not unlike what ’s happening with passenger cars -- drivers are abandoning gas - thirsty SUVs and pickups in favor of zippy subcompacts .
But with U.S. trucks burning upward of 20 billion gallons of diesel a year and trucking industry bankruptcies soaring , shifting to more efficient vehicles can be a matter of business survival .

“ There has long been an aversion to new technology and new approaches in heavy trucking , ” said Peter Nesvold , a transportation analyst at Bear Stearns .
“ But as costs of fuel rise higher , that ’s changing . ”
This fall , in an attempt to appease the conflicting desires of truckers for classic - looking vehicles and improved fuel economy , Navistar ’s International brand will start selling the LoneStar , an aerodynamic truck that slathers chrome over bumpers and grille while getting 5 % to 15 % better mileage than square - nosed trucks .
But Bob Weber , chief engineer for International , expects the company ’s new ProStar to be its bestseller .
It lacks bling but offers the best mileage in the business .
Weber says the truck gets as many as 7.5 miles per gallon -- practically Prius - like in the trucking world .
“ Aerodynamics is huge , ” said Weber , who explained that wind resistance can account for more than half of a truck ’s fuel consumption at highway speeds .

Another factor is velocity .
In general , the faster a truck goes , the more fuel it uses per mile .
Although many drivers are resistant , some fleets have begun using electronic regulators that cap speed , often well below legal limits .
Last week , the American Trucking Assn. proposed setting a nationwide top speed for trucks at 65 mph .
Two major trucking companies , Con-Way Inc. and Schneider National Inc. , said this month they would dial back their speedometers , Con-Way to 65 mph from 70 and Schneider to 60 mph from 63 .
Dennis Damman , director of engineering for Schneider , the nation ’s largest privately held trucking company , said that for each mile of speed reduced below 65 mph , a truck saves 1.5 % in fuel consumption .
“ The days of 75 miles per hour on the road are gone , ” he said .
Advertisement
Fleets , meanwhile , are also using increasingly complex computer programs that calculate the most efficient route possible and minimize the time without revenue - producing loads , said Clayton Boyce , an American Trucking Assn. spokesman .
Those programs , he said , can even tell drivers where they should stop for fuel and when to rest .
Rest stops are themselves a fuel issue .
Today ’s trucks have air conditioning , entertainment systems and even video games , all of which require electricity -- and most truckers get it by idling their hulking , 600 - horsepower diesel engines .
That can churn through several gallons of fuel in an hour .
Now more truckers are installing a small onboard diesel generator , called an alternate power unit , that runs in the engine ’s place .
Truckers used to eschew APUs because they can cost as much as $ 10,000 , but with high diesel prices , the devices can pay for themselves in little more than a year .
“ An APU allows them to turn that big engine off , ” said Jon Eide , senior vice president of Wells Fargo & Co. 's commercial vehicle lending division , which has $ 1.8 billion in heavy - duty truck and trailer loans outstanding .
“ That ’s a very efficient source of fuel savings . ”

Tires , too , are getting a once - over .
For decades , the top priorities in truck tires were durability and cost .
Now , fuel efficiency has moved to the head of the list .
Although new compounds and tread patterns help , another promising technology is “ super singles , ” which replace side - by - side tire setups with a single , wider tire .
That cuts weight by as much as 1,000 pounds and reduces energy loss from tire compression -- which , after aerodynamics , is the largest contributor to fuel consumption at highway speeds .
Experts say super singles can cut fuel use by 3 % .
Several manufacturers are making hybrid trucks , which capture braking energy to boost mileage , making them perfect for vehicles that make frequent stops , like garbage trucks .
On Friday , the Port of Los Angeles unveiled a fully electric truck it helped develop that ’s capable of towing shipping containers as far as 30 miles on a single charge .

Kambiz Salari , a fluid dynamics engineer at California ’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , has spent the last decade developing inventions that increase fuel economy , including a giant fan situated behind a truck ’s cab that reduces drag - creating turbulence .
None has been adopted commercially , but this year the Energy Department is offering grants to trucking companies that will test those devices on their fleets .
“ Fuel costs are bringing attention to our research , ” Salari said .
“ This industry is changing , ” said Weber , the Navistar engineer .
“ Ten mpg is now feasible . ”

1971 : Swiss women get the vote
Swiss women can now vote in federal elections and stand for parliament after a national referendum .
The official result shows 621,403 of the all - male electorate supported the vote for women and 323,596 were against .
All of the Swiss political parties , both houses of parliament , and many church and business leaders supported the vote for women .
The Swiss media has also welcomed the result .
Tribune de Geneve said the referendum ended a status quo that had become " unjust , untenable and abused " .
The poll was almost a complete reversal of a 1959 referendum , when women were refused the federal vote by a 2 - 1 majority .
' Children , Church and Kitchen '
This time round , political pundits were expecting a repeat performance with the rural and traditionally more conservative German - speaking cantons resisting the proposal .
The cultural perception of women 's role in society being bound to ' kinder , kirche und kuche ' ( children , church and kitchen ) remains popular in the German - speaking regions .
Even one women 's group had argued against change .
The Swiss Women Against Voting Rights Association campaigned on the grounds that women 's responsibilities lie in the household .
But out of 25 of the country 's administrative regions , only five cantons and three half - cantons voted against universal female suffrage .
Although Swiss women can now vote in most regional and national elections , they continue to face discrimination under Swiss law .
At home , men retain control of their wives ' property and capital , and the husband has the right to decide where he and his wife will reside .
All political parties have now pledged to offer women candidates in the election of the 200 member National Council ( lower house of parliament ) in October .
DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) --
Unless more is done to tackle growing extremism in countries including Pakistan , Afghanistan could once again fall into terrorist hands with dire consequence for the region and the world , the country 's president warned Friday .
Hamid Karzai addresses the opening session of the World Economic Forum on Wednesday .
Hamid Karzai said " misguided policy objectives " of unnamed countries or organizations were continuing to fuel violence in Afghanistan , although he was confident al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was no longer within its borders .
Speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Karzai also reluctantly accepted his image as " a puppet of America " but he shied away from accepting reported U.S. doubts that NATO troops lacked the training to combat the Taliban .
Asked if he agreed with a recent assessment by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reported in the L.A .
Times that NATO forces lacked the necessary skills , Karzai said he was not able to comment , but the fight needed to be more focused in Afghanistan and beyond .
" I believe there has to be a bigger effort , a more robust effort concentrated on the right objective , " he said .
I - Report Share your thoughts on Davos 2008
" The fight against terrorism is not in Afghanistan , a very small part of it may be in Afghanistan , the bigger part is in the sanctuaries where they get trained where they get motivated that is where we should go and unless we do that this vicious circle will keep going . "
Watch Karzai address the issue of bin Laden »
He said the Taliban were being funded partly by opium poppy crops , thriving due to the failure of efforts to eradicate them , from religious extremists and a " combination of criminals , misguided policy objectives and folly " .
However he rejected claims al Qaeda or the Taliban , which ruled Afghanistan until it was ousted by the U.S. - led invasion of 2001 , received funds from Saudi Arabia .
Karzai expressed concerns over growing terrorism in neighboring Pakistan , where President Pervez Musharraf faces mounting opposition to quit amid spreading militant violence .
" The problem is growing , the problem has grown , unfortunately , of terrorism in Pakistan , " he said .
" I was concerned , I remain concerned but I had a very fruitful talk with president Musharraf last time .
From that respect I hope there is more recognition of dangers there and of the dangers of the future of both countries and the region .
" Based on that I hope there will be a stronger effort in Pakistan and the region , and help from the rest of the world . "
He added : " It is one thing to recognize facts , it but it is another thing to work at it , to get at and remove it and defeat it and destroy it . "
Assessing progress in his own country , Karzai said things were improving despite ongoing violence .
" It is better than last year , some parts of the country are much better than last year .
Some parts of the country are not better than last year .
" And actually , the parts of the country that are not good are shrinking in size , and the parts that are getting better and better are expanding in size , so the overall situation in the country is a most definite improvement . "
On Osama bin Laden , Karzai insisted the fugitive terrorist mastermind would eventually be caught , even though he continued to elude coalition forces .
" I wish I knew where he was so we could go after him .
No absconder , no man running away from the law will be able to hide forever , some day we 'll catch him .
( He is ) not in Afghanistan .
He has no place to hide in Afghanistan . "
On his perceived image as an impotent leader in thrall to the U.S. administration , Karzai , said he was willing to shoulder insults in return for U.S. assistance .
" Me a puppet ?
My God .
" Anyway , Americans have helped Afghanistan tremendously .
The American people have a feeling for Afghanistan a very , very great feeling .
" The U.S administration has helped Afghanistan and if we are called puppets , or if I am called a puppet because we are grateful to America , then let that be my nickname .
" The truth is that without the United States in Afghanistan , Afghanistan would be a very poor , miserable country , occupied by neighbors and al Qaeda and terrorists . "

When a male mouse is about to have sex with a female , he lets out ultrasonic squeals of delight .
The vocalisations are controlled by a gene that is also involved in the production of the brain chemicals that mediate emotions , in mice as well as men .
This leads psychologists to conclude that mice squeak when they ’re in good mood .
It ’s been known for almost half a century that adult mice emit ultrasonic vocalisations in the 25 to 120 kHz range when they encounter females or their pheromones .
But no one knew what genes controlled the vocalisations .
So Haoran Wang at the University of Toronto , Canada , and his colleagues performed five separate experiments designed to elicit the calls in both wild type and knockout mice .

Squeaky clean fun
The researchers used stimuli such as urine , female odour , contact with female mice and amphetamines to make the males call out .
They recorded the vocalisations , which cannot be heard by humans , then processed them to make them audible to human ears .
The sounds are structured like birdsong , say the researchers .
The quantity and intensity of the sounds correspond to emotional states , they say .
During courtship , for instance , the males made simple whistles and calls .
After mounting the females , when things got more intense , the vocalisations became more chirp - like .
Listen to a recording of the male mice squeaking
When Wang ’s team looked at mice lacking various receptors , such as the M2 and M5 muscarinic receptors , which are involved in emotional expression , the males no longer produced the vocalisations .
Bonus odour
Female mice did n’t make the same positive squeaks during sex .
But when a female was reunited with a female chum after several hours of separation she did make positive chirps that were “ very similar ” to those made by bonking males .
“ Males and females are emotionally different , ” says Wang , in an understatement that speaks volumes .
“ This is the most detailed look at the quality of these vocalisations during mating behaviour in the literature , ” says Tim Holy at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis .
“ There ’s been a general question for some period of time about whether these sexual odours are intrinsically rewarding .
Their data argue that it ’s not an irrelevant question . ”

When the Oscars roll round every year , the movie industry goes to great lengths to stop nominated movies leaking to the Internet .
Every year they fail , miserably .
Here is a comprehensive list of piracy stats for all Oscars movies since 2003 , from camcorder copies right up to DVD Screeners .
When it ’s coming up to Oscars time , the movie industry tries everything in its power to stop nominated movies leaking to the Internet .
They go to extraordinary lengths to stop every piracy format – cam , telesync , telecine , region 5 and DVD Screener – from hitting the net .
But , their efforts almost universally fail , with most movies leaking in the end .
Some great statistics have now been collected by Waxy , which provides detailed piracy ( leaking ) data for all of the 185 Oscars nominated movies since 2003 , right through to 2008 ’s batch .
The amount of data provided is very impressive , even providing dates when a movie was leaked in cam , telesync , Region5 / Telecine , DVD Screener formats .
The stats show that the average length of time before a movie leaked to the Internet ( in any format , including ‘ cam ’ ) was just a single day in 2003 , extending to a peak of 7 days in 2006 .
By 2008 the term was back to 4 days and over the 2003 -2008 period , the average internet leak time was just 3 days .
From the day an official ‘ Screener ’ copy of the movie should ’ve been available , the average time took to leak the movie back in 2003 was a completely unimpressive minus 3 days .
So , 3 days before the Oscars screener was sent out to the Academy members , it was already available on the Internet .
Again , 2006 saw the greatest success for the movie industry when 16 days passed before a screener was leaked .
Over the 2003 to 2008 period , the average screener leak time was 6 days .
The most telling figures are when one looks at the number of movies nominated from 2003 to 2008 – a total of 185 movies .
Of these 185 , a massive 182 of these leaked to the internet in some way ( from ‘ cams ’ upwards ) and a worrying number – 143 – were leaks of ‘ Screener ’ copies , often leaked to uploaders by industry insiders .
In the vast majority of cases , a DVD or Screener copy of the movie was available for download on Oscar night .
Last year we reported on the OscarTorrents site .
The site will not be available again this year as the creators have no time , but they ’re promising to be “ back next year ” .
In the meantime ( and as usual ) , the full range of movies will be available at dozens of other torrent sites , right around the world .

It 's been known for a while that restricting your diet will increase your lifespan , but now researchers have shown one reason why : Eating less causes your ribosomes ( your cells ' protein factories ) to mutate .
And it 's looking like mutated ribosomes ( pictured here ) could be one key to life extension .
The good news is that you may not have to starve yourself to mutate your ribosomes anymore .
Biologists at the University of Washington have managed to induce the life - extending mutation in ribosomes with a drug that doubles the lifespan of yeast cells .

The key is to lower protein - production in cells , which is why eating less can cause lifespan extension .
According to the University of Washington :
In this project , the UW researchers studied many different strains of yeast cells that had lower protein production .
They found that mutations to the ribosome , the cell 's protein factory , sometimes led to increased life span .
Ribosomes are made up of two parts — the large and small subunits — and the researchers tried to isolate the life - span - related mutation to one of those parts .
" What we noticed right away was that the long - lived strains always had mutations in the large ribosomal subunit and never in the small subunit , " said the study 's lead author , Kristan Steffen , a graduate student in the UW Department of Biochemistry .
The researchers also tested a drug called diazaborine , which specifically interferes with synthesis of the ribosomes ' large subunits , but not small subunits , and found that treating cells with the drug made them live about 50 percent longer than untreated cells .
Using a series of genetic tests , the scientists then showed that depletion of the ribosomes ' large subunits was likely to be increasing life span by a mechanism related to dietary restriction — the TOR signaling pathway .

Researchers Uncover Details About How Dietary Restriction Slows Down Aging [ Eurekalert ]
SAN FRANCISCO — Being highly intelligent and social , humans suffer from more stress - related diseases than any other animal , worrying about family , health , jobs and even the future .
The average beast , on the other hand , does not spend much time worrying about these things .
But baboons do stress out , according to research presented here Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Why is that ?
The answer sheds light on human stress .
New worries
Just a century or so back , the primary threats to human life were pneumonia , tuberculosis , childbirth , the flu and the like .
Nowadays , relatively few people die from the flu ; instead most humans die of ailments that are relatively new to our species , such as heart disease , cancer , diabetes and Alzheimer ’s disease , said Robert Sapolsky , a Stanford University neuroscientist .
“ These are all diseases that are either caused by or being worsened by stress , ” said Sapolsky , who has written several books including " Why Zebras Do n’t Get Ulcers " and " A Primate ’s Memoir . "
He regularly visits Kenya to study baboons , primates with no predators that experience environmental and social stress sources like humans .
If you 're stomach is ripped open ...
Sapolsky explained homeostasis , is a state in which an organism or group is in balance , meaning for example , that there is an ideal level of glucose in the blood stream and the body ’s temperature is favorable .
A stressor is anything in the outside world that knocks an animal out of homeostatic balance .
“ You ’re a zebra , a lion has leapt out , ripped your stomach open and you still need to get out of there , ” Sapolsky told a packed room .
“ This counts as being out of homeostatic balance .
The stress response is what your body does to reestablish homeostasis .
That ’s all you need to know about the subject if you ’re a zebra . ”
In the case of humans , however , the definition is expanded .
Humans can anticipate that something unfavorable is about to happen to them and can have a stress response prior to the event , which could help them cope .
On the other hand , if a person believes they are about to be knocked out of homeostatic balance , but they are really not and this belief continues , then they are dealing with chronic stress .
You ’re being profoundly human in such a case , Sapolsky said .
“ Sit down a hippo and try to describe what ’s up with the ozone layer and he ’s going to have no idea what you ’re talking about .
We go exactly through that stress response as that zebra or lion , but we do it for chronic psychosocial reasons , ” he said .
This condition among humans , Sapolsky said , evolved from dealing with short - term crises .
“ For 99 percent of the beasts on this planet , stress is about three minutes of screaming in terror after which it ’s either over with or you ’re over with .
And we turn it on for 30 - year mortgages , ” he said .
Stress response
Stress , a stimulus that causes a physical or psychological reaction , causes the release of hormones , such as adrenaline and cortisol , in all vertebrates .
These hormones evolved to help facilitate behaviors that help vertebrates survive when they were about to become dinner .
During times of stress , animals go to their fat cells and liver and take out sugar and dump it in their blood streams .
“ You go to the bank and you empty out the savings account and you turn it into cash , Sapolsky said .
“ Next , you want to deliver this energy as fast as you can .
You increase your heart rate , your blood pressure and your breathing rate , to get that glucose to your thigh muscles in two seconds instead of three and you ’re that much more likely to survive . ”
However , humans , also generate these responses in non-life threatening situations , he said .
On a daily basis , humans could be worried about their jobs , missing deadlines and angering someone they love , among other things .
" If you turn on the stress response chronically for purely psychological reasons , you increase your risk of adult - onset diabetes and high blood pressure , ” Sapolsky said .
“ If you 're chronically shutting down the digestive system , there 's a bunch of gastrointestinal disorders you 're more at risk for as well . "
Baboon model
For 30 years , Sapolsky and his colleagues have been gathering behavioral and physiological field data — such as blood samples , tissue biopsies and electrocardiograms — on African baboons , close cousins of humans .
They study stress and neuron degeneration in the lab .
Unhealthy baboons , Sapolsky found , similar to unhealthy humans , have elevated levels of stress hormones and their immune responses and reproductive system are compromised .
" We 've found that baboons have diseases that other social mammals generally do n't have , " Sapolsky said .
" If you 're a gazelle , you do n't have a very complex emotional life , despite being a social species .
But primates are just smart enough that they can think their bodies into working differently .
It 's not until you get to primates that you get things that look like depression . "
These baboons have served a good model for understanding human behavior .
" The reason baboons are such good models is , like us , they do n't have real stressors , " Sapolsky said .
" If you live in a baboon troop in the Serengeti , you only have to work three hours a day for your calories , and predators do n't mess with you much .
What that means is you 've got nine hours of free time every day to devote to generating psychological stress toward other animals in your troop , " he explained .
" They 're just like us :
They 're not getting done in by predators and famines ; they 're getting done in by each other . "
Unlike baboons , however , humans can find different ways of coping with psychosocial stress .
Coping mechanisms
" We are capable of social supports that no other primate can even dream of , " Sapolsky said .
" For example , I might say , ' This job , where I 'm a lowly mailroom clerk , really does n't matter .
What really matters is that I 'm the captain of my softball team or deacon of my church , ' that sort of thing .
It 's not just somebody sitting here , grooming you with their own hands . ”
Humans also have a strong networking and support system .
“ We can actually feel comfort from the discovery that somebody on the other side of the planet is going through the same experience we are and feel , I 'm not alone , ” Sapolsky said .
“ We can even take comfort reading about a fictional character , and there 's no primate out there that can feel better in life just by listening to Beethoven . ”
Belgian city finds its former mayor 's heart in a fountain
For years it was just an urban myth .
Then the diggers moved in and found it was true - that the heart of a former mayor of the eastern Belgian city of Verviers really was buried under a fountain .
Followup to : Decoherence , Where Philosophy Meets Science
Once upon a time , there was an alien species , whose planet hovered in the void of a universe with laws almost like our own .
They would have been alien to us , but of course they did not think of themselves as alien .
They communicated via rapid flashes of light , rather than sound .
We 'll call them the Ebborians .
Ebborians reproduce by fission , an adult dividing into two new individuals .
They share genetic material , but not through sexual recombination ; Ebborian adults swap genetic material with each other .
They have two eyes , four legs , and two hands , letting a fissioned Ebborian survive long enough to regrow .
Human DNA is built in a double helix ; unzipping the helix a little at a time produces two stretches of single strands of DNA .
Each single strand attracts complementary bases , producing a new double strand .
At the end of the operation , a DNA double helix has turned into two double helices .
Hence earthly life .
Ebborians fission their brains , as well as their bodies , by a process something like how human DNA divides .
Imagine an Ebborian brain as a flat sheet of paper , computing in a way that is more electrical than chemical — charges flowing down conductive pathways .
When it 's time for an Ebborian to fission , the brain - paper splits down its thickness into two sheets of paper .
Each new sheet is capable of conducting electricity on its own .
Indeed , the Ebborian (s ) stays conscious throughout the whole fissioning process .
Over time , the brain - paper grows thick enough to fission again .
Electricity flows through Ebborian brains faster than human neurons fire .
But the Ebborian brain is constrained by its two - dimensionality .
An Ebborian brain - paper must split down its thickness while retaining the integrity of its program .
Ebborian evolution took the cheap way out : the brain - paper computes in a purely two - dimensional way .
The Ebborians have much faster neuron - equivalents , but they are far less interconnected .
On the whole , Ebborians think faster than humans and remember less .
They are less susceptible to habit ; they recompute what we would cache .
They would be incredulous at the idea that a human neuron might be connected to a thousand neighbors , and equally incredulous at the idea that our axons and dendrites propagate signals at only a few meters per second .
The Ebborians have no concept of parents , children , or sexuality .
Every adult Ebborian remembers fissioning many times .
But Ebborian memories quickly fade if not used ; no one knows the last common ancestor of those now alive .
In principle , an Ebborian personality can be immortal .
Yet an Ebborian remembers less life than a seventy - year - old human .
They retain only the most important highlights of their last few millennia .
Is this immortality ?
Is it death ?
The Ebborians had to rediscover natural selection from scratch , because no one retained their memories of being a fish .
But I digress from my tale .
Today , the Ebborians have gathered to celebrate a day which all present will remember for hundreds of years .
They have discovered ( they believe ) the Ultimate Grand Unified Theory of Everything for their universe .
The theory which seems , at last , to explain every known fundamental physical phenomenon — to predict what every instrument will measure , in every experiment whose initial conditions are exactly known , and which can be calculated on available computers .
" But wait ! " cries an Ebborian .
( We 'll call this one Po'mi . )
" But wait ! " , cries Po'mi , " There are still questions the Unified Theory can't answer !
During the fission process , when exactly does one Ebborian consciousness become two separate people ? "
The gathered Ebborians look at each other .
Finally , there speaks the moderator of the gathering , the second - foremost Ebborian on the planet : the much - respected Nharglane of Ebbore , who achieved his position through consistent gentleness and courtesy .
" Well , " Nharglane says , " I admit I ca n't answer that one — but is it really a question of fundamental physics ? "
" I would n't even call that a ' question ' , " snorts De 'da the Ebborian , " seeing as how there 's no experimental test whose result depends on the answer . "
" On the contrary , " retorts Po'mi , " all our experimental results ultimately come down to our experiences .
If a theory of physics can't predict what we 'll experience , what good is it ? "
De 'da shrugs .
" One person , two people — how does that make a difference even to experience ?
How do you tell even internally whether you 're one person or two people ?
Of course , if you look over and see your other self , you know you 're finished dividing — but by that time your brain has long since finished splitting . "
" Clearly , " says Po'mi , " at any given point , whatever is having an experience is one person .
So it is never necessary to tell whether you are one person or two people .
You are always one person .
But at any given time during the split , does there exist another , different consciousness as yet , with its own awareness ? "
De 'da performs an elaborate quiver , the Ebborian equivalent of waving one 's hands .
" When the brain splits , it splits fast enough that there is n't much time where the question would be ambiguous .
One instant , all the electrical charges are moving as a whole .
The next instant , they move separately . "
" That 's not true , " says Po'mi .
" You can't sweep the problem under the rug that easily .
There is a quite appreciable time — many picoseconds — when the two halves of the brain are within distance for the moving electrical charges in each half to tug on the other .
Not quite causally separated , and not quite the same computation either .
Certainly there is a time when there is definitely one person , and a time when there is definitely two people .
But at which exact point in between are there two distinct conscious experiences ? "
" My challenge stands , " says De'da .
" How does it make a difference , even a difference of first - person experience , as to when you say the split occurs ?
There 's no third - party experiment you can perform to tell you the answer .
And no difference of first - person experience , either .
Your belief that consciousness must ' split ' at some particular point , stems from trying to model consciousness as a big rock of awareness that can only be in one place at a time .
There 's no third - party experiment , and no first - person experience , that can tell you when you 've split ; the question is meaningless . "
" If experience is meaningless , " retorts Po'mi , " then so are all our scientific theories , which are merely intended to explain our experiences . "
" If I may , " says another Ebborian , named Yu'el , " I think I can refine my honorable colleague Po'mi 's dilemma .
Suppose that you anesthetized one of us -"
( Ebborians use an anesthetic that effectively shuts off electrical power to the brain — no processing or learning occurs while an Ebborian is anesthetized . )
"- and then flipped a coin .
If the coin comes up heads , you split the subject while they are unconscious .
If the coin comes up tails , you leave the subject as is .
When the subject goes to sleep , should they anticipate a 2/3 probability of seeing the coin come up heads , or anticipate a 1 / 2 probability of seeing the coin come up heads ?
If you answer 2/3 , then there is a difference of anticipation that could be made to depend on exactly when you split . "
" Clearly , then , " says De'da , " the answer is 1/ 2 , since answering 2/3 gets us into paradoxical and ill - defined issues . "
Yu'el looks thoughtful .
" What if we split you into 512 parts while you were anesthetized ?
Would you still answer a probability of 1 /2 for seeing the coin come up heads ? "
De 'da shrugs .
" Certainly .
When I went to sleep , I would figure on a 1 / 2 probability that I would n't get split at all . "
" Hmm ... "
Yu'el says .
" All right , suppose that we are definitely going to split you into 16 parts .
3 of you will wake up in a red room , 13 of you will wake up in a green room .
Do you anticipate a 13 /16 probability of waking up in a green room ? "
" I anticipate waking up in a green room with near - 1 probability , " replies De'da , " and I anticipate waking up in a red room with near - 1 probability .
My future selves will experience both outcomes . "
" But I 'm asking about your personal anticipation , " Yu'el persists .
" When you fall asleep , how much do you anticipate seeing a green room ?
You ca n't see both room colors at once — that 's not an experience anyone will have — so which color do you personally anticipate more ? "
De 'da shakes his head .
" I can see where this is going ; you plan to ask what I anticipate in cases where I may or may not be split .
But I must deny that your question has an objective answer , precisely because of where it leads .
Now , I do say to you , that I care about my future selves .
If you ask me whether I would like each of my green - room selves , or each of my red-room selves , to receive ten dollars , I will of course choose the green - roomers — but I do n't care to follow this notion of ' personal anticipation ' where you are taking it . "
" While you are anesthetized , " says Yu'el , " I will flip a coin ; if the coin comes up heads , I will put 3 of you into red rooms and 13 of you into green rooms .
If the coin comes up tails , I will reverse the proportion .
If you wake up in a green room , what is your posterior probability that the coin came up heads ? "
De 'da pauses .
" Well ... " he says slowly , " Clearly , some of me will be wrong , no matter which reasoning method I use — but if you offer me a bet , I can minimize the number of me who bet poorly , by using the general policy , of each self betting as if the posterior probability of their color dominating is 13 /16 .
And if you try to make that judgment depend on the details of the splitting process , then it just depends on how whoever offers the bet counts Ebborians . "
Yu 'el nods .
" I can see what you are saying , De'da .
But I just can't make myself believe it , at least not yet .
If there were to be 3 of me waking up in red rooms , and a billion of me waking up in green rooms , I would quite strongly anticipate seeing a green room when I woke up .
Just the same way that I anticipate not winning the lottery .
And if the proportions of three red to a billion green , followed from a coin coming up heads ; but the reverse proportion , of a billion red to three green , followed from tails ; and I woke up and saw a red room ; why , then , I would be nearly certain — on a quite personal level — that the coin had come up tails . "
" That stance exposes you to quite a bit of trouble , " notes De'da .
Yu 'el nods .
" I can even see some of the troubles myself .
Suppose you split brains only a short distance apart from each other , so that they could , in principle , be fused back together again ?
What if there was an Ebborian with a brain thick enough to be split into a million parts , and the parts could then re-unite ?
Even if it 's not biologically possible , we could do it with a computer - based mind , someday .
Now , suppose you split me into 500,000 brains who woke up in green rooms , and 3 much thicker brains who woke up in red rooms .
I would surely anticipate seeing the green room .
But most of me who see the green room will see nearly the same thing — different in tiny details , perhaps , enough to differentiate our experience , but such details are soon forgotten .
So now suppose that my 500,000 green selves are reunited into one Ebborian , and my 3 red selves are reunited into one Ebborian .
Have I just sent nearly all of my " subjective probability " into the green future self , even though it is now only one of two ?
With only a little more work , you can see how a temporary expenditure of computing power , or a nicely refined brain - splitter and a dose of anesthesia , would let you have a high subjective probability of winning any lottery .
At least any lottery that involved splitting you into pieces . "
De 'da furrows his eyes .
" So have you not just proved your own theory to be nonsense ? "
" I 'm not sure , " says Yu'el .
" At this point , I 'm not even sure the conclusion is wrong . "
" I did n't suggest your conclusion was wrong , " says De'da , " I suggested it was nonsense .
There 's a difference . "
" Perhaps , " says Yu'el .
" Perhaps it will indeed turn out to be nonsense , when I know better .
But if so , I do n't quite know better yet .
I can't quite see how to eliminate the notion of subjective anticipation from my view of the universe .
I would need something to replace it , something to re-fill the role that anticipation currently plays in my worldview . "
De 'da shrugs .
" Why not just eliminate ' subjective anticipation ' outright ? "
" For one thing , " says Yu'el , " I would then have no way to express my surprise at the orderliness of the universe .
Suppose you claimed that the universe was actually made up entirely of random experiences , brains temporarily coalescing from dust and experiencing all possible sensory data .
Then if I do n't count individuals , or weigh their existence somehow , that chaotic hypothesis would predict my existence as strongly as does science .
The realization of all possible chaotic experiences would predict my own experience with probability 1 .
I need to keep my surprise at having this particular orderly experience , to justify my anticipation of seeing an orderly future .
If I throw away the notion of subjective anticipation , then how do I differentiate the chaotic universe from the orderly one ?
Presumably there are Yu'els , somewhere in time and space ( for the universe is spatially infinite ) who are about to have a really chaotic experience .
I need some way of saying that these Yu'els are rare , or weigh little — some way of mostly anticipating that I wo n't sprout wings and fly away .
I 'm not saying that my current way of doing this is good bookkeeping , or even coherent bookkeeping ; but I can't just delete the bookkeeping without a more solid understanding to put in its place .
I need some way to say that there are versions of me who see one thing , and versions of me who see something else , but there 's some kind of different weight on them .
Right now , what I try to do is count copies — but I do n't know exactly what constitutes a copy . "
Po'mi clears his throat , and speaks again .
" So , Yu'el , you agree with me that there exists a definite and factual question as to exactly when there are two conscious experiences , instead of one . "
" That , I do not concede , " says Yu'el .
" All that I have said may only be a recital of my own confusion .
You are too quick to fix the language of your beliefs , when there are words in it that , by your own admission , you do not understand .
No matter how fundamental your experience feels to you , it is not safe to trust that feeling , until experience is no longer something you are confused about .
There is a black box here , a mystery .
Anything could be inside that box — any sort of surprise — a shock that shatters everything you currently believe about consciousness .
Including upsetting your belief that experience is fundamental .
In fact , that strikes me as a surprise you should anticipate — though it will still come as a shock . "
" But then , " says Po'mi , " do you at least agree that if our physics does not specify which experiences are experienced , or how many of them , or how much they ' weigh ' , then our physics must be incomplete ? "
" No , " says Yu'el , " I do n't concede that either .
Because consider that , even if a physics is known — even if we construct a universe with very simple physics , much simpler than our own Unified Theory — I can still present the same split - brain dilemmas , and they will still seem just as puzzling .
This suggests that the source of the confusion is not in our theories of fundamental physics .
It is on a higher level of organization .
We can't compute exactly how proteins will fold up ; but this is not a deficit in our theory of atomic dynamics , it is a deficit of computing power .
We do n't know what makes sharkras bloom only in spring ; but this is not a deficit in our Unified Theory , it is a deficit in our biology — we do n't possess the technology to take the sharkras apart on a molecular level to find out how they work .
What you are pointing out is a gap in our science of consciousness , which would present us with just the same puzzles even if we knew all the fundamental physics .
I see no work here for physicists , at all . "
Po'mi smiles faintly at this , and is about to reply , when a listening Ebborian shouts , " What , have you begun to believe in zombies ?
That when you specify all the physical facts about a universe , there are facts about consciousness left over ? "
" No ! " says Yu'el .
" Of course not !
You can know the fundamental physics of a universe , hold all the fundamental equations in your mind , and still not have all the physical facts .
You may not know why sharkras bloom in the summer .
But if you could actually hold the entire fundamental physical state of the sharkra in your mind , and understand all its levels of organization , then you would necessarily know why it blooms — there would be no fact left over , from outside physics .
When I say , ' Imagine running the split - brain experiment in a universe with simple known physics , ' you are not concretely imagining that universe , in every detail .
You are not actually specifying the entire physical makeup of an Ebborian in your imagination .
You are only imagining that you know it .
But if you actually knew how to build an entire conscious being from scratch , out of paperclips and rubberbands , you would have a great deal of knowledge that you do not presently have .
This is important information that you are missing !
Imagining that you have it , does not give you the insights that would follow from really knowing the full physical state of a conscious being . "
" So , " Yu'el continues , " We can imagine ourselves knowing the fundamental physics , and imagine an Ebborian brain splitting , and find that we do n't know exactly when the consciousness has split .
Because we are not concretely imagining a complete and detailed description of a conscious being , with full comprehension of the implicit higher levels of organization .
There are knowledge gaps here , but they are not gaps of physics .
They are gaps in our understanding of consciousness .
I see no reason to think that fundamental physics has anything to do with such questions . "
" Well then , " Po'mi says , " I have a puzzle I should like you to explain , Yu'el .
As you know , it was discovered not many years ago , that our universe has four spatial dimensions , rather than three dimensions , as it first appears . "
" Aye , " says Nharglane of Ebbore , " this was a key part in our working - out of the Unified Theory .
Our models would be utterly at a loss to account for observed experimental results , if we could not model the fourth dimension , and differentiate the fourth - dimensional density of materials . "
" And we also discovered , " continues Po'mi , " that our very planet of Ebbore , including all the people on it , has a four - dimensional thickness , and is constantly fissioning along that thickness , just as our brains do .
Only the fissioned sides of our planet do not remain in contact , as our new selves do ; the sides separate into the fourth - dimensional void . "
Nharglane nods .
" Yes , it was rather a surprise to realize that the whole world is duplicated over and over .
I shall remember that realization for a long time indeed .
It is a good thing we Ebborians had our experience with self - fissioning , to prepare us for the shock .
Otherwise we might have been driven mad , and embraced absurd physical theories . "
" Well , " says Po'mi , " when the world splits down its four - dimensional thickness , it does not always split exactly evenly .
Indeed , it is not uncommon to see nine - tenths of the four - dimensional thickness in one side . "
" Really ? " says Yu'el .
" My knowledge of physics is not so great as yours , but — "
" The statement is correct , " says the respected Nharglane of Ebbore .
" Now , " says Po'mi , " if fundamental physics has nothing to do with consciousness , can you tell me why the subjective probability of finding ourselves in a side of the split world , should be exactly proportional to the square of the thickness of that side ? "
There is a great terrible silence .
" WHAT ? " says Yu'el .
" WHAT ? " says De'da .
" WHAT ? " says Nharglane .
" WHAT ? " says the entire audience of Ebborians .

As the U.S. Treasury races to get the rebates to households , beginning this week , it faces an uphill battle against inflation that is blunting the benefits of the $ 152 billion 2008 stimulus package .
There is a lot riding on what consumers do with these rebate checks .
Depending on how much is promptly spent -- and on what -- it could mean the difference between the U.S. economy eking out marginal growth in the coming months or slipping into a deep recession .
It could affect whether the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates .
Also , the economy is likely to play a pivotal role in November 's presidential election , which incumbent parties tend to lose when recessions hit .
With inflation eroding consumer buying power , the worry is that the rebate checks will prove insufficient to prop up the economy , particularly when poll after poll shows that households intend to use a large portion of the money to pay down debt or bolster savings .
The U.S. economy is dependent on consumer spending .
Rising prices means the same dollar buys less of the goods and services that make the economy go .
" Every penny of gas price increases takes about $ 1.5 billion out of spending power for Americans , " said Gary Balter , retail sector analyst with Credit Suisse in New York .
" In other words , 50 cents wipes out over half the stimulus benefit for consumers . "
If they use the rest to pay bills or buy food , that could quickly eat up the entire rebate check with only limited benefit to retail stores and other businesses that are hoping for a summer windfall , Balter said .
Economists think economic growth came to a near standstill in the first quarter because of the slumping housing market , tightening credit conditions and rising food and fuel prices .
Initial data on first - quarter growth is due Wednesday .
While there are tentative signs that credit markets are stabilizing after nearly nine months of turmoil , there is little relief in sight on inflation .
Oil near $ 120 per barrel points to higher gasoline prices to come .
Since Bush signed the economic stimulus plan in February , the average price per gallon of gasoline has jumped 64 cents to $ 3.60 , according to government data released Monday .
The stimulus plan includes about $ 106 billion earmarked for households this year , with the remainder going to businesses .
With daily gasoline consumption averaging about 395 million gallons , according to government projections , consumers could use the checks to buy gas for about 75 days at current prices , which would n't even get them through the summer driving season .
If gasoline prices had not risen since February , that money would have bought about 90 days of supply .
The rebates give up to $ 600 for individuals and $ 1,200 per married couple , with amounts varying based on income .
Families with children can receive an additional $ 300 per child .
The White House seems to recognize that people may not be in a splurging mood .
Bush said Friday that the checks would " help Americans offset the high prices we 're seeing at the gas pump and the grocery store . "
Back on Feb. 13 , when he signed the stimulus bill , he did not mention inflation .
Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg described the price pressure as a " shock to the system that is draining household purchasing power . "
To be sure , $ 100 billion or so extra in consumers ' pockets will help the economy .
It represents about 2 percent of annual retail sales .
Consulting firm Retail Forward estimates that households will spend $ 42 billion of the rebates this year , with the rest going to debt repayment and savings .
Retail Forward economist Frank Badillo estimated that retail sales -- excluding autos and gasoline -- would rise by 3.5 percent in the second quarter with the rebates , compared with 2 percent without them .
The controversial proposal to charge drivers in the busiest parts of Manhattan took a major step forward on Monday , with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Speaker Christine C. Quinn wrenching approval from the City Council by an unusually slim margin .
Under intense pressure from the mayor , Ms. Quinn and their allies that continued almost until the voting began , council members approved the plan to charge most drivers $ 8 to enter a zone below 60th Street by a vote of 30 to 20 , with no abstentions and one absence .
At a news conference after the vote , where Mr. Bloomberg made a rare appearance on the speaker ’s side of City Hall , officials sought to play down the narrowness of their hard - won victory , among the closest of this administration in a body that typically votes in near unanimity .
Approving the proposal , Ms. Quinn said , would send a message to the Legislature that the “ people who were elected to represent the New Yorkers who live in our five boroughs are sick and tired of our streets being clogged with traffic , we ’re sick and tired of the children who live in our city literally having to fight to be able to breathe , and that we see congestion pricing as a solution to this problem . ”
Video of Newspeak lecture now available 19 April , 2008
The video has now been posted of Gilad Bracha ‘s talk on Newspeak that we mentioned last month .
Newspeak is a new dynamic language being developed at Cadence , and is descended from Smalltalk and Self , with influences from E , Scala and Scheme , exploring ideas around combinatorial parsing , strict message - passing , reflectivity , capability - based security and actor - style concurrency .
Newspeak is being developed on top of Squeak , and the presentation makes a number of direct comparisons with Squeak , especially when discussing UI matters such as the Newspeak widget framework , application framework and Class Browser , and how they ’ve improved on Squeak ’s access to the operating system with a new FFI framework .
The roadmap for the future development of Newspeak is also laid out , including a discussion of when / whether the code will be published .
( If you ’re having trouble viewing the video , see this thread for help ) .
[ Edit – Gilad Bracha has a fascinating blog that records his ongoing development of Newspeak . ]

Post subject : ' In C ' by Terry Riley
Subject description : A ChucK implementation using randomly repeated phrases I 'm sporking this discussion from another thread ...
Thought it merited it 's own subject line ...
UPDATE : Corrected the midi note conversrion using Std.mtof ( ) .
Code :
// ChucK Performance of Terry Riley's ' In C '
//
//
In this famous canon by composer Terry Riley , each performer is given the
// same set of phrases .
//
// Each performer repeats each phrase a random number of times before moving
// on to the next phrase .
//
// A single player keeps time by playing a pulse beat
//
When all the players are done , the pulse continues for a while , and then stops .
//
// ChucK port 11/2006 -- Jim Bumgardner
// Original Perl Program 9/2004 -- Jim Bumgardner
// With these settings , ChucK produces about 14 minutes of music .
// A more typical ' In C ' performance is 20 - 60 minutes .
Increase the
// min/max repetitions to achieve this ...
//
240 => float bps ; // ticks / second
4 => int minRepeats ; // minimum times to repeat a phrase
10 => int maxRepeats ; // maximum times to repeat a phrase

This is wonderful .
One suggestion for faster download and run : if you want , include the chuck source as an attachment .
.ck files should be recognized by the server .

I took your version of In C and went through it to try to understand it .
I append my slightly modified version ( mainly ; I distributed the players across the stereo field using an array of Pan2's ) .

In C split into two files ...
So to run it you simply chuck the In_C_phrases_01.ck file first , then the In_C_commands_01.ck file .
The number of lines seemed to be conserved ; in my last version it was about 450 lines total with comments , now we have two files , one 200 and the other 240 lines long .
c .
Partly for my own edification , and partly to make it easier to follow : I created a separate file with the note and phrase data for the In C program in a public class .
The commands and procedures are in the second file .
This makes it a little more wieldy ; you can follow the code flow without having to scroll over a couple hundred lines of data .
( This also incidentally mimics the CSound paradigm where the " orchestra " and " score " code are separate entities ... even if in the CSD format they can coexist in a single file . )

Post subject : " In C " follow up An update on my " In C " project .
The ChucK code I originally posted was actually a port of a Python version I made , which produced a MIDI file , some years back .
Recently , I 've become very interested in antique mechanical music instruments , and have contacted a number of instrument owners who have installed MIDI controller setups on their pianolas , orchastrelles and orchestreons .
I am preparing a version of " In C " which will be played on a single Orchestreon , which has piano , about 10 ranks of organ pipes , xylophone , marimba and percussion .
If I manage it video tape it , I 'll put it on YouTube and post it here :)

SEOUL ( AFP ) -- South Korea 's top car maker Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.SE ) said Sunday it will begin mass - producing hybrid cars next year , amid growing demand for fuel - efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles .
The first mass - produced model will be a compact sedan , known as " Avante , " the company said in a statement .
Some 89 % of adults think children are more materialistic than ever
Some 89 % of adults in the GfK NOP survey of 1,255 people believed today 's children were more materialistic than previous generations .
The poll is one of the contributions to a continuing inquiry into childhood .
The Children 's Society said adults had to " take responsibility for the current level of marketing to children " .
Bob Reitemeier , chief executive of the society , said : " A crucial question raised by the inquiry is whether childhood should be a space where developing minds are free from concentrated sales techniques .
" To accuse children of being materialistic in such a culture is a cop-out , " he said .
Children should be encouraged to value themselves for who they are as people rather than what they own
Dr Rowan Williams
Mr Reitemeier said : " Unless we question our own behaviour as a society we risk creating a generation who are left unfulfilled through chasing unattainable lifestyles . "
The children 's market is worth an estimated £ 30 bn a year .
As chief executive of the National Schools Partnership , Mark Fawcett brings business and marketing into schools , and he believes you cannot shield children from the real world .
" We have to live in the current communications era where children can see a huge amount of information , " he told BBC TV news .
" We have to use our judgement and we have to , as an industry , make sure we are working with children and families , and not exploiting them . "
Selling lifestyles
HAVE YOUR SAY Parents should be stronger at refusing the ridiculous demands for the latest gear at huge prices Hayley Smith Rotherham
The evidence on lifestyle is part of a six - part series of investigations published by the Children 's Society for a continuing inquiry into childhood in the UK which brings together the views of academics , religious communities , teachers , local authorities and authors .
Dr. Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , who is patron of the inquiry , said : " Children should be encouraged to value themselves for who they are as people rather than what they own .
" The selling of lifestyles to children creates a culture of material competitiveness and promotes acquisitive individualism at the expense of the principles of community and co-operation . "
CHILDHOOD LIFESTYLE
POLL 90 % agree childhood more materialistic 69 % agree violent video games make children more aggressive 90 % believe Christmas advertising puts pressure on parents to spend more than they can afford 60 % believe there should be a government ban on junk food advertising
One member of the childhood inquiry panel has warned that the commercial pressures on youngsters may have damaging psychological effects .
Professor Philip Graham , Emeritus Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Institute of Child Health in London , said : " One factor that may be leading to rising mental health problems is the increasing degree to which children and young people are preoccupied with possessions ; the latest in fashionable clothes and electronic equipment .
" Evidence both from the United States and from the UK suggests that those most influenced by commercial pressures also show higher rates of mental health problems , " he went on .
Junk food advertising
The poll found that an overwhelming majority , 90 % , of adults thought that advertising to children at Christmas put pressure on parents to spend more than they can afford .
Sixty per cent of those questioned believed that children and young people 's self esteem was being damaged by a negative portrayal of their age group in the media .
Women in the survey were more likely than men to think the media was causing the damage , with 63 % agreeing , compared to 56 % of men .

Sixty - nine per cent of the sample thought violent video games made children more aggressive .
A majority of the adults questioned agreed that the government should ban advertising of unhealthy food .
One parent who admits to feeling the commercial pressures of parenthood is Zara Hobley , aged 35 .
With three children between the ages of one and four , Mrs Hobley believes it is important to be able to teach them about discipline and boundaries .
" We 're never going to beat the big companies that push impressive marketing campaigns but what we can do is equip ourselves and our children to be able to say no and not to feel bad about it . "
Mrs Hobley said : " As parents we have a responsibility to teach our children how to cope with materialism .
If we can teach them some kind of responsibility then I think that will work . "
This theme is the fourth in the childhood inquiry ; the previous ones have included friends , family and learning .
The first theme , published in June 2007 , found that adult anxieties about the modern world were curtailing children 's freedom to play with friends .
Over the next 12 months the inquiry will hold meetings on the remaining themes of health and values and a final report will be published in 2009 .
Now I do n't want to alarm you , but there just happens to be a binary star about 8,000 light years from us that 's on the brink of exploding .
Not a big deal normally , but this one happens to have its pole pointed right at us , which means that if it explodes in a gamma - ray burst it could shoot a beam of destructive , ozone - layer - melting gamma rays at us all Death - Star - like .
Advertisement
There are enough ifs involved in the situation to make the likelihood pretty slim , but this is definitely one of those situations that astronomers are keeping a careful eye on .
It all revolves around WR 104 , a humungous star classified as a Wolf Rayet star .
Generally , these blow up as a supernova , which is no biggie .
But sometimes , they blow up as gamma-ray bursts .
What 's that mean ?
When a very massive star explodes , the inner core collapses , forming a black hole , while the outer layers explode outwards .
Due to a complex and fierce collusion of forces in the core , two beams of raw fury can erupt out of the star , mind - numbing in their power .
Composed mostly of high - energy gamma rays , they can carry more energy in them than the Sun will put out in its entire lifetime .
They are so energetic we can see them clear across the Universe , and having one too close would be bad .
Advertisement
Oh , well at least we will avoid it since it only shoots that energy out the poles , right ?
Uh , well , actually , its pole seems to be aimed right for us .
And what happens if it does hit us ?
Models of a GRB exploding at roughly the same distance indicate that the immediate impacts are damage to the ozone layer , and the creation of nitrogen dioxide , which is basically smog .
Gamma rays emitted by the burst would hit ozone molecules and shatter them , and models indicate that a GRB at this distance could deplete the ozone layer by 30 % globally , with local pockets depleted by 50 % .
It would take years for the ozone to recover from that .
Note that the ozone holes we have been dealing with the past few years are actually depletions of less than 5 % .
Obviously , this is a big deal .

The good news is that we do n't know when this guy is going to explode , be it tomorrow or 20,000 years from now , and we do n't know how it 'll explode either .
Basically , the chances are really slim that anything bad will happen , but I just wanted to add a nice dose of apocalyptic dread to your afternoon .
You are welcome !

The commander of U.S. military forces in the Middle East does not believe current tensions with Iran will lead to war and urges for greater emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy .
" This constant drum beat of conflict is what strikes me which is not helpful and not useful , " Adm .
William Fallon said in an interview with Al - Jazeera television , which made a partial transcript available Sunday .
Fallon , the head of U.S. Central Command , wraps up a seven-nation tour of the region on Tuesday that included stops in Persian Gulf countries , Afghanistan and Iraq .
Many of the talks with military and political leaders were dominated by worries about expanding Iranian influence and U.S. accusations that Iran is supplying arms and training to Shiite militiamen in Iraq .
" I expect that there will be no war and that is what we ought to be working for , " said Fallon during the Friday interview at Al - Jazeera 's headquarters in Qatar .
" We should find ways through which we can bring countries to work together for the benefit of all ....
It is not a good idea to be in a state of war .
We ought to try and to do our utmost to create different conditions . "
Al - Jazeera was expected to broadcast the complete interview later this week .
Fallon — who leads U.S. forces in Central Asia , the Middle East and the Horn of Africa — was in Iraq on Sunday for a second day of meetings .
At the United Nations , Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said Saturday that the world body plans to open a new office in Baghdad to encourage cooperation between Iraq and its neighbors , calling Iraq 's stability " a common concern . "
The U.N. greatly scaled back its presence in Iraq since a 2003 bombing at its Baghdad headquarters that killed 22 people .

Paleontologists have long been perplexed by dinosaur fossils with missing pieces – sets of teeth without a jaw bone , bones that are pitted and grooved , even bones that are half gone .
Now a Brigham Young University study identifies a culprit : ancient insects that munched on dinosaur bones .
BYU professor Brooks Britt will publish his study of these dinosaur bone - eating bugs in the May 8 issue of the scientific journal Ichnos .
Britt ’s idea for this study came when he first noticed the unique markings on the bones as an undergraduate at BYU .
“ As students we noticed these marks and thought it might be due to algae or insects and we started calling them ‘ bug bites , ’ just for fun , ” Britt said .
Years later , current BYU student Anne Dangerfield also wondered about the markings and teamed up with Britt to investigate the cause .
They studied insect traces on the 148 - million - year - old remains of a Camptosaurus , a plant - eating specimen discovered in Medicine Bow , Wyo. , in 1995 .
“ I knew this trace was something different because I had been looking at fossil termite traces all summer , so I knew we needed to check it out , ” Dangerfield said .
Their analysis revealed that beetles , from the family entomologists call Dermestidae , left the markings on the Camptosaurus .
Dermestid beetles still exist today and are typically brown or black , oval - shaped and feed on flesh , hair , skin or horns of carcasses .

Information about the beetle ’s typical habitat reveals the climate at the time of the Camptosaurus ’ death probably had 60 - 80 percent relative humidity and a temperature of 77 - 86 F .
By comparison , the average yearly temperature in Medicine Bow is now 43.5 F .
When the dinosaur died near what is now Medicine Bow , the carcass was consumed by other insects .
The beetles then infested the Camptosaurus within months of its death .
In addition to shedding light on Wyoming ’s ancient climate , Dangerfield and Britt ’s work shows dermestid beetles existed much earlier than previously thought .
The traces on this Camptosaurus predate the oldest body fossils for dermestid beetles by 48 million years .
“ This information gives us an idea of the environment during the Jurassic period and the evolution of insects , ” Dangerfield said .
To analyze the markings on the bones , Britt went to his family dentist for molding materials , allowing Britt to more quickly create replicas of the bone traces to work with .

He took the castings back to BYU ’s Earth Science Museum where he used an electron microscope to look at the mandible markings in the bone , analyzing eating patterns and the width between the teeth marks .
Britt and Dangerfield compared the marks to information about the mandibles of moths , termites , mayflies and dermestid beetles – all known to consume bone – to determine the identity of the insect .
“ Other people have thought they have seen dermestid beetle marks , or they have interpreted termite marks as dermestids , but this paper provides a guide to identifying insects from the bone traces , ” Britt said .
Britt and Dangerfield continued their research by looking at more than 7,000 bones from various quarries and found that insect traces on dinosaur bones are quite common , but dermestid beetle traces were found only on the Camptosaurus skeleton from Medicine Bow .
“ Dr. Britt ’s work is really exciting and delves into unique aspects of paleobiology that few scientists have yet explored , ” said Eric Roberts , an expert in dinosaur decomposition who teaches at South Africa ’s University of the Witwatersrand .
“ Insects are among the most diverse and abundant organisms on the planet , yet we know next to nothing about the fossil record of insects because of their extremely limited preservation potential . ”
Dangerfield ’s undergraduate and graduate mentored research experience has impressed many potential employers .
After finishing her master ’s degree in August , she will assume a position with Exxon Mobile as an exploration oil and gas geologist .
“ Whenever I show my resume , employers are impressed with the amount of undergraduate research I ’ve done , ” Dangerfield said .
Britt received his bachelor ’s and master ’s degrees at BYU and his Ph.D. at the University of Calgary and is an assistant professor .
Rodney Scheetz , another author on the study , is the curator at BYU ’s Earth Science Museum .
Last month , the US Navy and General Dynamics took the lid off the new U.S.S.
Independence littoral combat ship ( LCS ) .
This beast will sail close to the shore and throw everything imaginable at an enemy — from armored vehicles and helicopters to shells , torpedoes and missiles .
Plus , it can hustle at a rumored 60 knots .
Basically , that means the enemy will have a difficult time escaping the wrath of this mighty vessel no matter where they are .

Hell , you could be sitting in a Port - a - Potty in the middle of the desert and this thing would probably drop out of the sky hurling torpedoes up the toilet .
And the best part is that the price tag tops out at only $ 208 million , which is fairly frugal for the US government .
That 's why the Navy plans on building 55 of them in the near future .

As a child growing up on Long Island , New York , Stephen Post frequently heard an aphorism from his Irish mother .
“ When I would have a boring , lonely , morose day , she would always tell me , ' Stevie , why do n’t you go out and do something for somebody ? ’ ” Post recalled in a recent phone interview with the Georgia Straight .
Like a good son , Post often listened to his mother .
He would walk across the road to help a neighbour rake leaves .
Or he would pull a boat out of the water before winter began .
“ I always sensed there was a certain kind of buoyancy and flourishing in just doing simple things that everybody can do for the people around us , ” he said .
“ That was kind of for me , the key to happiness . ”
He did n’t realize at the time that his mother ’s wisdom would eventually lead him to become perhaps North America ’s foremost academic authority on altruism , compassion , gratitude , and service .
Post , president of the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love at Case Western Reserve University , will speak at the Ridge Theatre on Friday ( May 2 ) about studies linking good thoughts and good deeds to better health .
His research has been published in many peer - reviewed publications , including the Lancet , the Journal of the American Medical Association , and Science .
“ When I write ' It ’s good to be good , ’ I ’m not trying to be inauthentic about generous behaviour , saying this is the new gymnastic workout in the self - help model , ” Post said .
“ What I am saying is as a side effect or byproduct of sincere generous living , we are happier , healthier , and odds are we will live a little longer .
And we will certainly find life more meaningful . ”
In other words , nice guys can finish first .
Post said he has been interested in altruism since he was in high school .
While at Cornell University , he studied the hormone oxytocin , which is linked to attachment and compassion .
He obtained a PhD in religious ethics and moral philosophy from the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1983 and later became a professor of medical ethics .
The Institute for Research on Unlimited Love was established in 2001 .
A great deal of psychological research in North America in the 20th century focused on pathologies and personality disorders .
Thanks to a start - up grant from the John Templeton Foundation , which was created by the famed mutual - fund investor of the same name , Post got an opportunity to look into the consequences of being good .
It should n’t come as a surprise that the title of Post ’s 2007 book is Why Good Things Happen to Good People : How to Live a Longer , Healthier , Happier Life by the Simple Act of Giving ( Broadway Books ) .
In his interview with the Straight , Post said that 12 years ago there were a half - dozen peer - reviewed articles on forgiveness ; the last time he counted , there were 2,700 peer - reviewed published papers on the topic .
“ That would not have happened years and years ago when people thought the only thing you could study scientifically with any legitimacy would be human disease and deficits , negative emotions like hostility , bitterness , hatred , and the like , and fear , ” he commented .
Post ’s book cites studies linking forgiveness to improving moods , reducing anger , alleviating depression , lowering stress - hormone levels , and preserving close relationships .
He also highlights research by Neal Krause at the University of Michigan , which showed that forgiving others unconditionally offers even greater benefits than forgiving those who demonstrate contrition or those who apologize .
“ Studies show that someone who imagines an offender offering a strong apology feels more positive and experiences declines in heart rate and other physiological measures of stress , ” Post writes .
“ In other words , apology heals the recipient . ”
Forgiveness is just one of several areas that Post likes to discuss .
He also pointed to neurological research linking compassion with feeling happier .
Post told the Straight about a study published in 2006 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The research showed that brains secrete happy drops when people think they ’re doing altruistic things .
In this study , subjects were divided into two groups .
Post said that each person was hooked up to a magnetic - resonance - imaging device .
The ones in the experimental group were then given a list of charities .
When they checked off boxes for imaginary donations to groups that they supported , the mesolimbic pathway in their brains lit up .
“ It ’s the part of the brain that ’s associated with joy or happiness — also the part of the brain that doles out a lot of feel - good chemicals like dopamine and even serotonin , ” Post said .
“ Suddenly it was possible to see a picture that actually had been understood pretty well psychologically since the late 1980s as ' helper ’s high ’ . ”
Austrian psychiatrist Victor Frankl , who died in 1997 , was a major influence on Post in his younger days .
Frankl wrote Man ’s Search for Meaning , an account of his experiences at Auschwitz .
He paid close attention to those who survived the Nazis ’ indignities and concluded that inmates who clung to a purpose in their life generally had a better chance of success .
“ For Victor Frankl , of course , the great symbolic action was that he shared his small meals with other prisoners , ” Post said .
“ What he said was , in fact , as long as you could still do those kinds of things , you tended to have a better chance of getting through Auschwitz — all other things considered , of course . ”
Post noted that Frankl ’s research was largely anecdotal .
More recent empirical research has suggested that being compassionate can benefit people with addictions .
One of his colleagues at Case Western Reserve University , Dr. Maria Pagano , was the lead author of a study of alcoholics who had stopped drinking .
Those who helped other alcoholics in the year following treatment showed a lower relapse rate .
Post explained that the 12th step in the Alcoholics Anonymous program is to sponsor someone else with the addiction .
Those who followed through on that had a recovery rate of 40 percent over the next year .
“ If you do everything else but the 12th step , your recovery rate is 22 percent , ” he said .
“ So by helping someone else , people who have problems with alcoholism double their recovery rate in a one - year period .
This suggests that we can , in fact , find practical ways clinically to encourage this kind of behaviour , and in certain instances it may actually be helpful . ”
Another study in the 1980s by Harvard psychologist David McClelland demonstrated that compassion can have an impact on a person ’s immune system .
Post said that McClelland divided research subjects into two groups .
One watched an emotionally neutral movie and the other group observed Mother Teresa helping poor people in Calcutta .
Post said that those who saw Mother Teresa ’s altruism on - screen turned out to have “ markedly higher levels ” of immunoglobulin A in their saliva .
This suggested that people who watched someone being compassionate had somehow boosted their immune response .
Post said that McClelland took the study a step further .
He asked half of the experimental group to close their eyes and meditate and visualize others doing compassionate deeds .
“ They maintained that elevated immune system , whereas those who did n’t go through that kind of imaginative exercise went back down to baseline , ” Post said .
Post , who gave a lecture at Harvard last January on happiness , said that about 20 percent of the students at the Ivy League university have reported that they suffer from depression .
He said that there is ample evidence that being compassionate and altruistic can help alleviate this condition .
Near the start of his book , Post describes four domains of love : family , which he calls the inner sphere ; friendships , which form the second sphere of love ; community , which creates a web that sustains people ; and , finally , humanity , which encompasses everyone from the person on the street selling carnations to those who live on the other side of the planet .
Post noted that many people are “ rightly ambivalent about religion ” because it can bring out both the best and the worst in people .
“ Religion at its best teaches love for a shared or common humanity , ” he said , “ but what happens is sometimes it allows people to focus on some fragment of humanity and then it becomes us versus them . ”
His book also describes 10 ways to provide love : celebration , generativity ( nurturing others in deep and lasting ways ) , forgiveness , courage , humour , respect , compassion , loyalty , listening , and through creativity .
Post and a colleague , University of Miami associate professor of psychology Michael McCullough , even developed a Love and Longevity Scale , which enables people to calculate their score .
It is possible to assess your progress and make improvements .
It could even improve your health .
According to Post , being a generous person significantly reduces mortality later in life .
It also reduces depression and suicide in adolescents , according to research financed by the Institute for Research on Unlimited Love .
Perhaps not surprisingly , there has been a backlash against the happiness movement .
Eric Wilson , an English professor at Wake Forest University , recently wrote a book called Against Happiness ( Douglas & McIntyre ) , which is a defence of melancholia , citing it as the muse for great works of art .
“ Most hide behind the smile because they are afraid of facing the world ’s complexity , its vagueness , its terrible beauties , ” Wilson writes .
Post , however , cites the work of Canadian Jean Vanier as evidence that being compassionate not only offers benefits to society but can enhance your own personality and leave you feeling better .
Vanier , the 79 - year - old founder of L’Arche communities for the mentally disabled , was ranked 12th in a CBC survey identifying the greatest Canadians who ever lived .
Post said that Vanier is humble , attentive , and hears people very well .
Post attributed this to what Vanier learned in his years of trying to make people with severe cognitive disabilities feel significant .
Post also said that he considers Vanier a friend and an inspiration , as well as a modern - day saint .
“ He is a guy who , in my opinion , deserves the Nobel Prize , ” Post said .
“ I owe it all to my mother and to people like Jean Vanier and to a few dozen others in life who really inspired me . ”
The Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education presents an evening with Stephen Post at the Ridge Theatre on Friday ( May 2 ) .
He will sign books at 6 p.m. and present a lecture at 7 p.m. Tickets are available at Banyen Books for $ 15 .
Obama talks cap - gains rate with CNBC
In an interview in conjunction with his big economic speech in New York , Senator Obama tells CNBC ’s Maria Bartiromo he favors increasing the capital - gains tax rate .
Bartiromo reported after her interview : “ Right now , as you know , the cap gains tax is at 15 percent .
He has yet to give us a specific number .
How high he wants that number to go ?
He has said , and he told me today , that he wo n't go above 28 percent .
So we are talking about the possibility of a doubling in the capital gains tax .
He was averaging at about 25 percent . ”
Here is her exchange with the senator :
BARTIROMO : " How do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains ?
How high will that 15 percent rate go ? "
Sen. OBAMA : " Well , you know , I have n't given a firm number .
Here 's my belief , that we can't go back to some of the , you know , confiscatory rates that existed in the past that distorted sound economics .
And I certainly would not go above what existed under Bill Clinton , which was the 28 percent .
I would -- and my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that .
I think that we can have a capital gains rate that is higher than 15 percent .
If it -- and if it , you know -- when I talk to people like Warren Buffet or others and I ask them , you know , what 's -- how much of a difference is it going to be if it 's 20 or 25 percent , they say , look , if it 's within that range then it's not going to distort , I think , economic decision making .
On the other hand , what it will also do is first of all help out the federal treasury , which is running a credit card up with the bank of China and other countries .
What it will also do , I think , is allow us to make investments in basic scientific research , in infrastructure , in broadband lines , in green energy and will allow us to give us -- give some relief to middle class and working class families who have been driving this economy as consumers but have been doing it through credit cards and home equity loans .
They 're not going to be able to do that .
And if we want the economy to continue to go strong , then we 've got to make sure that they 're getting a little relief as well . "
ENTIRE INTERVIEW AFTER THE JUMP
FIRST ON CNBC INTERVIEW : CNBC TRANSCRIPT : CNBC'S MARIA BARTIROMO SPEAKS WITH SENATOR BARACK OBAMA TODAY ON CNBC'S " CLOSING BELL "
WHEN : TODAY , MARCH 27TH AT 3PM -5 PM ET
WHERE : CNBC'S " CLOSING BELL "
MARIA BARTIROMO , host : Senator , thank you for joining us .
Senator BARACK OBAMA : Thank you so much for having me .
BARTIROMO : Nearly seven months before Election Day , we 've got foreclosures on the rise ...
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
BARTIROMO : ... we 've got financial assets shrinking , gasoline above $ 3 a gallon .
Detail for us your economic plan to take us higher .
Sen . OBAMA : Yeah .
Well , it 's going to start with dealing with the immediate crisis , both in the financial markets and in the housing market .
And obviously , those things are connected .
On the housing market , to prevent foreclosures , I think it is important for us to create some bottom , some floor , give people some sense of where does this end .
And so I am a strong proponent of the proposal that Chris Dodd and Barney Frank have put forward , having the FHA step in to help stabilize the market .
It 's not a bailout for borrowers or lenders , but what it says is we will rework some of these loan packages so that they 're affordable .
And , you know , everybody 's going to have to take a haircut , the borrowers and the lenders , but it wo n't be as bad as if a foreclosure took place .
So that 'd be step number one .
Step number two , I think to stabilize and provide confidence in the financial markets it is appropriate for the Fed to take some of the actions that it has .
But I think it is also important to make sure that we 've coupled that with some new regulatory structures .
If the Fed is going to be a lender of last resort to investment banks , then it is , I think , legitimate to make sure that those banks are subject to some sort of requirements , both in terms of liquidity and capital , to assure that we 're not seeing excessive risks taken so that they get all the upside and the Fed gets all the downside .
So that would be , I think , a second important step .
And then the third thing that I think is important for us to do is to understand that the economy long term has been out of balance for quite some time , even before this current crisis .
I mean , we had high corporate profits , enormous rises in productivity over the last decade but wages and incomes have flatlined .
And so you had a lot of concentrated wealth at the top , but ordinary folks were getting hammered with rising gas prices , rising costs of health care , rising costs of college tuition .
And so creating a tax code that is more equitable and making sure that we 're making investments in things like infrastructure and clean energy that can put us on a more stable long - term competitive footing , I think that has to be part of the package as well .
BARTIROMO : I want to ask you about the mortgage plan .
Sen . OBAMA : Sure .
BARTIROMO : But since you ended with taxes , let me pick up right there , for investors .
Sen . OBAMA : Yeah .
BARTIROMO : How do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains ?
How high will that 15 percent rate go ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , you know , I have n't given a firm number .
Here 's my belief , that we can't go back to some of the , you know , confiscatory rates that existed in the past that distorted sound economics .
And I certainly would not go above what existed under Bill Clinton , which was the 28 percent .
I would -- and my guess would be it would be significantly lower than that .
I think that we can have a capital gains rate that is higher than 15 percent .
If it -- and if it , you know -- when I talk to people like Warren Buffet or others and I ask them , you know , what 's -- how much of a difference is it going to be if it 's 20 or 25 percent , they say , look , if it 's within that range then it's not going to distort , I think , economic decision making .
On the other hand , what it will also do is first of all help out the federal treasury , which is running a credit card up with the bank of China and other countries .
What it will also do , I think , is allow us to make investments in basic scientific research , in infrastructure , in broadband lines , in green energy and will allow us to give us -- give some relief to middle class and working class families who have been driving this economy as consumers but have been doing it through credit cards and home equity loans .
They 're not going to be able to do that .
And if we want the economy to continue to go strong , then we 've got to make sure that they 're getting a little relief as well .
BARTIROMO : But it 's not just the Warren Buffets of the world who own stocks , so ...
Sen .
OBAMA : Of course not .
BARTIROMO : ... let 's hypothetically say that ...
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
BARTIROMO : ... cap gains tax goes from 15 percent to 25 percent .
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
BARTIROMO : You 're impacting a lot of people .
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
BARTIROMO : A hundred million Americans own stocks today .
Sen . OBAMA : Absolutely .
BARTIROMO :
So it 's not just the rich .
Sen .
OBAMA : No , no , no , absolutely .
And that 's why I think that it may be , for example , that you could structure something in which people with certain incomes were exempted from this increase and it would stay at 15 .
The broader principle that I 'm interested in is just making sure that we 've got a tax code that is fair for all Americans .
And I think it is not unreasonable to say - - you know , I know that we 'll get some arguments from some folks on this , but it 's not unreasonable to say that those of us in the upper brackets have benefited disproportionately from a globalized economy ; that those benefits have been compounded by the Bush tax cuts and that for us to roll back some of those tax cuts and to put this economy on a more stable fiscal footing and to make investments in the American people so that they can afford a decent life , that that is actually good long term for our economy and also good for investors and Wall Street .
BARTIROMO : So what about the top marginal rate for ordinary income ?
Who ought to pay more and who should pay less ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , you know , what I 've said is that we should go back to probably a top marginal rate of 39 percent what it was before the Bush tax cuts .
So I would roll back those Bush tax cuts , I would not increase taxes for middle class Americans and in fact I want to provide a tax cut for people who are making $ 75,000 a year or less .
For those folks , I want an offset on the payroll tax that would be worth as much as $ 1,000 for a family .
Senior citizens who are bringing in less than $ 50,000 a year in income , I do n't want them to have to pay income tax on their Social Security .
And as part of my overall approach to housing , I actually want to provide an additional 10 percent mortgage deduction , a credit , mortgage interest credit , for those who currently do n't itemize .
Because if you live in a house that 's pretty expensive , like I do , and I itemize , I get a pretty big break from Uncle Sam .
If you own a $ 100,000 house and you 're making 65 , $ 75,000 a year , you 're not getting that same deduction .
I think that they deserve a break as well .
That will actually help relieve some of the pressure on homeowners .
BARTIROMO : But can you really look at this sort of like an umbrella standpoint ?
I mean , we are in very , very unique times right now .
Sen . OBAMA : Yes .
BARTIROMO :
Why raise taxes at all in an economic slowdown ?
Is n't that going to put a further strain on people ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , look , there 's no doubt that anything I do is going to be premised on what the economic situation is when I take office .
I 'm going to be sworn in in January , we do n't know what the economy 's going to look like at that point .
And , you know , the thing you can -- you can be assured of is that I 'm not going to making these decisions based on ideology .
I 'm not a dogmatist .
I know that some , you know , my opponents to the right would like to paint me as this wooly - eyed , you know , liberal or wild - eyed ...
BARTIROMO : You 're not a liberal ?
Sen .
OBAMA : The -- but my attitude is that I believe in the market , I believe in entrepreneurship , I believe in opportunity , I believe in capitalism and I want to do what works .
But what I want to make sure of is it works for all America and not just a small sliver of America .
And if it turns out -- if somebody can make a persuasive argument to me that , you know what , what we need at this juncture , at this particular point in time is a different set of policies than some of the ones that I 've proposed , I 'm always going to listen to people .
Because I think one of the problems , in fact , with the Bush administration has been its rigidness when it comes to economic policy .
I mean , you ask them any question , they 'll say tax cuts .
It does n't matter what the problem is , if it 's , you know , our trade deficit : tax cuts .
If it 's , you know , slowdown in manufacturing : tax cuts .
You know , at a certain point , you know , if you 've only got one arrow in the quiver , then you 're going to have problems .
BARTIROMO : Let me move on from taxes .
I do n't want to spend all the time there .
Let 's talk about small business .
This is the one area of the economy that really is creating jobs , small business .
Sen . OBAMA : Yes , absolutely .
BARTIROMO :
You want to index the minimum wage to inflation , we 'll see the minimum wage go up every year .
You are looking to strengthen the unions .
Basically , making costs go up for small business .
Why put a further strain of expenses , higher expenses , on the one place in the economy that 's actually creating jobs ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , actually , you know , that 's not entirely true .
It is true that I think that having the minimum wage go up every 10 years is a bad idea and it's not good for small businesses , because they get socked with sudden jumps as opposed to something more gradual that they can build into their cost structures .
It is true that I think that unions are a useful thing .
But generally that 's not affecting the average small business , that is typically much more targeted at large companies who , again , wages and incomes have not gone up for the average worker over the last seven years .
There 's a reason for that , and that 's a problem .
I actually want to provide more tax breaks to small businesses , because I think they are the primary generator of income .
And one of the areas that I want to help small businesses on is their health care costs , which are crushing them .
And if you talk to a lot of small business owners , not only are they having problems if they provide health care to their employees , but they 're also having problems paying health care for themselves .
And if we can provide them significant relief there , then I think that there are going to be a whole bunch of small businesses who are going to be much more successful in building their businesses and expanding it over time .
BARTIROMO :
But you say that , but we 've had small businesses on , they 're terrified .
They feel that their costs are about to soar .
Sen. OBAMA : I know .
Small businesses often get terrified because people ramp up .
The chambers of commerce , anytime you talk about the minimum wage , the sky is falling .
The sky does n't fall .
And as I said , the -- what is important is making sure that this happens over a gradual period of time .
Instead of us lurching back and forth , what I want to do is to create a climate for sustained economic growth .
Small businesses are going to be the heart of that , and that 's why we 're going to give a large amount of support to small businesses in the form of tax breaks for investment and in making sure that their health care costs are dealt with .
BARTIROMO : Let 's talk about spending .
You 've got a $ 400 - plus billion deficit .
How do you plan to pay for the new health , education , you mentioned green technology , social programs ...
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
BARTIROMO : ... in the middle of a recession ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , I tell you what ...
BARTIROMO : Away from tax cuts ?
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
The two points I would make .
Number one , as I said , I 'm going to have to take a look at what revenues are coming in when I take office because , you know , I 'm not ideological and I think it is very important for us to stick to a principle of pay as you go .
If I 'm going to cut taxes for the middle class , as I 've proposed , that means that I 've got to either end some tax breaks elsewhere or cut spending .
And if I want to increase spending , then I 've got to find offsetting revenues or cut programs that are n't working .
That 's a principle that I believe in strongly and I will run on and implement when I 'm president .
What 's interesting , though , is The Wall Street Journal , I think -- actually a columnist looked , in The Wall Street Journal , at does Obama 's policies in fact add up ?
Do the numbers add up ?
And the conclusion was , yes .
Because not only have I called for an end to the war in Iraq , which would not provide all the money that 's being spent there -- some of that 's going to have to go to resetting our military , dealing with veterans and so forth -- but there will be some money that we can use for other things .
Number two is the rollback of the Bush tax cuts on the top 1 and 2 percent .
That will in fact create additional revenue .
And the third thing is the cap and trade system that I 've proposed to deal with climate change and to increase energy independence .
That potentially generates billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar , wind , biodiesel , creating jobs here in America that can't be exported .
And so when you tally it all up , all my proposals pay for themselves .
Now , as I said before , it could be that revenues are so short in a year 's time that we 've got to make some assessments .
And I am not going to initiate programs that can't be paid for .
BARTIROMO :
So name three spending programs you would cut to balance the budget .
Sen .
OBAMA : Oh , you know , there are probably some weapons programs that I think are not serving our national security interests that need to be examined , and we 've got to do an audit there .
There are reforms that need to be made in our purchasing processes , where -- simple things , you know .
If we actually made sure that every government employee had a single , you know , debit card or credit card , then negotiated with large purchasers to get the discounts that any other large purchaser would get , we could lop off 10 percent of some of our major purchases by the federal government .
Our travel allowances and expenses are a major problem .
We could save several billion dollars just in how we set up government travel .
So there are a whole bunch of areas where we can make some significant savings .
I will tell you , though , that historically when -- you know , the fact is that the federal government primarily spends its money on Social Security , on Medicare and Medicaid , and on defense .
And that 's the bulk of our spending .
The biggest thing we 've got to do is get control of our health care spending , and that 's why the health care plan that I 've proposed , although costing some money in the front end -- we 've got to help rural hospitals invest in , you know , health IT .
We 've got to make sure that we are bringing people into coverage so that they 're not going to the emergency room .
Short term , that will cost us some money .
Long term , the more we emphasize prevention , the less likely we are to pay huge bills down the road .
That 's the only way we 're going to get control of health care inflation .
And if you talk to any executive , as well as any actuary who 's looking at government spending , our biggest crisis looming in the horizon has to do with our health care costs .
And the only way to really solve it long term is to make sure that we are making for a healthier America and improving the quality of care so that we get more bang for our health care dollar .
BARTIROMO : How about trade ?
You 've made the point that you want to improve relations around the world ...
Sen . OBAMA : Yes .
BARTIROMO : ... and yet you want to renegotiate NAFTA , you are not in favor of some other trade policies .
Sen .
OBAMA : But I 'm in favor of some .
BARTIROMO : OK .
Sen . OBAMA : Yeah .
BARTIROMO :
Tell me about the trade policies that you 'd like to look at ...
Sen . OBAMA : Yeah .
BARTIROMO : ... and particularly NAFTA , renegotiating that .
Sen . OBAMA : Yeah .
BARTIROMO :
Why potentially impact the one area of the economy that 's actually doing very well , exports and trading , and opening up markets for American companies ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , look , I believe in trade and I 've said it repeatedly .
And , you know , I have voted for trade agreements .
I voted for the Peru Trade Agreement , much to the chagrin or some people who objected about it .
I voted for the Oman trade deal .
It is true that I voted against CAFTA and I voted -- and I am concerned about NAFTA because they do n't have the environmental and labor protections written into this legislation that ensure some basic standards , make sure that child labor laws are n't being circumvented , making sure that you do n't have forced labor .
I think it is important in our dealings with China to make sure that we are tougher bargainers .
My problem with our trade agreements right now is not that I feel we can't compete in the global economy .
I think we 've got the best workers on earth .
I think the problem is is that we 're not very good bargainers .
We - - our trade mentality dates back to the '60s and the early ' 70s when we were so dominant in the world economy that basically if people sent their goods into this country without reciprocity , it was n't really going to have a dent on our economy .
Well , the fact is China , Brazil , Korea , you know , they 're not your dad 's China , Brazil or Korea .
They are now major competitors of ours .
We should want real trade with them , but it 's got to be on a reciprocal basis .
And we should put some pressure on them to improve how they treat workers , to deal with issues of environmental standards , to deal with safety standards .
And part of the problem that we 've got right now in our trade agreements is that US companies may move over there , get out from under basic safety standards that are important to US consumers , then the goods get shipped back into the United States and suddenly we 've got toys with lead paint on them .
That is not good for US consumers and I do n't think it 's good for business long term .
But , you know , one notion I want to dispel is the notion that somehow I 'm opposed to free trade .
I think it is important for us to have a trade regime .
And I think it 's good that China and India are growing .
Ultimately they may be markets of ours and , you know what , there 's just a human element to wanting to see billions of people scratch their way out of poverty .
That is in our long - term interest .
BARTIROMO : What happens if the Mexicans and Canadians say , ` We do n't want to renegotiate . '
Do we go back to the policy in place before NAFTA ?
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , I think that , you know , let me have those conversations with the president and the prime minister and see if we can negotiate something that makes sense for all sides .
I mean , keep in mind , Mexico has some of these similar problems , you know , some of the promises that were made about the improvements in the standard of living for Mexico .
Workers have not been borne out as a consequence of NAFTA .
Part of the problem we 're having with immigration right now has to do with a much more efficient US agricultural and agrobusiness operations going into Mexico and decimating Mexican farmers .
They have been displaced first to Mexico City and other urban areas , and increasingly they come into the United States .
And so , again , the principle that I have in general when it comes to economic policies : a belief in free markets , a belief in opportunity , a belief in trade , but wanting to make sure that in all these areas that somebody 's thinking about the little guy ; that somebody is making sure that the economy is working for everybody and not just some people .
And that , I think , is a basic difference between myself and George Bush and increasingly , it appears , John McCain , as well .
BARTIROMO :
But you want to put pressure on the companies and the people that are actually creating jobs , during a recession .
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , you know , I think part of my argument is part of the reason we 're in a recession is because we have an unbalanced economy .
Look , you know , Henry Ford was the first one to say , ` If I do n't pay my workers enough to buy my cars , my business is n't going to be around for a long time . '
Part of the genius of America has always been that we have a shared prosperity and a broad - based middle class , and that we make investments in roads and bridges and other infrastructure that allows the market to work efficiently .
And we 've got a regulatory system so that investors can trust the market and do n't feel like insiders are going to be taking advantage of them .
That 's what makes the market run .
And when we lose that balance , what ends up happening is in the short term you 've got some people who make out like bandits .
And the only reason that we have n't seen some of these problems in the US economy previously is because consumers had been driving this , even though their wages and incomes have n't been going up , because they 've been able to use their credit cards and home equity lines as an ATM .
That 's gone away .
And so the question now is who 's going to drive the economy , if not consumers ?
And the only way that we can make sure that consumers are able to drive that economy is if in fact they 've got some money in their pockets .
And right now they do n't , because they are getting squeezed hard .
BARTIROMO : Final question , Senator .
Sen . OBAMA : Yeah .
BARTIROMO :
And this is just in the news right now , away from business , the church bulletins .
A lot of people say that they were -- are anti-Semitic , anti-American .
How often did you read them ?
Did you find them troubling ?
Sen .
OBAMA : You know , the - - you know , I 've , I think , talked thoroughly about , you know , the issue with Reverend Wright .
And , you know , everybody , I think , who examines the church that I attend knows that it is a very traditional , conventional church .
Reverend Wright has made some , you know , troubling statements and some appalling statements that I have condemned .
He 's the former pastor of that church .
And I think that -- and when I travel around the country , what people are really interested is making sure that , if I 'm going to be the next president , that I can actually help them stay in their homes , get a job , send their kids to college .
That 's something that 's shared by people across races , religions .
And part of what I hope to do in this campaign and as president is to get us beyond these divisions that distract us from our common challenges and our common opportunities and move the country forward .
BARTIROMO : Senator , would you like to add anything else ?
Sen. OBAMA : I had a wonderful time .
I hope I get a chance to talk to you again .
BARTIROMO : Do you think that the Fed made the right move in terms of bailing out the financial system ?
Final question .
A final -- you know , I 'm just trying to do it on BusinessWeek - - I promise you , I promise you .
I 'm doing a piece for BusinessWeek on you for Friday and I 'm trying to do both CNBC and BusinessWeek .
Sen . OBAMA : Right .
BARTIROMO :
That 's why , I 've tried to do both .
Sen .
OBAMA : Well , now that -- now this is going to be really good story , because she got at least five final questions .
Absolutely .
BARTIROMO : ( Unintelligible ) .
No pressure , no pressure .
Sen .
OBAMA : No , no , no , I do n't mind .
The -- no , no .
Look , the -- I think that -- you know , I was n't privy to Bear Stearns ' balance sheets .
I think there 's no doubt that we want the Fed stepping in in emergencies , and no other government agency could step in sufficiently , quickly to prevent what could have been a domino effect .
But the one , you know , basic principle that I think is important is that if the Fed is going to be a lender of last resort to investment banks , then they 're going to have to be subject to some of the same regulatory requirements that commercial banks are subject to .
And I think Henry Paulson admitted as much in some of his statements yesterday .
And I know that the Senate Banking and Finance Committees are going to be examining the nature of this transaction to make sure that it was fair to all parties involved .
BARTIROMO : Thank you so much , Senator .
Sen .
OBAMA : All right .
Thank you .
BARTIROMO : Good to see you .
Sen .
OBAMA : All right .

This undated photo released by Obama for America shows Barack Obama and his father .
Long - lost article by Obama 's dad surfaces
Barack Obama ’s dad was such an important but absent figure in his life that he devoted his first book , “ Dreams From My Father , ” to the search for details about his father ’s life and how the quest helped forge a son ’s identity .
Now , a long - forgotten essay written 43 years ago by Obama ’s father has surfaced , and its contents reveal much — not only about the senior Obama ’s grasp of economic theory but also about the iconoclastic politics that , his son would later write , sent him into the spiral of career disappointment that concluded with his death in 1982 in his native Kenya .
Advertisement
Parts of the article , titled “ Problems Facing Our Socialism , ” have been making the rounds on several small blogs over the past week , but Politico.com is now , for the first time , reproducing the entire piece in its original form .
The scholarly eight - page paper , credited to “ Barak H. Obama , ” is never mentioned in “ Dreams From My Father , ” nor has the candidate discussed it in any of his many public speeches .
( Politico brought the article to his campaign ’s attention late last week , but aides did not respond to a request for comment from Obama . )
The paper ’s substance , though , offers insight into the mind and the political trajectory of a man described by his son largely through his emotional life , his family and his traditions .
Published in the esoteric East Africa Journal in 1965 , the year after Kenyan President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta took power and the country declared independence from British rule , the paper takes a gently mocking tone to the Kenyatta government ’s key , controversial statement of economic policy , titled “ African Socialism and Its Applicability to Planning in Kenya . ”
Obama senior ’s journal article repeatedly asks what the Kenyan government means by “ African Socialism , ” as distinct from Soviet - style communism , and concludes that the new phrase does n’t mean much .
Elements of Obama ’s argument now seem prescient , others deeply dated , but his central aim — particularly in the context of the heady early days of African independence — was moderate and conciliatory .
“ The question is how are we going to remove the disparities in our country , such as the concentration of economic power in Asian and European hands , while not destroying what has already been achieved and at the same time assimilating these groups to build one country , ” Obama senior wrote .
When he wrote the paper , he was in Nairobi and working on a never - completed Harvard doctoral dissertation , according to his brief biography in the journal .
Two years earlier , he had divorced his wife , who was raising his son in Hawaii .
But even back in Nairobi , the elder Obama felt free to mock the Kenyan government .
“ Maybe it is better to have something perfunctorily done than none at all ! ” he concluded .
That ’s the attitude , his son would later find , that took him from a career in the Kenyan governing class to “ a small job at the Water Department ” and then to unemployment and alcohol .
Obama senior , who returned to Kenya after his Harvard years , soon became a public critic of Kenyatta ’s growing favoritism toward the Kikuyu tribe , over Obama ’s Luos .
“ Word got back to Kenyatta that the Old Man was a troublemaker , and he was called in to see the president .
According to the stories , Kenyatta said to the Old Man that because he could not keep his mouth shut , he would not work again until he had no shoes on his feet , ” Obama quoted his half - sister as telling him .
Obama wrote that his father was rehabilitated after Kenyatta ’s death in 1978 but was by then broken and embittered .
Obama senior ’s 1965 paper , however , brims with confidence and optimism .
The article , with a loaded term in the title and a casual discussion of socialism , communism and nationalization , has raised the hackles of some anti-Obama conservatives who have been discussing it online .
Greg Ransom , a blogger who unearthed the journal at the University of California , Los Angeles , library , calls the article “ the Rosebud ” that provides the missing key to Obama ’s memoir .
Ransom wrote about the article ’s contents recently in a posting with the provocative headline “ Obama Hid His Father ’s Socialist and Anti-Western Convictions From His Readers . ”
But Kenya expert Raymond Omwami , an economist and UCLA visiting professor from the University of Helsinki who has also worked at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , said Obama senior could not be considered a socialist himself based solely on the material in his bylined piece .
Omwami points out that the elder Obama ’s paper was primarily a harsh critique of the controversial 1965 government document known as Sessional Paper No. 10 .
Sessional Paper No. 10 rejected classic Karl Marx philosophies then embraced by the Soviet Union and some European countries , calling instead for a new type of socialism to be used specifically in Africa .
The government paper rejected materialism ( i.e. , “ conspicuous consumerism ” ) , outlined the nation ’s goals to eradicate poverty , illiteracy and disease , and also laid out important decrees regarding land use for economic development .
Obama senior ’s response covers these issues , frequently focusing on the distribution of real estate to farmers .
Since most Kenyans could not afford farmland in line with market forces established earlier by white British farmers , the elder Obama argued that strong development planning should better define common farming space to maximize productivity and should defer to tribal traditions instead of hastening individual land ownership .
In other words , Obama senior ’s paper was not a cry for acceptance of radical politics but was instead a critique of a government policy by Kenya ’s Ministry of Economic Planning and Development , which applied African socialism principles to the country ’s ongoing political upheaval .
“ The critics of this article are making a big mistake , ” says Omwami , who at Politico ’s request read the document and the associated Internet debate over the weekend .
“ They are assuming Obama senior is the one who came up with this concept of African socialism , but that ’s totally wrong .
Based on that , they ’re imbuing in him the idea that he himself is a socialist , but he is not . ”
Omwami says he would instead refer to the elder Obama as “ a liberal person who believed in market forces but understood its limitations . ”
Sessional Paper No. 10 centered on the new control of Kenya ’s resources , promoting a form of trickle - down economics in which financial aid would be consolidated in more populated areas with the hope that positive effects would eventually be felt by smaller villages .
Obama senior argued against this notion , and Omwami suggests history has proven him correct since most , if not all , small communities in Kenya have yet to benefit from monies that poured into larger cities since the nation ’s independence four decades ago .
The elder Obama also looked ahead to what has become a shaping force across Africa — urbanization — arguing that the government ’s efforts to lure citizens back to the land were futile .
“ If these people come out in search of work , it is because they cannot make a living out of whatever land they have had , ” he wrote .
In retrospect , it was one of several warnings in the paper that would prove true .
“ If you understand the Kenyan context , you can clearly see in that paper that Obama senior was quite a sharp mind , ” Omwami concluded .
“ He addresses economic growth and other areas of development , and his critique is that policymakers in Kenya were overemphasizing economic growth .
“ We had high economic growth for years but never solved the problems of poverty , unemployment and unequal income distribution .
And those problems are still there . ”
Obama senior ’s projections and critiques are so spot on , says Omwami , that he plans to assign the paper to his classes in the future .
Welcome to the end of African - American support for the Democratic party .
From the NYT :
Mr. Clyburn added that there appeared to be an almost “ unanimous ” view among African - Americans that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton were “ committed to doing everything they possibly can to damage Obama to a point that he could never win . ”
Clyburn is the 3rd ranked Democrat in the US House .
He says a lot of blacks think Hillary is trying to destroy Obama ’s chances in 2008 , she ’s trying to make him lose this year in the general election , so that she can run again in 2012 .
I ’ve been wondering for a while if the SuperDelegates ’ fear of taking a stand is greater than their fear of Hillary forcing blacks to leave the Democratic party .
This article is scary as hell .
It means the black community is starting to see something larger , more nefarious , in what Hillary is doing .
As well it should .
Hillary has demonized the black church and black pastors , and her surrogates never miss a chance to remind people that Obama is b - l - a - c-k .
And now we ’re seeing that her race - baiting is n’t going unnoticed among African - Americans .
Again from the NYT :
In an interview with The New York Times late Thursday , Mr. Clyburn said Mr. Clinton ’s conduct in this campaign had caused what might be an irreparable breach between Mr. Clinton and an African - American constituency that once revered him .
“ When he was going through his impeachment problems , it was the black community that bellied up to the bar , ” Mr. Clyburn said .
“ I think black folks feel strongly that that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation . ”
And let ’s not fool ourselves .
This is only a smattering of the ( rightful ) anger we ’re going to see if the SuperDelegates decide to join leagues with the Clintons , overrule the people , and steal the nomination from Obama , the candidate who just so happens to be black .
Kiss the black vote goodbye for a very long time .
It ’s funny , you know .
The GOP has been trying to steal the black vote away from the Democrats for years .
And Hillary and Bill are on the verge of accomplishing it in – what ?
– only four months ?
They really are good .
MacRumors reader IntrinsicMac has noticed from teardown photos of Apple 's Time Capsule that Apple is not using " server - class " hard drives as advertised , but rather Hitachi Deskstar drives which are typically considered consumer - grade .
When introduced , Apple described the 500 or 1 TB drive being used within Time Capsule as " server grade " , and indeed continues to tout it as such today on its website .
Time Capsule is your one place for backing up everything .
Its massive 500GB or 1TB server - grade hard drive gives you all the capacity and safety you need .
So whether you have 250 songs or 250,000 songs to back up , room is the last thing youll run out of .
And considering all that storage and protection come packaged in a high - speed Wi-Fi base station starting at $ 299 , data isnt the only thing youre saving .
While it is unclear what practical impact the use of consumer drives will have on users , the advertising discrepancy has been alarming to some users .
Update : According to TidBITS , Apple has clarified that their assertion of " server - grade " is related to mean time between failure .
Chulani clarified that the " server - grade " drives in a Time Capsule are the same 7200 rpm drives used for Apple 's Xserve servers , and that they have a higher mean time between failure ( MTBF ) rating than consumer drives .
The MTBF for server - grade drives is often 1 million hours ( 114 years ) , which is a measure of probability ; in this case , that out of a set of drives with similar properties , an extremely high percentage will still be fully functional after several years .
The alleged rape of a young girl has triggered protests in Japan
Under the curfew , which began early on Wednesday , troops ' movements will be restricted to allow them a " period of reflection " , a military statement said .
Thousands of US troops are based in Okinawa , Japan 's southern - most island .
Many Okinawans dislike the US presence .
The recent alleged rape of a teenager by a US marine has caused outrage .
In 1995 there were mass protests in Okinawa after US troops gang - raped a 12 - year - old girl - an incident which raised concerns for the future of the US - Japan security alliance .
Both US and Japanese officials are working to prevent a similar outpouring of anger , analysts say .
' Reflection '
The order for the curfew - which is indefinite and also applies to troops ' relatives - came from the top US commander in Okinawa , Lt - Gen Richard Zilmer .
" Active duty service members on Okinawa will be limited to their place of duty or employment , worship , education , or medical or dental treatment " as they enter a " period of reflection " , a military statement said .
The restrictions would give troops " an opportunity to further review procedures and orders that govern the discipline and conduct of all US service members serving in Okinawa " , it said .
In a separate announcement , the US military said that troops across Japan would hold a " day of reflection " on Friday over the recent incidents .
Last week , US Marine Staff Sgt Tyrone Hadnott was arrested for allegedly raping a 14 - year - old girl in his car .
He admits forcibly kissing her but denies rape .
Over the weekend , two more US troops were arrested for drink - driving and trespassing - causing Japan 's top government spokesman to accuse the US military of a lack of discipline .
" I only have one thing to express and that is our true anger , " Nobutaka Machimura said .
" We demand serious self - reflection . "
Japanese leaders would raise the issue with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice when she visited the country next week , he said .
US Ambassador Thomas Schieffer flew to Okinawa last week to express his concern over the alleged rape .
About 20,000 US troops - half of the US presence in Japan - are stationed in Okinawa as part of the decades old US - Japan security alliance .
The bases are strategically very significant because of their proximity to the Taiwan Strait .
Local residents complain of crime linked to the military presence , as well as noise and disruption caused by the bases - but local leaders say the bases are vital to the island 's economy .
Please do n't shoot the messenger .
According to Infosecurity Europe , 10 % of men -- but 45 % of women -- were willing to give personally identifiable information to a complete stranger when approached outside Liverpool Street Station in London .
But , wait , it gets worse :
The fake researchers asking for the information were offering chocolate bars as an incentive to participate .
The press release is dated April 16 , so I 'm thinking it 's unlikely to be an April Fools joke .
There was some good news , however :
This year 's survey results were significantly better than previous years .
In 2007 64 % of people were prepared to give away their passwords for a chocolate bar , this year it had dropped to just 21 % so at last the message is getting through to be more infosecurity savvy .
The researchers also asked the office workers for their dates of birth to validate that they had carried out the survey ; here the workers were very naïve with 61 % revealing their date of birth .
Another slightly worrying fact discovered by researchers is that over half of people questioned use the same password for everything ( e.g. work , banking , web , etc. )
I know what you 're thinking :
No surprise there .
Nor here .
Workers were also queried about their use of passwords at work , half said that they knew their colleagues passwords and when asked if they would give their passwords to someone who phoned and said they were from the IT department , 58 % said they would .
Researchers also asked workers if they thought other people in their company knew their CEO 's password .
Thirty - five percent of them thought that someone else did with personal assistants and IT staff being the most likely suspects .
This type of ruse has been perpetrated before , of course , as in this example featuring the Internal Revenue Service ( bet they 're both distracted and vulnerable this week ) .
Nevertheless , it 's always striking to see exactly how much additional work needs to be done before the average Joe and Josephine will become more guarded about this stuff .
WASHINGTON  The Defense Department is conducting an extensive review of the videotaping of interrogations at military facilities from Iraq to Guantánamo Bay , and so far it has identified nearly 50 tapes , including one that showed what a military spokesman described as the forcible gagging of a terrorism suspect .
The Pentagon review was begun in late January after the Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged that it had destroyed its own videotapes of harsh interrogations conducted by C.I.A. officers , an action that is now the subject of criminal and Congressional investigations .
The review was intended in part to establish clearer rules for any videotaping of interrogations , Defense officials said .
But they acknowledged that it had been complicated by inconsistent taping practices in the past , as well as uncertain policies for when tapes could be destroyed or must be preserved .
The officials said it appeared that only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of interrogations worldwide since 2001 had been recorded .
The High Cost of Trendy Living : A Slight Variation on the Obvious Explanation By Bryan Caplan
In The Logic of Life , Tim Harford tries to figure out why rents in New York and other trendy urban locations are so high .
You might think that the rents are high because the wages are high .
But adjusting for the cost of living , urban living remains a bad deal .
Harford cites Glaeser ’s finding that “ [ E ] ach doubling of city size raises wages by 10 percent but raises prices by 16 percent . ”
So what gives ?
Harford considers , then rejects , the idea that people are primarily paying a premium for urban consumption amenities .
He estimates that it costs an extra $ 150 a day to live in Greenwich Village instead of Rock Island , IL , then tells us :
Just how often to people plan on going to the opera anyway ?
Sure , Manhattan ’s restaurant scene is better than Rock Island ’s , but if Manhattan ’s residents are really paying for access to restaurants then they are paying $ 150 to their landlord for every evening his nicely located place puts them close to a decent restaurant .
You ’d need to eat out an awful lot to make these figures seem halfway plausible .
Actually , I think these numbers are easily halfway plausible .
If you lived in Rock Island , what would you even spend your extra $ 150 / day on ?
( Here ‘s the city ’s website ) .
To overstate the point , many of us do n’t want to eat McDonald ’s in a mansion .
But more importantly , Tim misses the most important amenity of all : people .
If you ’re a trendy , successful person , the inhabitants of Anytown , USA are boring .
The typical Manhattanite would n’t want to buy a mansion in a small town in Kansas because he would be bored out of his mind .
Opera and restaurants might not be worth $ 150 / day .
But if you ’ve got a decent income , $ 150 / day is a small price to pay to not to fall asleep in your soup .
You might reply : “ You ’re forgetting that the typical resident of Rock Island would n’t want to move to Manhattan because he would be annoyed by their effete , snobby ways . ”
There ’s some truth in this .
But on net , the Manhattan premium still makes sense .
A sizable minority in places like Rock Island dreams of living someplace like Manhattan , but almost no Manhattanite dreams of living in Rock Island .
So without much higher rents , there would be a net influx into Manhattan .
In high school , many of us would sell our souls to hang out with the cool kids .
Manhattan offers the same privilege to anyone willing to pay $ 150 / day .
For millions of people , that ’s a bargain .
P.S. I much prefer Fairfax , Virginia to Manhattan .
That ’s partly because Manhattan gives me claustrophobia .
But it ’s mostly because I want to hang with the coolest kids of all .

The Elephant at Gitmo

“
Doctor , my eyes tell me what Is wrong . . .
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long ?
„ — Jackson Browne , " Doctor My Eyes "
“ I am proud to be a member of the American Psychological Association , proud for what APA has stood for in these troubling times , and deeply grateful to the Association for supporting me and my colleagues in our quest to ensure that all in our custody are treated with human decency and respect .
„ — Larry C. James , Colonel , United States Army , June 23 , 2007
“ Having custody and control over an individual is an awesome responsibility .
„ — Larry James , Colonel and Psychologist , June 23 , 2007
“ This is my second tour at Gitmo , Cuba .
I was also the first psychologist at Abu Ghraib .
I 'm going to repeat what I said earlier .
If we remove psychologists from these facilities , people are going to die .
If we remove psychologists from these facilities , people are going to get hurt .
„ — Larry James , APA National Convention , August 15 , 2007
Sounds good Colonel James .
Great sound bytes .
Good enough to convince thousands of psychologists that you 're the real thing , as American as Stealth bombers and pre-emptive war .
Who would possibly think that psychologists in the military would engage in torture after listening to you ?
Good enough that you became the poster child for the American Psychological Association as they pulled out all stops in their attempts to defeat those few psychologists opposed to torture , inhuman conditions and the disappearance of habeas corpus .
They brought you all the way from Guantanamo for their song and dance show .
Not even most psychologists , those who are supposed to understand human behavior , saw through your charade , as you convinced them that their professional association really IS on the side of truth and goodness .
The APA used you to introduce a different resolution against torture for the second year in a row , in an attempt to deflect the dissenters and detractors .
APA 's use of resolutions as a means to stop torture have proven to be simply a sleight of hand to appease the multitudes and the media , but actually signifies nothing .
Perhaps you 'll repeat history , Colonel James .
In 2006 , Surgeon General Kevin Kiley was used by APA leaders to offer the 2006 " Resolution on Torture . "
Remember him ?
He lost his job a few months after presenting THAT resolution , another military officer who was willing to overlook the inhumane treatment of people that were considered to have no value .
But you blew it this week , Colonel .
One might say you fell out of role , and the truth became evident .
Though you are in charge of the team of psychologists that assists interrogators at Guantanamo , when the Associated Press reported last week on the just - revealed Camp 7 at Guantanamo where detainees from CIA secret detention facilities are kept , including the detainees who HAVE been water - boarded , including Abu Zubaydah who endured water - boarding with two psychologists present , you stated you just do n't want to know about it .
" I learned a long , long time ago , if I 'm going to be successful in the intel community , I 'm meticulously -- in a very , very dedicated way -- going to stay in my lane , " he said .
" So if I do n't have a specific need to know about something , I do n't want to know about it .
I do n't ask about it . "
You , the military psychologist , who spoke so piously of how much you cared to protect detainees at Gitmo , who so scrupulously defended your character as patriotically humane - did n't you just sell out the fate of those detainees for the advancement of your career ?
You commanded the Guantanamo Behavioral Science Consultation Teams from January 2003 to mid-May 2003 , during a time when the International Committee of the Red Cross stated that the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo amounted to torture .
Under your command and supervision , psychologists from the military 's Survival , Evasion Resistance , and Escape ( SERE ) program were instructed to apply their expertise in abusive interrogation techniques to the interrogations of detainees in Guantanamo , according to a report from the Office of the Inspector General .
According to the Standard Operating Procedure manual at the time that you were the Chief Psychologist at Guantanamo , all incoming detainees were to be held in isolation for the first 30 days " to enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process " and were not entitled to the protections afforded by the Geneva Conventions .
So while you and the American Psychological Association continue to assert that military psychologists are necessary at Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , Bagram and other detention sites - to build rapport , to " protect " the detainees , to stop other military personnel from harming and killing the detainees - you 're telling reporters that the secret to your success is to look the other way .
What else could it mean when you say , " if I 'm going to be successful in the intel community . . .
I 'm meticulously . . . going to stay in my lane . . . I do n't want to know ? "
The fact is , for you and our professional organization , it 's all about keeping your job .
You toe the military line for your paycheck .
And the APA toes the military line to curry the favor of the Department of Defense and the current administration for contracts .
All the rest is window dressing , such as the APA 's gratuitous letter to Attorney General Mukasey this week .
The letter is a lobbyist 's masterpiece , suggesting that waterboarding is legal torture in one paragraph and then asking the AG to please hurry up and render a legal ruling in the next .
But as you seem not to be motivated by considerations of ethics , Colonel James , perhaps the potential for life in prison might have more impact .
At the Nuremberg Trials , it was held that merely following orders will not absolve you from criminal liability .
In that rare moment of truthiness , you told us that your guilty knowledge may pose inconveniences for you : " [ I ] f I do n't have a specific need to know about something , I do n't want to know about it .

Changes in Guantanamo Bay SOP manual ( 2003 - 2004 )
We all saw it .
Indeed , that was the whole point .
In the US , the networks stopped regular programming so we had little choice .
The White House wanted to make sure we caught the full dramatic impact of the US president landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln in a navy jet against a backdrop of a clear sky and the sign " Mission Accomplished " .
America the beautiful .
America the invincible .
The soundtrack to this most flamboyant and flawed of photo opportunities was similarly unequivocal .
" Major combat operations in Iraq have ended , " said President George Bush .
" The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on September 11 2001 and still goes on . "
" We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue , " wrote George Orwell in his essay In Front of Your Nose .
" And then , when we are finally proved wrong , impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right .
Intellectually , it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time : the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality , usually on a battlefield . "
And so it was , this month , that on the fifth anniversary of that stunt the White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , insisted we did not see what we thought we saw .
Indeed , we were all mistaken .
The president was n't referring to the Iraq war as such .
Instead , claimed Perino , he made all that effort and secured all that airtime to congratulate just that " particular " crew on having accomplished its " particular " 10 - month mission .
" President Bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said ' mission accomplished ' for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission , " she explained .
" And we have certainly paid a price for not being more specific on that banner . "
This kind of thing gives chutzpah a bad name .
And yet , with this administration it is a practice with which we have become all too familiar .
As median wages fall , Bush tells Americans they are better off ; as the torture continues at Guantánamo Bay - the only part of Cuba Bush actually controls - he calls on Raul Castro to honour human rights ; as he cuts taxes and starts wars , he calls on Congress to practise fiscal rectitude .
Not content with pissing on your leg and telling you it 's raining , he tries to convince you that your leg has been dry all along .
As the primary season draws to a close it has become increasingly apparent that Hillary Clinton has run her campaign with the same contempt for intelligence , decency and democracy that Bush has run the country .
Like the Bush administration , her campaign has been sustained by cynicism , divisiveness and fear - mongering , leaving a toxic and rancorous rift in its wake .
Like the White House , her aim has been to win at all costs .
And like the White House , it has produced the same result .
Failure .
It is a continuum not of policies - on that front she is closer to Barack Obama than either of them would concede - but a mindset that has served America ill these past seven years .
Creating a bespoke reality out of whole cloth and then hoping people will not just buy it , but wear it .
In a last , desperate bid to resuscitate her campaign , Clinton will put her case for the ratification of the results of the Michigan and Florida primaries to the Democratic National Committee rules and bylaws committee later this week .
Both states held their primaries in January , in defiance of Democratic party rules .
The party warned them beforehand that their delegates would be disqualified if they went ahead , and asked the candidates not to campaign there .
The candidates obliged .
The states went ahead anyway .
Clinton won both .
Her senior adviser , Harold Ickes , was on the committee that voted not to recognise them .
Obama 's name was not even on the ballot in Michigan .
Back in October last year Clinton said uncomplainingly of Michigan : " It 's clear , this election they 're having is not going to count for anything . "
But then she won both .
Now everything is different .
Speaking before a crowd of senior citizens in Boca Raton , Florida , last week she went into metaphorical hyperbole , comparing the battle to seat the delegates from Florida and Michigan to the suffragettes , the civil rights movement and Zimbabwe - where more than 40 people have been killed in election - related violence .
" We 're seeing that right now in Zimbabwe , " she explained to a crowd of senior citizens .
" Tragically , an election was held , the president lost , they refused to abide by the will of the people .
So we can never take for granted our precious right to vote . "
Clinton insists she is winning the popular vote .
She 's right .
But only if you tally votes with the same degree of selectivity as Robert Mugabe .
For her claim to make sense , you would have to count the discounted Florida and Michigan primaries and discount the legitimate caucuses in Iowa , Nevada , Maine and Washington state , three of which Obama won .
These four states do not reveal popular vote totals .
It 's like saying if you include your goals that were ruled offside and do n't recognise your opponents ' headers ( it is football after all ) then you really won the game .
The reason Clinton has had to resort to this sophistry reveals another trait she shares with Bush - hubris .
She believed she would have the nomination sewn up by Super Tuesday .
She woke up on the following Wednesday out of money , ideas and volunteers .
It was a month and nine contests before she won again .
By then the momentum was Obama 's and , though he has stumbled , he has been running with it since .
By most reckonings he leads by about 190 delegates and 400,000 votes .
Even if Michigan and Florida were counted , she would still trail in delegates .
And , like Bush , she has appealed to the basest instincts of the electorate to dig herself out of a hole .
First came fear .
" It 's 3 am in the morning and your children are safe and asleep .
Who do you want answering the telephone [ in the White House ] , " went her ad .
Then there is racism .
The most recent example of which was her claiming that Obama 's " support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again " , as evidence of her own viability .
Later she would concede that equating " white " and " hard - working " was a " dumb comment " .
On Friday she was lambasted for intimating that she was staying in the race because , like Bobby Kennedy , Obama may yet be assassinated .
It was clumsy .
But a reasonable reading of the context shows she neither said nor meant anything of the kind .
Her problem is that by now the general impression is that there is almost nothing she would n't do or say .
It would indeed take something that dramatic and tragic for her to win .
Like the Bush administration , the issue is no longer whether she leaves the stage with her reputation irreparably tarnished , but what state she leaves it in and how many people she is prepared to take with her .

Albania 's grid is in a poor shape
Albanians may have found a new villain to blame for the frequent power cuts that have been blighting their lives .
The country 's main electricity company says a cat chasing a mouse caused a 72 - hour blackout in parts of the capital , Tirana .
The animals ran into an area of high - voltage cables and were electrocuted , a spokeswoman for the firm - Kesh - told Reuters news agency .
" We took pictures because we 've never had anything like this , " she said .
Power cuts have been endemic in Albania for many years .
The authorities usually blame drought and the dilapidated state of the communist - era grid , which appears to be buckling under the strain of the extra demand caused by the Albanians ' recent access to modern amenities .
Subprime was just the beginning .
Wait until California 's prime borrowers start handing their keys to the bank .
Slate is writing Here Comes the Next Mortgage Crisis .
Riverside County , outside Los Angeles , may be the foreclosure capital of the country , with a rate close to six times the national average .
And housing prices are in freefall .
California should be the poster child for a mortgage - loan bailout .
In few other places have so many taken on such onerous debts with so little equity .
Unfortunately , the crisis in California is going to get much worse , and there is no bailout that will solve it .
Why ?
Because if the first stage of the foreclosure crisis was about people who could not afford their mortgages , the next stage will be about people who have every reason not even to try to pay their mortgages .
Over the next several months , we 're going to be subjected to a chorus of hand - wringing about the moral turpitude of people who walk away from their mortgages and pronouncements like last month 's warning from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that people should honor their mortgage obligations .
The problem with finger - wagging on what you " should " or " ought " to do is that , when it comes to money , you 're usually given the lecture only when it 's in your interest to do the opposite .
Certainly , that 's the case for all the California homeowners who in the next year or two are going to find themselves with the choice of whether , faced with a huge new wave of interest resets and a historic decline in the value of their homes , they will simply walk away .
My Comment
Just two banks , Washington Mutual and Countrywide , wrote more than $ 300 billion worth of option ARMs in the three years from 2005 to 2007 , concentrated in California .
Others — IndyMac , Golden West ( the creator of the option ARM , and now a part of Wachovia ) — wrote many billions more .
The really amazing thing is that the meltdown in California is already happening and virtually none of these loans have yet reset .
My Comment
Looking ahead to 2010 - 2011 I see a different set of problems .
Those problems are Alt - A and Pay Option ARMS .
And that is where the liar loans ( no - doc loans ) are hidden .
Liar loans are likely to blow up long before we get to 2011 .
I discussed a particular Alt - A pool in WaMu Alt - A Pool Revisited and WaMu Alt - A Pool Deteriorates Further
When those dominoes start falling next year , we may or may not have a subprime bailout plan , and the discussion will start about how to bail out this next tranche of borrowers .
The bailout plans on the table now , such as the one put forward by Barney Frank ( one of Congress ' genuinely cogent financial minds ) , are reasonably based on the principle of bringing payments down to a point that homeowners can afford .
But where prices fall 40 percent to 60 percent , all that goes out the window .
Why ?
Because in expensive locales like San Diego , tens of thousands of people with 100 percent loan - to - value mortgages and option ARMs are living in homes in which they have no equity and on which they owe a lot more than the house is worth .
Bet on this :
Whatever moral qualms are being urged on borrowers to keep them from walking away from their mortgages , they 'll count for a lot less than the economic reality facing borrowers whose homes have fallen in value by half .
Lenders had no reservations about selling borrowers loans with rising payments that would be poisonous in a rising market .
Now it seems borrowers have no reservations about leaving those lenders with the risks they begged to take .
Foreclosures Jump 57 % as Homeowners Walk Away
U.S. foreclosure filings jumped 57 percent and bank repossessions more than doubled in March from a year earlier as adjustable mortgages increased and more owners lost their homes to lenders .
More than 234,000 properties were in some stage of foreclosure , or one in every 538 U.S. households , Irvine , California - based RealtyTrac Inc. , a seller of default data , said today in a statement .
Nevada , California and Florida had the highest foreclosure rates .
Filings rose 5 percent from February .
My Comment
Auction notices rose 32 percent from a year ago , a sign that more defaulting homeowners are " simply walking away and deeding their properties back to the foreclosing lender " rather than letting the home be auctioned , RealtyTrac Chief Executive Officer James Saccacio said in the statement .
" We 're not near the bottom of this at all , " said Kenneth Rosen , chairman of Rosen Real Estate Securities LLC , a hedge fund in Berkeley , California and chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate at the University of California at Berkeley .
" The foreclosure process will accelerate throughout the year . "
My Comment
About 2.5 million foreclosed properties will be on the market this year and in 2009 , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. analysts led by Michelle Meyer said in an April 10 report .
U.S. home price declines will probably double to a national average of 20 percent by next year , with lower values most likely in metropolitan areas in California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada , mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc. said last week in a report .
My Comment
" At least 2 million jobs will be lost because of this recession , so we 'll get a cumulative negative spiral , " Rosen said .
" A normal recession is 10 months .
We think this one may be twice as long . "
My Comment
Nevada had the highest U.S. foreclosure rate in March at one for every 139 households , almost four times the national rate , Realty Trac said .
California had the second - highest rate at one filing for every 204 households , and the most filings for the 15th consecutive month at 64,711 .
Florida had the third - highest rate , one filing for every 282 households , and ranked second in total filings at 30,254 .
Foreclosures increased 112 percent from a year earlier and decreased almost 7 percent from February , Realty Trac said .
Ohio ranked third in filings at 11,273 and had the seventh - highest foreclosure rate , one for every 448 households .
Some borrowers are " hanging on at the margins " in the face of resets , said Mark Goldman , a loan officer at Windsor Capital Mortgage Corp. in San Diego .
" I 've had people sitting in my office in tears because there are no loans available , " said Goldman .
" There are no loans for someone who 's upside down on their house . "
California Attorney Chimes In
As a California real estate attorney I can tell you this :
1 ) Mortgage debt , whether it's a first or second loan , is nonrecourse if it is " purchase money " , used initially to purchase the property ;
2 ) Mortgage debt that exists due to a refinancing and / or to second loan taken out after purchase is recourse , but -- and it 's a BIG but -- only if the lender elects to file a lawsuit for judicial foreclosure rather than going through the usual foreclosure process ;
3 ) Suits for judicial foreclosure are in my experience of 28 years extremely rare , due mostly to the fact that any buyer at a judicial foreclosure sale has to give the foreclosed - upon party a full year to redeem the property .
This of course is a complete deal - killer .
An interesting side - note : California 's anti-deficiency law originated during the Depression years , in order to place the burden of properly valuing real property and risk of loss on lenders ( who presumably were more sophisticated and able to assess value ) rather than buyers .
Fast - forward to now , when it turns out that rampant greed prevented lenders from acting rationally in their own self interest .
Now they are paying the price with walk - aways and " jingle mail " .

Det finns egentligen ganska många anledningar till varför det är så kul att vara en svensk casinospelare nuförtiden , och en av dem är möjligheten att skapa ett spelkonto och börja spela på en helt ny casino utan att behöva delta i krångliga registreringsprocesser och uppladdningen av personhandlingar .
Någonting som länge var ett slags obligatoriskt irritationsmoment , så att säga , för oss som först introducerades till nätcasinon kring årtusenskiftet .
Det sagt , en av de mest intressanta alternativ till traditionella registreringsprocessen idag är Trustlys Pay N Play tjänst , vars närmare detaljer vi avser att diskutera i det guide som följer .
En snabbkurs i Pay N Play
Pay N
Play är en oerhört smidig tjänst som erbjuds av den svenska betalningsförmedlaren , Trustly , ( som på senare tid har blivit en väldigt vanlig syn hos online casinon som lockar just svenska spelare ) , och Pay N Play går principiellt ut på att man registrerar sig för ett spelkonto hos ett casino med hjälp av en framgångsrik första insättning .
Vilket är att säga , Pay N Play erbjuder en alternativ som helt onödvändiggör saker såsom inmatningen av personuppgifter , uppladdningen av eventuella dokument som styrker ens identitet och övriga former av efterfrågad information , och istället använder sig av den information som din bank tillhandahåller genom en framgångsrik transaktion i syfte att identifiera dig .
Tjänsten lanserades i sin ursprungliga form år 2019 , och har sedan dess förbättrat på det mesta .
Kanske delvis då Pay N Play används redan av mer än 100 olika aktörer världen över , och denna siffra förväntas minst fördubblas under de nästa två år .

One of the central challenges of our time is the supply of enough environmentally friendly and resource - efficient energy to our society .
In this context , hydrogen technology has taken on increased importance .
Björn Loges , Albert Boddien , Henrik Junge , and Matthias Beller at the Leibniz Institute of Catalysis in Rostock have now succeeded in the controlled extraction of hydrogen from formic acid — without the need for the high - temperature reforming process usually involved in other hydrogen generation systems .
As they report in the journal Angewandte Chemie , this hydrogen source , generated at room temperature , can be directly introduced into fuel cells .
Hydrogen - powered fuel cells are the cleanest source of energy because they only produce one type of exhaust gas : water vapor .
However , it is not yet practicable to transport and store hydrogen , which is a gas and cannot be pumped into a tank as easily as gasoline .
Storage systems currently in use are large and heavy , expensive , and complex .
It would thus be better to couple the fuel cell directly to a hydrogen - producing material , which would supply the fuel cell on demand .
Aside from methane and methanol , renewable resources such as biomass and its fermentation products ( e.g. bioethanol ) are the most promising starting materials for this technology .
The serious disadvantage is that their conversion only works at temperatures above 200 °C , which consumes a significant portion of the energy produced .
The researchers from Rostock have now developed a feasible process for the on - demand release of hydrogen ; they produce hydrogen from formic acid ( HCO 2 H ) .
In the presence of an amine ( e.g. N , N - dimethylhexylamine ) and with a suitable catalyst ( e.g. the commercially available ruthenium phosphine complex [ RuCl 2 ( PPH 3 ) 2 ] ) , formic acid is selectively converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen at room temperature .
A simple activated charcoal filter is enough to purify the hydrogen gas for use in a fuel cell .
The use of formic acid for “ hydrogen storage ” allows the advantages of established hydrogen / oxygen fuel cell technology to be combined with those of liquid fuels .
Formic acid is nontoxic and easy to store .
Because formic acid can be generated catalytically from CO 2 and biomass - derived hydrogen , the cycle is CO 2 neutral in principle .
Will we be replacing gasoline with formic acid in the future ?
It is not inconceivable , but initial applications requiring smaller amounts of energy are more probable .
“ For the use of fuel cells in portable electrical devices , ” says Beller , “ this nascent formic acid technology opens up new possibilities in the short term . ”
[ digg - reddit - me ] A few weeks ago , when the electoral math began to indicate that Senator Hillary Clinton had little no chance of catching Senator Barack Obama , the voices of the Democratic establishment who had remained mainly neutral began to push a new meme .
These establishment voices clearly wanted to send a message to the Clintons : “ Stay in the race as long as you want .
But keep it clean . ”
Bob Shrum wrote in the New York Times two weeks ago :
She has very little chance of winning , but Hillary Clinton has no reason to get out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — for now .
A long shot is n’t the same as no chance at all .
And an extended campaign does n’t have to wound the nominee , assuming a measure of self - restraint on both sides …
The degree of aggression on each side may not be comparable , as both sides argue on their own behalf .
But the Democratic nomination may not be worth winning if the victor is lacerated as unready , unfit to hold the office , or un-American — not , as expected , by the vast right - wing conspiracy but by a Democratic rival .
The editors of The New Republic wrote :
[ C] alls for Hillary to withdraw – calls that invariably rest on the mathematical case against her candidacy – are premature .
By winning Ohio and Texas , Hillary won the right to continue in this race . … [ But ] it ’s imperative that , as Hillary Clinton continues her campaign , she conduct it in a certain manner :
She ca n’t run the type of campaign she ran in the lead - up to Ohio and Texas .
For weeks , Clinton attacked Obama with a relish not previously seen in this race .
But it was n’t the fact she was attacking Obama that was problematic , it was how she was attacking him–namely , in a way that will make it more difficult for Obama should he , as is still likely , be the Democratic nominee in November .
For instance , it would have been fine for Hillary to argue that she ’d make a better commander - in - chief than Obama ; but it was wrong for her to essentially argue , as she did on more than one occasion , that she and John McCain would make better commanders - in - chief than Obama .
Similarly , her strange hedging on “ 60 Minutes ” about whether she believes Obama is n’t a Muslim only added fuel to the unfounded rumors that are already circulating about his faith .
Frankly , Clinton ’s chances are slim enough that a win - at - all - costs mentality from her campaign is not worth the risk of doing irreparable damage to the candidate who will likely be her party ’s nominee .
Yet – for whatever reason , despite the fact that she has little chance of winning – Ms. Clinton has continued to attack Obama using Rovian tactics of guilt - by - association , character assassination , the questioning of patriotism , and divisive identity politics .
Barack Obama ’s campaign has not been pure – from the beginning , he made it clear that he was willing to fight when challenged , as the hiring of David Axelrod as his campaign manager demonstrated .
But the restraint he has shown has been truly remarkable .
Just a taste of the topics he has n’t brought up : cattle futures ; Travelgate ; Filegate ; her own pastor ; pardons by her husband of terrorists that were intended to help her 2000 Senate campaign according to internal documents ; the many shady deals her husband has made since leaving the presidency , often acting against his wife ’s public positions .
All of these directly relate to the kind of president she might be .
We ’re not even touching on Monica Lewinsky , on Whitewater , on Vince Foster , and the dozen other scandals of her husband ’s administration as well as the persistent rumors of his continued infidelities and disconcerting business deals .
If Mr. Obama ’s campaign has showed great restraint , Obama personally has shown even more restraint .
Ms. Clinton has not – and her campaign has been worse .
Last night , she demonstrated – in front of over ten million viewers – that she has no shame .
Perhaps that is why , today , without any significant event to move him except Ms. Clinton ’s unconscionable performance at last night ’s debate , Howard Dean demanded that superdelegates make their decisions “ now . ”
The Democratic party is worried about the damage Ms. Clinton is doing ; as a co-worker of mine listens to hard - right talk radio through much of the day , I can hear the memes starting to spread – I can hear them gaining traction .
Ms. Clinton is damaging herself , her party , and Obama – and she is attacking him using the very tactics she abhorred and laying the same groundwork for the “ conservative ” attacks on Obama that the right launched at Al Gore , Bill Clinton , John Kerry , Max Cleeland , and many more Democrats ( and a few Republicans ) .
That ’s why I want Ms. Clinton to stay in the race .
As I wrote almost two months ago :
If Ms. Clinton wants to help her party win the White House this November , she can give Mr. Obama the “ vetting ” she claims he lacks , and with ever increasing histrionics , throw every smear , every false allegation , every innuendo at him .
She can make her name synonymous with the sleaze she throws at him ; she has proven that she is capable of a viciousness reminiscent of a Karl Rove .
And by playing the villain , she can discredit and de-fang the many attacks that are sure to come at Mr. Obama after he secures the nomination .
It is better for these attacks on Obama to come out now than in September or October before the election .
And Mr. Obama must overcome this type of politics if he is to win in November .
Perhaps it is best if these attacks come from a source reviled on the right , so they can be more easily dismissed as time goes on .
Though I doubt that Ms. Clinton is thinking in these times , I am trying to determine the best way Ms. Clinton ’s destructive course could be used to benefit Mr. Obama .
Most observers thought that Mr. Obama looked weary last night .
He was n’t able to – and did n’t seem to even try to – launch the “ knockout punch ” that would end the race .
Some quip , some throwaway line that would undermine the basis of Ms. Clinton ’s candidacy , as Lloyd Bentsen ’s response to Dan Quayle :
What Obama did – again and again – was to respond to the allegations and pivot back to the issues .
Mr. Obama was tired and off of his game , and Ms. Clinton was on point – yet , my gut feeling is that Mr. Obama won more votes last night than he lost , because a weary Obama was far more compelling and far more presidential than an invigorated , desperate , and affected Clinton .
Ms. Clinton is playing the villain well so far .
Unfortunately , it did n’t seem like an act last night .
Here ’s my proposition : the Pennsylvania primary is less than 10 days away .
Let Ms. Clinton bring everything she has to this – which is to say , let her throw all the mud she can .
We ’ll see in 10 days who the mud is sticking to – and if Mr. Obama survives these Rovian , Atwater - style attacks , he will be a significantly stronger candidate .
If he can rise above them , then he will be a truly great candidate .
I say let Ms. Clinton play the villain – because she is not giving us a choice .
She is staying in this race .
Obama has bet his candidacy on the fundamental decency and good sense of the American people .
And he ’s gotten this far .
I have hope that he can make it a bit farther .

The groups say a battered , starved Gaza cannot be a peace partner
Conditions in Gaza
They include Amnesty International , Save the Children , Cafod , Care International and Christian Aid .
They criticise Israel 's blockade on Gaza as illegal collective punishment which fails to deliver security .
Israel says its military action and other measures are lawful and needed to stop rocket attacks from Gaza .
Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 , but retains control over Gaza 's airspace and coastline , and over its own border with the territory .
It tightened its blockade in January amid a surge in rocket attacks by Palestinian militants in Gaza .
Israel 's Defence Ministry rejected the criticism in the report , blaming the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza .
" The main responsibility for events in Gaza is the Hamas organisation , to which all complaints should be addressed , " a statement read .
' Disaster '
The groups ' report , Gaza Strip : A Humanitarian Implosion , says the blockade has dramatically worsened levels of poverty and unemployment , and has led to deterioration in education and health services .
GAZA REPORT
More than 80 % of population rely on humanitarian aid Unemployment about 40 %
No running water for 25 - 30 % of Gazans
Gaza report : Key points
More than 1.1 million Gazans are dependent on food aid and of 110,000 workers previously employed in the private sector , 75,000 have now lost their jobs , the report says .
" Unless the blockade ends now , it will be impossible to pull Gaza back from the brink of this disaster and any hopes for peace in the region will be dashed , " said Geoffrey Dennis , of Care International UK .
Last week Israeli forces launched a bloody and destructive raid in northern Gaza , in which more than 120 Palestinians - including many civilians - were killed .
Israel says the measures are designed to stamp out frequent rocket fire by Palestinian militants .
Recent rocket attacks have hit deeper into southern Israel , reaching Ashkelon , the closest large Israeli city to the Gaza Strip .
Occupying power
The UK - based groups agree that Israel has the right and obligation to protect its citizens , urging both sides to cease unlawful attacks on civilians .
But they call upon Israel to comply with its obligations , as the occupying power in Gaza , to ensure its inhabitants have access to food , clean water , electricity and medical care , which have been in short supply in the strip .
" Punishing the entire Gazan population by denying them these basic human rights is utterly indefensible , " said Amnesty UK Director Kate Allen .
" The current situation is man-made and must be reversed . "
Other recommendations from the groups include international engagement with the Hamas movement , which rejects Israel 's legitimacy and has been shunned by Israel 's allies , and the Fatah party of Palestinian West Bank leader Mahmoud Abbas .
" Gaza can not become a partner for peace unless Israel , Fatah and the Quartet [ the US and UN , Europe and Russia ] engage with Hamas and give the people of Gaza a future , " said Daleep Mukarji of Christian Aid .
The US prison population almost trebled between 1987 and 2007
The Pew Center report calls the US the global leader in the rate at which it imprisons its citizens .
Over 2.3 million people were being held this year , it said - far ahead of other countries with large prison populations like China , Russia and Iran .
The report called for fewer low - risk offenders to be sent to jail .
Soaring costs
It claims that the growing prison population " is saddling cash - strapped states with soaring costs they can ill afford , and failing to have a clear impact either on recidivism or overall crime " .
With 750 inmates per 100,000 people , imprisonment cost the 50 states more than $ 49bn last year , up from less than $ 11bn 20 years earlier .
The rate of increase for prison costs was found to be six times greater than for higher education spending .
RATES OF INCARCERATION USA : 750 prisoners per 100,000 people South Africa : 341 per 100,000 Iran : 222 per 100,000 China : 119 per 100,000
According to the Pew Center study , the higher rates of incarceration did not reflect a similar increase in crime , or in population , but tougher sentencing measures .
Some states , though , such as Texas and Kansas , have acted to slow their prison population growth , with greater use of community supervision for lower - risk offenders , and sanctions other than prison for minor probation and parole violations .
Disproportionate numbers
The numbers were " especially startling " , according to the Pew Center report , for some groups in the population .
" While one in 30 men between the ages of 20 and 34 is behind bars , for black males in that age group the figure is one in nine . "
The total of 2.3 million adults held in prison - or one in every 99.1 adults - puts the US far head of other countries .
China , with its far greater population , has 1.5 million people behind bars , and Russia has 890,000 .
TCHO , a small company based in a warehouse in San Francisco , sounds like a typical high - tech start - up .
The brainchild of an engineer who previously worked on computer - vision systems for the space shuttle , the firm is developing “ beta ” versions of its new product .
Volunteer testers are invited to submit feedback via the web .
Louis Rossetto , the co-founder of Wired , a technology magazine , is on board as chief executive .
All the employees have stock options .
But Tcho is not about to launch a new website or mobile device ; it is a technology firm that makes chocolate .
Its founders believe there is vast scope for innovation in the way chocolate is made and sold .
Most cocoa farmers have never tasted chocolate , and produce cocoa beans without any idea of how they will be used , says Timothy Childs , Tcho 's founder .
The resulting chocolate is classified and sold in a very unsophisticated way , labelled at best by country of origin and percentage cocoa solids .
( It is rather like labelling a wine “ France , 13 % alcohol ” . )
So Mr Childs wants to put things on a more technical footing — just as Americans formalised techniques for winemaking in the 1970s .
He has developed ways to analyse and grade beans , and a six - segment “ flavour wheel ” to map out their natural aromas .
Using a variety of jury - rigged spice grinders , heaters and temperature sensors , he has worked out how to get cocoa beans to reveal their complex flavours and to get chocolate to solidify evenly .
Tcho is also working with cocoa growers , in conjunction with two research groups it has equipped with satellite - internet connections , to help them improve the quality and consistency of their beans .
Tcho hopes that the most effective techniques will then spread in an “ open source ” fashion to other growers .
Beans will be turned into chocolate on Tcho 's elaborate production line , which is being used as a test - bed for remote video - monitoring of industrial processes by researchers at Fuji Xerox in Palo Alto .
The firm will sell much of its chocolate to other food companies , for use in other products .
Such customers , says Mr Rossetto , like the idea of buying chocolate based on a consistent flavour profile ;
Tcho 's flavour wheel could become a de facto industry standard , he suggests , as IBM 's PC did in the computer industry .
Tcho will also sell chocolate using its website , and through a shop and visitors ' centre due to open in the summer .
San Francisco , a capital of food culture as well as technology , is the logical place to produce a high - tech chocolate .
John Kehoe , Tcho 's sourcing director , says chocolate is going down the trail blazed by speciality coffee , as consumers become more discerning .
Chocolate today , he says , is where coffee was five years ago .
Having been ahead of the curve with Wired , which launched just as the web was emerging , Mr Rossetto seems to have spotted another trend .
Congress passed the law in 2005 unde intense pressure from the NRA .
The court ruled Tuesday it had no authority to do so .
Will the decision open the doors to dozens of suits from gun violence victims ?
There are many unconscious reasons people believe in religious faiths .
While many people find comfort and joy in their religious practices because of their moral teachings , there are other reasons they 're drawn to their faith as well .
For many , faith was a part of their upbringing , and they want to continue their family 's traditions .
Faith plays an important role in culture for many reasons .

The high and consistent degree of religious concentrations suggests that people believe their religion because that 's the one they were indoctrinated into and which is consistently reinforced around them .
People acquire a religion before critical thinking skills , and that religion is promoted without most people noticing .
02 of 07 Indoctrination into Anti-Atheist Bigotry Kevin Dodge / Getty Images
If you 're constantly being told that people who do n't believe in your god are evil , immoral , and a threat to the stable social order , then you would never dream of dropping your theistic religion .
Who wants to be immoral or be regarded by the rest of society as immoral ?
This is very much what atheists face , especially in America , and it's hard not to see the constant indoctrination into anti-atheist bigotry as a reason why people stick to their religions .
Children learn in public schools that America is a nation for people who believe in God and this message is reinforced throughout their lives by preachers , politicians , and community leaders of all sorts .
03 of 07 Peer and Family Pressure skynesher / Getty Images Religion can be enormously valuable to families and communities , creating a tremendous amount of pressure to conform to religious expectations .
People who step outside those expectations are not merely choosing a different way of life , but can be perceived as rejecting one of the most important bonds which keep a family or community together .
Even if this is never communicated in so many words , people do learn that certain ideas , ideologies , and practices should be treated as vital to communal bonds and should therefore not be questioned .
The role of peer pressure and familial pressure in maintaining at least a veneer of religiosity for many people cannot be denied .
04 of 07 Fear of Death arturogi / Getty Images
Many religious theists try to argue atheists into believing in a god through the fear of what will happen after death , either going to hell or just ceasing to exist .
This arguably reveals something very important about the believers themselves : they , too , must fear death as the cessation of existence and believe not because there are any good reasons to think there is an afterlife , but rather out of wishful thinking .
People do n't want to believe that physical death is the end of all experiences , emotions , and thoughts , so they insist on believing that somehow their " mind " will continue to exist without any physical brain in an eternity of sustained bliss , or even will be reincarnated in a new form .
05 of 07 Wishful Thinking Yuri_Arcurs / Getty Images
The wish that physical death is n't the end of life probably is n't the only example of wishful thinking behind religious and theistic belief .
There are some other ways in which people profess beliefs that appear to be more about what they wish were true than what they can support through good evidence and logic .
06 of 07 Fear of Freedom and Responsibility Carl Smith / Getty Images
One of the most disturbing aspects of many people 's religious beliefs is the manner in which these beliefs make it possible for believers to avoid taking personal responsibility for what 's going on .
They do n't have to be responsible for ensuring that justice is done because God will provide that .
They do n't have to be responsible for solving environmental problems because God will do that .
They do n't have to be accountable for developing strong moral rules because God has done that .
They do n't have to be responsible for developing sound arguments in defense of their positions because God has done that .
Believers deny their freedom because freedom means responsibility and responsibility means that if we fail , no one will rescue us .

I recently finished reading Ayn Rand ’s The Virtue of Selfishness , and I wanted to offer some comments on her moral philosophy .
There are several good reasons why I ought to like Ayn Rand .
She was an atheist , and proudly so , and argued for the supremacy of reason as the only valid way of knowing .
I agree with this .
She denounced communism and supported capitalism .
I agree with this as well .
Her works are still very popular in some circles and offer a vision of a rational , productive life which many people find powerful and inspiring .
Nevertheless , there are also reasons why I do n’t like Rand – neither her as a person , nor her philosophy – and these reasons , in my judgment , far outweigh whatever factors are in her favor .
These include her blatant hypocrisy in her adulterous relationship with Nathaniel Branden , the cult - like attitude of absolute obedience and conformity that characterized her movement ’s founding , and her genocidal belief that the European settlers of the Americas were fully within their rights to slaughter , despoil and enslave the native people of those continents , all because the Native Americans did not share the European concept of property rights .
( Yes , she actually said that . )
This post will detail three of my primary objections to Rand ’s Objectivist philosophy , as it ’s expressed in TVOS and her other works .
Combined , I believe they demonstrate that Rand ’s system of thought either contains fatal self - contradictions , or else would be destructive to the welfare of any society that was to adopt it .
The Objectivist Firefighter : Sacrificing Your Life For Strangers
Central to Objectivism is the notion that the individual ’s life is the supreme moral value .
“ The Objectivist ethics holds man ’s life as the standard of value — and his own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man ” ( p.25 ) .
An Objectivist may rationally sacrifice his life , if the cause were so important to him that he would not want to live if it were to fail .
Central to Objectivism , however , is the notion that no one can ever have a duty to sacrifice his own life for the sake of others .
“ [ Objectivism ] means one ’s rejection of the role of a sacrificial animal , the rejection of any doctrine that preaches self - immolation as a moral virtue or duty ” ( p.27 ) .
Even when others are in danger , we have no obligation to assist them .
“ If the person to be saved is a stranger , it is morally proper to save him only when the danger to one ’s own life is minimal ; when the danger is great , it would be immoral to attempt it … ” ( p.45 ) .
Let ’s see how this principle would play out in a real - world situation .
Cast your mind back to the morning of September 11 , 2001 , and ponder the situation from the point of view of a rescue worker , like a paramedic or a firefighter .
The hijacked planes have crashed into the Twin Towers , which are in flames and badly damaged ; it ’s plain to see they may collapse soon .
Yet there are still thousands of people inside who could be saved .
Let ’s say you ’re one of the first responders , as well as an Objectivist , and your superior orders you into the towers to rescue as many people as you can .
How should you respond ?
Here ’s how one real firefighter actually did respond :
I will always remember one panting reporter talking to a fireman who was shrugging into his respirator .
“ What are you doing ? ” “ I ’m going to that other tower , ” he said .
“ I think that other tower is going to collapse , ” said the reporter , seeming to forget that he was on the air .
“ You would do the same for me , ” the fireman said , and ran up the street .
And yet , from the principles just stated , it seems the Objectivist course of action is clear .
Unlike the firefighter quoted above , the Objectivist rescue worker has to refuse – because he ’s being asked to risk his life for strangers , which can never be a moral duty according to Rand .
In fact , since the preservation of one ’s individual life is the highest virtue , the consistent Objectivist not only ought to refuse to enter the towers , he ought to get himself out of the area and to safety as soon as possible , and never mind what happens to anyone else .
As long as no one you personally know is in danger , your duty is to protect yourself and only yourself .
This is what Ayn Rand calls morality ; I think most people would more accurately describe it as contemptible cowardice .
Perhaps the objection could be raised that , having committed himself to the job already , the Objectivist is bound to follow through .
But that just moves the problem back , because then the conclusion would seem to be that an Objectivist should always turn down any job – firefighter , policeman , infectious - disease specialist – that might potentially put his life in danger .
These all entail putting yourself at risk for the sake of strangers , a thought intolerable to any consistent Objectivist .
Yet , just as clearly , society needs people to do these jobs if it is to survive .
Ayn Pangloss : Conflicts of Interest Among Rational Men
Central to the Objectivist morality is the idea that “ there are no conflicts of interests among rational men ” ( p.50 ) .
This is crucial to Rand ’s position because she argues that all people should make all their decisions on the basis of reason .
If reason led people to want mutually exclusive things , then either some people would have to surrender the goals dictated by reason and seek something else ( a thought Rand finds intolerable ) , or else no one would surrender their goals and the result would be an attempt to achieve a contradiction , which “ can lead only to disaster and destruction ” ( p.51 ) .
It ’s hard to see at first how this principle could apply in a capitalist economy .
What if two people apply for the same job ?
Is n’t there a genuine conflict of interest between them as to who will be hired ?
Rand ’s answer to this question is that , just because two people want the same thing , it does not follow that they both rationally want it .
“ The mere fact that a man desires something does not constitute a proof … that its achievement is actually to his interest ” ( p.50 ) .
Rand argues that reason leads to the conclusion that capitalism is the best economic system possible , because it maximizes human productiveness and freedom , both of which are to everyone ’s interest .
Thus a rational person accepts that , in the context of his entire life , competition on the basis of merit is a good thing , even if it may cause him to lose out occasionally .
“ He knows that the struggle to achieve his values includes the possibility of defeat ” ( p.53 ) .
An Objectivist also believes he is only entitled to what he has earned by his own effort , and in a rational , merit - based system , if he loses out to a superior applicant , that is the only outcome he had any right to expect .
He has no rational interest in the job unless he earns and deserves it by his own effort .
“ Whoever gets the job , has earned it …
The failure to give a man what has never belonged to him can hardly be described as ‘ sacrificing his interests ' ” ( p.56 ) .
So far , so good .
But now , consider a case Rand never discusses :
What if two equally qualified people apply for the same job ?
This certainly seems to be possible .
Let ’s assume that there are two applicants who are equally intelligent , equally skilled , and would perform equally well if given the job .
In that case , is it not in both their interests to get that job , and since only one of them can have it , is this not a contradiction ?
Rand fiercely disparages “ whim ” , and yet in this situation it seems there could be no other way to resolve the deadlock .
But we need not even go this far .
There ’s something else that Rand has overlooked : her doctrine requires that the market be not just free , but infallible .
For if the market ever selects wrongly – that is , if it ever chooses the less qualified applicant for a given job – then I , as the more qualified but unsuccessful applicant , am faced with an irreconcilable contradiction : I want to live in a free - market society , which is in my rational interest , but I also wanted that job , the obtaining of which was also in my rational interest .
In that case , the act of obeying reason leads to a contradiction .
Rand would hold that this is , by definition , impossible .
That being so , she and her followers are committed to believing that the market always knows best , that its choices are always the correct ones .
Otherwise , they ’re faced with the fatal self - contradiction of rationally wanting to live in a capitalist society , yet also rationally wanting something that it has denied them .
Obviously , on this point the Objectivist philosophy clashes with reality : there undoubtedly are many situations where capitalist economies make erroneous decisions .
A less rigid philosophy would recognize that , although a free society is in everyone ’s interest in the long term , that does not mean it will not make mistakes or block our interests on occasion ; it ’s just that the alternatives are even worse .
“ You Will Not Be Stopped ” : The Heartless Core of Objectivism
Since Objectivists reject all notions of a social safety net , it ’s natural to ask what would happen to the poor and needy in an Objectivist society .
This is Ayn Rand ’s answer : “ If you want to help them , you will not be stopped ” ( p.80 ) .
This chilling response , which carries with it the unmistakable implication that she will not be participating in any such effort , illustrates Objectivist philosophy ’s cruel , heartless ethic of social Darwinism .
Its guiding principle is not “ we ’re all in this together ” , but rather “ every man for himself ” – and whatever misery strikes the worthless and the inferior as a result ought not to trouble the brave , heroic , superior souls whom Rand imagines are mankind ’s salvation .
The parallels between this doctrine and the beliefs of tyrants throughout history should be too obvious to need pointing out .
Am I too harsh ?
Rand ’s defenders might point to passages like the following one , which condemns the Soviet Union , as proof that she does care about the suffering of others and wants to see it alleviated :
“ Two generations of Russians have lived , toiled and died in misery , waiting for the abundance promised by their rulers , who pleaded for patience and commanded austerity , while building public ‘ industrialization ’ and killing public hope in five - year installments .
At first , the people starved while waiting for electric generators and tractors ; they are still starving , while waiting for atomic energy and interplanetary travel ” ( p.84 ) .
This sounds very compassionate of her – until you remember that Ayn Rand believes that the free market is , by definition , infallible ( see last point ) .
In Objectivist philosophy , if you succeed it ’s because you deserve to succeed , and if you ’re poor it ’s because you deserve to be poor .
Combined with Rand ’s repeated expressions of fierce disdain for “ parasites ” and “ looters ” and “ moochers ” , it seems hard to escape the conclusion that a consistent Objectivist would never give any money or other assistance to others .
After all , if they were deserving of your help , they would n’t need it ; they ’d have already achieved success and security on their own through hard work and persistence .
To an Objectivist , the way you prove you ’re worthy of help is by proving you do n’t need help .
And the reason Rand was so upset about the starving citizens of the USSR was n’t because they were starving ; it was because they were starving under the wrong ideology .
In an Objectivist society , people might still starve , but we can at least comfort ourselves with the knowledge that they must have deserved it .
The Chinese group took the earlier session and then left by bus around 2 p.m. along the long , winding road back to Chengdu .
“ That ’s what is upsetting , ” said Teri Kopp of Seattle , who sobbed quietly as she recounted that morning .
“ We do n’t know what happened to that busload of people . ”
The Americans were gathering for a lecture at the reserve ’s panda breeding center when they noticed strange behavior by the animals .
The birds that had been chirping in the bushes , or twirling in the skies overhead , were gone .
There was almost no sound .
The pandas seemed nervous .
Then at 2:28 , the earthquake hit .
“ For me , what was terrifying was when the top of the cliffs started exploding , ” Ms. Kopp said .
“ All the boulders started coming down .
The staff at the reserve was wonderful .
They were yelling at us to get under some structure . ”
The steep mountains looming over the breeding center were collapsing in landslides as strong aftershocks rippled through the valley .
“ These rocks were just flying in the air , ” Mr. Weber said .
“ A few of the rocks were the size of Volkswagens . ”
The aftershocks finally halted , and the people at the reserve soon realized they were trapped .
Boulders blocked the path leading to a bridge that linked the breeding center to the road to Wolong village .
A new path was needed : The Frenchman , three Americans , a tour guide and the panda keepers created a route by climbing over cages , stepping carefully along the top of a wall high above a river and rigging a ladder up to the bridge .
It was a precarious , rain - slicked solution .
One by one , everyone carefully moved forward .
One of the Americans was a 79 - year - old Californian traveling with a friend .
“ It was very scary , ” Ms. Capito said .
When the last person had made it to the bridge and out to the road , the staff raced back for the baby pandas .
They carried the cubs tucked under their arms as they slowly edged forward above the river and then up the ladder .
All 13 cubs were saved .
They were put inside a small ticket booth , a home that kept them from escaping , if not happy .
“ You could hear them , ” Ms. Capito said .
“ They were just tearing the place apart .
And when they let them out , they would just romp and play .
Not one got killed .
I could n’t believe it . ”
Originally published in The Independent .
After his latest shenanigans , I ’ve come to the conclusion that George Bush is the first US president to march backwards .
First we had weapons of mass destruction .
Then , when they proved to be a myth , Bush told us we had stopped Saddam ’s “ programmes ” for weapons of mass destruction ( which happened to be another lie ) .
Now he ’s gone a stage further .
After announcing victory in Iraq in 2003 and “ mission accomplished ” and telling us how this enormous achievement would lead the 21st century into a “ shining age of human liberty ” , George Bush told us this week that “ thanks to the surge , we ’ve renewed and revived the prospect of success ” .
Now let ’s take a look at this piece of chicanery and subject it to a little linguistic analysis .
Five years ago , it was victory – ie success – but this has now been transmogrified into a mere “ prospect ” of success .
And not a “ prospect ” , mark you , that has even been glimpsed .
No , we have “ renewed ” and “ revived ” this prospect .
“ Revived ” , as in “ brought back from the dead ” .
Am I the only one to be sickened by this obscene semantics ?
How on earth can you “ renew ” a “ prospect ” , let alone a prospect that continues to be bathed in Iraqi blood , a subject Bush wisely chose to avoid ?
Note , too , the constant use of words that begin with “ re - “ .
Renew .
Revive .
And – incredibly – Bush also told us that “ we actually re-liberated certain communities ” .
This , folks , goes beyond hollow laughter .
Since when did armies go around “ re-liberating ” anything ?
And what does that credibility - sapping “ actually ” mean ?
I suspect it was an attempt by the White House speech writer to suggest – by sleight of hand , of course – that Bush was really – really – telling the truth this time .
But by putting “ actually ” in front of “ re-liberate ” – as opposed to just “ liberate ” – the whole grammatical construction falls apart .
Rather like Iraq .
For by my reckoning , we have now “ re-liberated ” Fallujah twice .
We have “ re-liberated ” Mosul three times and “ re-liberated ” Ramadi four times .
The scorecard goes on .
My files show that Sadr City may have been “ re-liberated ” five times , while Baghdad is “ re-liberated ” on an almost daily basis .
General David Petraeus , in his pitiful appearance before the US Senate armed services committee , was bound to admit his disappointment at the military failure of the equally pitiful Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in Basra .
He had not followed Petraeus ’ advice ; which was presumably to “ re-liberate ” the city ( for the fourth time , by my calculation but with a bit more planning ) .
Indeed , Petraeus told senators that after his beloved “ surge ” goes home , the US will need a period of “ consolidation and evaluation ” – which is suspiciously close to saying that the US military will be , as the old adage goes , “ redeployed to prepared positions ” .
Ye gods !
Where will this tomfoolery end ?
In statistics , perhaps .
By chance , as Bush was speaking this week , my mail bag flopped open to reveal a letter from my old American military analyst friend , George W Appenzeller .
He gently ( and rightly ) corrects some recent comparative figures I used on US casualties in Korea , Vietnam and Iraq .
“ In previous wars , ” he writes , “ the US army has not reported to the public the number of wounded who are treated and immediately released back to duty .
They have reported these casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars ” .
So here are a few Appenzeller factoids ( glossed by Fisk , so the responsibility is mine ! ) .
The correct ratios for wounded in action vs killed in action for Iraq and Afghanistan is 8.13 to 1 ; for Korea , it ’s 7.38 to 1 and for Vietnam it ’s 6.43 to 1 .
The true number of US wounded in Iraq until 18 March this year was 13,170 , of whom 8,904 were so badly wounded that they required air evacuation to hospitals outside Iraq .
The number of killed in action in Iraq is 3,251 .
( The other 750 died in accidents or of sickness . )
But this does not include the kind of figure that the Pentagon and Bush always keep secret : an astonishing 1,000 or more Western - hired mercenaries , killed in Iraq while fighting or killing for “ our ” side .
But now I ’ll let George Appenzeller speak in his own words .
“ There are widely ranging estimates , but roughly 450,000 individuals … fought on the ground in Vietnam …
At the height of the Vietnam war there were 67,000 ground combat troops there .
That is roughly the number of ground combat troops the US presently has deployed in Iraq .
Interestingly enough , that is also about the number of ground combat troops the US had fighting at any one time in the Korean war .
“ The US army now has a much leaner and meaner organisation than in the past with a higher proportion of combat troops to total troops .
All those American civilian truck drivers and Bangladeshi cooks have freed up troop slots that have gone to the combat arms . ”
No , Iraq has not yet reached Korea and Vietnam proportions .
The three - year Korean war resulted in 33,686 US battle deaths and about 250,000 US wounds , an average of 94,562 casualties per year .
The American phase of the Vietnam war lasted 14 years and resulted in 47,378 US battle deaths and 304,704 US wounds , an average of 25,149 casualties per year and an average of 66,792 during the four years of 1966 - 1969 , the height of American fighting .
The Iraq war has lasted five years and has resulted in 3,251 battle deaths and 29,395 wounds , an average of 6,529 casualties per year .
“ Thus , the average number of killed and wounded during the Korean war was three times the total number of killed and wounded in the five years of the Iraq war .
The average number of killed and wounded during each of the most difficult years of the Vietnam war was twice the total for the five years of the Iraq war . ”
Now for much more blood , the civilian variety .
According to George , “ About 1,600,000 were killed in the Korean war , 365,000 ( according to American authorities ) and four million ( according to the Vietnamese government ) during the American phase of the Vietnam war , and who knows how many in Iraq .
No fewer than 250,000 , certainly . ”
Not that long ago , Bush claimed that civilian fatalities in Iraq were “ 30,000 more or less ” – again , note the “ more or less ” – but I can see why these statistics matter even less for him .
It ’s not just that we do n’t care a damn about Iraqi lives .
We are going to care even less about Iraqi civilian casualties when we walk backwards , when we are renewing and reviving and re-liberating all over again .
