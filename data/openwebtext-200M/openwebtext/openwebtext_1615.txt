I just euthanised Sam Fisher .
It was the right thing to do .
I could n’t let him go on like that , constantly trailing off mid sentence , sometimes for minutes at a time , before carrying on exactly where he left off .
Or he ’d pull himself into safety behind a piece of cover , only to get seemingly distracted , vacant stares as all around him was chaos .
When he finally returned to reality , he would just as likely be somewhere entirely different to when he started .
I do n’t blame him though .
It ’s not his fault he ’s like this .
It ’s Ubisoft , with all their talk of good intentions and protecting their creative license , that have really killed him , not me .
It was n’t me who decided that it was time to fight the pirates at all costs , even if it meant that the only true victim would be the paying customer .
It was n’t me who waged this war over copyright infringement .
I ’m just collateral damage .
I ’m well aware that my suffering is n’t representative of the wider picture , but at the same time it ’s certainly not an isolated event ; I happen to be caught in the uncomfortable cigar shape caught in between the two large circles of the Venn diagram that is ‘ People Who have Fast Internet ’ against ‘ People Who Ca n’t Play Ubisoft Games ’ .
I could just get angry , hell I am getting angry , but damned if I ’m not going to let you all know about it .
So , Ubisoft decided that , in an effort to combat piracy , they ’d implement a DRM system so draconian it ’d make us pine for the days of SecuROM .
Requiring a constant internet connection , the ‘ service ’ provides a steady stream of data between your computer and the Ubisoft master servers .
What this boils down to is that if you do n’t have a fast internet connection , or , like me , you ’re on a less - than - reliable wireless connection , you ’re going to see this screen a lot .
There ’s a bit of a character to that screen .
It reminds me of an overbearing parent that does n’t want me to play too many games .
You ’ll go an hour , maybe two , without anything , then , all of a sudden , it ’s a polite , but curt ‘ time to stop playing now . ’
You ignore it , then a few minutes later it flashes up again , a little longer this time .
‘ I ’m warning you .
Time to stop . ’
Stubbornness arrives , you set your jaw , and continue .
And then , for me , the sign comes back once more , but this time it ’s here to stay .
The only cure is to shut down the game , because when it arrives like that it ’s there to tell me that it ’s just shut down my entire internet .
I can guess a few reasons , primarily being that it ’s overloaded my connection with data , but seeming as I can play any number of bandwidth intensive multiplayer games with no issues , it does n’t seem right .
So yeah , that ’s fucking annoying .
It ends up with a situation where , each time I load up the game , I ’m playing connection roulette , wondering if I ’ll be able to get from one checkpoint to the next without my connection conking out due to the horrendous barrage between my computer and Ubisoft ’s servers .
The game no longer feels like a single player experience to be enjoyed on my own .
I ’m not battling with Ubisoft , to see if I can get from one checkpoint to the next as fast as humanly possible without them deciding to shut me out .
Of course , such personification of a completely abstract and arbitrary system is hardly useful , but my anger at it is enough that I ’m willing to create a face out of anything I god damn like .
I ’ve got half a mind to attack my chest of drawers ; it ’s been eyeing my like that for days .
The only course of action left to me was to delete the game from my computer , out of fear of my mental well being .
Which is a shame , because I really did enjoy what I got to play of Splinter Cell .
All this has happened a week after grappling with the arbitrary nature of the Games For Windows Live connection .
I ’d been wanting to play multiplayer , and because it could n’t connect , I could n’t play .
In the end , I did n’t really mind too much , if only because it made at least some sense that if I could n’t connect to their online service , I could n’t play online .
But that ’s not the case here .
I ’m locked out of an entire game purely because Ubisoft can’t deal with the idea that the pirates that copy their games are n’t paying for them .
What I want to know , as someone who has n’t pirated their game , and yet has been landed with all this horrific DRM , is was it worth it ?
Did they see a significant rise in sales on these products with the DRM ?
Have they noticed any increase , hell , anything at all that ’s different with these games compared to any they ’ve published before ?
Because if they have n’t , they need to get rid of this .
Right now .
Any of a number of finishes can be used , depending on the look you want to achieve .
Acrylic paints are an excellent choice .
Using basic painting techniques , a faux - wood look can be achieved quite easily .
Or , you might want to cover it with colored papers , cloth , oil based stain , etc .
That choice is up to you !

The world ’s population is quickly growing … and growing … and growing .
Our resources , obviously , are under an increasing amount of strain .
With more mouths to feed , more food is needed world wide ; millions of people are already dying from starvation on a daily basis .
Not everyone has a home or even just a protective shelter .
Resources are slowly yet surely depleting , and soon … we will be forced to face this international problem .
The thing is , the human population is not just growing but increasing faster than it ever has .
Between 1800 and 1930 , the world populatiojn doubled –in 100 + years .
But it doubled again between 1930 and 1975 , less than half the time is took to double previously .
This has undeniably caused an increase in extinction rates of other animals , which is not a problem that can be lightly brushed away as no big deal .
Because it really is a “ big deal . ”
What a majority of the human race seems to often forget or just ignore , is that we are simply and plainly animals .
We do not own the earth or control the earth .
We inhabit the plant with tens of thousands of other species that are as important as we are ( or even more so ) to maintaining the environment .
But instead of doing so , we are grabbing the reigns , forcefully I might add , and attempting to will the earth to do our bidding .
Because of this attitude , resources are withering away .
The solution ?
Well , the solution is not just finding other sources of food and energy , but making space .
Space cannot be artificially produced ; we must solve it realistically .
Birth control is a wise idea… especially for families like the Duggars who have “ 19 Kids and Counting . ”
Situations like these are what proves my point to be absolutely correct :
The human race wants to do whatever they want to do , even if it means producing an unnatural amount of offspring and taking more than their fair share of resources .

Ste7en on April 26 , 2010 at 03:33:25 Artist Actually bombs ( fairly devastating allegories for nuclear weaponry , in fact ) are in The Butter Battle Book , but no , the point was not to include things seuss himself had created but to create an homage to his works .
d3d on April 26 , 2010 at 03:33:31 Alumni i think it 's pretty silly to pick on the legitimacy of the imagery .
it nails the dr seuss style perfectly without being a direct ripoff of any dr seuss property .

Augmented Reality Navigation comes to Android
We may earn a commission for purchases made using our links .
If you ’ve been impressed with the recent augmented reality apps for Android but have not found much use for them , you might want to take a look at Wikitude Drive .
Posted by XDA forum member djbrutale , Wikitude Drive is the first navigation system based on augmented reality for your Android device !
Developed by Mobilizy Research & Development group in Salzburg , Wikitude Drive is a light weight navigational system and works by overlaying point to point directions on a camera - view – without the need for maps .
The app also provides the option to toggle to a traditional 3D map view by pressing the screen .
Currently only available in the US , and supporting the metric system , Wikitude Drive was available for download in the Market for beta testing but the download limit has now been reached .
A few XDA members appear to have been lucky enough to participate in the beta testing , so to join the discussion and keep up to date with progress , visit the forum thread .
John Woodell ( @johnwoodell ) gave an excellent talk at the App Engine Meetup this evening on using Ruby on Google ’s AppEngine .
After some highlights of App Engine and a tour of three real - world use cases , John gave a series of quick demos of what seem to be very well - documented resources for getting started .
I built the simple “ hello ” Sinatra app during his talk which was pretty satisfying .
I was distracted by my success with the first app , so I missed some of his Rails presentation , but it looks like the docs go through what he demo’d .
Overview
Key Features
No need to install or maintain your own stack
“ We do the scaling for you ” ->
Google services via standard APIs
Charge only for actual usage – Always free to get started
Built - in application management console ( pretty sweet )
Gotchas
no native code
no sockets or thread
no writing to the files system
30 seconds to do your work , then the request times out ( issues with initialization in Rails , but they ’ve developed a “ deferred dispatch ” workaround )
takes several seconds to “ spin up ” a new JRuby instance when your app first starts or your load spikes
Good things to know
AppEngine datastore has no schema .
Reads are always the same speed no matter how big your data store , writes are slower
You use DataMapper rather than ActiveRecord .
rather than ActiveRecord .
memcache API is available
URL Fetch API is a drop - in replacement for Net:: HTTP
as of today , there will be a release where openssl “ just works ” for the first time
Matthew Blain , the engineer for the main bulkloader tool , gave a short talk about it .
Bulkloader lets you put data into the AppEngine data store .
You can use it to import data or to move from one AppEngine app to another .
It currently supports limited input : csv and simple xml .
It also supports “ simple text ” for output .
You can write any connector you want .
Some real world references to people using Ruby on App Engine :
Very nice getting started guide , which I followed to build a Sinatra app in about 5 minutes .
sudo gem install google - appengine appcfg.rb generate_app hello dev_appserver.rb hello
After this I had an app running locally at http://localhost:8080/
— I find it unsettling to hear that the dev app is running on whatever Ruby I have , but when I deploy it is JRuby .
John reassures me that the only real glitch that I ’ll run into is if I have a gem with native code , for which there are n’t also java extensions ( or an alternate pure Ruby implementation ) .
Installation notes : has n’t been tested with rvm , the env is there , so you do n’t need it .
gems are stored in a jar file , kept in .gems / bundler_gems in your app directory
Then to deploy my app on App Engine , I needed to use my Google account to register an app .
I picked the name “ hello - sarah ” which I then added to my config.ru .
I also added a little snippet of Ruby code to the Rack app to report the current time , so I could tell it was mine .
Then I typed some magic words into my local command line :
cd hello / appcfg.rb update .
Then my app was live at : http://hello-sarah.appspot.com/
Since I tweeted it , I got a chance to see how the application dashboard works .
Here ’s what it looks like for this app which was first deployed a few hours ago :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon urged the U.S. Congress on Thursday to reinstate a ban on assault weapons to help cut cross - border gun smuggling and reduce drug gang violence for its southern neighbor .
In a speech to a joint session of Congress , Calderon described efforts to fight organized crime in Mexico , where 23,000 people have been killed in drug violence since he came to power in late 2006 and launched an army offensive .
Washington is also aiding Mexico ’s battle against drug gangs with a 2007 pledge of $ 1.4 billion for equipment and police training to help fight the cartels that ship some $ 40 billion worth of illegal drugs north each year .
The drug violence has become a major political test for Calderon and a growing worry for Washington and foreign investors as violence has spread across the southwest border .
“ There is one issue where Mexico needs your cooperation .
And that is stopping the flow of assault weapons and other deadly arms across the border , ” Calderon said to a standing ovation from U.S. lawmakers .
Calderon said the increase in violence in Mexico had coincided with the 2004 lifting of a U.S. assault weapons ban .
The 10 - year ban on the sale of assault weapons to civilians expired without being extended by Congress .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the administration favors reinstituting the ban , though guns rights groups oppose it .
Calderon said he respects Americans ’ Second Amendment right to bear arms but said many of the guns are getting into the hands of criminals .
SEIZING GUNS
Mexico has seized around 75,000 guns and assault weapons in the last three years , Calderon said .
He said more than 80 percent of them came from the United States and noted there were more than 7,000 gun shops along the border .
“ I would ask Congress to help us , with respect , and to understand how important it is for us that you enforce current laws to stem the supply of these weapons to criminals and consider reinstating the assault weapons ban , ” he said .
Though Calderon ’s request received applause and a standing ovation from mainly Democratic lawmakers , Republicans criticized the Mexican leader for discussing U.S. laws .
“ It was inappropriate for President Calderon to lecture Americans on our own state and federal laws , ” said Senator John Cornyn , a member of the Republican leadership .
“ Moreover , the Second Amendment is not a subject open for diplomatic negotiation , with Mexico or any other nation . ”
On immigration -- a common theme during his visit to Washington -- Calderon said his country was trying to improve economic conditions so Mexicans would not feel the need to leave their country in order to succeed .
He said Mexico expected more than 4 percent growth this year , even though data released on Thursday showed the economy shrank quarter - on - quarter in the first quarter of this year .
Millions of people are still crossing the U.S. border illegally to seek work .
An estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants live in the United States , most of them from Mexico and Central America .
Calderon repeated his opposition to a new Arizona law that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect is in the country illegally .
“ We must find together a better way to face and fix this common problem , ” he said .
There 's a new trend sprouting among local off - gridders , urban farmers , DIY scientists and Burning Man fanatics : home - grown algae .
This movement is being spearheaded by Aaron Baum , 40 , a Harvard and Stanford graduate who researches algae farming for NASA .
Two years ago , he also created what he believes is the world 's first community algae lab .
The Berkeley Shipyard - based project consisted of 16 55 - gallon tanks of algae but became so time consuming that when Baum traveled the world last year to visit algae farms and attend algae lectures , he shuttered it .
The latest iteration of the San Rafael resident 's algae revolution is teaching people to create personal photobioreactors , or 5 - gallon algae tanks .
To that end , Baum has recently launched a series of workshops on raising spirulina , a strain of algae that 's relatively easy to grow and harvest .
There are more than 50,000 strains of algae , so Baum advises against foraging for wild , unidentified algae which can be toxic .
Spirulina is the strain that 's been most evaluated for its safety and health benefits .
Baum explains all this in detail at the workshops , which typically draw between one and two dozen people .
Spirulina 's a superfood that 's high in complete protein , vitamins , minerals , antioxidants and omega - 3 fatty acids .
It 's normally sold in pill or powder form , tastes like seaweed ( a turnoff for many ) and costs about $ 80 a pound .
But Baum says that when it 's fresh , it tastes " light , creamy and buttery . "
He suggests eating fresh spirulina uncooked ( to maintain its nutrients ) in soups , smoothies and dips .
Highly affordable
Raising spirulina requires a complex mix of nutrients , acid / base balance , temperature and other physical requirements .
But Baum says it 's the food of the future because it can grow in ultra-compact areas , cleans greenhouse gases , and reproduces in a matter of hours so it can be harvested every day .
While laboratory algae tanks can cost tens of thousands of dollars , Baum 's seven - hour workshops costs $ 150 and hand - built tanks go for $ 150 , pretty much at cost .
" I think everyone was pretty thrilled , excited to get growing .
It seemed like a lot more possible for the common person , even with no science background , " said Katia Sussman , 26 , who attended a recent workshop in Berkeley .
Baum 's so serious about making algae accessible that he 's offered to help workshop participants install their tanks for free if they run into trouble .
Baum wants to continue to form the Linux of algae - a DIY community that uses low - cost materials and shares information .
He has hundreds of people on his mailing list and fields inquiries from as far as Italy and Japan .
" Aaron could 've made a lot of money but he 's committed to doing it open source , " said Mike Gittelsohn , a software engineer and fellow algae - phile .
" A lot of companies want to keep their knowledge proprietary . "
Technological impasse
Baum , a calm man with hoop earrings , a chinstrap beard and a self - described " nerdhawk " ( a shaved head with a tuft of hair at the nape of the neck ) had a circuitous journey to his algae obsession .
His father was a psychology professor who wanted to get away from capitalism so the family lived on a 2 - acre farm in New Hampshire with a solar home , chickens , pigs and goats .
Baum 's favorite pastime was exploring the woods .
At 14 , he attended a college - level astronomy course , which sparked his passion for physics .
Baum studied the subject at Harvard and enrolled in an applied physics doctoral program at Stanford where he had a full scholarship as a National Science Fellow .
At the Farm , he developed a new electron source for electron beam microscopy and lithography , and earned multiple patents .
Upon graduating in 1997 , Baum continued developing his research at Intevac , but three years later his technology reached an impasse and he came to a realization : " I was working my butt off to make computer chips go faster , " he said .
He had made money through real estate , so Baum quit .
Musical ball invented
For the next seven years , he was an artist and his work culminated in the " boing " a large inflatable ball - shaped structure with sensors that created music when people bounced on it .
His work appeared everywhere from dance troupe performances to the semifinals of ABC's " American Inventor . "
But Baum missed the intellectual nature of science and the opportunity to help people , so in 2006 , he spent several months researching which scientific topics could most benefit humanity .
" He 's really dedicated to scientific truth and he 's really into serving the planet , " said Amanda Johnsen , Baum 's girlfriend of three years .
The one topic that kept resurfacing was algae .
Baum and a small group built an algae exhibit for Burning Man in 2007 .
The installation consisted of a trailer hosting 16 algae tanks that consumed the exhaust of a generator .
A NASA employee was so inspired by Baum 's work that when he discovered NASA had an algae project , he quickly joined it and gave Baum a call .
Baum advised the group and is now contracted to work on NASA 's Omega project , which studies algae farming to produce biofuel , fertilizer and food .
Aside from NASA and the workshop , Baum is busy writing a novel about global warming and designing an inexpensive photoprobe to measure the health and density of algae .
If the probe pans out , he may launch a company around the product .
But he will always remain dedicated to getting algae to the masses .
" Algae is an incredible resource we have n't tapped , " he says .
" Even people with no dirt can grow fresh food for themselves . "
Image caption Current leglislation bans child pornography but not adult material
A South African government official is proposing a complete ban on digitally distributed pornography .
Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba has approached the country 's Law Reform Commission to ask whether a change in the law is possible .
He has also had talks with the Justice Alliance for South Africa ( JASA ) , a respected group which has written its own draft bill on the issue .
Internet security experts have dismissed the idea as " madness " .
" Cars are already provided with brakes and seatbelts ...
There is no reason why the internet should be provided without the necessary restrictive mechanisms built into it , " said Mr Gigaba .
' Wild west '
JASA proposes that the ban , covering TV but also mobile phones and the web , could be implemented in the form of filters set by internet service providers .
Countries such as Australia and China have already developed filters to block access to certain websites .
Graham Cluley of security firm Sophos said previous attempts by other nations to ban pornography had not been successful .
" One wonders how on earth a democracy like South Africa would be able to introduce such a system , as it's not as though the state has 100 % control over telecommunications , " he told BBC News .
" Although their intentions may be honourable , it 's barking mad to think you will be able to completely outlaw pornography from the web which , is after all , the modern equivalent of the wild west . "
Pornography is a subject of ongoing debate in South Africa .
A terrestrial television channel called ETV caused a storm of controversy when it began broadcasting adult material after midnight in 2002 .
In 2010 a propoosal by satellite broadcaster Multichoice to offer a 24 hour pornography channel was abandoned after a deluge of complaints .

In a surprise announcement , the Songbird developers have announced that they will no longer support Songbird in Linux .
This is really a socking announcement as Songbird has its root in open source .
Songbird will however continue to be available for Windows and Mac .
UPDATE : Now , long term Songbird contributor , Antoine , has finally announced that they are forking the Linux version of the Songbird project and the new music player will be called Nightingale .
For those who do not know what Songbird is - it is a cross-platform Music Player cum Manager .
Some time back we had also told you about 15 add - ons that can improve your Songbird Experience .
( 15 more add - ons )
The decision to stop support for Songbird in Linux is because of the lack of engineers in the Songbird team .
Due to the limited amount of man-power available with the Songbird Team , the Linux build has been lagging behind the others .
According to Georges Auberger , they have to come up with a trade off between continuing development for Linux or bringing in new features .
The Songbird team has decided to go with the latter and stop the Linux support .
This is what Georges Auberger wrote :
After careful consideration , we ’ve come to the painful conclusion that we should discontinue support for the Linux version of Songbird .
Some of you may wonder how a company with deep roots in Open Source could drop Linux and we want you to know it is n’t without heartache .
We have a small engineering team here at Songbird , and , more than ever , must stay very focused on a narrow set of priorities .
Trying to deliver a raft of new features around all media types , and across a growing list of devices , we had to make some tough choices .
Songbird will however maintain a version of the software for use by their engineers who develop on the Linux platform .
This version will be available to the Linux community and they will keep Linux build bots and host the Linux builds on the developer wiki .
However , these builds will not be tested for stability and and will not necessarily pick up new features developed by Songbird ’s team .
Law firms should recognize that lawyer resignations and the loss of clients are inevitable in the modern law practice due to prohibitions on agreements that restrict competition .
Law firms can protect the interests of clients and the firm by adopting best practices that govern lawyer resignations .
Law firms should recognize the investments made in the firm ’s intellectual property and adopt policies that limit misappropriation .
Law firms must survive in a world in which key employees are free to leave at any time and to take as much of the firm ’s business with them as they can .
Many lawyers , motivated by the financial incentives that are part of their separation , believe that there are no rules limiting their solicitation of clients , copying of key documents and compensation for their old firm .
This view may be mistaken , but sorting it out after the resignation or withdrawal is expensive , time - consuming and threatens to draw off the time and attention of key managers .
The grab and go is the unexpected resignation without notice combined with the immediate unilateral solicitation of clients .
Its corollary is the law firm lockout , in which a lawyer that has indicated his or her intention to leave is locked out of the firm and cut off from clients while the clients are intensely solicited by the firm .
Best Practices to Manage Lawer Resignations
Here is a list of some of 10 policies that a law firm should have in place before a key lawyer decides to move his or her practice .
But first , the reality check .
Lawyers will leave and lawyers will take clients .
Not only that , but lawyers have a right to leave and take clients .
The only issue on the table is managing the process .
Law firms , the individual lawyers that work there and the clients that we serve are better served by articulating a clear set of rules beforehand , by adopting key internal policies and by recognizing that resignation need not equate with conflict .
Lawyers and their former law firms should remember that life goes on after the departure .
But when one side tries to gain an unfair advantage over the other , however , life gets complicated and messy .

AS we inch closer to a clearer understanding of the products and practices that unleashed the credit crisis of 2008 , it ’s becoming apparent that those seeking the whole truth are still outnumbered by those aiming to obscure it .
This is the case not only on Wall Street but also in Washington .
Truth seekers the nation over , therefore , are indebted to Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , who in recent days uncovered what he called a government - enabled “ TARP money shuffle . ”
It relates to General Motors , which on April 21 paid the balance of its $ 6.7 billion loan under the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
G.M. trumpeted its escape from the program as evidence that it had turned the corner in its operations .
“ G.M. is able to repay the taxpayers in full , with interest , ahead of schedule , because more customers are buying vehicles like the Chevrolet Malibu and Buick LaCrosse , ” boasted Edward E. Whitacre Jr. , its chief executive .
G.M. also crowed about its loan repayment in a national television ad and the United States Treasury also marked the moment with a press release : “ We are encouraged that G.M. has repaid its debt well ahead of schedule and confident that the company is on a strong path to viability , ” said Timothy F. Geithner , the Treasury secretary .

Is turnabout fair play ?
UPDATE : This post hit the front page of social news site Reddit , and some pretty ironic flaming is going on over there .
What I find amazingly ironic is that most of the arguments are over whether government is good or government is bad , like it could be purely one or the other .
In a representative democracy , the government is us .
We voted for these clowns .
As Pogo famously said , we have met the enemy , and he is us .
Would you argue about whether the American people are good or bad ?
Obviously , some are good and some are bad ( sometimes , the same people are both good and bad , occasionally at the same time ) .
The same thing is true for government — some is good and some is bad .
Which we get is up to us .
As much as I love to bash Fox News , the problem is not Fox News , the problem is all the people who believe their bald - faced propaganda .
If you claim that government is purely bad , does that mean you want no government at all ?
No police , no fire department , no military , no laws , and all transactions done by barter ?
If you claim that government is purely good , does that mean you want government to do everything ?
Own all property , decide what you read ?
I ’m sure there are nut - jobs at both ends of this spectrum , but most people understand that we need some government .
The issue is not , for example , whether or not to have regulations at all , but what regulations actually work and what regulations do n’t work .
The real message of Obama ( as he frequently said himself ) was that we should n’t trust him , that he ca n’t fix everything .
If we want to have a good government , we have to be involved , we have to make sure the government works for us , not the other way around .
When did we become a nation of victims , bleating on and on while not actually doing anything constructive ?

Devils ’ general manager Lou Lamoriello confirmed that Devils ’ defenseman Anssi Salmela will miss 12 - 16 weeks after undergoing surgery Friday to repair a torn ACL .
Salmela injured his knee while playing for Finland in the LG Games earlier this month .
At the time , Salmela ’s agent , Jay Grossman , tweeted the defenseman would head back to New Jersey for tests on the knee .
Grossman first broke the news about the surgery on Wednesday , when he tweeted that Salmela would have surgery Friday .
Lamoriello said the organization will not rush the defenseman back from the injury .
Salmela did not play in the Devils ’ first - round loss against the Philadelphia Flyers .
The defenseman , acquired in the Ilya Kovalchuk trade , only played in nine games for the Devils this season .
He recorded one goal and two assists , but had a +/- rating of - 5 .

Jon Venables served eight years for murdering James Bulger
The mother of James Bulger has said she has a right to know why his killer is back in prison , but is getting " no answers " from the government .
Jon Venables , 27 , who murdered two - year - old James in 1993 , was recalled for breaching the terms of his licence .
James 's mother , Denise Fergus told ITV's This Morning : " I am sick of them closing doors in my face . "
Justice Secretary Jack Straw has confirmed he will answer " urgent questions " in parliament at 1530 GMT .
Earlier he said he is on the " horns of a dilemma " over whether to divulge the allegations .
A number of media outlets have alleged Venables was recalled to prison on suspicion of offences related to images of child abuse .

Mr Straw admitted the details behind Venables being returned to prison were in the public interest , but said there was a risk of prejudicing any further criminal proceedings .
Mrs Fergus said she was " prepared to wait " for details of how Venables breached his licence .
" I do not want to prejudice a trial but I have the right to know , " she said .
Mrs Fergus is to meet Mr Straw in the next couple of days and has prepared a list of questions .
The justice secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " What I want to do is to look at what has already been made public ... to look at that and then to make a judgment about whether there is information that given it is now out in any event we could now confirm . "
Mr Straw stressed Venables was still not facing any charges and that a criminal investigation was still under way .
' Not eating ' Shadow justice secretary , Dominic Grieve , had earlier said there should be a statement to Parliament .
He said Mr Straw had tried to respond to the story and " tried to honour his commitment to the rule of law and not to allow things to be said , or openly stated , which he thinks would interfere with the legal process . "
James Bulger was abducted from a shopping centre in Bootle Mr Grieve said : " He faces a difficulty there , but at the same time it does seem to me now that enough has been said for him to come to Parliament and explain what 's going on . "
Meanwhile Mrs Fergus said Venables ' recall had left her " very emotional " .
She said : " My head has been all over the place .
I do n't know what he has done .
" I do n't know whether he has gone on to kill someone else .
" I have had sleepless nights and I am not eating again - I have had to pull my kids out of school .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I think we have a right to know but I am not surprised they will not tell us jd " It is just one massive rollercoaster again for me . "
Venables and James 's other killer , Robert Thompson , both 10 at the time , snatched two - year - old James from the Strand shopping centre in Bootle , Liverpool in 1993 .
They walked him more than two miles to a railway line where they beat him to death and left his body on the tracks to be hit by a train .
They were given new identities on their release from life sentences in 2001 .

Today I found out there is an irony mark in punctuation .
The irony mark specifically is a backwards question mark : ؟
This mark was originally proposed by the 19th century French poet Alcanter de Brahm , also known as Marcel Bernhardt .
Around the same time other “ second level ” punctuation marks were proposed .
For instance , Tara Liloia and Josh Greenman suggested a “ sarcasm mark ” should be added to common punctuation .
Later , Herve Bazin , in his book , Plumons l’Oiseau in 1966 , used this irony mark and also suggested several other new punctuation marks including the doubt point , certitude point , acclamation point , authority point , indignation point , and love point .
Though the irony mark is n’t widely used or commonly known , it is used occasionally in mostly obscure literary works .
In order to help it become more widely adopted , it has been recently suggested that the “ irony mark ” should be expanded to also include such things as “ sarcasm ” and “ satire ” and similar such notions .

This galactic bubble is known as RCW 120 .
It lies about 4300 light - years away and has been formed by a star at its center .
The star is not visible at these infrared wavelengths but pushes on the surrounding dust and gas with nothing more than the power of its starlight .
New cosmic observations from the European - built Herschelinfrared space observatory have revealed previously hidden details of star formtucked away in distant galaxies .
One snapshot reveals what researchers called an ? impossible ?
star caught in the act of forming .
The new images show thousands of these galaxies andbeautiful star - forming clouds draped across the Milky Way .
These images were part of the presentation of the firstresults from Herschel , which was launch on May 14 of last year , today during a major scientificsymposium held at the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , which runs the observatory , in Noordwijk , Netherlands .
These results challenge old ideas of star birth , andopen new roads for future research .
' Impossible ' star
In a statement , European scientists said Herschel hasdiscovered an " impossible " star so massive it would dwarf our ownsun , but they are perplexed as to how it came to be .
Herschel found the embryonicstar in the star - forming cloud RCW 120 .
The newborn star looks set to turn into one of the biggestand brightest stars in our galaxy within the next few hundred thousand years .
It already contains eight to 10 times the mass of the sun and is still surroundedby an additional 2000 solar masses of gas and dust from which it can feedfurther .
" This star can only grow bigger , " said AnnieZavagno , of the Laboratoire d?Astrophysique de Marseille in France .
Massive stars are rare and short - lived .
To catch one duringformation presents a golden opportunity to solve a long - standing paradox inastronomy .
" According to our current understanding , you should notbe able to form stars larger than eight solar masses , " Zavagno said .
This is because the fierce light emitted by such large starsshould blast away their birth clouds before any more mass can accumulate .
Butsomehow theydo form .
Many of these " impossible " stars are alreadyknown , some containing up to 150 solar masses , but now that Herschel has seenone near the beginning of its life , astronomers can use the data to investigatehow it is defying their theories .
Star birth up close and far away
Herschel can see the stellar birth process because as starsbegin to form , the dust and gas surrounding them is warmed up and starts toemit light in the far - infrared wavelengths , which Herschel measures .
Thediameter of Herschel 's main mirror is four times larger than any other infraredspace telescope and 1.5 times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope .
This size gives Herschel enough resolution and sensitivityto conduct a census of star - forming regions in our galaxy .
" Before Herschel , it was not clear how the material inthe Milky Way came together in high enough densities and at sufficiently lowtemperatures to form stars , " said Sergio Molinari , Istituto di Fisicadello Spazio Interplanetario in Rome , Italy .
Another new space photo released today from the Herschelobservatory covers a number of the Milky Way 's stellar nurseries and show howstars form in these environments .
Stellar embryos first appear inside filaments of glowing dustand gas draped across the galaxy .
These form chains of stellar nurseries , tensof light - years long , wrapping the galaxy in a web of star birth .
Herschel has also been surveying deep space beyond our galaxy , and has measured the infrared light from thousands of other galaxies , spreadacross billions of light - years of the universe .
Each galaxy appears as just apinprick but its brightness allows astronomers to determine the rate of starbirth within it ?
roughly speaking , the brighter the galaxy the more stars itis forming .
Herschel has also challenged conventional wisdom in thisarea by showing that galaxies have been evolving over cosmic time much fasterthan previously thought .
Astronomers believed that galaxies have been formingstars at about the same rate for the last three billion years .
But Herschel shows this is not true .
In the past , there were many more so - called ' starburst ' galaxies forming stars at 10 to 15 times the rate we see in the Milky Waytoday .
But what triggered this frantic activity is not completely understood .
" Herschel will now let us investigate the reasons forthis behavior , " said Steve Eales of Cardiff University in Wales .

The White House announced Tuesday a new strategy for the decades - old War on Drugs , saying it plans to place emphasis on treatment and prevention and urging sharp reductions to drug abuse rates nation - wide .
The plan ’s rosy language , however , does n’t quite mesh with the reality of the drug war ’s budget allotment : a fact that did not go unnoticed by activist group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , which chastised the administration as “ just talking about ” a truly changed strategy over actually moving ahead with one .
ADVERTISEMENT
President Obama ’s plan calls for a 15 percent reduction in the rate of drug use by youths and chronic drug users as well as in drug induced deaths by 2015 .
It aims to cut drug use by young adults , and the incidence of drugged driving , by 10 percent , according to a summary of the strategy released by the White House .
Obama said it make the drug war take a more balanced approach to the persistent , unsolved social and medical problem of addiction that the United States has dealt with through law enforcement and incarceration — a policy that has affected American minority groupsÃ‚Â much more severely than whites .
“ By boosting community - based prevention , expanding treatment , strengthening law enforcement , and working collaboratively with our global partners , we will reduce drug use and the great damage it causes in our communities , ” Obama said in a statement .
“ I am confident that when we take the steps outlined in this strategy , we will make our country stronger and our people healthier and safer , ” he added .
ADVERTISEMENT
In a media advisory , LEAP cited figures reported by RAW STORY in February , noting : “ The strategy devotes 64 percent of the budget to traditional supply reduction strategies like enforcement and interdiction while reserving only 36 percent for demand reduction approaches like treatment and prevention .
And , due to accounting changes made under the Bush administration and maintained by Obama , the budget ratio does n’t even take into account some costs of the ‘ war on drugs ’ such as incarceration . ”
According to 2011 funding “ highlights ” Ã‚Â released by the ONDCP ( PDF link ) , the Obama administration is actually growing the drug war and tilting its funds heavily toward law enforcement over treatment .
The budget places America ’s drug war spending at $ 15.5 billion for fiscal year 2011 ; an increase of 3.5 percent over FY 2010 .
That figure reflects a 5.2 percent increase in overall enforcement funding , growing from $ 9.7 billion in FY 2010 to $ 9.9 billion in FY 2011 .
Addiction treatment and preventative measures , however , are budgeted at $ 5.6 billion for FY 2011 , an increase from $ 5.2 billion in FY 2010 .
ADVERTISEMENT
AnÃ‚Â ONDCP press release described the budget outlay as “ balanced . ”
“ The drug czar is saying all the right things about ending the ‘ war on drugs ’ and enacting a long - overdue balanced strategy focused on a public health approach , ” said Neill Franklin , a former Baltimore cop and incoming executive director of LEAP , according to a release .
“ Unfortunately the reality of the budget numbers do n’t match up to the rhetoric .
Two - thirds of the budget is dedicated to the same old ‘ war on drugs ’ approach and only a third goes to public health strategies .
My experience policing the beat tells me that it ’s certainly time for a new approach , but unfortunately this administration is failing to provide the necessary leadership to actually make it happen instead of just talking about it . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The White House characterized law enforcement ’s role in the strategy as “ critical , ” but placed much of its emphasis on creating new community treatment centers and exploring new options for eradicating addiction .
It also points at prescription drug abuse as the nation ’s fastest - growing drug - related health problem .
“ It ’s great to see the administration starting to talk like they want to actually change failed drug policies , ” Franklin added in the LEAP advisory .
“ But we ca n’t let them get away with claiming that they ’ve ended the ‘ war on drugs ’ while we continue to arrest 800,000 people a year on marijuana charges alone . ”

Kinderporno - Prozess Gericht verurteilt Tauss zu Bewährungsstrafe
Eindeutiges Urteil in einem aufsehenerregenden Prozess : Der frühere SPD - Bundestagsabgeordnete
Tauss ist wegen Besitzes von Kinderpornografie zu einer Bewährungsstrafe verurteilt worden .
Auf seinem Handy waren rund 260 Bilder und etwa 40 Videoclips gefunden worden .
On November 9 , 1938 , in the Tyrolian city of Innsbruck , Richard Berger , president of the local Jewish community , was snatched from his home and beaten to death with rocks and rifle butts , his body deposited in a nearby river .
On the same evening , in an apartment building on Gänsbacherstrasse , Karl Bauer , of whom little is known besides his religious affiliation and his activities on behalf of Innsbruck 's Jewish community , was beaten to death by plainclothes members of the SS .
The vulturine horde moved swiftly upstairs , where they found the Volksfeind Richard Graubart , also Jewish .
He was stabbed to death as his wife and daughter looked on .
This is a small window into the wanton brutality that was Reichskristallnacht — often called the " Night of Broken Glass " — in a medium - sized Austrian city .
A contemporaneous report compiled in Berlin and presided over by the gruesome SS butcher Reinhard Heydrich estimated that 36 Jews were killed across the German Reich .
It was , as historian Saul Friedländer has observed , a rather conservative guess : " Apart from the 267 synagogues destroyed and the 7,500 businessees vandalized , some ninety one Jews had been killed all over Germany and hundreds more had committed suicide or died as a result of mistreatment in the camps . "
Would you be surprised to learn that a similar spasm of violence was recently visited upon African - American politicians in Washington , D.C. ?
Well , credulous reader , The New York Times recently told us that the shock troops of the Tea Party movement engaged in a " small - scale mimicry of Kristallnacht " while protesting the passage of a treasury - busting health care bill .
This bizarre invocation of genocide was to be found on the op - ed page , from the hysterical ex-theater critic and Tea Party obsessive Frank Rich .
Whether or not Rich is aware of it — and when one ascends to the position of New York Times columnist , ignorance is an unconvincing excuse — it is to mass killings that the reader 's mind wanders when the 20th century 's most famous pogrom is invoked .
In a book of essays analyzing the events of 1938 , the scholar Walter H. Pehle 's chosen title lays down the marker : The Jewish Pogrom : From Kristallnacht to Genocide ( Der Judenpogrom : Von der " Reichskristallnacht " zum Völkermord ) .
The anti-Semitic attacks , " spontaneously " carried out " in reaction " to the murder of a Nazi diplomat , were the beginnings of a program of systematic genocide .
Surely Rich , a professional writer his entire adult life , understands that the English language is abundant enough to allow for nuance and precision .
No one was stabbed this March , no limp bodies dumped into the Anacostia River , no buildings burned .
A few lunkheads broke windows ( and if this is enough to provoke comparisons to Kristallnacht , the anti-globalization crowd must be the protest equivalent of the Einsatzgruppen ) and one unidentified protester called Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) a " faggot , " for which he was rebuked by fellow protesters .
Despite gleeful recitation by the media , claims of racial taunts directed at African - American congressmen have yet to be substantiated — but more on that in a moment .
One stray columnist comparing the rowdy Tea Party crowds to German genocidaires could perhaps be explained away .
An inattentive editor , a moment of regretful anger seeping into the prose .
But to Rich 's colleague Paul Krugman , the hyperpartisan economist and Nobel Prize winner , the Nazi comparison was a useful one , although it did demand subtlety .
" What has been really striking , " Krugman wrote after the health care bill passed , " has been the eliminationist rhetoric of the G.O.P. , coming not from some radical fringe but from the party 's leaders " ( emphasis added ) .
If your dictionary is unfamiliar with the word eliminationist , that 's because of the term 's recent vintage , coined in 1996 by Harvard political scientist Daniel Jonah Goldhagen .
In his book Hitler 's Willing Executioners : Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust , Goldhagen argued that far from being bullied and terrorized into allowing its government to commit genocide in their name , most Germans were imbued with an eliminationist hatred of Jews — i.e. , a desire that Jews be eliminated from Aryan society — which transitioned smoothly into an exterminationist orgy of violence .
Of the 40 references to " eliminationism " in the Times archive , all but one refer to the destruction of European Jewry .
The sole standout is Krugman , who , as we have seen , is referencing the Republican Party 's opposition to health care legislation .
( Though in fairness to Krugman , this is something of a requirement for those anointed by the Nobel Committee .
Nobelist Harold Pinter said that the only comparison one could make to Bush - era America was to that of Nazi Germany . )
Moving downmarket to the New York Daily News , one finds a column by sports columnist Mike Lupica declaring that the crowds of health care protesters are " no longer about political dissent .
It is about storm trooper sound bites , and hate . "
It is unclear what a " storm trooper soundbite " is ( or why this would be incompatible with " political dissent , " no matter how noxious ) , though Lupica is unambiguously guiding readers towards the Nazi image ; towards the brown - shirted tough rounding up dissidents , cracking jaws , and kicking teeth .
Examining the Tea Party protesters , Washington Post columnist Colbert King saw faces whose very visual cues betrayed direct lineage to overt racists from a half - century before .
" Those same jeering faces , " King wrote , " could be seen gathered around the Arkansas National Guard troopers who blocked nine black children from entering Little Rock 's Central High School in 1957 . "
If the examples of Alabama and Mississippi in the 1950s were too distant , King told readers that he had also seen those very faces in the 1990s , at a rally in support of neo -Nazi agitator David Duke .
It is depressing that , for quick political gain , people like King will debase the legacy of the civil rights movement by comparing peaceful ( and often misguided ) protesters with the thuggery of Bull Connor and the racist Birmingham police department .
But just when it looked like we had scraped the bottom of the hyperbole barrel , the always vapid Jesse Jackson told the breast - obsessed readers of Huffington Post that the Tea Partiers reminded him of an era when some Americans responded to social change " with terror , bombed churches , and killed freedom marchers . "
Many referenced the claim that Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga. ) was , in Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D - Mo. ) description , met with a " chorus , " of racist taunts , though no evidence has materialized to substantiate these accusations — and the alleged chorus occurred in an area with a higher video camera density than a Paris Hilton birthday party .
Indeed , claims the Cleaver was spat upon were debunked when video surfaced of a spittle - flecked protester shouted " kill the bill " as the congressman passed , but not deliberately hocking a loogie on him .
So if the events on Capital Hill were indeed the moral equivalent of a " mini-Kristallnacht , " then questioning this tale of racism is a David Irving - like act , right ?
Those who wondered about the contradicting claims surrounding the Lewis charge were , naturally , themselves derided as racist .
But if the country 's largest newspapers can accuse those assembled to " kill the bill " of being motivated by racial animus , " eliminationism , " Nazism , or old Dixie nostalgia , is it so unfair to ask for verifiable proof ?
It is n't unreasonable to think that amongst the Tea Party protesters one can find the ignorant and hateful .
Many of the protesters seem to believe that the president of the United States of America is a communist , demonstrating that they have a level of historical understanding on par with Frank Rich .
But that critique is something rather different than imputing a racist motivation to anyone deeply concerned about an enormously expensive health care bill .
Some of this is the problem of now , of rendering apocalyptic judgments about events that are only just unfolding .
In the weeks following the 9/11 attacks , Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter declared solemnly and with regret that irony had vanished in the smoke and embers of the demolished World Trade Center , a judgment that seemed plausible at the time .
Rereading some of the commentary produced in the aftermath of the attacks is like looking at old high school yearbook photos — good god , what were we thinking ?
Likewise , a journalist who chased Bill Clinton scandals for a conservative magazine in the 1990s recently told me how silly it all seemed with the clarifying benefit of hindsight .
At the time , he said , it all seemed so reasonable .
And while we are on the topic of 9/11 , how quickly we forget that in the editorial rooms and bar rooms of the Bush era , the vapid phrase on the lips of my liberal - minded comrades , repeated like a Maharishi mantra , was that " dissent is patriotic . "
Now dissent has become the first indication of incipient fascism and subterranean racism .
If Rich sees in the current debate the seeds of pogrom , if Krugman sees the rhetoric of " eliminationism , " forget national heath care — we need a national history lesson .

Image caption UN forces will remain in DR Congo until June 2011
The UN Security Council has voted to authorise the withdrawal of up to 2,000 peacekeepers from the Democratic Republic of Congo by 30 June .
However , it has delayed a decision on the full withdrawal of its 20,500 - strong force , as sought by Congolese President Joseph Kabila , to next year .
The 15 - member body unanimously adopted a resolution to withdraw the troops " where the security situation permits " .
It also decided to retain a UN presence in DR Congo until 30 June 2011 .
The force , known as Monuc , will be renamed UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in DR Congo - or Monusco - from 1 July .
The resolution allows it to comprise up to 19,815 military personnel , 760 military observers , 391 police personnel and 1,050 personnel of formed police units .
Sexual violence
UN troops have had a mixed record in DR Congo , with accusations of sex abuse , gold smuggling and running from rebels .
UN IN DR CONGO First sent in 1999
Currently 20,509 - strong - world 's biggest peace force
Has been criticised for not standing up to rebels
Last year accused of human rights abuses
Peacekeepers previously accused of gold smuggling and sex abuse UN - DR Congo rebel fight ' failing ' Q&A : DR Congo conflict
Peacekeepers arrived in DR Congo in 1999 , initially to deal with the nationwide civil war .
Since the end of the conflict in 2003 , they have been dealing with the various militias which have been looting the rich mineral resources in the east of the country .
Most of them have now either been disarmed , absorbed by the Congolese army or reduced to gangs of armed bandits .
Mr Kabila believes national security forces can deal with the remaining problems and has indicated he wants UN troops out by the end of 2011 .
However , some analysts believe the region remains too unstable to cope with the force 's withdrawal .
Sexual violence is a particular problem , with more than 8,000 women raped during fighting in 2009 , according to the UN .
The situation caused Monuc troops to begin escorting women to market .
The UN ruled that the future shape of its force would be determined by operational progress in the east and the Congolese government 's ability to protect citizens and control the country .
" The protection of civilians must be given priority , " its resolution said , adding that it authorised peacekeepers to use " all necessary means " to carry out this mandate .
May 16 , 2010  -- Sen. Jeff Sessions , the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , told ABC News ' " This Week " that Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan " violated the law " by not allowing military recruiting on the Harvard Law School campus when she was dean there , and added the issue is " no little - bitty matter . "
But Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , appearing on " This Week " with Sessions , dismissed the argument as " sound and fury signifying nothing . "
The controversy revolves around Kagan 's decision to prohibit military recruiting directly on the law school 's campus because the military 's " Do n't Ask Don't Tell " policy prohibiting gays from openly serving in the armed forces violated Harvard Law School 's anti-discrimination policy .
When the Supreme Court ruled that a law tying federal funding of schools to military recruiting was constitutional , Kagan allowed on - campus military recruiting to resume so the school would n't lose funding .
Asked about the issue by host Jake Tapper , Sessions , R - Ala. , said , " This is no little - bitty matter , Jake .
She would not let them come to the area that does the recruiting on the campus .
They had to meet with some student veterans , and this is not acceptable .
It was a big error .
" That went on for a number of years , " Sessions said .
" It was a national issue .
People still remember the debate about it .
" She reversed the policy , " Sessions said .
" When she became dean , they were allowing the military to come back on campus and had been for a couple of years . "
Leahy : ' Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing '
Leahy insisted that the whole affair was much ado about nothing .
" Well , this is like in Shakespeare , " he said .
" Sound and fury signifying nothing .
The recruiters were always on the Harvard campus .
She 's shown her respect for the veterans there .
...
Recruiting went on at Harvard every single day throughout the time she was there . "
Sessions strongly disagreed .
" She disallowed them from the normal recruitment process on campus .
She went out of her way to do so , " he told Tapper .
" She was a national leader in that , and she violated the law of the United States at various points in the process . "
Other Republican voices have been even sharper .
" She , as Dean of the Harvard Law School , took an effort to block the American military from the Harvard campus all the way to the Supreme Court during a war , " former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Saturday night an NRA convention .
" And that is an act so unbecoming of an American that she should be disqualified from the very beginning . "
Kagan , currently serving as solicitor general , wrote vividly about her decision regarding military recruiting in 2005 in a letter addressed to the Harvard Law School community .
" I have said before how much I regret making this exception to our antidiscrimination policy .
I believe the military 's discriminatory employment policy is deeply wrong -- both unwise and unjust .
And this wrong tears at the fabric of our own community by denying an opportunity to some of our students that other of our students have , " Kagan wrote .
" The importance of the military to our society -- and the great service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- heightens , rather than excuses , this inequity . "
Asking Personal Questions About Kagan : Sessions Says " Be Careful "
Amid some reporting on Kagan 's personal life , Tapper asked Sessions how far is too far in that area .
" I think you 've got to be careful about that , " Sessions said .
" I do n't believe that is a fundamental judgment call on whether a person can be a good judge or not . "
Sessions said legal matters were more important .
" We need to know how able they are to ascertain the real legal issues in a case and deciding it fairly and justly .
Will they restrain their personal political views and follow the law faithfully and serve under the Constitution ?
That 's the fundamental test in personal integrity , " he said .
" Those are questions that go to the heart of whether a person will be an able judge or not . "
Upcoming Hearings Will Be a ' Big Deal '
Sessions said Kagan 's confirmation hearings will be a " big deal " and that they are particularly important because Kagan " has so little other record , " having never served as a judge .
Sessions explained he will be looking to understand how broad her reading of the Constitution is .
" I think we'd like to know , in a real honest sense , whether her philosophy of law is so broad in her interpretation of the Constitution that you are not faithful to the Constitution and laws , " Sessions told Tapper .
" In other words , a judge under their oath says you serve under the Constitution , not above it .
So we want to know whether she faithfully will follow it even if she does n't like it .
" I think we 'll be looking at her testimony , because she has so little other record , " Sessions added .
" It 's going to be a big deal .
It 's so important how she testifies . "
' Real Questions ' About Kagan
Later , on the This Week roundtable , Salon.com blogger Glenn Greenwald and former Obama White House Counsel Gregory Craig clashed about Kagan 's experience .
" There are real questions about Elena Kagan , " Greenwald said .
" Look at the great legal issues that have confronted the court : Roe v. Wade ... gay rights , affirmative action , the president 's authority in the war on terror , " he said .
" Can you point to anything that she has said or written in the past that would let Americans know what she believes about those issues ? " he asked Craig .
" What you 're arguing for here is a judge and [ that ] only judges should be on the Supreme Court , " Craig said .
" She 's not a judge , so she does n't have the 17 years of writing opinions that Sonia Sotomayor does . "
" But lots of law professors have written numerous things about those questions .
Has she ? "
Greenwald interrupted .
" She 's written five or six law review articles .
She taught classes , " Craig replied .
" So what has she said that would enable people to know about those great issues that have confronted the country and the court , " Greenwald asked .
" Anything ? "
" Yes ! " Craig replied .
" What is it ?
What are those things ? "
Greenwald demanded .
" Every day Elena Kagan has taught students , administered law professors , " Craig said .
" What has she said about those issues ? " Greenwald asked again .
" Well , " Craig said , " she 'll answer questions about that when she 's asked . "

Most deaths occurred during an assault by police and army troops on Tivoli Gardens , a volatile Kingston slum and bastion of support for suspected drug kingpin Christopher ‘ Dudus ’ Coke , Deputy Police Commissioner Glenmore Hinds told reporters .
Coke was still at large .
Tension gripped the upper middle class community of Kirkland Heights early on Thursday when word came that he was hiding there in a house owned by a friend .
Police stormed the area and a two - hour firefight broke out .
Keith Clarke , the 58 - year - old brother of former Minister of Industry and Commerce Claude Clarke , was killed by security personnel , apparently caught in the crossfire .
The violence in the capital started on Sunday as Coke ’s supporters torched police stations to protest his potential extradition to the United States .
He was indicted last year in New York on drug trafficking and gunrunning charges .
Prime Minister Bruce Golding declared a state of emergency , giving security forces broad powers to restrict freedom of movement , search premises and detain suspects without warrants .
Four of the dead were police and soldiers .
The rest were civilians , mostly young men .
Violence in Tivoli Gardens eased on Thursday and security forces let journalists tour the bullet - scarred neighborhood , where residents complained of abuse by police and soldiers .
“ They shoot up my house and they even killed two men in the house next to mine , ” one woman said .
“ They also killed a youth in my house after they sent me outside , ” a man told Reuters .
Many people said they were hungry and had not been allowed to leave their homes to buy food .
Others were angry at the prime minister , who is also their member of Parliament .
“ He has abandoned us .
We do n’t want him around here again .
He has let us down , ” one woman shouted in reference to Golding , who has led the Caribbean island since 2007 .
Amnesty International called for a thorough investigation into the deaths .
Security forces had recovered only about a half - dozen weapons , “ quite a low number compared with the number of people killed , ” the rights group said .
“ The human rights record of the police force in Jamaica is dire .
Every year the police are responsible for a high number of killings , ” said Kerrie Howard , deputy director of Amnesty International ’s America ’s program .
“ Only an impartial and thorough investigation of every death or injury caused by the use of force will enable the facts to be established regarding possible unlawful killings or extra-judiciary executions . ”
Police in Jamaica killed 253 people in 2009 , a figure consistent with previous years on the island of 2.8 million .

TAYLORSVILLE -- Police in Taylorsville say a drug deal led to the stabbing death of an 18 - year - old woman Wednesday night .
They are now looking for three men .
Heather Quast and her friend 21 - year - old Eric Russom were on the Jordan Parkway when they were both stabbed .
Relatives of Russom say they had arranged to meet three men who wanted to buy marijuana .
Police say the attack happened in a field off the parkway at about 4100 South .
Russom told his family that one of the men pulled out a fake gun , and then another pulled out a knife .
" When the people attacked them , Eric tried his best to keep heather behind him ; and when she tried to run , they wanted money , " Russom 's mother said .
" When [ Heater ] tried to run , they went after her , " Russom 's mother continued .
" Eric got slashed many times in the process .
He let the purse go when he saw heather fall , and he took his shirt off , and he tried to save her life . "
Heather Quast
Quast was stabbed in the stomach , and Russom was stabbed in the face , near his eye .
Quast and Russom were taken to Intermountain Medical Center in critical condition .
Once there , Quast died .
Police say Russom 's injuries are serious but not severe .
His family says he could lose his eye , but the pain he feels from Quast 's death is much worse because he could n't save her .
" As soon as my brother knew what was going on , my brother started fighting with the people , " brother Joseph Russom said .
" They pulled out a knife , and he told Heather to run , and he did n't know that she got stabbed . "
Family members say Russom and Quast had been living along the Parkway .
Quast 's grandmother , Sharlene Nolan , says the teen 's parents asked her to leave home because she was doing and dealing drugs .
Nolan says Quast was a good girl who loved music .
She says Quast started hanging out with the wrong crowd .
" She was doing really good , then just got with the wrong crowd , " Nolan said .
A neighbor who knows Quast and Russom said , " She was a good girl .
She really was .
A little confused , a little mixed up , but it 's a shame that they live on the river like they do . "
Nolan thinks Russom may know the men responsible for Quast 's death .
" My daughter says they feel that the kid knows who they were , because he did n't get hurt but was carrying a wad of money , " Nolan said .
" Knowing Heather , she 's like her mom .
She 'd fight and put up a fight before she let them take the money . "
Heather is also survived by her parents , Rachelle and Jerry Quast , and sister Amber , who is just 18 months apart .
Heather was to turn 19 years old in July .
Meanwhile , police are looking for three males in their late teens or early - 20s ; one of them has a tattoo on his neck .
" Everybody that is available is out here helping us right now , trying to help us catch these people , " said Taylorsville police Detective Shannon Bennett .
" It 's very concerning to us .
We want to find these people and get them off the street . "
Officers are talking to Russom , whom they say is cooperating with them .
He is now out of the hospital and helping investigators look for evidence at the scene of the crime .
Anyone with any information on this case should call police at 801-743-7000 .

According to Friedrich von Hayek , the development of welfare socialism after World War II undermined freedom and would lead western democracies inexorably to some form of state - run serfdom .
Hayek had the sign and the destination right but was entirely wrong about the mechanism .
Unregulated finance , the ideology of unfettered free markets , and state capture by corporate interests are what ended up undermining democracy both in North America and in Europe .
All industrialized countries are at risk , but it ’s the eurozone – with its vulnerable structures – that points most clearly to our potentially unpleasant collective futures .
As a result of the continuing euro crisis , European Central Bank ( ECB ) now finds itself buying up the debt of all the weaker eurozone governments , making it the – perhaps unwittingly – feudal boss of Europe .
In the coming years , it will be the ECB and the European Union who dictate policy .
The policy elite who run these structures – along with their allies in the private sector – are the new overlords .
We can argue about who exactly are the peasants , the vassals , and the lords under this model – and what services exactly will end up being exchanged .
But there is no question we are seeing a sea change in the post - war system of property , power , and prosperity across Western Europe , just as Hayek feared .
An overwhelming debt burden will bring down even the proudest people .
The ECB - EU approach will not of course return countries to reasonable levels of growth – the debt overhang is simply too large .
The southern and western periphery of the eurozone cannot grow out of their debts under these arrangements , and so will stumble from stabilization program to stabilization program – just like Latin America did during the 1980s .
This is bound to be acrimonious , leading to hostile politics , social unrest , and more economic crises .
The International Monetary Fund will do just what the EU and ECB asks to keep the charade in place .
The old days when all member countries got nice presents from the euro zone are long gone ; now it is all instructions and austere requirements .
But enough resources will be provided to keep rolling everything over .
The top three French players – President Nicolas Sarkozy , Jean - Claude Trichet ( ECB ) , and Dominique Strauss - Kahn ( IMF ) – seem to be enjoying themselves ; presumably they think they will end up running things .
More surprising is the reaction of other European leaders , who genuinely seem able to convince themselves that what they are doing makes sense – as opposed to being a series of crazed improvisations .
The market is telling them that their euro rescue schemes make no sense , and the market is probably right .
Faced with the ugly reality of the loss of confidence in European finance and institutions , the Germans and even the normally sensible Swedish government are increasingly blaming “ irrational ” markets and speculators for homegrown problems .
The currently preferred messy solution of the EU leaves the world at risk of shocks like we observed this week .
This particular iteration may blow over , but another will arise when there is backlash in Athens , Dublin , Lisbon , or – heaven forbid – Madrid .
Meanwhile , rational market participants are selling debt of risky nations , and getting out of the euro .
The whole fiasco is now leading to a messy shift away from risky assets all around the world , and the cost to the world of such volatility is not small .
Debt peonage looms for a wide range of countries that were recently thought immune to serious fiscal crisis , including the United States and UK .
It is inappropriate for the Europeans to subject the rest of the world to these large , chronic risks .
Europe should also recognize how disorderly insolvencies end – it is never pretty .
The 1970s crisis in Britain is the model for what may go wrong .
Ongoing large strikes , populations disenchanted with all authority , and great economic disruption are inevitably the outcome .
When the assets are very cheap , deep - pocketed investors from the US , China , India and of course Russia will swoop in for the crown jewels .
What should be done ?
It is time to look in the mirror and recognize the problem .
Several nations in Europe are bordering on insolvency , and it is now pretty clear that we should n’t just “ bandage ” that over for a few years with large aid packages .
To deal with this insolvency we need to restructure the debts of those nations .
But this has to be done in a way that does not destabilize Europe ’s fragile banking system .
And it needs to be credible enough so that once restructured , the troubled nations will be able to finance themselves easily .
Europe now has the 750bn package of assistance in place , and they should use it to fix the problem once and for all .
The ingredients for a solution include :
Announcing an orderly restructuring of the periphery countries ’ debt ( Greece , Portugal , Ireland and possibly others also ) .
This should start with a standstill and a program of fiscal financing while budget cuts are put in place .
Regulatory forbearance should be explicitly provided to all European banks , with a backstop of ECB liquidity , and a 500bn euro support program to provide capital injections – as was done in the United States , 2008 - 09 .
The nations that are not restructured need to be supported via ECB liquidity lines that guarantee the rollover of their government debt .
The G20 needs to provide support to prevent chaotic foreign exchange markets but also accept a large further devaluation of the euro .
At some point the G20 will need to intervene to support the euro via central banks .
Such a comprehensive package of measures would be painful , but it is the only realistic solution to this chaos .
It would also restore some credibility to Mr. Trichet and the ECB , who , at this stage , appear captives the fiscal crises in the euro zone .
Unfortunately , there is no leadership today in Europe that could take such decisive actions , so Europe will only reform itself dragged kicking and screaming through successive crises until the current , and many ensuing , problems are resolved .
The UK and US need to prepare themselves for more storms .
The United States will be in the more pleasant position as the world ’s safe haven , but this will only encourage America ’s profligate politicians to spend more and build more debt .
The UK will bear much more pain from euro devaluation and financial dislocation , all exacerbated by its own large deficit and debts .
We might well see one more invasion across the channel , this time by bond vigilantes who question Britain ’s ability to rein in inflation as it builds too large debts .
At the end of this great tumult , Europe and the UK will have sound fiscal regimes .
Debt will be defaulted on or inflated away , and nations will have dramatically cut spending .
Hayek ’s predicted demise of western society will prove correct , but welfare systems will prove the victim , rather than the mechanism , erased by a political and financial elite gone awry .
An edited version of this article appeared in the Sunday Telegraph ( UK ) this morning .
A couple of modern traditions are taking place for hockey watchers this week .
On a daily basis the NHL is releasing the names of the " finalists " of its major trophies , the three players who received the most votes for the Hart , Norris , Vezina , Calder , and Lady Byng Trophies , among others .
It 's a bit of a gimmick , since there are no " finals " ; the order of finish is already known , but wo n't be released until the awards gala at the end of the season .
The process does serve to highlight the fine seasons of more than just the winners .
The other tradition is that of second - guessing the voters .
Which players made the short list on the strength of their reputation rather than their actual play ?
Who 's the " seen him good " , or for that matter the " remember him good " , darling of the media ?
Who 's the up - and - comer who is getting touted for an award before he 's quite there yet ?
Who 's the deserving guy on the local team who yet again has been cruelly overlooked ?
One award that has always prompted dark mutterings about the competency of the voters is the Frank J. Selke Trophy for the best defensive forward .
Defensive efficiency is notoriously difficult to measure , so it has always seemed to be more of a reputation award than anything .
While many deserving players have been bypassed over the years * coughJariKurricough * the list of Selke winners stands up to scrutiny pretty darn well , featuring as it does many great checkers and two - way players and only a couple " flavour of the month " duds like Steve Kasper and his minus - 18 .
It seems to me that defensive play is one aspect of the game that we surely have a better handle on nowadays .
There are many more statistical categories that capture a player 's role within the game and within his team , from the NHL's own much - maligned RTSS numbers to some of the more reliable metrics gathered and disseminated by keen observers of the game like Gabe Desjardins and Vic Ferrari .
We now have reliable data on where a player is deployed ( ZoneStart ) , against whom ( Quality of Competition ) , and how the play flows when he is out there ( Corsi ) .
In 2009 - 10 the Selke finalists are an interesting group .
Pavel Datsyuk , Ryan Kesler , and Jordan Staal all played on solid playoff - bound teams that finished 4th or 5th in their respective conferences with 101 - 103 points .
Datsyuk and Staal have faced off in the last two Stanley Cup Finals , while Kesler 's team reached the SCF as recently as 1994 ... oops , maybe one of these things is not like the others . :)
All are centres , although in somewhat different roles within their teams ; for discussion purposes let 's consider Datsyuk a first - line centre , Kesler a second - liner , and Staal the prototypical third - line checking centre .
After the jump we 'll have a look at their relative performances across a broad spectrum of statistical metrics .

+- /60 - 4.34 n/a - 3.8 2/5 - 5.44 4/5
I have tried to group these stats in logical clumps , showing both raw totals and where the player ranks among the forwards with 40 +
GP on his own team in each category .
My two primary sources were NHL.com and behindthenet.ca ; the stats from the former show the players ranking as a single number , while the latter shows that ranking against the number of eligible teammates ( 13 in each case ; I removed Alexei Ponikarovsky from the Pittsburgh equation as he only played 16 games with the Pens ) .
The PK stats at bottom show only those forwards meeting the dual standards of 40 + GP and 1:00 + SH TOI /G. I chose to omit powerplay statistics altogether as they have little bearing on defensive performance .
Note also that I have shown in bold , those categories which I deem to be purely or primarily defensive in nature , and in italics those which measure two - way play .
First of all , the similarities .
All three are big - minute centres , ranking 1st , 2nd and 3rd respectively on their teams in TOI , in keeping with their primary roles on the 1st , 2nd and 3rd lines respectively .
All three lead their squads in Shifts per game , which suggests extra defensive assignments for Kesler and Staal .
All three had very similar offensive production at even strength , with the discrepancy in their overall totals due to Staal 's lack of powerplay time and production .
All three have very solid plus numbers in Relative Corsi despite facing competition and ZoneStarts that are well above team averages in all cases .
The case for Datsyuk : The Red Wings star is gunning for his third consecutive Selke and the numbers make a compelling argument .
Once again Datsyuk led the loop in Takeways by a very wide margin , almost 60 % ahead of Kesler who ranked second in the NHL .
Of course such numbers must be taken with a grain of salt given the apparent lack of a league - wide standard , but it 's hard to deny Datsyuk is a master of the art of puck - stealing .
Particularly impressive is his ability to challenge for the puck without taking penalties ; not only will that " gentlemanly and effective " combination help him win his fifth straight Lady Byng , it speaks directly to excellent defence that he does n't often put his team at a manpower disadvantage .
Datsyuk has the best GA /60 of any of the three candidates .
Contra : Datsyuk faces slightly lower QualComp than his rivals , and also plays with top - level teammates .
His penalty - killing role is much less than the others , surely an important consideration for a defensive player .
His great Relative Corsi in that situation has to be discounted significnatly due to small sample size ; it 's not that he can't kill penalties , it 's just that he does n't .
The case for Kesler :
By raw numbers ( although not team ranking ) Kesler had the toughest ZoneStart of the three , with an O - zone Pct. below 45 % compared to the others ' ~ 50 % .
He was by far the leading shot blocker , and the most effective faceoff man overall , taking many more draws than Datsyuk and achieving a much better percentage than Staal .
He has a great Tk : Gv ratio which can only partially be written off to home scorer bias .
He faces the toughs playing with second - level teammates .
Contra : Kesler was a minus player at even strength , with a lousy ES GA of over 3 per 60 , almost a goal per hour worse than his rivals and ranking a lowly 12th on his own club .
This mirrors his poor numbers in on - ice Sv % and PDO# , which depending on how you feel about the dice roll of percentages , either explains away Kesler 's poor numbers or is symptomatic of too many gold - star scoring chances against on his watch .
Kesler also takes more penalties than his rivals , though he draws more as well .
The case for Staal :
This guy is a very balanced player , ranking among the top 6 forwards on his team in every single category listed , and in the top 3 in a rank majority of those .
He 's a horse on the PK , ranking second in the NHL ( behind only Jay McClement ) in SH TOI .
Like Kesler , he plays top level opposition with second level linemates ; but in Jordan 's case he manages to outscore by a healthy margin in the process .
Contra : Staal 's faceoff percentage is still on the shady side of 50 % ; although he has significantly improved in this category every year he 's been in the league - he was a Coglianoesque 37.1 % as a rookie in ' 06-07 - this is one indicator that this guy is still a kid ( just 21 this season ) .
My " vote " :
Of course I do n't have one , that said I daresay I 've already put more time into researching this than 95 % of the PHWA members who do cast ballots . :p
If I was to throw out " seen him good " and simply rely on number crunching , one method might be to simply identify a basket of key categories and see how the guy ranks on his own team across the board .
For argument 's sake I would tend toward a disparate sixpack of metrics that includes QualComp , ZoneStart , SH TOI , GA On / 60 , Relative Corsi , and Tk : Gv ratio , with the first three identifying the player 's role on his team and the last three crudely measuring his performance both with and without the puck .
If one was to apply this method to this year 's candidates , the surprise winner of the Selke Trophy would be Jordan Staal .
Those choices ( and omissions ) are by nature arbitrary .
No doubt arguments can be raised to include other metrics , or to use a weighting system ; I welcome discussion in the comments section .
Being a lazy bastard at heart I have only done the detailed comp of the three finalists , so I also invite you to submit names of other worthy Selke candidates - Mike Richards ?
Martin Hanzal ?
Brandon Sutter ? - who might have similar or even better statistical qualifications than the above three .
Nonetheless , I am satisfied that the information at hand confirms that each of the three finalists has staked a solid claim to the trophy .

This is one of those tips that most real geeks already know , but chances are there 's somebody reading this that does n't know about it — if you hold down the Shift key while right - clicking on any folder , including the desktop background , you 'll see a new item for " Open command window here " , that will open a command prompt with that folder as the default path .
This tip only works in Windows 7 or Vista , for Windows XP you 'll need to use a registry hack to accomplish the same thing .
We can't mention this tip without telling you how to do the opposite — you can open a file browser from your current command prompt directory as well .

Hide Secret Data Inside Any File

There 's any number of great ways to hide data from prying eyes — TrueCrypt , anyone ?
But if you want to simply hide some text data inside a secret " compartment " , you can abuse the Alternate Data Streams feature in the underlying NTFS file system .
All you have to do is open up a command prompt , and then use a command similar to this :
notepad SomeFile.txt:SecretWordHere.txt
The special filename with the colon and second filename tells NTFS to actually store the data in an alternate stream , instead of the regular file .
You can put whatever you want into the file , and nobody will be able to access it unless they know the command to retrieve it .

Tile or Cascade Specific Windows

Sure , Windows 7 has the awesome Aero Snap feature that lets you drag windows to the side of the screen to fill one side , but what if you want to cascade them , or tile them stacked on top of each other ?
Back in the XP and Vista days this was relatively simple — you could hold down the Ctrl key while selecting multiple windows on the taskbar , and then right - click on any of them to tile or cascade them .
For Windows 7 , you can do the same thing , but you 'll need to open up Task Manager instead , hold Ctrl , select the open windows , and then you can cascade them from there .

Have you ever tried to select a bunch of files while holding the Ctrl key , and then accidentally copied all of them because you slightly moved your mouse ?
Maybe you just deleted a file and do n't feel like hunting it down in the Recycle bin .
In either case , you can use the Ctrl + Z shortcut key to immediately reverse whatever you did n't mean to do .
Readers will probably point out that you can also do this from the context menu in Windows 7 , but it 's surprising how many people do n't realize the keyboard shortcut works .

Have you ever wondered how to restart the Start Menu ?
The more tech - savvy among you probably know that you can just pop open Task Manager and kill the explorer .
exe process , but there 's actually another way to do it built right into Windows 7 and Vista — it 's just a bit of a secret .
Hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys , then open up the start menu , and right - click anywhere on the blank space .
You 'll see a new menu with an Exit Explorer item on it , which will immediately terminate the desktop shell — keep in mind to reopen it you 'll need to use Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager , and then File –> Run and type in explorer .exe .
That 's not the only right - click menu trick you can do here , however — if you want to open up the Start Menu folder in Windows 7 , you can right - click on the All Programs menu item to access the old Start Menu context menu from previous versions of Windows .

If you want to save the step of renaming the file , you can make sure that you right - click on top of the file that you want to have the same name .
For instance , if we had right - clicked on the Readme. txt file in the screenshot and used the Send To –>
Compressed feature , the resulting file would have been called Readme.zip .
Since that 's not very helpful , it 's better to right - click on one of the selected HTGBack.x files , which will give us HTGBack.zip instead .

The second series of David Mitchell 's Soap Box continues with David 's views on getting your hair cut

Israel was sharply rebuked and accused of war crimes and serious breaches of international law in Amnesty International ’s annual report , published on Wednesday .
The 430 - page report provides an overview of the state of human rights worldwide and lists each country ’s alleged human rights abuses during the previous year .
The chapter dedicated to Israel focused on Israel ’s human rights violations during and in the aftermath of Operation Cast Lead , as well as its treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank .
“ Israeli forces committed war crimes and other serious breaches of international law in the Gaza Strip during a 22 - day military offensive code - named Operation ‘ Cast Lead ’ that ended on 18 January .
“ Among other things , they carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians , targeted and killed medical staff , used Palestinian civilians as ‘ human shields ’ and indiscriminately fired white phosphorus over densely populated residential areas , ” stated the report .
The report also blamed Israel for creating an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza by enforcing what Amnesty describes as an “ illegal blockade .
”
“ The restrictions included a military blockade of the Gaza Strip , which effectively imprisoned the 1.5 million residents and resulted in a humanitarian crisis .
“ Despite this , Israel often stopped international aid and humanitarian assistance from entering Gaza .
Permission to leave Gaza to receive medical treatment was denied or delayed for hundreds of seriously ill Palestinians and at least 28 individuals died while waiting for permission to travel , ” read the report .
The report also stated that Israeli forces committed acts of torture , held prisoners without trial , forcibly evicted Palestinians , demolished their homes and expropriated their land in the West Bank and east Jerusalem .
The section of the report detailing human rights abuses in the Palestinian Authority noted Palestinian liberation organizations ’ attacks on Israeli civilians and criticized Hamas ’s campaign of abductions , deliberate and unlawful killings , torture and death threats against people accused of collaborating with Israel .
“ More than 30 individuals were summarily killed .
Scores of others were shot in the legs , kneecapped or otherwise injured in ways intended to cause permanent disability , or they were severely beaten or otherwise tortured or ill - treated .
These abuses were committed with impunity , with the apparent approval of the Hamas leadership , ” read the report .
Hamas ’s continual refusal to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross access to kidnapped soldier Gilad Schalit is also mentioned , as is the Israeli fatalities and injuries sustained from Gaza - based rocket attacks .
The Amnesty report also highlighted violence between Fatah and Hamas forces , accusing both factions of human rights violations , including arbitrary detention without charges or trial , excessive force and torture , causing civilian deaths and clampdowns on freedom of expression .
Amnesty International ’s Israel director , Itai Epstein , backed the findings of the Goldstone report , calling it “ well balanced , ” and said that if Israel and Hamas fail to conduct an independent investigation on human rights abuses during Operation Cast Lead , as the United Nations Security Council demanded of them , there would be little choice but to refer them to the International Criminal Court .
“ Both Israel and Hamas owe a responsibility to the victims of the conflict , ” said Epstein .
He also spoke about Israel ’s mistreatment of refugees and asylum seekers entering the country .
Epstein lamented the government ’s decision to promote the Infiltration Protection Bill , which he said would see innocent refugees escaping from war zones in places like Sudan and Eritrea imprisoned for long periods of time for attempting to reach freedom .
“ Israel has failed to protect the rights of asylum seekers .
There are currently 20,000 African asylum seekers in Israel , 85 % of them from Sudan and Eritrea .
Israel has repeatedly sent asylum seekers back to Egypt , a country that is known to ship refugees to their countries of origin , where they face torture and death , ” said Oded Diner , Amnesty Israel ’s public action director .
Diner said that Israel was deliberately not processing the refugee status of 95 % of the asylum seekers because officials prefer not to designate them as refugees and provide them with the rights they are entitled to under the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees .
Epstein said that since Operation Cast Lead he has identified a deterioration in the state ’s treatment of human rights groups .
“ We in Amnesty International , as well as Israeli human rights organizations , have been coming under severe criticism and attack by government officials .
We are worried about a public atmosphere that opposes human rights driven by the state ’s leaders , ” he said .
Jerusalem - based research organization NGO Monitor said that Amnesty International ’s accusations are made with no credible evidence and are based on an “ ideological bias ” inherent in Amnesty ’s work on Israel .
“ Amnesty ’s annual report repeats the discredited allegations anddistorted human rights rhetoric used to target Israel , ” said Prof .
Gerald Steinberg , president of NGO Monitor .
“ Accusations of ‘ warcrimes , ’ ’ indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks againstcivilians ’ and ‘ target[ing ] and kill [ing ] medical staff ’ are madewithout any credible evidence and reflect the ideological bias thatdetermines the content of Amnesty publications on Israel .
” Steinberg said Amnesty exploits human rights principles to demonize Israel .
“ During the Gaza war , the entire population of Gaza was used by Hamasas a massive human shield , but since Amnesty ‘ researchers ’ did not hearthis from frightened Palestinians , Hamas has been absolved .
Similarly , Amnesty has erased all evidence that Gaza hospitals became shelters forHamas leaders , that mosques were used for storing missiles and thattunnels are used to smuggle weapons .
This systematic bias and lack ofcredibility forms the basis for the Goldstone report , and highlights Amnesty ’s immoral exploitation of human rights principles in order todemonize Israel . ”
The stoush between the Brisbane Lions and Fitzroy Football Club over the AFL club 's revamped logo is headed for the Victorian Supreme Court .
Fitzroy has accused Brisbane of reneging on its 1996 merger agreement to keep the old lion as its mascot when it introduced a new - look beast to its AFL logo this season .
The old and the new ... Fitzroy fans are battling the Brisbane club over the Lions logo .
Brisbane had sought to establish that Fitzroy could n't afford to proceed in the matter , but Supreme Court Associate Justice Neemar Mukhtar today refused the application .
Fitzroy 's case was " genuine and respectable " and the club had a " triable " case , Associate Justice Mukhtar said .

When Beastie Boys co-founder Adam Yauch announced that doctors had found a cancerous tumor in his left parotid ( salivary ) gland , he expressed optimism about his recovery , because the cancer was localized and would not affect his vocal chords .
That was back in July , and though we 've interviewed Yauch since then , we did n't want to press the man too much on his health .
( Gothamist : How is your health situation ?
Yauch : I 'm doing all right !
I 'm in Hawaii right now , feeling good . )
It 's unclear what his status is , but this email just went out to members of the Beastie Boys fan club :
hello , wanted to send this out to you guys in case you were into it , or wanted to give it to anyone who you think might be .
a few friends and i are meditating at the same time twice a day .
9:30 am and 6:30 pm eastern standard time , for about an hour and half .
we are picturing smashing apart all of the cancer cells in the world .
we are visualizing taking the energy away from the cancer , and then sending it back at the cancer as lightening bolts that will break apart the DNA and RNA of the cells .
if you have the time , please join us in whipping up this lightening storm .
mind over matter ......
The email continues :
if you prefer to sit then sit , but if you are not used to meditating , or sitting quietly does n't sound like fun , put on some music and dance while you do the visualization , and if you want to do it at some other time , or picture curing some other illness that 's fine too .
yoko will be joining the meditation by visualizing all of us dancing with joy to celebrate the world without cancer .
all variations are welcome .
this is really just being done with a wish for all beings to be cured of all illnesses and to find true lasting happiness .
i'll also be saying prayers for the earthquake victims in tibet , so join in on that if you can too .
please feel free to pass this onto anyone who you think may find it interesting .
with all my love , adam yauch
Yauch has been a follower of Tibetan Buddhism since at least the early ' 90s , and since being diagnosed with cancer , has made at least one trip to India to receive Tibetan medicine and meditate with the Dalai Lama .
Until he recovers , the Beastie Boys have suspended touring and the release of their next album , though Yauch continues to be involved in his film distribution company , Oscilloscope Laboratories .

A SPECTER is haunting Glenn Beck .
" Socialism , " Beck declared on his radio show last year , with that trademark teary quaver in his voice , " does n't seem to be a bad thing in America anymore .
Most people are like , ' Yeah , socialism is n't so bad . ' "
Hard as it may be to believe , Glenn Beck was right about something .
Like a blind pig that eventually finds an acorn if it roots around long enough , he has stumbled across a fact -- that more and more people are open to the idea that there could be an alternative to capitalism and all the misery it has produced lately .
That was confirmed again in May in an opinion poll released by the Pew Research Center .
The survey found that in spite of the vilification the idea of socialism has suffered over many decades , three in 10 people in the U.S. have a positive view of it , compared to just a bare majority who were positive about the prevailing system of capitalism .
Among young people aged 18 to 30 , it 's an even split between those with positive views of socialism and of capitalism .
These statistics confirm almost exactly the findings of a Rasmussen opinion poll from a year ago .
Likewise , a Gallup survey earlier this year found that 37 percent of Americans considered socialism as " superior " to capitalism .
" Keep in mind , " wrote Charles Derber at the Common Dreams Web site , " these findings reflect an overview of the public mind when right - wing views seem at a high point -- with the Tea Party often cast as a barometer of American public opinion ... This is not a ' center - right ' America , but a populace where almost 50 percent are deeply ambivalent or clearly opposed to capitalism . "
To the likes of Glenn Beck , this is very bad news indeed .
" Your freedoms , your economic freedom , the idea of capitalism , the idea that you control your own life and you make your own decisions - - it 's all going away , " he declared .
What 's wrong with these " most people , " he must wonder ?
Do n't they realize they 're rejecting the kind of society where a self - described " rodeo clown " can rise to fame , fortune and far - reaching political influence ?
Featured at Socialism Hear Alan Maass at Socialism 2010 in Chicago and Oakland , speaking on " A People ’s History of the Russian Revolution . "
Check out the Socialism 2010 Web site for more details .
See you at Socialism !
IF BECK was actually interested in understanding this disturbing open - mindedness about socialism -- and he so is n't , but if he was -- he could talk to Kenneth Hoagland .
Hoagland went to jail because of a cold .
In 2004 , he was in a waiting period to get health insurance at his new job when the illness hit and landed him in the hospital for two days .
Hoagland had recently refinanced his Nashville home to pay off a bill from a previous weeklong hospital stay related to his diabetes .
In the months after the second hospitalization , when he and fiancée , Sonya Davis , could n't afford both monthly payments on the mortgage and the medical bill , they picked the mortgage .
That explanation did n't satisfy the Vanderbilt University Medical Center .
A collection lawyer filed suit for the hospital , and Hoagland , fearing to take time off work , missed the court date .
" After a series of hearings , attempts to collect the debt and what Hoagland says were genuine efforts to pay it , " reported the Tennessean newspaper , " an attorney working for Vanderbilt asked a judge to issue what 's known as a body attachment " - - a court order requiring sheriff 's deputies to find Hoagland and take him to jail .
" They fingerprinted me , took my picture and asked some questions about my medical history , " Hoagland told the Tennessean .
" When the guy who tested ( my blood sugar ) asked me why I was there , and I told him ... he said , ' I did n't know we did that in this country . '
I told him , ' Until now , I did n't either . ' "
Hoagland was allowed to make bond , and the collection agency started garnishing his wages .
But the experience left him scared of going to the hospital again .
A few months later , when he woke up sick again with a cold and his blood sugar dangerously low , his fiancée called the ambulance anyway .
" I hate to admit this , " she said , " but as soon as they got here , I thought , ' Oh God , I hope they are n't going to have to take him . '
He was sick , but I know he was probably thinking , ' We ca n't afford another set of medical bills . ' "
Hoagland 's story is unusual in its details , but there are health care nightmares in every corner of American society .
In 2007 , nearly two - thirds of the 1.5 million personal bankruptcies declared that year were the consequence of medical bills , according to the American Journal of Medicine .
And for every household literally driven into bankruptcy by a health care disaster , many more felt the kind of overbearing financial strains that Kenneth Hoagland and Sonya Davis did .
This is the crisis that Barack Obama 's health care law was meant to address -- and it's why longtime activists for a sane health care system that provides access to everyone in the U.S. are deeply disappointed in how short the legislation falls in addressing the problems .
Those problems have only grown worse .
In May 2009 , the Center for American Progress estimated that 2.4 million workers had lost health coverage provided by their jobs in the first 15 months of the recession that started in December 2007 .
Once spouses and children are added in , researchers estimated that Americans were losing health coverage at a rate of 14,000 people a day in January of last year .
If , by that point , fear of the financial consequences of getting sick was no longer first on the list of worries for many families , that 's only because it had been replaced by so many others -- long - term unemployment , food " insecurity , " foreclosures and evictions .
For millions and millions of people in the richest nation in the world , there just is n't any other way to describe it : capitalism is n't working .
All of the claims made for the free - market system -- that if you work hard and sacrifice , you can pull yourself up , you can make a decent living , your children will enjoy better opportunities than you -- have vanished .
Instead , for the majority of people in society , it 's harder and harder to make ends meet , with fewer and fewer opportunities to get ahead .
And for the smaller but growing numbers of people who had the bad luck , like Kenneth Hoagland , to have an unexpected crisis -- or who were born into poverty and never had a chance to " get ahead " in the first place -- the ends often do n't meet at all .
That 's the backdrop to the Pew and Rasmussen surveys , and all the other signs of growing discontent with capitalism and a society built around its upside - down priorities .
The free - market system itself is confirming the strongest argument for socialism -- the fact that capitalism is incapable of meeting the needs of the majority of people in society .
SOCIALISM STILL comes up most often in the U.S. mainstream debate as a term of abuse to be flung at a far - from - radical president by right - wingers counting on the lingering scare effects of 1950s McCarthyism .
To Republicans , it 's a simple formula : government - plus - economy equals socialism .
But the history of capitalism shows that state intervention in the economy is perfectly compatible with capitalism , especially in times of crisis .
That 's why it 's absurd to hear Obama 's health care law , which leaves privatized control of the health care industry intact and barely even more regulated , described as " socialism . "
If socialism is often identified with the state , not just by right - wingers but generally , it has something to do with the legacy of Stalinism in Russia , China and elsewhere -- governments that ruled with an iron fist , but used the name of " socialism " to justify it .
These societies have nothing to do with genuine socialism , any more than the tame tradition of reform socialism in Europe , where parties once identified with the labor movement have carried out the neoliberal agenda .
The genuine socialist tradition is committed , as Karl Marx put it , to the " self - emancipation of the working class . "
Socialism must be direct and democratic rule by the working majority in society , with production organized to meet human needs , rather than produce profits .
Such a society wo n't be achieved by voting a socialist party into office , or waiting for an enlightened few to bring about change .
At its heart , socialism is about the creation of a new society , built from the bottom up , through the struggles of ordinary working people against exploitation , oppression and injustice -- one that eliminates profit and power as the prime goals of life , and instead makes equality , democracy and freedom the highest values of all .
Washington ( CNN ) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan received critical cover from moderate Republicans on Thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings : gays in the military and judicial experience .
Kagan has been strongly criticized by GOP leaders for her efforts to block military recruiters from Harvard University during her time as the school 's law school dean because of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
The policy , opposed by President Obama , prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces .
Top Republicans have also highlighted the fact that Kagan has never served as a federal judge , something that distinguishes her from all nine current members of the high court .
If party moderates break from the GOP leadership on these issues , it dramatically increases Kagan 's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country 's 112th Supreme Court justice .
Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats ' 60 - member filibuster - proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy 's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military .
" It was the first question I actually asked her because , having been in the military , I had concerns about [ her ] position at Harvard , " Brown said .
" It was very clear to me , after we spoke about it at length , that she is supportive of the men and women who are fighting to protect us and very supportive of the military as a whole .
I do not feel that her judicial philosophy will hurt the men and women who are serving . "
While dean at Harvard Law , Kagan said she " abhorred " the military 's " discriminatory recruitment policy . "
She called it " a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order . "
Kagan supported other schools ' challenges to a federal law requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding .
The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law in 2006 .
Earlier in the day , Maine GOP Sen .
Susan Collins said she does n't have any concerns about Kagan 's experience .
She also said she did n't see any " extraordinary circumstances " that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against Kagan .
Collins said that Kagan told her she considers Roe vs.
Wade , the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion , to be settled law .
Kagan herself has remained tight - lipped when asked such questions from reporters .
The support of Brown and Collins alone , combined with a unified Democratic caucus , would be enough to ensure Kagan 's confirmation .
In addition to meeting with Brown and Collins on Thursday , Kagan stopped by the offices of five key Senate Democrats : Massachusetts ' John Kerry , New York 's Chuck Schumer , Maryland 's Ben Cardin , Minnesota 's Amy Klobuchar and Pennsylvania 's Arlen Specter .
Specter said Kagan may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of Supreme Court hearings .
" She said it'd be helpful to the public and to the court , " he said .
" This was the best answer I 've gotten " from any recent Supreme Court candidate .
Specter is a staunch advocate of allowing television cameras into the high court .
Most justices , however , have adamantly opposed the idea .
Specter also said Kagan stood by comments she made in 1995 , when she dismissed the confirmation hearing process as a " charade . "
Kagan 's meeting with Specter attracted considerable attention because of his political troubles .
Specter -- who is facing a tough primary fight next week -- voted against Kagan for solicitor general before switching from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party .
Specter has not said how he will vote on her Supreme Court nomination .
Some political observers have speculated that his previous opposition to Kagan , combined with an unwillingness to immediately back her now , could undercut his support with stalwart Democrats .
A quick declaration in favor of Kagan , on the other hand , could strike some voters as political opportunism .
Kagan kicked off her Capitol Hill meetings on Wednesday , visiting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
She also met with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the committee 's top Republican .
Obama nominated Kagan on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens .
If confirmed , she would become the third woman on the current nine - member bench and the fourth woman in the court 's history .
CNN 's Ted Barrett and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .
Visualizing Permutations
At some point a few years ago , I got interested in permutation algorithms and implemented a few that were in Knuth as well as gathered some that were floating around the internet .
I never did anything with them , until I saw Aldo Cortesi 's excellent sorting visualizations which reminded me of a figure from Knuth , and inspired me to create some visualizations of my own using Aldo 's code .
Lexicographic Permutations
Informally , the permutations of a set are all possible orderings of its members .
The permutations of the set { 1,2,3} , are :
[ 1,2,3 ] , [ 1,3,2 ] , [ 2,1,3 ] , [ 2,3,1 ] , [ 3,1,2 ] , [ 3,2,1 ]
This particular ordering of permutations is in lexicographic order ; it 's listed in the same order as it would be in the dictionary .
There are many well - known algorithms for generating permutations in lexicographic order .
Here is my version of one such algorithm ; go read Knuth if you 're at all interested in learning more .
Here 's what a lexicographic permutation of four elements looks like :
It 's easy to see that each element gets its turn at the top of the list , and that each time a new element goes to the top the remainder of the list is sorted .
Single - transposition Permutations
It is an interesting and non-obvious fact that there 's a way to permute any given set by only switching the positions of one pair of elements per iteration .
This permutation is deeply related to the Gray code , which if you have n't heard of , I highly recommend you go read about .
The Knuth paper I mentioned aleady has a superb bit on the Gray code .
This image demonstrates clearly that at each step , there is exactly one crossing .
My implementation of this algorithm is also on github .
CLP Permutation
I know very little about this algorithm , except that I got it from a message to comp.lang .
python where it's attributed to Alex Martelli , Duncan Smith , and somebody named Anton ( Anton Vredegoor ? ) .
Despite the crazy number of switches , and the fact that it reorders the list it 's passed , it 's actually crazy fast .
I 'd love to hear from anyone with more info on this algorithm ; my slightly modified version is here .
Odds and Ends
Well , that 's it , just wanted to post some fun pictures of permutations , I hope you enjoyed it .
The code I used to generate the pictures is derived from Aldo Cortesi 's wonderful sortvis , and all my modifications to it are available on github as well .
If you want bonus points , I never got around to implementing Knuth 's algorithm E ( it 's given towards the end of this ) , and I 'd love for somebody else to do my work for me .
If you 're tough enough , that is .
Following up on its list of the 10 best places to live in Canada , MoneySense magazine has released a list of the 10 worst – and six of them are in British Columbia .
Williams Lake was ranked second , followed closely by Quesnel , Port Alberni , Campbell River , Prince Rupert and Terrace , which took the number 10 spot .
The towns and cities were at the bottom of the 179 evaluated for the magazine 's best places list .
MoneySense used data gathered from a wide array of sources including Statistics Canada , Environment Canada and real estate boards to compare criteria such as cultural offerings , schools , year - round weather , employment and crime .
" We care about : how much money can you make ?
What kind of job can you get ?
How much does it cost to buy a house ?
How many doctors are available ?
What kind of infrastructure is there ?
How much pollution is there ? " editor Duncan Hood told CTV's Canada AM last week .
The worst are largely situated along Canada 's coasts , something the magazine attributes in part to poor weather .
Ottawa was ranked the best place to live in Canada for the third time in four years .
Victoria ranked first last year , but was determined too expensive for the 2010 list , bumping it down to eighth .
Vancouver fell off the top 10 , as it considered the most unaffordable city in Canada .
The average home in the picturesque city tops $ 762,000 -- almost 10 times the average income .
The entire list of the 10 worst places to live , according to MoneySense :
Finally after many delays , the Perl Survey 2010 is ready for participants to complete .
It should take you about 10 to 15 minutes .
The purpose of this survey is to find out information about programmers who use Perl , the tools that they use , and their opinions about Perl .
The survey is funded by The Perl Foundation , with hosting support from Strategic Data and Shadowcat Systems .
We plan to re-run the survey every two to three years to see how the community changes over time .
So please fill in a questionnaire yourself by visiting the Perl Survey website .
Once you 've done that , please tell your friends , tell your friends friends , and your friends friends friends .
We do n't just want heavily involved members of the Perl community to complete the survey but more casual Perl programmers as well .
The 2007 survey managed about 4,000 responses , but I 'd be happy with around the 1,000 mark .
I 'll be presenting the initial cut of the data analysis in three weeks time ( Week beginning June the 5th ) at the German Perl Workshop .

Americans do n't like to think much about where their gasoline comes from .
They 're happy when supplies are plentiful and prices are cheap .
Many have painful memories of oil embargoes , gas lines and price spikes , and prefer those episodes not be repeated .
Americans expect gasoline to be as reliable as electricity .
The oil industry satisfies their demand .
Some 30 % of domestic oil ( along with 11 % of natural gas ) comes from the Gulf of Mexico .
Considering that 35,000 workers are engaged in a heavy industry that operates 24 hours a day in a marine , all - weather environment , the safety and environmental record in the Gulf of Mexico is pretty remarkable .
There have been incidents .
The worst spill in the Gulf was the Bay Marchand spill in 1970 , a near - shore production incident .
The greatest losses of life occurred in 1987 , when 13 men perished in a helicopter accident , and in 1976 when 11 men died , ironically , when their emergency survival capsule overturned while being towed .
I can't remember a previous drilling incident in the Gulf with the nationwide significance of the Deepwater Horizon blowout .
BP was drilling in 5,000 feet of water .
Given the cost , risk and operating challenges of that environment , why would anyone bother ?
My company has never considered it .
We operate on the " shelf " of the Gulf of Mexico , mostly in waters of 200 feet or less .
We do n't use subsea blowout preventers .
Ours are " dry " , on the surface .
We rarely use ROVs ( remotely operated vehicles ) and divers can dive to any depths we might require .
On the shelf , cost to drill and produce wells are a tiny fraction of deepwater costs .
And the risk is much less .
Problems , if they happen , are more easily controlled when the valves are at the surface instead of under a mile or so of sea water .
But the chance that we 'll find a really big field on the shelf is nill .
Geologists say the shelf is very mature , or " picked over " ; think of a cotton field after it 's already been worked once .
Most U.S. drillers these days are working that second or third harvest because all the domestic basins are so thoroughly exploited .
That 's my company 's niche , so we 're content to limit our search to shallow water .
By contrast , the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is not mature .
There , the major multinational companies still find the world - class prospects which have the potential of providing oil in the huge quantities their integrated infrastructures need ( i.e. , refining , distribution and marketing , in addition to exploration and production ) .
The majors must find reserves in big chunks , and produce their wells at high rates , so that they can satisfy our demand for uninterrupted and readily available supply .
There are also big prospects to drill elsewhere , in Africa , the Middle East , Brazil , and the Far East .
The U.S. offers political stability and security of ownership that many foreign countries do not .
But Americans ' attitude toward drilling has gone beyond " Not In My Back Yard ! "
Now it 's " Not Near Anything With a Pretty View ! " and " Do n't Interfere With Mating Pronghorn Antelopes or Nesting Sage Grouse ! "
We 've kept 85 % of the Outer Continental Shelf off - limits for exploration for a generation .
So the majors turn to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico , the only domestic basin where they can find the " elephants " they need to sustain their businesses .
By keeping 85 % of the OCS off limits to drilling , we 're holding back large swaths of shallow water where less risky offshore shelf technologies could be used .
If you agree with continuing the official policy of limiting drilling access , at least consider the consequences of your position .
Despite all the advertising by " green " interest groups and adminstration rhetoric , DOE 's Energy Information Agency forecasts increasing use of petroleum through at least 2030 .
That same forecast also assumes explosive growth in renewables , including biofuels .
Our appetite for energy is voracious .
As " green " as we'd like to think we are , individual consumers change their consumption habits very slowly .
So increased oil consumption , absent domestic growth of supply , necessarily means more dependence on potentially hostile regimes and less security at home .
It also means that more oil will be imported in tankers .
Offshore , we use pipelines , which limit the volume in the event of a spill .
Much more oil is spilled from ships , barges and boats than from the offshore oil and gas industry .
Exxon Valdez and recent spills on the Delaware and Mississippi Rivers prove the point : transporting oil in boats is riskier than shallow water oil production .
The offshore industry was born and came of age right here in South Louisiana .
The industry has learned its lessons from past failures .
Despite the Deepwater Horizon incident , the offshore industry remains a safe , invaluable source for the nation 's energy supply .

To his defenders , Mahmoud Reza Banki is the accomplished son of Iranian American parents , with degrees from UC Berkeley and Princeton and a business acumen that made him the logical person in the family to trust with more than $ 3 million .
“ My family is unusually generous to me , certainly beyond what is customary among U.S. families , ” Banki , 33 , told federal authorities after they asked about the hundreds of thousands of dollars dropping into his bank account .
Banki said the money came from his cousin Ali in Tehran .
But when agents raided Banki’s $ 2.4 - million Greenwich Village apartment in January , they say evidence indicated that the money was n’t from rich cousin Ali but from customers around the world who wanted to send cash to Iran .
Banki made sure the right amount got to the intended recipients in the Islamic republic via a money - transferring system known as a hawala , prosecutors allege .
As Banki ’s trial unfolds in New York , it is highlighting the difficulty the U.S. government faces as it tries to manage hawala operations , which are legal if licensed but which , because of their informal setups , can be tools for other activities such as dodging sanctions against Iran and , according to investigators , funding Faisal Shahzad ’s self - admitted bomb plot on Times Square .
“ They ’re designed to be secretive , and they ’re designed to have very little paperwork involved .
The record - keeping they do keep could be in another language , ” said Stephen Hudak of the U.S. Treasury Department ’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , which relies on bank alerts of suspicious activities to help track suspected illegal hawalas .
The two cases being heard in a Lower Manhattan courthouse have little in common , but hawalas may play a role in both .
Banki was a management consultant with a prestigious Manhattan firm whose lifestyle included an elegant apartment and five - figure credit - card bills .
He is accused of operating an unlicensed money - transmitting business and of violating the United States ’ 1995 trade embargo against Iran , charges that prosecutors say could bring more than 20 years in prison .
In court , Banki , who has been held without bond since January , smiles confidently at the jury and casts frequent flirtatious looks at his girlfriend seated on the wooden benches behind him .
Last week , a group of Iranian Americans from Los Angeles were among those in court to bolster his confidence .
Shahzad , a 30 - year - old Pakistani American , was facing foreclosure and was struggling to support his wife and baby after leaving a low - level job as a financial analyst when he tried to bomb Times Square on May 1 , authorities say .
He is suspected of funding his plot with money sent from Pakistan via hawalas .
Unlike Banki , who is accused of funneling millions of dollars , Shahzad is believed to have received just enough to buy a used SUV for $ 1,300 , bomb - making materials and a one - way plane ticket out of the country .
Both cases offer a look into the murky , ancient system of moving money across borders .
“ There is the potential of great danger when individuals illegally move money internationally without the government ’s knowledge , since that money often falls into the hands of individuals who threaten our national security and the security of other nations , ” FBI special agent in charge James T. Hayes Jr. said after Banki ’s arrest .
According to prosecutors , from January 2006 through September 2009 , Banki received about $ 3.4 million from individuals and companies from Latvia , Slovenia , Russia , Sweden , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , the Philippines and the United States in his Bank of America account .
Banki used a Tehran - based partner to ensure that the intended recipients received the money , minus processing fees , in Iran , the government alleges .
The defense says the partner is actually a licensed broker who simply made sure the family funds reached Banki in New York .
They say Banki received money but never sent any to Iran .
Rather than using wire transfers to send money overseas , the hawala system generally relies on a system of trust between far - flung brokers , enabling them to avoid expensive bank transfer fees and to get cash into recipients ’ hands rapidly — often within hours .
The system also limits the paper trails that come with formal bank transfers .
It is the best way to move money to places such as Somalia , without proper banking systems , and the cheapest method for migrant workers to send cash home to relatives .
“ It ’s a very good business model , ” said Nikos Passas , a criminology professor at Northeastern University and an expert on money - laundering methods .
Passas said the problem the United States faced in trying to manage hawalas , which might operate out of corner groceries , barber shops , dry cleaners or individuals ’ apartments , was the fees that states charged people who wanted to operate legally .
“ State - level regulation is completely unrealistic , ” said Passas , adding that it could cost more than $ 1 million for someone with clients in New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania to meet the requirements to operate money - transferring businesses in all three states .
“ No corner store trying to help a community send money back home is going to comply with this , ” Passas said .
Banki contends he merely invested the funds sent by his cousin and earned through a lucrative family enterprise .
Banki drew a family tree for investigators outlining his extended clan and aiming to explain why so much wealth was coming his way .
“ I am the only family member with an advanced degree living abroad and in the United States , ” he wrote .
“ Because of this , for better or worse , I am the source of pride for the extended family . ”
Prosecutors , who rested their case May 19 , presented witnesses who testified about envelopes filled with cash found in Banki ’s apartment , notes indicating amounts to be delivered and computer records with no sign of Banki communicating directly with a cousin Ali about money transfers .
“ There is zero proof ” the money came from his cousin , said Assistant U.S. Atty .
Danya Perry .
When the defense begins presenting its case Tuesday , it plans to air videotaped testimony from Banki ’s alleged Iranian hawala partner , who gave his deposition in the Bahamas this month after volcanic ash from Iceland prevented attorneys from meeting him in Turkey .

I owe my years as a jazz reporter to John Osborne ’s Look Back in Anger , which made the British cultural establishment of the mid-1950s take notice of a music so evidently dear to the new and talented Angry Young Men .
When , needing some money , I saw that Kingsley Amis wrote in the Observer on a subject about which he obviously knew no more and possibly less than I did , I called a friend at the New Statesman .
He arranged a meeting with the editor , Kingsley Martin , then at the peak of his glory , who said ‘ Why not ? ’ , explained that he conceived his typical reader as a male civil servant in his forties , and passed me on to the commander of the ( cultural ) back half of the mag , the formidable Janet Adam Smith .
Her interests ranged from mountaineering to poetry , but did not include jazz .
As ‘ Francis Newton ’ ( named after a Communist jazz trumpeter who played on Billie Holiday ’s ‘ Strange Fruit ’ ) , I wrote a column every month or so for the New Statesman for about ten years .
It was a good time to be writing about jazz .
Not only did my column allow me an occasional respite from the personal and political convulsions of 1956 , that year of Communist crisis , but it was the first time since 1935 that American jazz musicians could be heard live in Britain .
Until then the typical British jazz fan , well informed by Melody Maker and tiny argumentative journals , had lived essentially on a diet of 78 rpm records , passionately analysed by young men in upstairs rooms or in the ‘ rhythm clubs ’ of the 1930s .
A surprising number of these records had been made in the US for the British market , but hard - core aficionados , especially the small but missionary group of blues enthusiasts , also established their own networks for importing American discs .
I had been on the fringes of this community of experts since the early 1930s , thanks to my cousin Denis Preston , who eventually became a pioneering figure on the recording scene ; but , until the example of Kingsley Amis gave me courage , I had been too awed to join in their debates .
Young and on the whole provincial , suburban and musically untaught , they were loving and propagandist critics rather than practitioners .
By the time Francis Newton was born , these aficionados had created a uniquely original youthful British pop scene in ‘ trad jazz ’ , which reproduced versions of New Orleans jazz and country blues , by then far better known in this country than in the US .
In one of my earliest columns I observed the sudden profitability of trad jazz ‘ and even that last refuge of bankruptcy , blues - singing ’ , as illustrated by profitable but unimpressive imitations of Bessie Smith ’s ‘ Reckless Blues ’ and a chart - topping version of Huddie Ledbetter ’s jailhouse ‘ Rock Island Line ’ , sung by a surprised and blameless British guitarist , Lonnie Donegan .
What did it mean ?
I asked .
We now know that it meant the rise of the British rock scene , the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , about to transform the American pop industry in the early 1960s .
It never captured my generation , nor that of most jazz musicians , least of all the highly professional record studio session players who had to turn its illiterate amateur products into music .
But what did being Francis Newton mean to me ?
The attraction was not so much the opportunity to review jazz performances and the records now flooding in , or even to fit this extraordinary music into 20th - century society .
It was the chance to understand the musicians and their world : in short , ‘ the jazz scene ’ .
I lived on the edge of the West End , and teaching at Birkbeck left most of the day free , so it was possible to combine my profession with the nocturnal and late - rising habits of the scene .
My main base was the Downbeat Club on Old Compton Street , a few minutes ’ walk from home , a joint which , like so many of London ’s modern musicians and their hangers - on , I used as an off - duty reporting point .
Though people might play there and it sometimes booked a pianist , the Downbeat was a social club , unlike Ronnie Scott ’s new enterprise , then starting up in a not yet orientalised Lisle Street , where one went not to drink and gossip but to listen .
There were also some after - hours joints in Soho where one could do both .
Clubs are what I remember more vividly than the concerts in which visiting musicians earned their keep , though it was only in the US that I was to discover the glory of a jazz scene based primarily on clubs .
I must have been one of the last to hear the great Ellington band , visibly at ease in its natural environment , play a genuine club date , ‘ melting ’ , as I reported , ‘ a hard assembly of middle - aged San Francisco lawyers , doctors , journalists and fixers like traditional brides ’ .
I suppose this and meeting the tragic pianist Bud Powell in his Paris hotel room , catatonic except when at the keyboard , are the most vivid memories of my jazz years .
It soon became obvious that there was a notable gap both in taste and context between those of us – most jazz writers , but also successful players – who developed an enthusiasm for the music in the 1930s and 1940s , and the small corps of serious professional British musicians who played and formed the only real public for ‘ modern ’ jazz before Miles Davis began to make his impact .
Writing about jazz in the 1950s meant , basically , trying to understand or at least come to terms with bebop ( even the passionate jazz - conservative Philip Larkin eventually felt he had to make a gesture in this direction ) , but I do n’t know how far I succeeded , except for an admiration for Thelonious Monk and an immediate passion for the supremely talented and intelligent Dizzy Gillespie , the most dazzling trumpeter in the world , who lacked no gift except the willingness to reveal his soul , as Parker had done .
My admiration for Miles Davis was based on his records , not on any live performance I heard .
I enjoyed the company of the players , and they accepted me as an oddity on the scene ( no milieu is more tolerant than that of jazz musicians ) , sometimes as the sort of walking reference book who could answer ( non-musical ) queries .
I remember one from a tenor player ’s girlfriend , about whether it was right to believe in God .
But could any non-musician understand what creative musicians are really about , however much he socialised with them ?
After all , as one of them told me ( I think it was the tenor saxophonist Sonny Stitt ) , ‘ words are not my instrument . ’
For a white non-musician to get close to black artists was even harder .
Until the great exodus of American players in the 1960s , when the US jazz scene collapsed , few of them lived in Europe .
True , there did n’t seem to be any difference between white and black in the Downbeat Club , and the young Cleo Laine was perfectly at ease describing herself as ‘ a Cockney spade ’ , but visiting African - American players were aware of race even in tolerant Europe , and so , almost certainly , were British West Indians like the gifted and adventurous alto player Joe Harriott , who was an important component of the modern scene .
Still , on the road , which was their permanent way of life , the Americans were used to being asked questions by white admirers , and experienced performers who relied entirely on the white circuit , notably blues singers , had a genuinely informative narrative ready .
As the only academic writing on jazz , and under culturally high - class auspices , Francis Newton naturally found himself acting as tourist guide to swinging Soho for foreign intellectuals .
He also found himself drawn into the avant - garde cultural bohème in Britain , which overlapped with the non-bop jazz scene ; George Melly and ‘ Trog ’ ( Wally Fawkes , the clarinettist of the Humphrey Lyttelton school ) were already producing their satirical and socially perceptive comic strip Flook in , of all places , the Daily Mail .
I still have the membership card for Muriel ’s Colony Club in Dean Street , which someone – most likely Colin MacInnes – pressed on me , but alcoholic camp was not my scene , nor jazz theirs , even though at one time they had decent background music played by an agreeable West Indian pianist .
I was commissioned almost immediately to write a book .
More to the point , being Francis Newton reinforced my contacts with those on whom the musicians depended , the agents , bookers and the rest of the pop music business world of which jazz formed a small corner .
Their private opinions of ‘ the talent ’ diverged widely from their public ones .
I also found myself a member of the global network of intellectual jazz lovers .
Since outside Britain these still saw themselves as something of an underground , if no longer persecuted , musical faith , they – and especially the writers – formed a surprisingly effective international of mutual trust and help .
In the US this did not go as far as in Japan , where , as I was to discover in those tiny bars , the most formal academics – and who can be more formal than a Japanese university dean ?
– talked with an inconceivable degree of emotional frankness , simply because a guest they had never met before was a fellow jazz lover .
I soon discovered that jazz solidarity , which went with the championing of Kafka as a first stage of the Prague Spring , was equally intense in Czechoslovakia .
As the Miles Davis and Modern Jazz Quartet scores for Nouvelle Vague movies showed in the 1950s , French intellectuals were expected to be unusually hip about modern jazz but , as usual , took little note of non-French jazz writers .
Stateside , jazz solidarity was of more practical help .
Local jazz writers did everything they could to help an unknown from London , from booking a hotel in Greenwich Village to passing him from one critic to the next for guidance to the scene in some unfamiliar city .
It helped that so many promoters of jazz and blues came out of the left - wing milieu of the 1930s and 1940s , notably the greatest of all jazz talent scouts , the crew - cut John Hammond Jr , whose judgments were largely to guide my own .
It was only on my first trip to the US , where all surviving schools and artists could be heard at the same time , that I came to realise how lucky Francis Newton had been : this was a golden age for jazz , largely because even the ultra - boppers of the 1940s had rejoined and renewed the music ’s mainstream .
It was only on my second trip in 1963 that I realised how quickly the tsunami of rock music had swept it away .
Birdland had put up the shutters .
For the best part of the next 20 years , jazz hardly existed for the young , except in the university milieu as a part of adult high culture – like classical music , only smaller .
What public did remain for live performance was antagonised by the emergence of a new , musically radical ‘ free form ’ jazz .
Paradoxically , this isolated what was politically the most radical and racially militant movement in jazz from its natural African - American constituency .
By this time my life was changing .
My wife , Marlene , claims that I proposed at a Bob Dylan concert .
Marriage and babies inevitably put an end to Francis Newton ’s freewheeling nocturnal lifestyle , though not to reviewing concerts and records .
It was n’t as much fun , except for the stunning and disturbing first visit to Britain of Ray Charles , whom I had first heard as one of a handful of whites in a corner of a vast rock - and - roll dance in Oakland , California , when he was still known only to the black public .
They did not dance much while he sang .
By now not quite a major pop star but already a hipster saint , fourth in line to Lester Young , Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker , and certainly already a monstre sacré , he worked the audience in the Finsbury Park Astoria with his ‘ sanctified ’ bluesy voice in a style combining showbiz effects and soul - baring emotion .
I still shiver at the memory of hearing that hunched , thin , unhappy blind man milk the audience with ‘ once I was blind , but now I see . ’
Let that , as well as my spectacular failure to recognise the potential of the Beatles ( I never had any time for the Stones ) , stand as the last memory of Francis Newton ’s years covering the scene for the readers of the New Statesman .

In the annals of time and Science Fiction , no character is more used and recognized than the mad scientist .
They have been evil , they have been good and they have ( more often than not ) been absolutely out of their freaking heads .
Crazy as the day is long , these characters have been a constant source of entertainment , weird science and madcap inventions .
So when you hear " mad scientist " what do you think ?
Do you really think " mad ? "
Usually , you think of Dr. Frankenstein , the original mad scientist ( as far as popular culture , literature & movies are concerned ) .
Dr. Frankenstein is the king of the mad scientist genre , with the tortured but well - intentioned creation of his monster .
Tortured because of the anguish he suffered in his devotion to the creation , and well intentioned because he really thought he was doing some good .
That 's the conundrum facing many of the mad scientists today .
While they generally have the best of intentions , the chaos they create as a result of those intentions is what ends up classifying them as " mad . "
From destroying whole universes , to creating paradoxes in time , to just being a general nuisance to the tri-state area - mad scientists end up getting a bad rap .
In this weeks '
Great Geek Debate , we take a look at some of the most popular ones in geek culture - aside from the obvious Dr. Frankenstein - to determine if they are really mad , or just misunderstood .
Name : Dr. Emmett Brown
Disposition : Frantic , forgetful , brilliant but controversial .
Claim to Fame : Invented a time machine made from an DMC DeLorean .
Analysis : Dr. Brown was looked down upon by society as being a true outcast , a mad scientist trapped in suburban America .
His years of experiment ( and a bump on the head ) resulted in the invention of the " Flux Capacitor . "
With this , and a converted DMC DeLorean tuned to run on nuclear power , he created time travel .
However , the paradoxes created by time travel were a constant source of frustration for Dr. Brown , eventually leading him to destroy the time machine - but not before building another one .
Dr. Brown 's intentions with the time machine were of the best kind , not evil at all , but even well laid plans can be messed up by terrorists looking for their nuclear materials and a teenager wearing a jacket that resembles a life vest .
The best thing for Dr. Brown was getting trapped in the past , where his inventions were actually able to not only do some good , but be appreciated for doing so .
Madness Factor : Great Scott !
Bananas , but not full coconuts .
Name : Dr. Herbert West
Disposition : Brilliant to the point of insanity , a narcissistic loner with a deep belief in his work .
Claim to Fame : Famed for re-animating the dead .
Analysis : Dr. West was the unfortunate victim of his own massive intelligence and ego .
He is a true mad scientist , deeply involved in his personal beliefs about life and death in relation to humanity .
This makes him just as dangerous as it does brilliant .
While he was called upon on occasion to assist with actual medical emergencies , by that time his experiments on the dead had already met with gruesome and violent results .
Dr. West exhibits a strong arrogance about his intelligence and work which causes him to treat the living and the dead with a lack of general respect for their existence .
This would prove time and time again to be his undoing , as he would over look the anger the living had towards him after he re-animated them from death .
Especially if West was actually the killer .
Dr. West is a dangerous individual and while he portrays a sense of egotistical confidence , he is not to be trusted or kept company with .
Madness Factor : Roasting marshmallows on the sun nuts .
Name : Dr. Horrible
Disposition :
Shy , underachiever with a penchant for redheads and gangs run by horses .
Claim to Fame : Defeated Captain Hammer to earn his way into Bad Horse 's Evil League of Evil .
Analysis : Dr. Horrible is n't really that all horrible .
He 's quite entertaining and his rudimentary weapons ( a freeze ray , remote control for a vehicle ) create a less than threatening persona .
Long the whipping boy of his foil , Captain Hammer , Dr. Horrible dreams of a day where he can rule with an iron fist and goggled face .
Struggling constantly between kind of evil and true evil , it 's not until a horrible accident finally pushes him into the arms of true evil .
Madness Factor : Wants to join a gang run by horse .
Nuff said .
Name : Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz
Disposition : Bumbling , clumsy , intelligent but vacant .
Claim to Fame : Constantly attempts to take over the tri-state area using a myriad of " - inators . "
Analysis : Dr. Doofenshmirtz is more of a " chaos causer . "
That is , his attempts at taking over the tri-state area are rarely well planned out and usually based on some minute irritation he has with the community at large , generally stemming from his childhood , in which he was often overlooked in favor of his " goody two - shoes brother . "
However , his adeptness at building destructive " - inators " one after the other should not be over - looked .
Between his own inability to keep his competence up to finish a job and the constant interference of Perry the Platypus , Dr. Doofenshmirtz is a minor annoyance at best .
Madness Factor : Crazy like not being able to find everything on the grocery list in one store .
Name : Dr. Walter Bishop
Disposition : Disorganized , hints of dementia , lucidity comes and goes .
Claim to Fame : Opened a doorway to a parallel universe .
Analysis : Dr. Bishop previously lived for his work , then he worked for his son .
He applied his great and vast intelligence to find a cure for his dying son .
Eventually this led him to travel to another universe to kidnap his parallel son , who was also dying .
Between this action and his earlier experimentation on children to give them what would be considered to be super powers , the guilt and morally deplorable acts of his past caught up with him mentally and he was committed .
Dr. Bishop has had the chances in his life to make things right , but has been too afraid of the consequences to do so .
He has since applied his brilliant , though at times featherbrained , mind to solving cases for the F.B.I. that border on the fringe of reality .
Dr. Bishop had the potential to be one of the greatest living scientists ever , but was undone by his own arrogance in thinking that what he was doing was of the best intentions .
Arrogance , a trait of many mad scientists , can be very destructive .
Madness Factor : Angry and contemplative drunk with one leg mad .
Name : Professor Hubert Farnsworth
Disposition : Completely gone .
Too old to be living , much less inventing .
Confused , with sparks of misguided brilliance .
Claim to Fame :
The smell - o- scope .
Really .
Analysis : Roughly around 160 years old , Farnsworth is a genius scientist trapped in a decaying body .
To this end , he 's created numerous doomsday devices , the smell - o - scope of course and to combat the old age - a clone .
There is no invention or problem too great for Farnsworth to solve , but remembering that he was tasked to solve the problem tends to get in the way .
At one time creating an alternate universe in a box , which almost destroyed the universe , his fault is once again that of arrogance .
Sadly , he does not recognize it as such , instead it 's most likely gas or a stroke .
Madness Factor :
Who got shot in the what now ?
In the end , they are all mad .
From Frankenstein to Farnsworth , they all exhibit great intelligence but quality traits that end up undoing their work or causing more harm than good .
That 's the mad part of being a mad scientist .
Perhaps it 's less the uncontrollable urge to control the universe , traverse time and space or invent objects of destruction , but more the madness caused by the frustration of failure .
As we ask at the end of every Great Geek Debate , who are your favorites ?
Which ones were left out that bear mentioning ?

The Federal Opposition is in damage control again after Joe Hockey 's appearance at the Press Club descended into what even his own colleagues admit was a " shemozzle " yesterday .
Last week Opposition Leader Tony Abbott told the House of Representatives that Mr Hockey would use yesterday 's lunchtime speech to give details of the Coalition 's proposed budget savings .
But Mr Hockey 's speech did not contain any concrete detail on the savings , a task that was left to finance spokesman Andrew Robb , who briefed journalists on the cuts after Mr Hockey made his exit .
The headline figure is $ 47 billion of savings , but there is devil in the detail .
The proposed cuts included axing the Government 's computers for schools program as well as green initiatives and the plan to put all Medicare records on a centralised computer database .
The bad day came hard on the heels of Mr Abbott 's admission that only his carefully considered , scripted remarks should be taken as gospel truth .
On The 7.30 Report last night Mr Hockey acknowledged that not giving out the Coalition 's proposed savings as his leader had promised was not the wisest move .
" With the benefit of hindsight perhaps I should have given [ journalists ] all the documents half - an - hour earlier , " he said .
In his first chance to answer questions on the $ 47 billion worth of savings , Mr Hockey defended including measures funded by the mining tax , which the Opposition opposes , as a saving .
The Coalition is claiming as a saving any money that it would not spend from revenue it would not get that would have been created by a tax it will not implement .
Mr Hockey also defended the decision to claim as a saving money the Coalition would not borrow to fund a National Broadband Network it would not implement ; money the Government says is equity and does not count towards the budget bottom line .
" Borrowings carry .
What we announced today was $ 47 billion of gross savings .
That 's money we do not have to borrow under the circumstances proposed by the Rudd Government , " Mr Hockey said .
Mr Hockey 's gross total of $ 47 billion sounds impressive , but putting the $ 30 billion from the mining tax and NBN aside at least some of the remaining saving will be spent , with the Coalition saying there will be replacement programs for some of the areas being cut , and in some cases the replacements may cost more .
Mr Robb failed to deliver on a commitment he made to journalists yesterday to release a document by the end of the day outlining all the Coalition 's proposed spending to date .
But Mr Hockey says the Opposition still needs more time .
" We will release all of our costings on our own policies as soon as we can get to the bottom of the budget numbers the Government has delivered , " Mr Hockey said .
" Quite frankly as at this stage we still have n't got to the bottom of the budget numbers and hopefully we 'll get some better information out of the estimates process in the Senate next week . "
Reaction from some senior Coalition MPs to Mr Hockey 's speech and the savings measures was not good .
One told AM the decision not to release the costings ahead of the speech was " madness " , another said the trouble that ensued was not surprising , while others said they were disappointed the savings did not amount to tough decisions .
They say the way they were done stretched conventional budget practice and the Coalition has not yet done the work to win over voters disenchanted with the Government .
Government frontbencher Anthony Albanese told Sky News Mr Hockey 's budget reply speech was a shambles .
" Joe Hockey turned up , presented nothing whatsoever and then flick - passed to episode three , Andrew Robb , whose savings do n't even add up .
It 's quite clear that this is not an alternative government , " Mr Albanese said .
While the Government has ridiculed the events of yesterday , it still has more than enough troubles of its own .
Its mining tax is continuing to cause problems .
Fortescue Metals has officially put two projects on hold .
The Prime Minister had to address concerns about the tax at a community cabinet meeting in Tasmania last night , and one of the biggest mining companies , Rio Tinto , will go to the Treasury for consultations on the tax today .
The Government is still struggling to regain momentum after ditching promises , including the emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) .
It has not been the best month for credibility in politics from either side , and the election is creeping ever closer .
Introduction
I ’ve already written a great deal on the RE0s but I do n’t consider any of it a formal review in the traditional sense .
If you ’ve read my previous writing about the RE0s , you should know that I am positively enamored by them .
In the few weeks since I received them , they have quickly become my preferred listening devices when I sit down with my laptop or MP3 player and listen to music .
After putting them through their paces for 200 + hours and listening to the sound signature evolve and mature in that time , I finally feel that I ’m ready to give the RE0s the review they deserve .
So , without further ado , read on for my full review of the HiFiMan RE0 in ear monitors .
Technical Specifications
Driver : 9 mm dynamic driver
Frequency Response : 15 Hz – 22KHz
Impedance : 64 Ω
Sensitivity : 100db/1mw
Cable Length : 1.2m/4ft
Packaging and Accessories
The RE0s come packaged in a small , clear plastic clamshell box .
The design is unobtrusive and eye catching , showing off the IEMs flanked by the three pairs of silicone single flange tips .
Included accessories range from the aforementioned three pairs of single flange silicone tips , two pairs of small and large bi-flanges , five pairs of replacement filters and a shirt clip .
Overall , this is a decent accessory package but I would ’ve been happier if a soft or hard carrying case had been included with the package .
I guess you could argue that the case the RE0s came in could be used to carry them around in a pinch but it ’s just slightly too big and bulky to fit very comfortably in a pocket .
Design and Build Quality
Right off the bat , the similarity to the V - Moda Vibes is immediately apparent .
The housing is made of metal , painted black with a matte finish instead of the high - fashion polished aluminum look and feel of the V - Moda Vibes .
The metal design inspires confidence in terms of long and short - term durability in that they feel sturdy and resilient without being too heavy or too light .
Extending down from the casing is a long strain relief which is soft rubber in texture and adds to the durability and protects the cable as it enters the housing .
The cable also terminates in a properly relieved L - plug which is new in the current revision of the RE0s .
The cable itself is fairly thick and very soft and pliable and seems durable enough to withstand a fair amount of abuse .
One issue I have with the cabling of the RE0s is that they transmit a lot of cable noise .
Wearing them straight down while walking or performing any kind of activity that causes the IEMs to rub against your clothing , will result in microphonic noise being transmitted into your ears .
It ’s annoying and distracting to be sure and using the included shirt clip and wearing them over - the - ear is practically required if you plan on walking anywhere with these .
These feel like they will be able to withstand normal amounts of daily use and abuse for a long period of time .
I do wish these came with a carrying case of some kind to protect them while on the go and naturally , it ’s expected that you ’ll want to protect your investment .
I would advise getting in a carrying case of some kind to protect them if you plan on carrying them around .
Comfort and Fit
The housings of the RE0s are very small and light and , as such , you ’ll barely feel them while they ’re in your ears .
For me and my small ear canals , the small black tips were best for me but now , I use a pair of small tips I sourced from a pair of V - Moda Vibes which I find to be a bit softer and thus more comfortable .
With all of the various eartips supplied with the RE0s , I ’m sure that most users will be able to find a pair that will work for them .
Sound Quality
Let me preface this by saying that these are the best sounding IEMs I ’ve ever heard .
Nothing I ’ve ever used comes close to matching the RE0s in terms of clarity and transparency , bass and treble extension and micro level detail .
These are a highly resolving pair of IEMs and as such will be highly revealing of flaws in your source material .
I would not recommend using these with 128 kbps music files or any other poorly recorded music , as these will make the flaws in those files stand out so much more .
On the other hand , because they are so highly resolving , they allow great recordings and high bitrate files such as 320 kbps MP3s and FLAC files to shine .
The RE0s are a very neutral pair of IEMs across the board and offer very little in the way of coloration to the music being pumped through them .
That ’s a very good thing .
These are highly transparent and allow you to hear music mostly as the artist intended , without adding any degree of warmth or coldness that is n’t actually present in the piece itself .
The midrange is fairly recessed but lively and very clear .
Both male and female vocals are full - bodied and natural sounding and , across the board , instruments just sound great .
The biggest strength of the RE0s is their endlessly extended and exceptionally clear and bright treble .
Highs are forward and sparkle with just a touch of warmth without a hint of sibilance .
These have the best highs I ’ve ever heard in an IEM and should please just about anyone looking for a great high end response .
Low end response is perhaps the weakest aspect of the RE0 ’s sonic presentation but even then , it ’s not at all bad .
Bass is very detailed and natural sounding but what it lacks in is body .
It just does n’t have quite enough “ oomph ” to my ears and as a result makes the entire sound signature somewhat thin .
Extension is very nice , as you can detect bass notes down to 20 Hz , even if those notes are n’t particularly powerful .
Soundstage and imaging are both good as well .
The soundstage is of average size and depth , with great instrument separation and decent imaging .
The RE0s do n’t necessarily need to be paired with an amp , despite their relatively high 64 ohm impedance but respond very well to the extra juice .
The soundstage widens a bit , separation and dynamics improve and the bass improves a bit in terms of fullness .
These also respond well to amps with a bass boost feature such as the inexpensive Fiio E5 and the JDS Labs CMoy BB , which highlight the great low end detail and sub-bass extension the RE0s possess .
Conclusion
Without a doubt , these are the best IEMs I ’ve ever heard .
These really make my music collection come alive and are very entertaining to listen to for long stretches .
They let the music sink in slowly if you ’re reading a book , doing homework or anything else that requires concentration while also allowing you to tune into the finer details of the music and really immerse yourself in the music you hear .
For the current asking price of $ 79 plus shipping from Head - Direct , you really ca n’t go wrong with the RE0s .
While these probably wo n’t satisfy bass - heads ( at least without a bass boosting amp ) , these can easily compete with IEMs three to four times their price and are an absolutely phenomenal value for the price .
I highly recommend these to budget conscious audiophiles who are interested in neutral and , above all , excellent sounding IEMs .
MYSTERY BEAST : Otago moose hunter Ken Tustin is unsure whether this photo captured a moose or a deer .
Is this a moose on the loose ?
Otago moose hunter Ken Tustin thinks he may have snapped a photograph of a juvenile moose in southwestern Fiordland .
The hulking animals have not been officially spotted in New Zealand for more than 50 years .
The photograph was taken on March 7 in an area of Fiordland known as Herrick creek , Mr Tustin said .
It was snapped automatically by one of 13 cameras he had set up in the area .
When he retrieved the images a few days ago , he waded through thousands that showed only deer .
" But there was one photo that was strikingly different and it had me sitting back with my hair on end . "
The first sign it was different was the " horse - shaped face " , which contrasted with the dog - shaped face of a deer , he said .
But the photo did not show enough detail to be sure , and he suspected it might actually be a deer , he said .
" I think this will always be a ' maybe ' . "
It could not be a half - moose , half - deer because the two species did not interbreed , he said .
Most people regarded the last official sighting of a moose to have been from 1952 , but he had documented several more sightings since then in his history of the species in New Zealand , he said .
Mr Tustin said his " absorbing , compelling interest " in all things moose had begun during a stint working as a scientist in Fiordland .
He estimated a population of 20 moose could be wandering around the area – though that was a " total guess " .

The Schalit family on Thursday asked for assistance from international left - wing activists due to arrive in the Gaza Strip later in the day .
If the left - wing activists pressure Hamas to allow international organizations to bring letters and food packages to Gilad Schalit , the kidnapped soldier 's family has agreed to support the international expedition 's attempt to dock , Army Radio reported Thursday .
Lawyer Nick Kaufman presented the offer to the organization " Free Gaza , " one of the organizers of the flotilla headed for Gaza , which promptly refused the offer .
" We are disappointed that the organizers of the flotilla have refused to also provide basic humanitarian assistance to our son , who has been held in Gaza four years in contradiction of international law , " said the Schalit family .
The IDF announced Wednesday evening that it was planning to stop the international convoy of nine ships currently on its way to Gaza carrying hundreds of activists and thousands of tons of supplies .
“ If they decide to continue sailing and do not listen to the instructions , then they will be stopped , brought to Israel and dealt with by the Interior Ministry , which will return them to the countries they came from , ” an IDF statement said .
According to the statement , the IDF will unload the supplies and transfer the shipment to the Gaza Strip , after inspecting it for weaponry .
The Navy has held a number of drills in recent weeks to prepare for the arrival of the small fleet , which is expected to try breaking the Israel - imposed sea blockade on Gaza and dock at its newly expanded port .
The scenarios drilled included the commandeering of the ships , which could , military sources said Wednesday , include violent clashes – depending on the response by the passengers on the vessels .
“ We will do everything to ensure that the operation runs smoothly , butare prepared for every possible scenario , ” one defense officialexplained .
Meanwhile Wednesday , the IDF continued its media blitz against theflotilla and released datashowing that all of the supplies the ships are carrying were alreadybeing transferred by Israel to Gaza via land crossings on a regularbasis .
“ This flotilla is a provocation that is not needed considering thehumanitarian situation in Gaza , which is stable and good , ” said Col .
Moshe Levi , commander of the IDF ’s Gaza Coordination and LiaisonAdministration .
Levi said that 100 trucks , loaded with supplies , enterGaza on a daily basis , and that in the past two months over 1,200 tonsof medical supplies were transferred to the Strip .
Mr. Obama argued for a slower course , saying , “ We are going to want to make sure that we can continue to move towards less emphasis on nuclear weapons , ” and , he added , to “ make sure that our conventional weapons capability is an effective deterrent in all but the most extreme circumstances . ”

The release of the new strategy , known as the Nuclear Posture Review , opens an intensive nine days of nuclear diplomacy geared toward reducing weapons .
Mr. Obama plans to fly to Prague to sign a new arms - control agreement with Russia on Thursday and then next week will host 47 world leaders in Washington for a summit meeting on nuclear security .
The most immediate test of the new strategy is likely to be in dealing with Iran , which has defied the international community by developing a nuclear program that it insists is peaceful but that the United States and its allies say is a precursor to weapons .
Asked about the escalating confrontation with Iran , Mr. Obama said he was now convinced that “ the current course they ’re on would provide them with nuclear weapons capabilities , ” though he gave no timeline .
He dodged when asked whether he shared Israel ’s view that a “ nuclear capable ” Iran was as dangerous as one that actually possessed weapons .
“ I ’m not going to parse that right now , ” he said , sitting in his office as children played on the South Lawn of the White House at a daylong Easter egg roll .
But he cited the example of North Korea , whose nuclear capabilities were unclear until it conducted a test in 2006 , which it followed with a second shortly after Mr. Obama took office .
“ I think it ’s safe to say that there was a time when North Korea was said to be simply a nuclear - capable state until it kicked out the I.A.E.A. and become a self - professed nuclear state , ” he said , referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency .
“ And so rather than splitting hairs on this , I think that the international community has a strong sense of what it means to pursue civilian nuclear energy for peaceful purposes versus a weaponizing capability . ”
Mr. Obama said he wanted a new United Nations sanctions resolution against Iran “ that has bite , ” but he would not embrace the phrase “ crippling sanctions ” once used by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
And he acknowledged the limitations of United Nations action .
“ We ’re not naïve that any single set of sanctions automatically is going to change Iranian behavior , ” he said , adding “ there ’s no light switch in this process . ”
US aircraft manufacturer Boeing will end a 70 - year history of building parts for some of the world ’s most famous jetliners in NSW after closing a plant in south - west Sydney with the loss of about 350 jobs .
Boeing announced today that it will close the manufacturing plant near Bankstown Airport over the next 24 to 30 months , shifting the work to its facility at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne .
Mark Ross , the managing director of Boeing Aerostructures Australia , said today that it made the decision to centralise operations because the two plants in NSW and Victoria were operating at less than 50 per cent capacity .
‘‘ We simply could not carry the overheads associated with operating two under - utilised plants , ’’ he said .
Boeing said about 300 new jobs at the Melbourne plant would be offered to the Sydney workers .
Exoplanet orbits that seem just right for life could be bent out of shape by pushy neighbors .
New simulations of extrasolar planetary systems may mean the definition of " habitable " planets needs to be completely overhauled .
When astronomers talk about the " habitable zone , " they mean the shell around a star where the temperatures are right for liquid water .
Any closer , and oceans will boil .
Any farther , and the planet will freeze .
But this definition assumes that most planets have roughly circular orbits , like the Earth and most other planets in the solar system .
" What we know from studying exoplanets is that that is definitely not the rule , " said Rory Barnes of the University of Washington at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Miami .
Many of the 454 exoplanets discovered to date have highly elliptical orbits , meaning the planets are not always the same distance from their parent star .
Thanks to this uneven geometry , the planet spends more time closer to its star , which tends to make for warmer planets .
Adding another planet , especially a bullying Jupiter - sized planet , can mess with orbits and make a once - hospitable planet move in and out of the habitable zone over time .
Using computer simulations of several hypothetical planetary systems , Barnes showed that a giant neighbor can pull an Earth - like planet 's orbit like a rubber band , shifting it from circular to elliptical and back to circular again in as little as a few thousand years .
" It 's a very stable , repetitive process , " Barnes said .
The Earth 's orbit actually does feel similar nudges from Jupiter , known as Milankovitch Cycles .
But luckily for us , these orbital shape shifts are subtle .
Barnes ' simulations predicted more - dire consequences for extrasolar planets near the edge of their habitable zones , though .
If the planet is on the cooler edge of the habitable zone , it could go through cycles of freezing and thawing .
If it 's on the warmer side , the temperature could fluctuate from comfy to boiling from one millennium to the next .
" The inner edge is much more dangerous , " Barnes said .
All the water could boil off and be lost forever , or the warming planet could experience a " runaway greenhouse " effect and end up a scorched wasteland like Venus .
But it 's not all bad news .
Barnes suggests that some planets we might dismiss as snowballs could just be going through an eccentric phase .
" Our own Earth has gone through stages of glaciation – we call them snowball Earth phases – and we managed to pull out of it , " he said .
" On a planet like that , on the outer edge , you will have reservoirs of life , and there will be habitats that will persist . "
For planets around dim , low - mass stars , which have to be especially close to be in the habitable zones , neighboring giant planets could wreak havoc with the length of the day , and the gravitational pull could cause cycles of volcanic activity and earthquakes interspersed with relative calm .
" These are fascinating worlds to think about , " Barnes said .
" It will do lots of interesting things as far as how climates might evolve and how evolution might happen on such a planet . "
The results suggest that the current definition of " habitable zone " may be too simplistic .
Astronomers may have to consider the whole family of exoplanets in a system before determining if one is habitable or not .
" One of the things that this new work is emphasizing is that one needs to be very careful about defining habitability , " commented Phil Armitage of the University of Colorado , Boulder .
" Those ideas about terrestrial planet formation and habitability of terrestrial planets will need to be re-evaluated from scratch . "

Home developers think that the service has a less than positive reputation .
It must feel pretty strange when you work hard on something that you know most people think is a piece of garbage .
That 's exactly the case with PlayStation Home content developer Veemee 's Kirk Ewing , who fully acknowledges that the game space does n't have the most favorable view amongst the gaming public .
Play.tm reports that at the last Game in Scotland event , Ewing admitted : " Most people think that Home is sh*t . "
Veemee is responsible for Home content such as the London Pub and the V - Store which sells many different kinds of Home apparel .
Ewing followed the statement with : " I 'm here to say that it 's not . "
Ewing also said that Home is set to leave the open beta phase it 's been in for at least the past year - and - a - half in December , though what this exactly means for the service is unsure , and Sony has not confirmed the claim .
His message on Home not being " sh*t " could possibly be referring to it as a platform for profit , rather than fun .
Waiting around in a virtual world to play a game of pool or to bowl was n't exactly the type of experience I wrote home to mom about ( my real home ) when Home first launched .
However , decorating one 's house and experiencing some of the exclusive mini-games and content on the service has been entertaining , but still is n't enough to graft me to regular use personally .
They always seem to be adding interesting sounding content , though .
Somebody must be into Home , as Ewing says that " one in three PlayStation 3 owners use Home " and " there are 1.7 million repeat users each using Home for around 53 minutes on average . "
I would think that anyone with a PS3 hooked up to the internet has tried Home as some point , explaining the first figure .
The second figure can only be explained by the addiction people seem to have to virtual dancing and harassment of female avatars .
Is Home sh*t like most people seem to think , or should it become a regular visit for more PS3 owners ?

Look , there 's no arguing that Apple charges a boatload for its first - party adapters , and this is n't the first time that one of those overpriced dongles has caused an uproar ( Mini DisplayPort to Dual - Link DVI Adapter , anyone ? ) .
But when the company trots out an iPad Dock Connector to VGA Adapter and promises to enable users to " see their videos and slideshows on the big screen , " it should probably make a few clarifications .
Instead , more than a handful of consumers are revolting over on Apple 's own webstore , noting that any video laced in any type of DRM ( iTunes flicks and Netflix streams included ) wo n't output at all .
Contrary to popular belief , this adapter does n't actually mirror the iPad 's display , which is fairly absurd in our eyes -- teachers are even stating that Apple 's own Pages and Keynote apps wo n't output via the dongle , making this effectively worthless for blowing up presentations for all to see .
We ( sort of ) get the DRM thing , but not including support in your own presentation app ?
Unacceptable .
A tipster has noted that Apple informed him that " it 's up to the app makers to enable the video out function , " so we suppose all that 's needed to solve a lot of controversy is for some switch to be flipped in some direction .
Any other hang - ups with this thing that the world should know about ?
Drop 'em in comments below .
[ Thanks , Tony ] :
A few tipsters have noted that Keynote does in fact work here .

For those of us outside the fusty world of philately , there are few reasons to get excited about stamps .
Most childhood collectors grow out of the pastime as they do fossils or football stickers .
To their annoyance , those who carry the habit into adulthood are considered a step above trainspotters in the hobbyist hierarchy .
But before you turn the page on this story of stamps , just try , for a moment , to set aside prejudice and consider one sticky little square of paper that surely deserves to be coveted .
The Penny Black , which first went on sale in London on 1 May 1840 , is neither the rarest nor the most valuable stamp in the philatelist 's album , but it is the most beautifully designed and nobly conceived .
It also changed the world in ways that should excite us all .
Before 1840 , there were no collectors to poke fun at because there were no stamps .
To dis - cover how momentous the arrival of the Penny Black was , we must imagine posting a letter in , say , 1835 , when you had to be rich – and patient – to use the Royal Mail .
Delivery was charged according to miles travelled and the number of sheets of paper used , and it was the recipient who had to pay when the top - hatted " letter carrier " came knocking .
If you lived in London and received a two - page letter from Cousin Hamish in Edinburgh , you would be stung for two shillings , or more than seven pounds in today 's money .
Letter writers employed various ruses to save money , doing everything possible to cram more words onto a page .
You wrote between or across the lines of your first page .
Nobody bothered with heavy envelopes ; instead , naked letters would be folded and sealed with wax .
You then had to find a post office – there were no pillar boxes – and hope your addressee did n't live in one of the vast areas of rural Britain not served by the system .
If you were lucky , your letter would arrive ( it could take days ) without being read or censored .
The state of mail had been causing concern throughout the 1830s , but it was Rowland Hill , an inventor , teacher and social reformer from Kidderminster , who proposed a workable plan for change .
Worried that a dysfunctional , costly service would stifle communication just as Britain was in the swing of its second industrial revolution , he believed reform would ease the distribution of ideas and stimulate trade and commerce , delivering the same promise as the new railways .
Hill 's proposal for a penny post , which meant any letter weighing less than half an ounce ( 14 grams ) could be sent anywhere in Britain for about 30 p in today 's money , was so radical that the Postmaster General , Lord Lichfield said , " Of all the wild and visionary schemes which I ever heard of , it is the most extravagant . "
Lichfield spoke for an establishment not convinced of the need for poor people to post anything .
But merchants and reformers backed Hill .
Soon the government told him to make his scheme work .
And that meant inventing a new type of currency .
Hill quickly settled on " a bit of paper ... covered at the back with a glutinous wash which the user might , by applying a little moisture , attach to the back of a letter " .
Stamps would be printed in sheets of 240 that could be cut using scissors or a knife .
Perforations would not arrive until 1854 .
The idea stuck , and in August 1939 the Treasury launched a design competition open to " all artists , men of science and the public in general " .
The new stamp would need to be resistant to forgery , and so it was a submission by one Mr Cheverton that Hill used as the basis for one of the most striking designs in history .
Cheverton , who worked as a sculptor and an engineer , determined that a portrait of Queen Victoria , engraved for a commemorative coin when she was a 15 - year - old princess , was detailed enough to make copying difficult , and recognisable enough to make fakes easy to spot .
The words " Postage " and " One Penny " were added alongside flourishes and ornamental stars .
Nobody thought to add the word " Britain " – the stamps were intended for domestic use – but so powerful was the design that , apart from the arrival of new royal faces over the years , it never changed , and would come to symbolise the Empire .
British stamps remain the world 's only stamps that do not bear the name of their country of origin .
The Penny Black was an instant hit , and printers struggled to meet demand .
By the end of 1840 , more than 160 m letters had been sent – more than double the previous year .
By the turn of the century , the figure had rocketed to 2.3bn .
It created more work for the post office , whose reform continued with the introduction of red letter boxes , new branches and more frequent deliveries , even to the remotest address , but its lasting impact on society was more remarkable .
Hill and his supporters had promised " moral " advantages from a cheaper post , which , they rightly predicted , would improve the " diffusion of knowledge " .
Suddenly , Cousin Hamish could be reached in a day or two and so , for the first time , Britain – and later the world – began to shrink .
As literacy improved , sections of society that had long been disenfranchised found a voice .
Tristram Hunt , the historian and would - be MP for Stoke , values the " flourishing of correspondence " that followed the arrival of stamps .
" While I was writing my biography of Friedrich Engels I could read the letters he and Marx sent between Manchester and London , " he says .
" They could write to each other three times a day , pinging ideas back and forth so that you can almost follow a real - time correspondence .
For historians that 's absolute gold . "
The penny post also changed the nature of the letter .
Weight - saving tricks such as cross- writing began to die out , while the arrival of envelopes built confidence among correspondents that mail would not be stolen or read .
And so people wrote more private things – politically or commercially sensitive information , and love letters .
" In the early days of the penny post , there was still concern about theft , " Hunt says .
" Engels would send Marx money by ripping up five - pound notes and sending the pieces in different letters .
But the probity of the postal system became a great thing and soon it was part of Britishness to expect that your mail would not be tampered with . "
So that 's why we should get excited about stamps ( or at least this one ) ; the Penny Black 's impact on society could only be compared with subsequent world - shrinking innovations such as the telegraph and the internet .
When , then , did people who liked stamps enough to collect them become anoraks in the popular imagination ?
Pretty soon .
In his 1988 work , Victorian Things , the historian , Asa Briggs , cites a report in Punch magazine in 1842 ( just two years after the arrival of stamps ) about a " new mania " that had " bitten the industriously idle ladies of England " .
A Times article in the same year reports a trend among such ladies to paper the walls of their dressing rooms with thousands of used Penny Blacks .
The fad was widely ridiculed .
By the 1850s , dealers in coins and other curios saw potential in stamps .
They included a 16 - year - old Plymouth boy called Stanley Gibbons , whose name would become synonymous with collecting .
Soon , " timbromanie " , or stamp mania , swept Europe , as post offices all over the world followed Britain 's lead with exotic stamps .
Enthusiasts began to stick them into albums that could be viewed like mobile museums – or inspiring windows on the empire and the wider world .
The practice of philately , the study ( rather than collection ) of stamps , soon followed .
Douglas Muir is curator of philately at the British Postal Museum and Archive , which is coordinating a year - long Festival of Stamps .
He says the joy of stamps is about more than pasting and hoarding : " Stamps are microcosms of the age and place that reflect a great deal about the attitudes , history and geography of a country , " he says .
" You can say the same today .
It 's hard to compare the Penny Black to the Harry Potter stamps issued in 2007 , but a hundred years from now , historians will look back and learn things about our popular culture . "

The bottom panel , which currently houses the Trash bin and the Show Desktop button , will be moved to the left side of the screen , and be used exclusively for launching and switching between applications .
The launcher panel will also be extended to be larger and easier to use with touch screens .
more touch - friendly .
The top menu bar will contain only one menu , from which all the other actions can be accessed .
The net effect of all this is to reduce wasted horizontal space and make more vertical pixels available for Web browsing .
Ubuntu Light versions are being developed as an easy way to " put a free software foot forward , " even where the use of Windows is predominant .
Ubuntu Netbook Light and Ubuntu Desktop
Light will boot almost instantly into a Web - ready environment that will protect keep any other data on the computer even if you 're connected to an unprotected network .
It does this by lacking support for traditional local file management , which keeps data safe but may force the user partly ( if not entirely ) into the cloud to do it .
The new Unity Design will be implemented beginning with .
Ubuntu Light is available to OEMs as of today .
CIA spy infiltrates Cannes red carpet
CANNES , France Ã¢â‚¬â€ Director Ken Loach , in Cannes with his Iraq war film , called Thursday for the “ war criminals ” George W. Bush and Tony Blair to be tried for launching the invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein .
“ We have to keep pursuing Blair , Bush and the others until we have them in the dock , ” he said as he arrived for a red carpet premiere of his film “ Route Irish ” which is in the running for the festival ’s Palme d’Or top prize .

“ It ’s certainly true that the people who started the war , who are war criminals , have not been called to account , ” said Loach , whose new work probes the murky world of private security contractors in Iraq .
Britain ’s former prime minister Blair was George W. Bush ’s staunchest supporter when the then US president launched the Iraq invasion in 2003 .
CIA spy infiltrates Cannes red carpet
The Iraq war returned to Cannes Thursday with Sean Penn and Naomi Watts taking the lead roles in thriller “ Fair Game , ” the true tale of a CIA agent betrayed by the Bush administration .
The movie by “ The Bourne Identity ” director Doug Liman got a round of applause — but also a few boos — at a press screening ahead of its red carpet premiere at the film festival in the French Rivieria resort .

It tells how the glamorous spy Valerie Plame , played by Watts , was stitched up by a vengeful White House after her diplomat husband publicly denounced its claims that Iraq leader Saddam Hussein was working on weapons of mass destruction .
US president George W. Bush used those claims as the main reason for invading Iraq in 2003 and ousting Saddam .
“ Fair Game ” is the second film this year to focus on the controversy , after the political thriller “ Green Zone , ” starring Matt Damon as a US army officer hunting in vain for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .

The Iraq conflict also came to Cannes on Wednesday , when Britain ’s Ken Loach screened his “ Route Irish , ” about the murky world of private security contractors in the war - torn country .
Liman ’s movie is the only US film in the race for the festival ’s Palme d’Or top prize to be handed out on Sunday .

He said it was the first foreign feature film to have actually shot some scenes in Iraq , where the director made a 24 - hour trip to film surrounded by heavily armed guards .
“ It ’s the story of two incredible people who found themselves in the middle of a giant maelstrom , ” the director said at a press conference held with Watts and the film ’s screenwriter .
Plame herself is in Cannes this week in connection with another film screening here , on the threat from nuclear weapons titled “ Countdown to Zero , ” in which she is interviewed as an expert witness .

Back in 2003 she was an undercover agent for the CIA , working in a dangerous counter - proliferation job linked to the hunt for suspected weapons of mass destruction .
Her husband is the former US ambassador Joseph Wilson , played by Sean Penn in Liman ’s film .
Wilson visited Niger in 2002 to investigate claims that Iraq tried to buy uranium for nuclear bombs and in 2003 wrote an article in the New York Times titled “ What I did n’t find in Africa . ”
That article was the start of a campaign to show that the Bush administration had twisted intelligence reports to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam .

A week after the New York Times article , the Washington Post put an effective end to Plame ’s CIA career by revealing that she was a secret agent who for years had been passing herself off to friends as a businesswoman .
Plame and her husband alleged her identity had been leaked as revenge by the White House for Wilson ’s opposition to the war .
A top White House official , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , was sentenced to jail for perjury and obstructing a probe of the leak .
Bush commuted the jail term but did not grant him a full pardon .
Liman said Thursday he also saw his film as a domestic drama that looks at “ how a marriage between a spy and a non - spy works ” when the wife ’s job is “ to lie to people all day long . ”

He added that with “ Fair Game ” he had finally fulfilled his ambition to “ make films that are both entertaining and meaningful . ”

27 Scudetti , 9 Coppa Italias , 3 European Cups , and 3 UEFA Cups .
Sounds like a team that should be competing for number one every year .
But alas , Juventus , the team described above , have floundered this season .
What precipitated this fall ?
Most of it stems from the Calciopoli scandal of 2006 , in which Juventus were stripped of two scudetti ( 2005 and 2006 ) and relegated to Serie B .
Juve quickly came back to the Serie A and the forefront of Italian football , but they have yet to win a Scudetto since the scandal .
They showed promise towards the end of last season under Ciro Ferrara , but he quickly proved to be an ineffective leader .
If you ask me , dismissing Claudio Ranieri in the first place was a mistake .
As Claudio proved this year with Roma , he is a talented manager , but evidently not talented enough for the Juventus front office .
Neither was Ferrara , as he was fired in January and replaced with Alberto Zaccheroni , whose main accomplishment is leading a lucky Milan squad to the Scudetto in the ’ 98 - ’99 season .
But there is more to the troubles in Turin then bad management .
For a club as successful as Juventus , one would think the squad would be full of world - class players who truly love their team .
This is not the case .
The defense has been embarrassing , one of the worst in the Serie A. Aside from Chiellini and Caceres , the defense has been a mishmash of over the hill and overrated players .
Now , how does Juventus go about fixing their defense ?
I have some ideas .
First off , sell Cannavaro and Legrottaglie .
Fabio Cannavaro , the captain of the Italian national team , might have been a great signing when he originally joined Juventus , in 2005 , but he proved himself unworthy of a spot on the team after he abandoned Juventus following their relegation to Serie B .
I think I know who can replace the aging duo in the backfield .
Obviously , only one starter is needed , since the great Giorgio Chiellini is the number one centerback .
My choice to fill the other spot is Lorenzo Ariaudo , a young Juventus - owned player who is currently on loan to Cagliari .
While Ariaudo has n’t had that much playing time with the Rosoblu , he has impressed when he has played .
I feel that Ariaudo could be a great member of the Juventus defense for years to come .
Now that the centerback situation is resolved , the problems of left and right back need fixing .
The left - back situation is in decent condition with Paolo De Ceglie , but Fabio Grosso needs to go .
Like his fellow Fabio , Fabio Cannavaro , Grosso is over the hill .
What Juve need is a young left - back , much like De Ceglie , to help share time in back , and the perfect man for the job is Domenico Criscito , the left back Juve recently sold to Genoa .
A great way to begin rebuilding the team is to buy back this talented youngster .
The right back situation is much worse .
Zydnek Grygera has been alright , and Juve should keep hold of him for depth .
However , Jonathan Zebina should not stay in Turin , not only has his play been sub-par , but he has turned his back on the fans , getting into an altercation with Juventus fans during the Europa League match against Fulham .
The man to replace Zebina is already at the club .
Martin Caceres , owned by Barcelona but on loan to the side from Turin , has showed that he belongs with the Bianconeri .
Not only has he displayed technical ability , but he , unlike some of his teammates , has shown dedication to the team .
With a few transfers , both in and out , the left / rightback situation in Turin can be fixed .
The Bianconeri ’s midfield is n’t that damaged .
While one of last summer ’s big transfers , Felipe Melo , has flopped , Marchisio and Sissoko have played well , with Marchisio showing he is ready to be a midfield anchor for years to come .
The oldster Camoranesi is talented and able , but he has few productive years left , perhaps Juventus will allow him to see out his playing days with the club .
Melo is a lot like the previously mentioned Zebina , ineffective .
He also joined Zebina by insulting the fans during after the Europa League match at Fulham .
One man who would fit nicely alongside Marchisio and Sissoko is Marek Hamsik .
Hamsik has been called the successor to Juve great Pavel Nedved .
Who said that ?
Pavel Nedved himself .
Adding Hamsik alongside Sissoko and Marchisio would create a feared trio in the middle of the field .
In the attack midfield position , Diego has shone , as has Candreva , and both should stay .
Sebastian Giovinco seems to have fallen out of favor with management , and although I would love to see him stay , there is a chance the front office will sell him .
There have also been rumors about 23 year old French attacking midfield Yoann Gourcuff , I think Gourcuff would be a great purchase , and Juve would be wise to bring him to Turin .
Gourcuff is young , and talented , and reminiscent of Zinedine Zidane , another Frenchman who was a star for Juventus before he finished his career with Real Madrid .
Another one of the Bianconeri ’s problems has been a lack of goals .
While they have talented forwards , they have had trouble scoring goals .
Their most talented striker is the legendary Alessandro Del Piero .
Unfortunately , Del Piero is almost 36 , and his best days are behind me .
This is why they have struggled , Del Piero has had to become their first striker .
Amauri , while talented , has struggled with injuries , and must go .
Iaquinta should stay , as he has a few good years left .
David Trezeguet , the 33 year old Frenchman , is a nice compliment to Iaquinta and Del Piero , and should see out his career in Turin .
But , it looks as if management will get rid of him after this season , and so the Juve fans will probably bid adieu to their favored Frenchman .
A good replace for Amauri and Trezeguet would be Fernando Torres , who has been rumored to be leaving Anfield for a club such as Chelsea or Man City , but I can not see him moving to another English team , if he does leave Liverpool , it will be to a non-English team , and Juventus fit that bill .
Recently , rumors have said that Juventus are interested in bringing back Zlatan Ibrahimovic , the 28 - year old striker currently at Barcelona and who played for Juventus before the Calciopoli scandal .
Zlatan has been inconsistent in Spain , but he shined in Italy with both Juventus and then Inter , and so I think a return to Italy will treat him well .
Juventus are lucky to have one of the best goalkeepers in the world in Gianluigi Buffon , but it is rumored they will sell him to free up transfer funds .
That would not be a good decision .
Buffon could still be a good goalkeeper for a number of years .
It is simply not worth it to sell him , as any benefits from such a deal would not outweigh the damages .
Juventus have appointed a new manager in Luigi Del Neri , a talented tactician who is fresh off of leading Sampdoria to 4th place and the Champions League , and who before that led a pretty mediocre Atalanta squad to some decent mid-table finishes .
Step one of the rebuilding is complete , a solid , experienced coach has been found .
In the end , Juventus will probably end up bouncing back .
With solid transfers and a good coach , they can jump back to the summit of Italian football by even next year perhaps .
But , if they continue their recent tradition of bad transfers and bad management , they will have a long and tough struggle ahead of them .

Once again , Canada appears near the top of the US government 's 2010 " Special 301 " piracy watchlist .
And once again , the Canadians are angry about being classed with China and Russia as the worst places on earth for intellectual property law .
Michael Geist , a prominent Canadian academic at the University of Ottawa law school , slams the report for " bullying " and being long on rhetoric but short on facts .
According to Geist , Canada 's reputation as a piracy haven simply is n't accurate :
According to the software industry 's own piracy numbers , [ Canada 's software piracy ] rate is declining and is dramatically lower than any other country on the priority watch list .
Moreover , even the Business Software Alliance has characterized Canada as a " low piracy country . "
According to the recording industry 's own numbers , the Canadian recording industry did not decline last year as badly as the US or Japan and it ranked well ahead of the global average for digital music sales growth .
According to the motion picture industry , illegal camcording has declined rapidly in Canada in recent years .
Canada is one of the only countries in the world with criminal convictions for such activities .
Canada is often characterized as a prominent home for BitTorrent sites , yet there are more sites hosted in European countries such as the Netherlands not included on the list .
Canada is the only participant in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement to be named to the Priority Watch List .
Apparently , our involvement in those talks counts for little .
Canadian copyright lawyer Howard Knopf , also no fan of the Special 301 process , agrees that Canada gets a bad rap for bad reasons .
In fact , he argues , Canadian copyright law is much stronger than US copyright law in at least 21 ways .
Here are a few :
Canada has a rich blank media levy scheme that has generated nearly $ 300 million overall to date , most of which will wind up in the USA .
Artists see at most about an average of $ 160 per year of this — and probably much less in reality on an average basis .
The US has never had anything comparable .
Canada has no parody right / exception for creators and users .
In fact , the Canadian Federal Court has explicitly ruled against such a right .
On the other hand , the US Supreme Court has confirmed such a right .
Canada has no time shifting exception that would clearly allow for legal use of DVRs / PVRs such as the TIVO in Canada .
The US has had this since the 1984 Betamax decision from the US Supreme Court .
Recent US jurisprudence in the Cablevision case has extended this user right and this technology into “ the cloud . ”
Canada has crown copyright , which leads to all kinds of unnecessary costs and complications for those ranging from advanced researchers to fishermen , who should be able to depend on mapping and GPS information for life saving purposes from the government and not privatized for profit parties .
Canada privatizes its government copyright for profit , which cannot happen in the USA .
As for the whole premise of the Special 301 report , people like Geist have been railing against it for years .
In a 2007 paper ( PDF ) , Geist argued that the process is merely political and is driven by special interests .
If it had any real basis in international law , the annual report would look quite different .
" While the USTR report and its supporters seek to paint many countries as laggards on copyright , " he wrote , " this rhetoric ignores the fact that many of those same countries are compliant with their international obligations .
In fact , of the three highlighted issues ( WIPO ratification , copyright extension , and camcording ) , only three of 192 United Nations members — the US , Singapore , and the Czech Republic — have completed all three reforms .
" Indeed , once the sound and fury behind the Special 301 report are stripped away , it becomes apparent that few countries respond directly to the US lobby effort , recognizing that no country should be in a rush to become the fourth country on that list .
The USTR may dole out many failing grades , but the real failure lies with countries that cave in to such bullying by enacting laws that are not in their national interest . "
Knopf concludes :
" The real danger is that well meaning but nonexpert officials and politicians on both sides of the border and even in other countries may be influenced by inaccurate and / or misleading findings by the USTR resulting yet again from the incessant spin , propaganda and lobbying at any cost by certain U.S. dominated industries .
One has to ask what financial return is expected by these industries to justify the clearly enormous spending on Canadian and American lawyer / lobbyist and other high - profile activity . "
Indeed , these assessments were echoed in the US by the CCIA , a trade group that counts Google and Microsoft among its members .
In its filing to USTR , CCIA argued ( PDF ) that keeping Canada on the Priority Watch List " would undermine Special 301 credibility . "
One of the key reasons given for including Canada on the watchlist is its failure to ratify the 1996 WIPO Internet treaties ( treaties which led directly to the DMCA in the US ) .
As CCIA notes , " Moreover , watch - listing one nation for nonratification of the WIPO Internet treaties would seem to require watch - listing all non-members of the WIPO Internet treaties .
The European Union , for example , only just ratified the Internet treaties late in 2009 , and by such logic was presumably as much a haven for pirates as Canada until that time . "
In what could one day be seen by historians as a seminal speech presented before the Paul Volcker - chaired Group of Thirty 's 63rd Plenary Session in Rabat , the ECB 's Lorenzo Bini Smaghi had two messages : a prosaic , and very much expected one : of unity and cohesion , if at least in perception if not in deed , as well as an extremely unexpected one , in which the first notable discords at the very peak of the power echelons , are finally starting to leak into the public domain .
It is in the latter part that Bini Smaghi takes on a very aggressive stance against not only the so - called " inflation tax " , or the purported ability of central bankers to inflate their way out of any problem , but also slams the recently prevalent phenomenon of fear - mongering by the banking and political elite , which has become the goto strategy over the past two years whenever the banking class has needed to pass a policy over popular discontent .
The ECB member takes a direct stab at the Fed 's perceived monetary policy inflexibility and US fiscal imprudence , and implicitly observes that while the market is focusing on Europe due to its monetary policy quandary , it should be far more obsessed with the US .
Bini Smaghi also fires a warning shot that ongoing divergence between the ECB and Germany will not be tolerated .
Most notably , a member of a central bank makes it very clear that he is no longer a devout believer in that fundamental , and false , central banking religion - Keynesianism .
First , a quick read through the " prosaic " sections of Bini Smaghi 's letter .
Bini Smaghi , who is a member of the executive board of the ECB , has a primary obligation to defend the ECB 's public image in this time of weakness and complete lack of credibility .
And so he does .
When discussing the ECB 's response to the Greek fiasco and contagion , he is steadfast that the response , although delayed and volatile , was the right one .
Furthermore , he claims that the hard path Europe has set on is the right one , as it will ultimately right all the fiscal wrongs , even without the benefit of individual monetary intervention .
Ultimately , the ECB is convinced that not letting Greece fail , either in the form of union expulsion or partial default , was the right decision , as " this sill force euro area countries to address their fiscal positions earlier .
It ’s not easy .
But it will be done , because it can be done and it has to be done in any case .
And , last but not least , because there are no alternatives . "
Alas , while we agree that admission is the first step on the road to recovery , the subsequent steps will prove to be insufficient .
The imbalances in Europe are of such great magnitude that hoping that countries eventually grow into their balance sheets by way of austerity is simply a ridiculous assumption , and as such does not merit extended overviews .
We note this with irony , because apparently the ECB , contrary to elementary school rule # 1 , favors quantity over quality .
As the ECB board member says :
Let me consider the arguments put forward by those who regard a Greek default as unavoidable .
Their first argument is economic .
The adjustment programme is too harsh , given the level of the debt - to - GDP ratio reached in Greece .
It will produce a debt spiral which will lead the country into a recession and deflation .
The problem is made worse by the loss of competitiveness suffered by Greece over the last decade and the impossibility of devaluing the currency .
Their reasoning is generally no more sophisticated than that .
Some analysts have put together a few numbers to show that they are aware of the problem .
But I have not seen a serious analysis of the 120 - page report produced by the IMF which looks at the various aspects of the programme , including the impact of the structural measures on growth , the sustainability analysis or other features of the programme .
Not one review of the realism of the assessments made by the staff of the IMF and the Commission .
In fact , I suspect most market analysts have not even looked at the adjustment path for the primary surplus which is embedded in the programme , which aims to reach 6 % of GDP in 2015 , a level no different from the ones that other countries in the past have implemented to consolidate their public finances .
It ’s a level that a number of other countries – including some outside the euro area – will have to achieve if they want to stabilise their debt .
Most market analysts and other observers have probably not even looked at the structural measures that are embedded in the programme , affecting for instance the labour market , or at several liberalisations , and their impact on economic growth .
The inefficiencies in the tax collection system , which have been aggravated before the elections , have also been overlooked .
The perception that the Greek programme will not work looks more like an assumption than the result of a serious assessment .
To summarise , I wonder which analysis is more serious and credible : the many one - pagers , very well publicised – I must admit – which probably aim to influence the rest of the market ; or the IMF ’s 120 pages of rather tedious analysis describing the contents of the programme , together with its risks .
To this we ask : if a collective brain trust is charged with the goal seeked , and well compensated by taxpayers , duty to put together a 1,200 page report that confirm the primary tenets of the trust itself , will Mr. Smaghi give it 10 times the credibility of the ECB 's report ?
Or how about one million typewriter - armed monkeys putting together 1,200,000 page " analyses " claiming that the Greek default is inevitable ?
We hope someone has the facilities to conduct just such an experiment .
Perhaps the futility of such a simplistic act is the very reason why not more than a one - pagers is required to refute the central bank dogma .
Thus the key axis of contradiction emerges : the ECB is willing to set off on the " demonstratedly " arduous journey of forcing its member states to right their fiscal ( income statement ) evils , yet while not acknowledging that the key missing link , balance sheet restructuring , is not necessary but critical .
There is a reason why plain vanilla restructurings focus on the balance sheet , and not on the income statement : a company with a fresh start balance sheet can grow its income statement without its debts being a hindrance , on the other hand , rarely if ever , do income statements allow companies to grow into untenable balance sheets .
This is the main flaw in the ECB 's plan .
And it is these very contradictions that force the European populace to lose its credibility in the ECB , a concern which even the central bank is all too aware of .
The balance of the " prosaic " part of the speech is along the same lines : merely a defense of the ECB 's line of actions , driven primarily by a direct response to the market , and thus a very short - sighted and reactive , instead of proactive , policy response , which merely invites the market to test out the ECB 's lack of resolve .
And once again , the ECB is not naive and is fully aware of this , yet it redirects attention to other source of " market - test " weakness : " Financial markets are testing each country , one by one , to see whether they are willing to adopt the necessary budgetary measures , starting with those which seem to be facing the greatest hurdles to consolidation . "
Bini Smaghi is right and wrong here : the market will continue testing country by country , but not to determine fiscal resolve , only to take advantage of the lack a monetary one .
And so from crisis to crisis , the market will continue reaching deeper until it finally tests the very core of the eurozone : Germany .
And speaking of Germany , this brings us to the other part of Bini Smaghi 's letter .
In one of the first open shots of public confrontation , we see that the ECB has been very much displeased not only by rampant fear - mongering , but by the words of Germany 's Angela Merkel , whose recent repeat declarations that Greece could be allowed to leave the union , have undermined the bedrock of the ECB .
Furthermore , as the WSJ reports , " in a rare show of defiance for the consensus - driven ECB , Germany 's central bank head Axel Weber told the German newspaper Börsen - Zeitung that he viewed the bond - buying decision " critically " and that it carried " substantial stability risks . "
Is this the type of rancorous infighting between Europe 's two main powers , that will seal the fate of the Eurozone experiment far more certainly than parliamentary stormings in Athens ?
We read in Bini Smaghi 's letter the first fingerpointing of displeasure by an ECB official aimed squarely at Germany :
A further dimension , in the European context , is the difference in cultures and sensitivities .
They affect how issues are communicated within countries , in particular between politicians and their electorates .
These are differences which totally disconcert financial markets .
For instance , in one large euro area country it was thought that public support for swift action could be achieved only by dramatising the situation , for instance , by telling the public that “ the euro is in danger ” or by considering the possibility of expelling a country from the euro area .
But it was not realised that , in the midst of a financial upheaval , such words are like fanning the flames and that the cost of the support package could only increase following such dramatic declarations .
By contrast , in other countries , leaders want to be seen as being in control of the situation and taking all sorts of initiatives to reassure their electorates .
The media , of course , have a field day reporting on such apparently inconsistent activities .
We hope that the ECB 's displeasure by the kind of racketeering that Americans have grown to know and loathe , as it is performed either openly by politicians who directly threaten with end of the world scenarios every time they wish to get their way , or indirectly , such as when the market crashes a 1,000 points when it appears that the Fed is on the verge of losing its secrecy , is espoused by more individuals and organizations .
On the other hand , we will closely follow the now open feud between German and Europe 's Central Bank - if past experience is any indication , infighting between these two will only lead to mutual weakening , and result in an even faster forced reorganization of peripheral European countries , and , eventually the euro .
In this regard , perhaps Bini Smaghi 's speech created far more damage than damage control : now that the public's , and more importantly , the market 's , attention is be drawn to the duel between Germany and the ECB , this will merely destabilize the monetary union even more , now that monetary and political unions , and conflicts , are synonymous , a point not lost on the ECB executive himself : " As I said earlier , monetary union is de facto a political union . "
And now that European monetary " politics " are the center stage , we find two other pearls in Bini Smaghi 's speech .
Not too surprisingly , the ECB is now directly pointing a finger at the Fed , where conventional wisdom has long held the belief that due to its ability to determine independent monetary policy , backed by the world 's reserve currency , the Fed can and always will easily inflate its way out of any complication .
To believe that an inflation tax can solve the problem posed by the mounting public debt is an illusion that some people like to cultivate .
For several reasons .
First , people are less naïve than some might think – they dislike an inflation tax as much as other forms of fiscal adjustment .
Second , it ’s not so easy to generate inflation , in particular ‘ surprise ’ inflation , without provoking a more - than - proportional increase in interest rates , also in light of the short average maturity of public debt in most countries .
Third , a rise in inflation , and inflation expectations , would produce a major upward shift in the yield curve , inflicting major losses on the banks and financial institutions which have been heavily investing in these markets , potentially undermining the recovery .
This is probably the best encapsulation of the threats , or rather threat , that another QE episode by the Fed will bring with it .
In essence the ECB is saying that should the Fed pursue another QE episode , the imminent explosion in short - end interest rates will lead to a solvency crisis within the US itself , monetary policy or not .
Bini Smaghi points out one very critical truth : in not having a reserve currency , and thus protected by the belief that the ECB can inflate its way out of complication , it is forced to pursue fiscal reform , much sooner than the US will , which will only result in a much greater crisis in the US , once it becomes clear that the marginal influence of monetary policy will be drowned out by a sea of fiscal imprudence .
And for the one true shining example of the latter , look no further than the CBO 's 10 year budget deficit estimates .
In short , the impossibility of resorting to an inflation tax is forcing euro area countries to tackle the burden of public debt sooner rather than later .
In other countries the illusion of being able to resort to the inflation tax might delay the adjustment , but the longer the treatment is postponed the harsher it ’s likely to be .
End of digression .
Was this the first shot across the bow in the the transatlantic central bank wars ?
Too bad the ECB will be insolvent overnight if the Fed decides to truly escalate and pull all its swap lines tomorrow .
Why risk retaliation ?
This is easily the most important question needing answering over the next several weeks .
Last , but not least , are the following zingers that have no other intent than to poke at the ever larger holes appearing in the fabric of that one modern false economic religion known as Keynesianism .
In the aftermath of the Lehman failure , governments around the world seemed to rediscover Keynes .
They injected huge amounts of borrowed money – public funds – to stabilise the economy after the shock of the Lehman failure .
These policies worked , and averted a global depression .
The success of those policies has led governments – encouraged by international organisations – to continue using expansionary fiscal policies to try pulling the economy out of the recession and getting it back to the pre-crisis level .
The strategy is based on a model which may turn out to be inappropriate in the current conjuncture .
Let me discuss some of the underlying assumptions of the model .
First , the initial fiscal impulse was successful in avoiding a depression because it helped to coordinate agents ’ expectations , in the Keynesian or Knightian way of reducing uncertainty , thereby avoiding a vicious circle of recession and deflation .
The direct impact on domestic demand may have been more modest , as shown in countries where the size of the fiscal stimulus was more contained but nevertheless fared equally well .
Second , potential growth might have been severely affected by the crisis .
As a result , the pre-crisis level of output , achieved in a bubble economy , would not represent a sustainable objective over the policy - relevant horizon .
Third , the level achieved by the public debt in many countries may have impaired the effectiveness of further expansionary fiscal policy .
To sum up , while the fiscal expansion was successful immediately after the Lehman crisis , it may not be sustainable over time and may have to be corrected rapidly .
Financial markets seem to be giving increasing attention to this hypothesis .
And they have started to test it .
Is this the last degree of " religious " doubt before outright revulsion set in and the oligarchic heretics emerge ?
More so than the question of whether or not the euro is viable , is whether the beginning of the end for Keynesianism is approaching ?
If so , the imminent revolution in Western world economic thought will be unprecedented , and the resulting global reset will lead to a world where daily news will no longer be dominated by headlines about more record banker theft going unpunished , co-opted and facilitated by a cheaply purchased legislative , executive and judicial system .

As Bangkok suffers its worst political unrest for two decades , the Thai army has declared parts of the city " live - fire zones " , warning that anyone found entering certain roads in the capital will be shot on sight .
The move came as one of the leaders of the redshirt protesters said that there would be " civil war " if the army did not pull back and declare a ceasefire .
After two days of conflict , the army stepped up efforts to cut off the redshirts from the rest of the world , sealing off swaths of the city .
Troops have erected signs at Ratchaprarop Road , on the northern edge of the redshirts ' camp , warning , in Thai and English : " No Entry , Restricted Area . Live Firing Zone " .
Protesters still risked their lives to harass troops , drawing fire as they ran across the deserted streets to hurl rocks and bottles .
Others , including residents caught out by the army 's sudden move , were seen fleeing the area with their hands above their heads .
Since violence re-erupted in Bangkok on Thursday with the shooting of renegade army general Seh Daeng , 24 people have been killed , bringing to 54 the death toll since 12 March .
More than 1,100 have been injured , including more than 150 during the past three days .
International bodies called for calm as the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , urged both sides to do everything in their power to avoid further loss of life .
British ambassador Quinton Quayle and former US ambassador William Itoh have also called for the two sides to restart talks .
In the middle of the sprawling encampment in the heart of Bangkok 's shopping and finance districts , redshirt leaders remained resolute .
Weng Tojirakarn , head of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship , demanded the government declare a ceasefire and pull back its troops because " we do n't want to see a civil war .
If it does happen , I do n't know how many years it will take to end . "
Speaking publicly for the first time in two days , Thailand 's prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , said that his administration was acting in the interests of the majority of Thai people .
" The government has no choice but to move forward [ in ending the protest by force ] , " he said in an address carried live on every Thai TV channel .
" We have tried every other method to bring this to an end . "
He asked that the people of Bangkok co-operate with the government 's efforts and that protesters allow women and children to leave the camp .
On the streets , however , there is a growing realisation that the impasse will not end without further bloodshed .
Behind the fortifications of bamboo staves and fuel - filled tyres , the redshirt guards say they are prepared to face the troops when they march in .
" We are all very afraid , " Somchai Sanwong said as he manned the barricades , a few hundred yards from troop positions .
The redshirts have piles of rocks and Molotov cocktails stashed to hurl at troops when they finally advance .
They also have gallons of motor vehicle oil to make the road slippery .
Deeper inside the camp , sources say , the redshirts have dozens of M79 rocket - launched grenades .
Several were fired last night at an inner-city police station .
" Obviously we 're outgunned , outnumbered .
In the worst case , if the soldiers come , we 'll just burn the barricades , " Somchai said .
In the no man 's land between the redshirt fortifications and the troop roadblocks , some of the streets in Bangkok are eerily quiet .
Businesses are shut and thousands of residents have fled .
The government says it has no timetable yet to order troops to march on the redshirts ' barricades .
It intends , for now , to restrict the protesters ' communications and access to reinforcements , as well as supplies of food , water and power .
After two days of porous army roadblocks that allowed supplies and thousands of extra protesters to reach the camp , movement in central Bangkok is now heavily restricted .
Vehicles and bags are being checked at roadblocks for supplies , and only those who can prove they are resident or work inside the cordoned - off area are allowed in .
Already there are reports of food shortages .
By most estimates , the redshirts can only sustain themselves for a few more days .
Reality has hit home for one of the " Real Housewives of Orange County 's " blond - and - Botoxed stars : Tamra Barney unloaded her Tuscan - style house in a short sale , the Orange County Register reports .
The 4,300 - square - foot Ladera Ranch showpiece went for $ 1.12 million , a 30 % discount from the original $ 1.6 million asking price .
In a short sale , the lender - in this case , JP Morgan Chase - agrees to a price less than what is owed .
The process helps troubled owners avoid a foreclosure .

Image caption Mr Qahtani was arrested on 3 May after a note about the plot was found
An alleged al - Qaeda militant detained in Iraq has given details about a plan he had to attack the World Cup in South Africa next month .
The Saudi man , Abdullah Azam Saleh al - Qahtani , told reporters he had suggested an attack on the Dutch and Danish teams in revenge for cartoons drawn of the Prophet Muhammad .
But he said senior al - Qaeda leaders had not yet approved the plan .
On Monday Iraqi police claimed to have prevented an attack on the World Cup .
The claims prompted phone calls from South African police , trying to find out what was going on .
' Target fans '
Mr Qahtani was arrested after Iraqi forces found a note detailing the plan in a hideout used by two senior al - Qaeda figures , killed in April .
" We discussed the possibility of taking revenge for the insults of the prophet by attacking Denmark and Holland , " Mr Qahtani told the Associated Press .
" If we were not able to reach the teams , then we would target the fans . "
The plan would have included car bombs and gun attacks .
The plan had not been approved , but had been awaiting the green light from al - Qaeda 's number two man , Ayman al - Zawahiri , Mr Qahtani said .
" It was only an idea to blow up the World Cup , " he said .
" It was relayed through other men , but I did n't get a reply . "
Details discovered
It is not clear if al - Qaeda in Iraq has the resources to carry out a complicated attack that far away from their home base .
A note detailing the plan and Mr Qahtani 's name , was discovered in a joint US and Iraqi operation in which top al - Qaeda in Iraq operatives Abu Ayyub al - Masri and Abu Omar al - Baghdadi were killed .
Mr Qahtani was arrested by the Iraqi authorities on 3 May .
In 2006 a Danish newspaper published 12 cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad , including one that showed a bomb in his turban .
In the Netherlands , anti-Islamic politicians have called the Koran a " fascist book " .
Fifa has said it will not comment on any specific or potential threats to the World Cup .
South African police spokesman Vish Naidoo said the South African police had only heard about the plan through the media and had not received any information from the Iraqi authorities .
Mr Qahtani arrived in Iraq from Saudi Arabia in 2004 after the US invasion .
He was arrested in 2007 and held for two years in Camp Bucca , AP reported .

The need for greater linkages between the environmental , peace and Wall Street reform movements grow by the day in the face of the epic oil spill caused by British Petroleum , a multinational firm tied to Goldman Sachs and Halliburton in oil wars from the Gulf of Mexico to the Persian Gulf .
Ad Policy
Peter Sutherland , chairman of BP ’s board for the past decade , had headed Goldman Sachs International and , in the 1990s , was a director of the World Trade Organization .
Last year Sutherland touted BP ’s founders as the “ cream of Edwardian society ” who organized the Anglo - Persian oil company in 1909 with a concession from the Shah of Persia .
Kicked out of Iraq by former president Saddam Hussein in the 1960s , BP recently has been rewarded with the concession to exploit what “ could be one of the largest expansions of crude - oil production ever achieved anywhere ” , according to the Wall Street Journal .
The BP - Halliburton connection was not only forged in Iraq , but in underwater catastrophes in 2009 in Australia ’s sea of Timor and explosion two weeks ago of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the southern US coast .
Halliburton performed the concrete work that preceded both spills , and the New York Times reports a Halliburton employee has acknowledged “ that he made the problem worse ” during the Australian spill .
As for the recent disaster , Halliburton officials claim it would be “ premature and irresponsible to speculate ” on the cause .
The Goldman Sachs connection remains to be investigated , but it appears Sutherland had a conflict of interest in his dual roles at BP and the Wall Street giant .
BP and Goldman were involved heavily in the 1990 and in 2000 in achieving deregulation of energy futures trades from the previous oversight of the Commodities Futures and Exchange Commission ( CFTC ) .
As most crude oil futures trades became deregulated , the price of oil skyrocketed from $ 18 per barrel in 1988 to $ 36 in 2000 , to $ 110 in 2008 .
BP ’s environmental crimes also include the use of Colombian paramilitaries to protect its jungle pipelines and thousands of air pollution violations at its Carson oil refinery in Los Angeles .
BP has asserted that the goal of global warming initiatives should be to stabilize emissions at 500 - 550 ppm , levels considered shocking by most environmental experts .
And yet despite its status as a serial and dangerous polluter , BP has attempted to cultivate a reputation as a “ responsible ” oil company , famously rebranding itself as BP “ Beyond Petroleum ” with a $ 200 million Ogilvy and Mather advertising campaign in 2000 , and known for encouraging “ dialogues ” and “ partnerships ” with mainstream environmental organizations like the National Wildlife Federation .
The current oil spill invites a coming together of many social movements , including those inspired by the recent indigenous gathering in Bolivia and mainstream groups with a new opportunity for principled battle against the Obama administration ’s embarrassing energy legislation which green - lights more off - shore drilling .
It remains for progressives to move beyond a single - issue focus to make the connections between Wall Street , war , and environmental destruction .
I ’m not even gonna bother describing this ; you ’ll understand what this is about five seconds after you hit “ play . ”

How to maintain your engine
Your engine is the heart of your car and one of the most expensive parts to replace .
With your good care , it can last long .
We have met many owners of high - mileage cars and trucks with an engine that still runs like new .
What is the secret ?
Why are regular oil changes important ?
Your engine has a lot of moving and rotating parts .
These parts need to be well lubricated , whether it 's freezing or sweltering outside .
That 's the function of the engine oil .
As you drive , the oil degrades .
It breaks down under high temperatures and loses its lubricating quality .
As a result , carbon deposits form on internal parts .
See this photo of oil sludge inside the engine .
Through the engine ventilation system , carbon deposits spread into the engine intake and build up inside the throttle body and on the intake valves causing Check Engine light problems .
The increased friction causes accelerated wear .
Synthetic and semi-synthetic oils can withstand higher temperatures and last longer , but they have their limit too .
For as long as you keep up with your oil changes and keep the oil level topped up , your engine remains well - lubricated and clean inside , like in the top photo .
What are the signs that your car needs an oil change ?
You can check the engine oil level and condition with the dipstick .
If it looks too dirty , have the oil change done .
Read here on how to check engine oil : Simple car maintenance checklist .
Is there a warning light for low oil ?
No , most cars do n't have any warning light that will warn you if the oil level is low .
There is the low oil pressure warning light , but by the time it comes on , the level could be so low that it 's not even enough to keep the minimum oil pressure .
The proper oil pressure , as well as the level are vital for lubrication of all moving parts .
Many cars have an oil change reminder message , but it 's based on the mileage driven or time since the last oil change .
The oil change reminder does n't know the oil level .
Will the Check Engine light come on when the oil level is low ?
The low oil level could cause the Check Engine light to come on , but again , the level might be already so low that it caused more problems .
For example , a timing chain may skip without proper tension .
In most cars , a timing chain tensioner is controlled by oil pressure .
Another common problem is when the low oil level causes problems with a variable valve timing ( VVT ) system that is also controlled by oil pressure .
Advertisement - Continue reading below
How often should you check your oil ?
Check engine oil level
The goal is to maintain the proper level of oil .
Car manufacturers recommend checking the oil level on a regular basis , some manufacturers advise doing it every time you refuel .
Many modern cars consume some amount of oil between oil changes .
If you check the level after 1,000 miles and it is close to the " Low " mark , check it more frequently and top up as needed .
Oil leaks are another reason to check the level more often .
Some cars barely use any oil between oil changes .
If you check the level after 3,000 miles and it's still close to full , then you know when you should check it the next time .
How to prevent the engine from overheating
Have the vehicle checked if the engine temperature rises more than normal
Overheating is the source of many engine problems and in worst cases , it can result in major engine repairs or even replacement .
One of the common problems is when the coolant level drops due to leaks , which causes the engine to overheat .
Other reasons for overheating include a failed water pump , radiator fan or the thermostat .
How can you prevent overheating ?
Keep the cooling system topped up and have the vehicle checked if the engine temperature rises more than normal .
Read :
Car maintenance checklist : how to check the coolant level .
Watch out for coolant leaks and repair them before the coolant drops to dangerous levels .
Keep the front of the radiator clean from debris , as the coolant is cooled down by the air flow passing through the radiator fins .
Is it worth it to switch to synthetic oil ?
Synthetic oil
Most modern cars already require synthetic oil , as it offers better protection for the engine .
Synthetic oil can withstand higher temperatures , lasts longer and provides better lubrication at below - zero temperatures .
Using synthetic oil makes perfect sense if you have a low - mileage or turbo engine or often drive in severe conditions such as high temperatures , excessive load or longer intervals without an oil change .
However , if your car does n't require synthetic , switching to synthetic oil at high mileage is not always worth the extra cost .
A high - mileage engine is more likely to develop leaks or run noisier with synthetic oil as it's " thinner . "
How long can you go between oil changes with synthetic oil ?
Synthetic oil does lasts longer , but what about products of wear ?
Rotating and moving parts inside the engine will wear , whether you use regular or synthetic oil .
If you drive longer between oil changes , the tiny metal particles and other products of wear mix with oil , reducing its lubricating ability .
On top of this , they clog up the oil filter , restricting the oil flow , which in turn , further increases friction .
We recommend keeping oil change intervals close to what is recommended by your car manufacturer regardless of type of oil used .
Do oil additives really help ?
Car manufacturers advise against using oil additives
Most car manufacturers do n't recommend using any additives , but you will find many people swear by them .
We had tried several products in different engines .
Some oil additives did n't have much effect , but others actually worked .
For example , there was a four - year old Honda Accord that was consuming more than 2 quarts of oil between oil changes .
Since the engine overall was in good shape , we suspected that the oil rings were stuck in their grooves due to carbon build - up .
We added an oil additive that was said to " help free sticking oil rings " and it worked .
After this , the oil level in this Honda stayed almost the same between oil changes .
Is your air filter clean ?
An engine air filter prevents dust and other debris from being sucked into your engine .
A clogged - up air filter restricts the air flow , causing lack of power when passing or accelerating .
An old air filter can actually collapse or rip through , allowing sand and dust into the engine .
An air filter is typically replaced every 15,000 - 25,000 miles or more often if you drive on unpaved roads .
Replacing an air filter can cost from $ 30 to $ 50 .
Many DIY car enthusiasts change an air filter at home ; in most cars , it 's actually not very difficult .
Does your engine need a tune - up ?
Common tune up items : spark plugs , spark plug wires , air filter and throttle body service
An engine tune - up needs to be done every 60,000 to 90,000 miles .
In modern cars , a tune - up may include changing spark plugs and an air filter .
Iridium - or platinum - tipped spark plugs last longer , but we have seen them getting contaminated to the point where they cause an engine to misfire .
Read more about spark plugs below .
If your car has spark plug wires and fuel filter , they may also need to be replaced .
In some cars , a PCV valve can fail causing increased oil consumption .
It 's another item to check during a tune - up .
Your mechanic may also suggest cleaning the throttle body .
A very dirty throttle body can cause too low or too high idle speed and the Check Engine light .
See how a dirty throttle body looks compared to new .
Often , problems with idle speed happen after a car battery has been replaced or disconnected .
When the battery is disconnected , an engine computer resets some learned values , including the throttle angle .
In many cars , the idle RPMs has to be re-learned after disconnecting the battery .
Carbon buildup on the intake valve
In some high - mileage cars with direct fuel injection , carbon deposits , accumulated on the intake valves ( see the photo ) can cause misfiring .
If your car has a direct injection , your mechanic may suggest cleaning intake valves during a tune - up .
There are several ways to clean intake valves .
It can be done with a special solution that sprays inside the intake while the engine is running or manually .
Cleaning valves manually is more effective , but it requires more labor .
Check these YouTube videos for more info .
How do you know if your spark plugs need changing ?
Old conventional spark plugs have a larger electrode gap .
Some cars have conventional spark plugs , some have long - lasting ( Iridium / Platinum ) spark plugs .
Conventional spark plus wear out with mileage and the electrode gap increases , see the photo .
The larger gap requires higher voltage to produce a spark .
This adds load on the ignition coil and a spark plug wire .
Eventually an ignition coil fails or a spark plug wire shorts out causing the engine to misfire .
Conventional spark plugs need to be replaced at lower mileage , before 60,000 - 80,000 miles .
Many modern cars have long - lasting platinum - or iridium - tipped plugs .
The electrode gap stays the same longer , but spark plugs can get contaminated .
New vs. old Iridium - tipped spark plugs .
We have seen iridium - tipped spark plugs last for over 160,000 miles .
However , we have also seen many cars where contaminated spark plugs were causing ignition coils to fail much earlier .
The symptoms of worn - out or contaminated spark plugs include rough idle , occasional misfiring at start up and acceleration .
Often , however , there is no symptoms until an ignition coil fails .
Read more about ignition coils problems , when to replace and repair costs .
Does your car have long - lasting spark plugs ?
One way is to check the maintenance schedule for your car .
If it says replace at 120,000 miles , it 's probably long - lasting ones .
You also can check in the Specifications section of your owner 's manual , it will say it 's iridium or platinum - tipped or it will give you the part number .
Google the part number and it will tell you what kind of spark plugs you have .
Long - lasting spark plugs are more expensive , around $ 25 - $ 40 apiece .
Conventional spark plugs go for $ 8 - $ 16 each .
When to replace a timing and serpentine belt ?
Timing belt
Not all cars have a timing belt .
Many modern cars have a timing chain instead of a belt .
You can check your maintenance schedule , it usually mentions when a timing belt must be replaced or at least inspected .
A timing chain does n't need regular replacement .
In most cars , timing belt replacement intervals vary between 60,000 and 105,000 miles ( 96,000 - 168,000 km ) .
Read more about the timing belt .
All gasoline - or Diesel - powered cars have at least one serpentine belt .
An old serpentine belt can break , which means your car will have to be towed in .
If a serpentine belt shows signs of wear or is found to be soaked in oil it must be replaced .
Read more : Serpentine Belt : problems , signs of wear , when to replace , noises .
Do turbo engines require more maintenance ?
Chevrolet Cruze 1.4L turbo engine .
A turbocharger turbine is spun by exhaust gases that are extremely hot , but the turbine shaft is lubricated by engine oil .
This means that engine oil in a turbo engine must be capable of withstanding much higher temperature .
For this reason , many turbocharged cars require special synthetic oil .
If your turbocharged engine requires mineral oil , make sure to have the oil changes done regularly , as mineral oil carbonizes much faster in a turbocharged engine .
When you stop a turbocharged car after a long uphill climb , towing or driving hard , do n't shut the engine off right away .
Let it idle for a while to cool down the turbocharger .

YOU GUYS I went falconing for the first time yesterday .
We went to Arran and got to handle four birds : a hybrid falcon , an eagle - ( or , in North America , Horned ) owl , a Harris hawk and a buzzard .
The falcon was amazing , she ate a chick from my hand ( a somewhat disconcerting experience for vegetarian me .
And , as it turns out , chicks are full of recognizable YOLK ) .
The owl was adorable , I 'd take him home in a second .
And the hawk and the buzzard are the ones we actually got to fly , which was a whole other kind of amazing , watching the way they adjusted their flight to land on you .
The whole thing was quite thrilling , and I absolutely recommend it for those without crippling fear of birds ...
Home to the famed Alamo , River Walk , and the location of several major U.S. military installations , San Antonio is the second largest city in the state of Texas , and the seventh largest city in the country .
The San Antonio commercial real estate sector – like the city itself – is rapidly growing , primarily due to a strong economic base bolstered by the health care industry , financial services , national defense and tourism ( approximately 20 million visitors annually . ) .
[ property_contact_form ]
Mixed - use projects , office building and expansive retail center developments , as well as record - breaking industrial and warehouse space construction in 2007 , continuing well into this year , will help satisfy the ongoing demand for San Antonio commercial real estate space .
San Antonio Office Space
Currently , San Antonio office space continues to show positive growth .
Vacancy of 11 percent at the close of the fourth quarter 2007 is already showing signs of lowering due to San Antonio ’s low - cost business environment fueling strong growth in the finance , health care and information technology sectors , and assuredly will balance out office space absorption during 2008 .
San Antonio Industrial and Warehouse Space
The availability of San Antonio industrial and warehouse space grew considerably in 2007 due to more than 968,000 square feet of record - breaking new construction of storage , manufacturing and distribution facilities .
With over 400,000 square feet of industrial and warehouse space under construction this year , this growth has far exceeded the 700,000 square feet of industrial space added per year prior to 2007 .
Much of this construction has been geared toward maximizing the Port of San Antonio ’s importance and a major shipping and distribution center .
The " world 's largest airship " - according to its makers - was inflated for the first time yesterday and is undergoing ground tests inside a mighty roofed exhibition hall in Alabama which in normal times offers " the space for 1500 cattle " .
The " Bullet 580 " ship measures 235 feet long and 65 feet in diameter .
It is intended to carry payloads of almost one tonne to altitudes of 20,000 feet on surveying or surveillance missions .
The Bullet design was developed in Canada by a company called 21st Century Airships , spawned by well - known ballooning and airship enthusiast Hokan Colting ( he was partnered in the balloon biz with fellow Swede Per Lindstrand - noted aerial daredevil and chum of beardy bizlord Richard Branson - in 1970s Britain ) .
Colting achieved a 20,000 - foot - plus airship height record in a spherical 21st - century airship above Alberta in 2003 .
The Bullet design , based on a 21st - century flying prototype called Voyager , offers various special sauces compared to a standard helium - filled blimp .
Its propelling ducted fans are mounted along the centreline of the hull rather than beneath it , so that the nose does n't lift when more power is applied .
The zeppelin - finally sorted out ?
Slats also allow the pilot to control the airflow emitted by the ducted fans , meaning that traditional tailplanes and rudders are n't required - and that the ship can still be controlled even when not moving foward through the air .
This is supposed to offer good manoeuvrability even when hovering , and to mean that the large ground handling crews required by normal airships are unnecessary .
Did you know about -> and ->>?
This is the second post in my „ Did you know ? “ series .
This time we will have a closer look at -> and ->> .
From `->` to `->>` and back again
We all know the two threading forms which help a lot with chains of calls .
-> threads on the first position , ->> on the last .
Here some examples .
( -> a b ( c d ) ( e f ) g ) ( g ( e ( c ( b a ) d ) f ) ) ( ->> a b ( c d ) ( e f ) g ) ( g ( e f ( c d ( b a ) ) ) )
Sometimes you have one or two one calls in the middle of the chain which require the other form .
Then one has to split the chain .
( let [ first - part ( -> a b ( c d ) ) second - part ( ->> first - part ( map h ) ( filter pred ) ) ] ( -> second - part ( e f ) g ) )
However , we can actually simplify this !
( -> a b ( c d ) ( ->> ( map f ) ( filter pred ) ) ( e f ) g )
Going the other way around is not so trivial .
Trying the naive approach we get the following .
( ->> x ( map f ) ( -> ( get :x ) ) ( filter pred ) ) ( filter pred ( map ( get :x ) f x ) )
Not quite what we want .
The reason is , that ->> inserts the expression at the end of the next form .
This is also the case for the contained -> form .
And from there on things go southwards .
However with a small trick , we can still get what we want : we simply have to start with -> .
( -> a ( ->> ( map h ) ( filter pred ) ) ( c d ) ( e f ) ( ->> ( remove second - pred ) ( reduce i ) ) )
Here is a practical example ( allthough a little stretched ) : a column index to Excel column converter .
user= > ( def column - chars " ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
" ) #' user / column - chars user= > ( defn index - to - column [ idx ] ( ->> idx ( iterate # ( -> % dec ( quot 26 ) ) ) ( take - while ( complement zero ? ) ) ( map # ( -> % dec ( rem 26 ) ( ->> ( nth column - chars ) ) ) ) reverse ( apply str ) ) ) #' user / index - to - column user= > ( index - to - column 1 ) " A " user= > ( index - to - column 26 ) " Z " user= > ( index - to - column 27 ) " AA " user= > ( index - to - column 677 ) " ZA "
Did you also know about `doto` ?
And finally – as a small teaser that there is more to explore – there is also doto .
Consider this Swing example .
( doto ( JFrame . ) ( .setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame / DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE
) ( -> .getContentPane ( .add ( JButton .
" Hello " ) ) ) ( .setVisible true ) )
There is a lot to explore in Clojure .
Go on and experiment !

Some conspire to take power ; others conspire to keep it What we don�t know explains what we don�t understand .
This is why the work of the Gold Anti-Trust Action committee , GATA , is to be admired .
Much of the exposure of the US government�s hidden hand in the manipulation of the gold markets is due to GATA�s work .
What most still do not understand is the extent of that hidden hand and its effect on America , a nation many believe to be free .
The sewers of influence that course through America �s financial system are hidden from the public eye and for good reason .
If Americans understood the intent and motives of those who control the nation�s finances , they would realize they �re the patsies in an on - going suckers game with political parties the hired hacks who work on behalf of those who run the country ; but , of course , Americans don�t understand and the game goes on .
Voting : A sucker�s bet in a fixed game On GATA�s Board of Directors is Catherine Austin - Fitts , a person not known to many .
She should be .
From 1978 to 1989 , she was at Dillon Read , a powerful and prestigious New York investment bank ( later merged with S.G. Warburg and then UBS ) where she was both Managing Director and a Member of its Board of Directors .
It was at Dillon Read where Catherine Austin - Fitts witnessed America �s heavily denied transformation , a transformation where America �s elites and Wall Street conspired with the Clinton Administration to turn Nixon�s � War on Drugs� into profit - driven genocide .
� I decided to write � Dillon Read & Co Inc. and the Aristocracy of Stock Profits � as a case study designed to help illuminate the deeper system �
Dillon Read�and the Clinton Administration with the full support of a bipartisan Congress ..[ colluded to profit ] by ensnaring our youth in a pincer movement of drugs and prisons and wins middle class support for these policies through a steady and growing stream of government funding and contracts for War on Drugs activities at federal , state and local levels �
This is genocide � a much more subtle and lethal version than ever before perpetrated by the scoundrels of our history texts .
Catherine Austin- Fitts , US Assistant Secretary of Housing ( HUD ) Bush Administration 1989 - 1990 , Managing Director and Member Board of Directors , Dillon Read , 1986 - 1989 Because of Wall Street�s participation in America �s War on Drugs , large amounts of money were involved ; and to start the money flowing , more Americans would have to go jail and they did .
It �s no coincidence that the US is now the world�s number one jailor with the highest percentage of its citizens behind bars .
Under President William Jefferson
No , I did not inhale Clinton , America �s prison population began to significantly rise , surpassing the numbers arrested under President Ronald Reagan .
Thus began the diaspora of America �s underclass , especially black Americans into increasingly private prison cells in larger and larger numbers .

America �s genocide as told by Wall Street and Washington insider and GATA board member , Catherine Austin - Fitts , involves the US government , banks , powerful elites , both political parties and the Rothschilds .

GATA , MARTIN ARMSTRONG AND FREE MARKETS GATA was incorporated by Bill Murphy in January 1999 to advocate and undertake litigation against illegal collusion to control the price and supply of gold and related financial securities .
Exactly one year later in January 2000 , Bill Murphy was to become personally acquainted with Martin Armstrong of Princeton Economics .
At the time gold was $ 280 / oz , silver was $ 5.18 and GATA�s Bill Murphy was hearing rumors that Martin Armstrong was heavily involved in shorting gold .
Then , on January 5 , 2000 the following article , a revelatory bombshell , was posted on Kitco .

Whilst I have read a lot on this site about Armstrong and his supposed short gold position , etc. , etc. , etc. , I just thought everyone should know that it is all BS .
I have worked inside Republic Bank and quite frankly the whole thing stinks of a major set up intended to frame Armstrong big time .
Armstrong was right about the manipulation of silver and a whole lot more .
Not only was silver manipulated , they do it all the time .
If you want to know the truth , it was Republic who has been behind almost every manipulation I know of for at least the last 10 years , I 've seen it first hand .
Buffet is not lily white and this silver purchase of his was not the first .
The manipulation by Phibro in 1995 when they exercised the call options way out of the money was executed by Andy Heck who now works for Republic .
The CFTC went to Phibro demanding to know who the client was behind the trade and they refused to give up the name .
The CFTC did not do their job , as usual , and just walked away demanding that they exit the trade .
Phibro was owned by Salomon Bros and the authorization to squeeze silver was given personally by Buffet .
Does anyone really think that a small sub like Phibro could do a $ 1 billion trade without board approval from above ?
It does n't end there .
Bribes were paid to Russian officials to " recall " platinum so it could be inventoried .
Republic helped Tiger corner the market in palladium and stored it for them just like they moved the silver from NY to London for Buffet .
This thing even goes back to the manipulation of the US Treasury Auctions .
The govt boys are so stupid , when they threatened to take the license away from Salomon Bros , Buffet came to the rescue .
Ha !
He was behind that trade as well and his name was concealed then , as always .
Then that trader left and started LTCM and had a real merry old time .
Look at who his investors were !
Just before it blew up , Buffet agreed to bailout that operation and wrote a letter stating that if his offer were ever revealed , it would be void .
That letter was published in the WSJ because it blew up before Buffet could put the deal to bed .
The point is , Armstrong was trying to fight the crowd .
He knew what was going on and the word inside the bank was that he might even have tapes of conversations between a lot of the players .
Everyone is really worried about that for sure .
These guys take the market up get all you suckers believing the rally is real and then slam it again .
How do you think they make their billions ?
They do n't care about bull markets .
They shag the markets to make their billions off of the people who do n't have a clue .
They rotate between the markets .
All the same names were on the short - side in copper .
Sumitomo tried to fight these guys .
They baited the Japanese into the trades offering them untold credit .
They then would short copper against them .
Sumitomo tried to defend their position and ended up buying the entire inventory .
When they had Sumitomo loaded , they ran to the authorities and did them in calling it a manipulation .
They made a fortune on that short trade .
To add insult to injury , Sumitomo ran to Goldman Sachs for help , Goldman started selling thousands of contracts in copper that day and then accepted the work out the following day after front - running their own client .
Jimmy Goldsmith was involved in this one as well as Safra , Tiger and a host of others .
They amazingly are all on the right side of every one of these trades .
Hell - bribes were even paid to bank officials at the Central Bank of Thailand to start the Asian Crisis !
That was the evidence the Japanese took to the G7 meeting and demanded controls against the organized hedge funds .
The US govt refused to do anything against the group of players because this thing is so dirty nobody wants the truth out there .
They told the Japs they would agree to sanctions only .
That 's why Armstrong is being served up as the Xmas turkey .
Quite frankly , he knows too much .
Safra was paying bribes to people inside the IMF as well .
They all thought they had the IMF in their pocket .
That 's why they all invested so much into Russia .
They even set up Bank of New York on behalf of a rival group of thugs in Russia and because Republic hates Bank of New York because they are not part of the club .
These markets are never going to breakout until someone breaks up this organized mob of billionaires .
The govt is either too stupid or they are involved with them ==== a high probability !
After all , Armstrong had a $ 1 billion credit line in the bank and everyone knew it .
Suddenly , his credit line was pulled and Republic took $ 500 million of his clients money pretending it was never there .
That order came from good old Mr. Safra himself and was carried out by George Wendler personally .
And if anyone believes that story about Safra 's death , I guess they believe in Santa Claus and a few other sudden deaths when the heat got turned up .
If Armstrong or his clients got Safra on the stand , the whole thing could have unraveled .
His bodyguard was changed just after this affair started .
You fill in the blanks .
Armstrong was never short 700 tons of gold .
In fact , to get the silver manipulation going , Armstrong was out of the country and they ran their orders through Republic to make everyone think it was Armstrong covering short positions he never had .
The records are all there !
All this stuff is on tapes , docs and emails .
The question is , will the govt go along with the big boys and cover everything up again ?
[ They did ]
If so , they say already Armstrong wo n't make it to trial .
They cannot afford a open trial with everything Armstrong knows .
He probably knows far more than what has been written here .
They just can't afford for the world to know how rigged this game truly is and how these billionaires really make their money at the expense of everyone else .
That 's the real story .
Take it for what it 's worth .
End [ note :
The govt is either too stupid or they are involved with them ..
the answer may be some of both �some are too stupid and some are involved . ]
Subsequent events have shown the writer was probably correct that Martin Armstrong was being set up and that market manipulation occurs far more often than anyone knows .
Markets aren�t free .
They �re rigged .
Free markets are a myth .
In actuality , markets have been rigged as long as it has been possible to do so .
When investors have sufficient wealth and power , rigging markets is preferable to investing as the odds are far better when chance is replaced by manipulation ; and , the belief that market regulators , e.g. the SEC , the CFTC , the FDA , etc. are neutral and honest is as vain and na�ve as believing JFK was gunned down by a lone gunman or that Building 7 in the World Trade Center suddenly collapsed on 9/11 without any intervening exogenous force ; or that bankers Edmund Safra , Michele Sindona , and Roberto Calvi were not in trouble with the powers that be when they were murdered �Safra burned to death by his newly - hired bodyguard trapped in his fortress - like penthouse in Monaco , Sindona poisoned in prison after drinking coffee laced with cyanide and Calvi found hanging by his neck beneath Blackfriar�s Bridge in London , his pockets filled with bricks while out on bail .
EVEN EVIL RUNS OUT OF LUCK
The governments and bankers behind the manipulation of gold are running out of options .
Their supplies of physical gold are dwindling as demand is rising .
Their attempts to force down the price of gold has lasted almost 30 years but even evil runs out of luck .
Their attempts to re-liquefy the markets are backfiring as Gary Dorsch , editor of Global Money Trends , points out that when central banks now pump in new debt , it forces the price of gold higher :
The Fed has monetized trillions of dollars of new debt , through its QE scheme , and many investors have lost all faith in the value of paper money .
In fact , the ballooning size of the US Treasury�s debt , which hit a record $ 12.8 - trillion last month , has been a steady linchpin supporting the historic rally in the gold market over the past decade .
As a general rule of thumb , every $ 1 - trillion of fresh debt issued by the Treasury equates with a $ 125 / ounce increase in the price of gold .
As long as the Fed and G - 20 central banks continue to peg ultra- low interest rates , - and G - 20 governments continue to flood the debt markets with huge quantities of IOU�s , - it translates into monetization , and the trajectory for the gold market would stay bullish .

Gold has now again broken above the $ 1200 . mark .
The price of gold has quadrupled since GATA was incorporated in January 1999 .
It will even go higher as central bankers continue to fight in vain to maintain capitalism�s crumbling fiefdom of paper money .
John Exter�s inverse pyramid denoting the deflationary flight to safety has now reached government bonds , i.e. sovereign debt .
Gold is the ultimate destination of deflating wealth .

FREE MARKETS AND CAPITALISM
There is a controversy regarding capitalism that should be addressed .
Rather than defining capitalism in contradistinction to communism , i.e. free versus managed markets , it is more useful to define what capitalism actually is : Capitalism�s distinguishing feature is the nature of money used in capital markets
In his book , Capitalism ( Polity Press 2008 ) , Geoffrey Ingham writes :
It might seem unnecessary to draw attention to the fact that money is an essential component of the capitalist system �Capitalist societies �share certain fundamental features : ( i ) the private credit and the banking system �money multiplier� : ( ii ) state debt as the ultimate foundation of credit - money ; ( iii ) the pivotal role of the central bank : and , ( iv ) the three cornered struggle between state , money market and taxpayer .
Capitalist economies came into existence when the Bank of England was established in 1694 , a central bank which issued money in the form of debt , a monetary phenomena that had never before occurred in history .
In capitalist economies , money is debt .
The substitution of debt for savings as money led to the acceleration of Gresham �s Law where bad ( debt - based ) money drives out good ( savings - based ) .
This explains much about our present circumstances .
The issue of free versus managed markets came only after the appearance of communism .
The rise of communism shifted the focus away from capitalism�s shortcomings ( debt ) and advantages ( credit ) to communism�s egregious , obvious and brutal oppression , a phenomenon that occurs whenever and wherever power is centralized .
The greater the centralization of power the greater the opportunity for oppression
It should be understood , especially today , that capitalism is no more a protector against oppression than is democracy ( see Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville ) and , if capitalist / democratic societies , e.g. the US , the UK , the EU , etc , continue their present trajectory ; their end will be but another iteration of state tyranny .
� democratic societies which are not free may well be prosperous , cultured , pleasing to the eye , and even magnificent , such is the sense of power implicit in their massive uniformity ; in them may flourish many private virtues , good fathers , honest merchants , exemplary landowners , and good Christians too �
But , I make bold to say , never shall we find under such conditions a great citizen , still less than a great nation Democracy in America , Alexis de Toqueville , 1835 Today in America , under the guise of protecting the nation , long - standing constitutionally guaranteed freedoms are being dismissed and dismantled in the US at an accelerating pace .
The dispersion of power that the Founding Father embedded in the Constitution in 1776 has now been replaced by a highly centralized government .
In America , markets aren�t free and neither are Americans The US Patriot Act �Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act of 2001 �is the blueprint for the new America .
Written by legal hacks , foisted on the nation by the Republican Party in the darkly contrived shadow of 9/11 and extended by the Democrats , the right of the US government to intrude and override America �s civil liberties is now the law of the land .
MARTIN ARMSTRONG AND THE US GOVERNMENT
I am not sure what is going on .
I have been told that the receiver is now going to try a contempt charge for my not handing in my keys despite the fact that the locks and security codes have been changed �
It appears that a contempt - of - court can land you in jail for about one year .
After that , higher courts deem it to be cruel and unusual punishment .
Martin Armstrong
The above was excerpted from an email sent to GATA�s Chris Powell from Martin Armstrong in early January 2000 .
The court receiver who accused Mr. Armstrong of contempt was Alan Cohen , a lawyer at the powerful and prestigious firm , O�Melveny & Myers .
On January 14 , 2000 , Martin Armstrong was arrested based on Mr. Cohen�s allegations .
For the next seven years , Armstrong would be held without trial .
Appellate courts would dismiss Armstrong�s appeals that such an unprecedented incarceration on contempt charges constituted cruel and unusual punishment ; the courts instead found that cruel and unusual rulings apply only to persons , not to corporations or corporate officers such as Mr. Armstrong .
This is legal parsing at its most scurrilous , equal to those written by John Yoo , the Bush Administration lawyer who provided cover for America�s legalization of torture ; cover , that if extended , could exonerate those convicted at Nuremberg .
Such is the current state of American jurisprudence , a country based on the rule of law�or , so it proclaims .
If so , the question must then be asked : Whose rule ?
Whose law ?
And , most importantly , whose country ?
If you haven�t asked those questions , you don�t know the answers .
As would be expected , those who serve power , e.g. John Yoo , Alan Cohen , Bill Clinton et. al. , are well - rewarded in a country as wealthy and powerful as America .
Yoo is a professor at Boalt Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley , Cohen is Executive Vice President and Global Head of Compliance at Goldman Sachs and Clinton receives $ 5 - $ 8 million annually in speaking fees as a respected former US president .
Currently , Martin Armstrong is serving a five - year sentence at Fort Dix federal prison ; as his time served on contempt charges �seven years ( a record ) �was not credited against his sentence .
For Armstrong�s case and information on his incarceration , see http://princetoneconomics.blogspot.com/
Martin Armstrong�s
Pi Cycle Economic Confidence Model which predicted the exact top of the Japanese stock market is a noteworthy achievement in matters of economic theory .
While incarcerated Armstrong continues to write , even when in solitary confinement ; and when he�s not allowed access to a typewriter , he will use a pen , see http://armstrongeconomics.com/writings/.
Martin Armstrong in prison at Fort Dix Federal Penitentiary and Catherine Austin - Fitts , Bill Murphy and Chris Powell at GATA deserve our support in these consequential times .
John Yoo , Alan Cohen , Bill Clinton and the many others who serve power and wealth do not .
In America , real power is held by those who pay Yoo , Cohen , and Clinton to do their bidding ; coalescing power , control and wealth in a nation that still believes itself free �while those who are governed remain obli vio us and unconcerned as to their true state .
Sleep , America , sleep Dream , America , dream
For only in your sleep and dreams
Are you free and awake America , however , is about to wake up .
Its awakening will not be pleasant .
The pain has only just begun .
Buy gold , buy silver , have faith .

By now you have probably realized – correctly – that “ financial reform ” has turned into a victory lap for Wall Street .
When they saved the big banks , with massive unconditional support ( both explicit and implicit ) over a year ago , top administration officials promised they would be back later to fix the underlying problems .
This they – and Congress – manifestly have failed to do .
Our banking structure remains unchanged , the rules will be tweaked at the margins , and the incentive and belief system that lies behind reckless risk - taking has only become more dangerous .
( The back story , if you can still stomach it , is in 13 Bankers ) .
There is only one small chance for any sensible progress remaining – and you are about to see this crushed in conference by the supporters of unfettered big banks .
Senator Blanche Lincoln ’s proposal with regard to derivatives has much to commend it .
A fiduciary duty for swaps dealers vis -à - vis customers would be entirely appropriate – in fact long overdue .
Real time price reporting should also help regulators at least begin to understand what is driving market dynamics , for example around the May 6 “ flash crash ” – a point that Senator Ted Kaufman has also been making most forcefully .
Legal authority against market manipulation would be greatly strengthened and there would be more protection for whistleblowers .
And the kind of transaction that Goldman entered into with Greece – a swap transaction with the goal of reducing measured debt levels , effectively deceiving current and future investors , would become more clearly illegal .
All of this is entirely reasonable and responsible – and completely opposed by the most powerful people on Wall Street .
Of course , most of the anti-Lincoln fire has been directed against the idea that “ swaps desks ” would be “ pushed out ” to subsidiaries – i.e. , the big broker - dealers could still engage in these transactions , but they would need to hold a great deal more capital against their exposures , thus making the activities significantly less profitable .
It is striking that while Treasury argues that increasing capital is the way to go with regard to financial reform , they are adamantly opposed to what would amount to more reasonable capital levels at the heart of the derivatives business .
This is beyond disappointing .
No doubt the administration feels good about what it has “ achieved ” on financial reform .
The public aura of mutual congratulation will last for about three weeks .
But outside of the inner White House - Capitol Hill bubble , it is very hard to find anyone well - informed about the financial system who thinks that anything substantial has changed or that risks will be better managed as we head into the next cycle .
“ Business as usual ” is the abiding legacy of the Obama administration with regard to the systemic risks posed by this financial system .
Treasury and White House let us down repeatedly and completely in the last 18 months on financial sector issues – just as they did ( as decision - making bodies and as some of the same individuals ) at the end of the 1990s .
At one point in early 1998 , Larry Summers called Brooksley Born – the last person who really tried to rein in the dangers posed by derivatives ( and it was a much lower level of danger then compared with now ) .
Summers reportedly said , “ I have thirteen bankers in my office , and they say if you go forward with this you will cause the worst financial crisis since World War II . ”
We now seem to have come full circle to exactly the same people saying exactly the same things – no doubt top people in the administration are now calling Senator Lincoln and impressing upon her a version of the same point made by Summers to Born .
The 13 bankers have won , completely .
Here we go again .
Analyzing the political design of our lawmakers
" QUANTUM SHOT " # 628 Link - article by M. Christian and A. Abrams
A city full of midgets , a tour of Hell , and the Incubator Babies
We always seem to short - change the past .
The pyramids ?
Must have been aliens : those Egyptians could n't have been smart enough to build them .
The Eiffel Tower ?
Sure it 's impressive but it probably should have fallen down decades ago : after all , Gustave Eiffel did n't have computers and modern witchy mixtures of alloys and composites .
Bur our smug superiority is misplaced , our 21st century dismissal of everything created before the integrated circuit and plastic insultingly arrogant .
The fact of the matter is that the past was more than grand , more than amazing , more than impressive .
( images via )
Take , for example , Coney Island , or , as it was called , The City of Fire , around the turn of the previous century .
Originally just a tiny , sandy dot of land full of itchy scrub and wild rabbits -- or " Conies " which is where the place got its name -- the island became first a waypoint and then a tawdry vacation spot for the weary citizens of the Big Apple .
But soon Coney began to change , to become a phantasmagorical place : a world of wonders , dreams , and -- tragically as well as mystically -- a City of Fire .
( image via - click here to enlarge )
The Elephant Brothel , Mechanical Ponies and a Clown with a Cattle Prod
Take , for instance , Coney Island 's elephant .
Created in 1885 by James V. Lafferty -- who also created Atlantic City 's famous pachyderm , which still stands today -- it was one of Coney 's first amazements .
The elephant was n't just a statue , some cheap tourist novelty .
It was an actual , functional , five - storey hotel and , to give you an idea of what kind of world early Coney Island was , a brothel .
( images via 1 , 2 )
But the elephant , while grand at the time and would have remained grand today like her sister in Atlantic City , was only a tusked taste of what was to come .
In 1897 , George C. Tilyou created one of the island 's lost yet enduring parks : Steeplechase Park .
It 's hard to imagine what it must have been like to be a visitor to Steeplechase in those early days .
No one had ever seen anything like it : wild and raucous , rude and amazing , Steeplechase was a playground of laughter and thrills .
The main attraction were the mechanical ponies .
Racing at almost dangerous speeds on a up - and - down and round - and - round iron track , the horses were thrilling , terrifying and , as someone perfectly put it :
Gave the boys a chance to hug girls , and girls a chance to be hugged by boys .
( images via 1 , 2 )
But the fun at Steeplechase did n't end with the ponies .
Exiting riders , under the frighteningly cheery face of Tillie , the park 's mascot , were assaulted by a clown and a dwarf .
The clown would hit the boys with a cattle prod and try to blow the women 's skirts up over their heads with a blast of compressed air .
The giggling and shrieking boys and girls would then be allowed to sit on bleachers to watch other fun-seekers go through the same treatment .
( image via )
The Human Roulette Wheel , the Barrel of Love , the Cave of Winds ...
In what would be a common theme for the island , Steeplechase burned in 1907 but was rebuilt on a scale that 's hard to comprehend for us 21st century folks .
In addition to the restored mechanical horses , Tilyou also added an immense steel and glass " Pavilion of Fun " with dozens of other rude rides including the Human Roulette Wheel , the Barrel of Love , the Cave of Winds , and many contraptions guaranteed to make men and women alike shriek and wail with laughter .
Steeplechase was amazing , to be sure .
But it was mostly a broad and guttural place , acres and acres of architectural joy buzzers and whoopee cushions .
( image via )
Then there was Luna Park , and with it Coney Island became a land of dreams .
Built by Frederic Thompson and Elmer " Skip " Dundy , Luna was a hallucination , a disorienting vision of twisting minarets , undulating arches , and – at night – the brilliant spectacle of hundreds of thousands of then - novel electric lights .
At Luna Park visitors were treated to rides – such as the famous soaking Shoot - the - Chutes , and the legendary animals , including the park 's own herd of elephants – but , more importantly , they could walk the sprawling promenades of Luna Park and feel like they'd been whisked away from their ordinary lives in 1903 to a world of rapturous imagination : a world of fantasy made real .
Albeit in lath and plaster .
( click to enlarge - image via )
The spectacle of Luna Park's , well , ' spectacles ' is staggering , even today : mock naval battles , including an attack on Manhattan by the combined navies of Germany , France Spain and even Great Britain , only to be beaten back by Admiral Dewey 's fleet ; a trip to the moon that included mischievous ' moon men ' ; a trip to the north pole by submarine ; and too many more for this small space .
( image via - click to enlarge )
( image via - click to enlarge )
Luna also featured the world of the time , which for most people touring the park might as well have been the north pole or the moon : entire villages , such as Samoan's , were uprooted and placed in the park for the education – and amusement – of the visitors .
Before Disneyland , before Las Vegas - there was Dreamland ...
Luna Park is a legend , and with it , unprecedented spectacle came to Coney Island .
But then came Dreamland .
( image via )
Built in 1904 by the very crooked William H. Reynolds , Dreamland was to be the crowning glory of the island , a factor - of - ten grander park than either Steeplechase and Luna .
It 's hard to picture imagine the scale and majesty that Reynolds made with Dreamland , the outrageousness as well as the beauty that he created on the island .
While Luna had a reported quarter of a million electric lights , Dreamland claimed to have more than one million : all of these lights giving the island its nickname of The City Of Fire .
( images via )
See the detailed panorama of Dreamland on this page - click here .
( image via )
Dreamland was an entire dazzling world , a complete universe of dazzling spectacle .
Every hour on the hour 2,000 firemen would put on a performance of extinguishing a roaring blaze in a six - storey building .
An entire town was built – half scale of course – for the park 's resident 350 midgets .
A 375 - foot - high central tower lit up so bright it was often seen from Manhattan .
There were also performances of the Biblical view of creation as well as a tour of Hell .
And let 's not forget the incubator babies .
Yep , that 's right : one of the most famous exhibitions of Dreamland were the baby incubators , compliments of the brilliant Dr. Martin Arthur Couney .
Unable to get hospitals to take his inventions seriously , Dr. Couney worked with Reynolds and – through some showmanship – finally got the world to take notice of his technique to save the lives of premature babies .
( image via - click to enlarge )
Unfortunately , as with that original elephant , Steeplechase , and many other Coney Island amazements , the City of Fire lived up to its name and Dreamland burned to the ground in a hellish blaze that , too ironically , began in the Hell Gate exhibition in 1911 .
Fortunately there were only a few tragedies , including a lion that had escaped from the fire and had to be shot by police .
Unfortunately , the park never recovered and Dreamland became only a memory , the ghost of a dream for those lucky enough to have seen it before it became soggy ashes .
Even more sadly , Luna and Steeplechase 's appeal and popularity slipped away in the decades afterward until they collapsed into tawdry ruins , their majesty becoming tainted by the desperation and failures of their autumn years .
These days we have our Disneylands and dozens of other parks around the world and feel like we 've managed something amazing – but then you look at the pictures of Coney Island in its heyday and realize that what we consider amazing now is actually small and cheap and easy .
For truly wondrous playlands and amazing spectacles , you have to go back at least a hundred years , to Coney Island , to that legendary City of Fire .
Here is a great short comedy video with a glimpse of some of the Luna Park attractions .

President Barack Obama has asked Congress to approve 205 million dollars to help Israel deploy an anti-missile defense system , the White House said Thursday .
“ The president recognizes the threat missiles and rockets fired by Hamas and Hezbollah pose to Israelis , and has therefore decided to seek funding from Congress to support the production of Israel ’s short range rocket defense system called Iron Dome , ” White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said .

Israel completed tests in January on its Iron Dome anti-missile system , designed to intercept short - range rockets and artillery shells fired at Israel by Hamas and Hezbollah .
The next phase in its development is to integrate it into the army .
Israel hopes the system will provide it with a means to deal with rocket fire from the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip and from Lebanon .
Palestinian militants have fired thousands of home - made rockets into southern Israel , prompting Israel ’s devastating assault on the Islamist Hamas in Gaza on December 27 , 2008 .
The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah also fired some 4,000 rockets into northern Israel during a 2006 war with Israel , which now believes Hezbollah has an arsenal of some 40,000 rockets .
“ As the president has repeatedly said , our commitment to Israel ’s security is unshakable and our defense relationship is stronger than ever , ” said Vietor .
“ The United States and our ally Israel share many of the same security challenges , from combating terrorism to confronting the threat posed by Iran ’s nuclear - weapons program . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The move comes after ties between Israel and its key ally the US were strained by an announcement of new Israeli settler homes in east Jerusalem made during a visit to the Jewish state by Vice President Joe Biden .
Israel ’s President Shimon Peres also sparked controversy in April when he accused Syria of supplying the Shiite Hezbollah movement with long - range Scud missiles , a charge Damascus has staunchly denied .
Washington , which has sought rapprochement with Damascus , further fed the controversy when Defense Secretary Robert Gates accused Iran and Syria of arming Hezbollah with sophisticated weaponry , without naming Scuds .

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also warned Syrian President Bashar al - Assad about the risks of triggering a regional war if he supplied the Shiite group with the missiles .
Fragile indirect talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority of president Mahmud Abbas opened Sunday with US envoy George Mitchell shuttling between the two sides in Jerusalem and Ramallah .
Mozilla , Opera ( and Google ) are n't the only ones supporting the open - sourced VP8 video codec in their browsers .
Microsoft is going to do the same , as well , according to my tipsters .
Update :
It seems like the tipsters were on the money .
See below for Microsoft 's latest codec - support statement .
( I do n't know exactly when or how Microsoft is going to support VP8 with Internet Explorer .
But given IE 9 is unlikely to ship until 2011 , according to various sources of mine , the Redmondians have some time to figure it out . )
At the Google I/O conference on May 19 , Mozilla and Opera announced with much fanfare their plans to support VP8 codec , which Google acquired when it bought On2 Technology .
At the I/O confab , Google unveiled the WebM container , which includes VP8 video and Ogg Vorbis audio support .
( Google officials said WebM will work well on even lower - power devices , including netbooks and handhelds , according to Engadget . )
WebM is going to be available under a royalty - free BSD open - source license .
At the end of April , Microsoft IE General Manager Dean Hachamovitch created a bit of controversy when he blogged that IE 9 would support the H.264 codec only .
In an update to his comments , Hachamovitch said IE 9 users will , of course , be free to download and install other codecs .
But the implication was that IE 9 would include built - in support for H.264 only .
( A related aside : My ZDNet colleague Ed Bott did a must - read post that rebutted the notion that H.264 codecs might end up a costly proposition for consumers , as opposed to the open - sourced VP8 . )
I 've asked Microsoft whether the company is , indeed , going to add VP8 support to IE9 , but have yet to hear back .
This just in : Microsoft is confirming it will support VP8 via a just - published blog post from Hachamovitch .
The bottom line :
" When it comes to video and HTML5 , we ’re all in .
In its HTML5 support , IE9 will support playback of H.264 video as well as VP8 video when the user has installed a VP8 codec on Windows . "
Hachamovitch does note in the May 18 post that Microsoft still considers H.264 to be the superior video codec choice .
From his post :
" Today , hardware support is widely available for H.264 both on PCs and phones .
( You can read about the benefits of hardware acceleration here , or see an example of the benefits at the 26:35 mark here . )
Codecs have been a source of security and reliability issues ( link1 , link2 , link3 , link4 ) for some users .
New code often faces security issues ; the H.264 codec in Windows 7 has been in broad use for some time now .
Sites also need to think about the issues in supporting multiple formats . "
I 've also asked the Silverlight team what its plans are , going forward , in terms of VP8 support .
At the Google I/ O conference today , Adobe officials said they are going to put the VP8 code into the Flash player and push it out to " a billion users within a year " ( as News.com 's Stephen Shankland tweeted ) .
No word back yet from the Silverlight spokesperson .
I 'll update this post with any Microsoft comments I get .
More just in : I did n't get a direct response to my question , but here 's Microsoft 's statement regarding VP8 and Silverlight :
" Silverlight today supports H.264 , VC1 and other audio - related codecs , Also , the Raw AV pipeline makes it easy to support a variety codecs . "
Meanwhile , I wonder how / if Apple is going to support VP8 on the iPad ...
Any guesses ?
Image caption Scientists used Hubble data to create an image of the planet being swallowed
The Hubble Space Telescope has captured evidence of a Sun - like star " eating " a nearby planet .
Astronomers knew that stars were capable of swallowing planets in orbit around them , but this is the first time the event has been " seen " so clearly .
Although the planet was too far away for Hubble to photograph , scientists have created an image of it , based on analysis of the telescope 's data .
The discovery was published in the The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
We have identified chemical elements never before seen on planets outside our own Solar System Carole Haswell , Open University
The researchers say the planet , which is called Wasp - 12 b , may only have another 10 million years left before it is completely devoured .
It is so close to its star that it completes an orbit in 1.1 Earth days and is superheated to more than 1,500C .
Because of this proximity , the planet 's atmosphere has ballooned to nearly three times the radius of Jupiter and is spilling material on to the star .
Carole Haswell from the UK's Open University led the research team .
She explained : " We see a huge cloud of material around the planet which is escaping and will be captured by the star . "
Hubble 's detection of the cloud enabled scientists to draw conclusions about how it was generated .
Dr Haswell said : " We have identified chemical elements never before seen on planets outside our own Solar System . "
Wasp - 12 is a dwarf star located approximately 600 light - years away in the constellation Auriga .
The exoplanet was first discovered by the UK's Wide Area Search for Planets ( Wasp ) in 2008 .
TEL AVIV — The Obama administration ’s problems with Israel go beyond the construction of another few hundred housing units in East Jerusalem .
More ominously , the ruling coalition in Israel reflects a reshaping of Israeli society that has fortified right - wing designs on the West Bank and strengthened resistance to a peace agreement .
To be sure , this is not the first time Israel is dealing with a right - religious - settler - Russian coalition pushing a reactionary agenda .
The difference is that this political alignment could be dominant in Israel for some time to come .
The political left has virtually disappeared , discredited by failed peace gambits .
At the same time , the conservative , ultra - orthodox sector is growing rapidly in numbers .
So is the Israeli Arab population , which , in the shadow of a failed peace process , is becoming increasingly hostile to the idea of being a minority in a Jewish state — thereby stiffening the reaction of the Jewish majority .
Moreover , the stakes are higher than in the past .
The Israeli right perceives an international onslaught against its bastions in East Jerusalem and the West Bank .
It has resolved never to permit a repeat of the withdrawal from Gaza .
Hence it is attacking its critics and beefing up its grip on the instruments of power .
And this reaction further amplifies Israel ’s international isolation , creating a vicious circle .
Mr Heiss said : " He lost the knife when it fell to the floor .
He tried to crawl towards it but I tried to prevent it by sitting on him .
After a few seconds I got hold of it .
I was almost sure that if I had lost the knife it would have been my end .

You just read it for the articles , huh ?
Well , now 's your chance to prove it .
Playboy has announced plans to roll out a work - friendly website , targeting office workers who browse the internet from their desks but do n't want to get caught reading the iconic men's magazine .
" Playboy ’s TheSmokingJacket.com is the safe - for - work website that brings you everything you love about men's entertainment and the internet , minus the stuff that 'll get you into hot water at the office , " Playboy spokeswoman Theresa Hennessey said in a written statement .
The site is up but not active and will be launched " in the coming months , " Hennessey said .
The announcement comes as Playboy seeks to reposition itself in an adult - entertainment landscape drastically altered by the internet .
In short , if you 're looking for pictures of naked women , there are plenty of other sites to find that ( and more ) for free .
Playboy Enterprises reported a net loss of $ 1 million in the first quarter of this year - actually better than what was predicted .
The company reported a loss of $ 13.7 million during the same quarter last year .
" We believe that 2010 will be a transitional year and that the true benefits of our strategy will be more fully evident next year , " Playboy CEO Scott Flanders said in a statement last month .
Presumably , The Smoking Jacket - a nod to founder Hugh Hefner 's preferred brand of leisure wear - would be part of that transition .
After its monthly photo spreads of playmates , Playboy magazine is also known for celebrity interviews , short fiction by big - name authors , rankings of the nation 's top party schools and other content .
But as tech blog Switched notes , " ... if The Smoking Jacket will not feature buxom beauties au naturel , what exactly will drive traffic to the site ? "

OK , that is a strong opinion but I can say that I honestly believe that while the Champions League final will be a great match ( going to pick Bayern Munich to win ) , and while I always think Real Salt Lake matches are huge .
There is only one match that could mean the difference between financial ruin and playing at the highest level in the world .
It will take place on a grand stage of Wembley , as Blackpool and Cardiff City face off in the Championship playoff to see which team will take their place next year in the premiership .
How important is this match ?
Well here is just one aspect of the importance :
" In financial terms , this match offers the winning club the most substantial prize in world football and the value is now even greater as a result of the Premier League 's increased revenues from international broadcast rights and the proposals to extend parachute payments over four seasons .
It is a prize which provides the opportunity for sound investment and strengthening the foundations of a club for years to come . "
from Paul Rawnsley , director of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte via sports - city.org
But there is so much more at stake for these two teams , Blackpool have n't played in the premiership since 1971 , and for Cardiff City it has been even longer , 10 years longer in fact as the Bluebirds last played at England 's top level in 1961 .
It is n't the first time that Cardiff City have played in a huge match at Wembley , just two years ago they found themselves battling for the FA Cup title against Portsmouth ( details here and here ) and the heartbreaking 1 - 0 loss still pains their fans to this day .
More on this important match after the jump :
I can't claim to be an expert on either team , but I have to say I love the system of relegation and promotion , and while I do n't believe it will ever take hold in the US , it is one of the best stories in world football .
For every team that goes down , there are teams that come up .
This year the three sides leaving the EPL are Burnley , Hull City , and Portsmouth , and the top two teams in the Championship ( the level below the EPL ) are promoted ( this year it is Newcastle United , and West Brom ) .
It is how the final promotion slot is filled that I love , they take teams 3 - 6 and have them face off in a home and home to determine the final two who will fight it out on neutral turf to see who will claim the spot .
So there are a number of things you can read online that will help you understand this matchup more :

The match preview from the BBC
I can offer up just these couple things , to know that a team is just days away from tax bills that could cause the club to be put into administration , to know that 6 million pounds could buy you 49 % of the club just weeks ago , knowing that Cardiff City could be playing host to the top teams in their new stadium which opened this year , and having a friend / co - worker who is as passionate about his Bluebirds as I am about Real Salt Lake .
Makes me a Cardiff fan , to not be one would be too hard in a match like this .
Here are his words about the match :
This truly is the biggest game of my supporting life and the biggest of Cardiff City 's for over 50 years .
I have been supporting the Bluebirds for 20 years and have been to over 75 league grounds following them around the country .
I have seen us relegated in front of a few thousand fans , lose at faraway places such as Carlisle and bore draws at Port Vale , so to go to Wembley and be 90 minutes away from the biggest and most lucrative league in the world is incredible .
My whole family will be going to the game ( Mum , Dad and Brother ) and it is going to be an amazing experience , but very nerve wrecking as so much hinges on this game .
After we beat Leicester in the semi's I was sat on my sofa ( I could not go to the game , as I was recovering from an operation ) blubbing my eyes out like a baby ... why and how does this affect me so much ?
It is because football and Cardiff city is a huge part of my life and my family , it is going to games for years with my Dad and brother and feeling the energy of the faithful fans cheering the team to victory .
Sleeping tonight is going to be hard ... On Sunday morning , we will wall wake up knowing we will be playing either Leeds United , Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace OR Man U , Liverpool and Tottenham - THAT IS HUGE !!!
Good luck to all Bluebirds and let 's hope ( no lets pray ) that this result goes our way , because I cannot actually contemplate defeat ... it can not happen .
" I 'll be there , with my little pick and shovel , I 'll be there ... "
He sent along a link to this video , which was made in the days leading up to the 2008 FA Cup and of course after watching it I knew I would be cheering for Cardiff on Saturday :
These two teams faced each other twice this year in league action , and each ended in a 1 - 1 draw .
There will be no draw at Wembley and one of these teams will be playing on TV 's around the world next year .
I do n't think there could be any better drama written , as a season of football can bring .

Whether the new M.I.A. Born Free Music Video is a social commentary on humanity ’s natural tendencies for violence and segregation .. or simply another stab at gingers , the video definitely demonstrates M.I.A. ’s much darker side .
Directed by French Romain Gavras , produced by a company called elnino.tv and just released 10 hours ago , I am sure that by the end of the day everyone will have their own opinion of it .
While I did not enjoy the low quality mp3 of Born Free that has been circulating on the music blogosphere in the last couple of days …
I completely love the video for its realism and intensity , although not even sure what it all really means .
I do not want to say the video is “ controversially pushy ” but its definitely not what we are used to seeing from M.I.A .

Hamas police beat and forcibly removed residents from their homes in a southern Gaza city , and the buildings were then demolished by bulldozers .
The Associated Press reports that the Hamas police wielded clubs and pushed the residents out of dozens of homes in Rafah , on the Egyptian border .
The incident occurred on Sunday , and destruction was expected to continue on Monday .
Hamas authorities said the homes were built illegally on government land .
Newly homeless residents were reportedly furious over Arabs on bulldozers razing Arab homes .
" For years , " AP 's Rizek Abdel Jawad reports , " Palestinians have criticized Israel for destroying houses , mostly because they were built without permits issued by the military .
Now , Rafah residents complained , their own government , run by the Islamic militant Hamas that seized power in Gaza in July 2007 , has done the same . "

Fixstars , who we usually cover here for reasons of news related to Yellow Dog Linux , announced today that they ’ve released an electronic OpenCL programming book called , oddly enough , the OpenCL Programming Book
The book is a result of the collaboration of our team of engineers in providing a practical and easy to use tool for OpenCL programming .
It starts with the basics of parallelization , covering the main concepts , techniques , and setting up a development environment for OpenCL .
It concludes with a clear and useful example of the FFT and Mersenne Twister algorithms written in OpenCL , walking you through the programming process and providing you with the source - code .
It is the perfect resource for those wishing to get started on programming in OpenCL .
“ Fixstars is a skilled OpenCL practitioner and is ideally qualified to create state - of - the - art OpenCL educational materials , ” said Neil Trevett , the president of Khronos Group .
“ I wholeheartedly recommend to this book to anyone looking to understand and start using the amazing power of OpenCL . ”
The book is available from Fixstars right now for 19.50 , and the company says that it expects to have it in Amazon ’s Kindle Store and Apple ’s iBooks Store soon .
This may be the first book devoted exclusively to OpenCL programming : a quick search for “ opencl ” at Amazon returns 22 entries , none of which appear to focus exclusively on that topic .
Enlarge by Adrian Wyld , AP Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks after his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Parliament Hill in Ottawa , Canada , Monday May 31 , 2010 .
( AP Photo / The Canadian Press , Adrian Wyld ) JERUSALEM  Israeli commandos rappelled down to an aid flotilla sailing to thwart a Gaza blockade on Monday , clashing with pro-Palestinian activists on the lead ship in a botched raid that left at least nine passengers dead .
Bloodied passengers sprawled on the deck and troops dived into the sea to save themselves during several hours of hand - to - hand fighting that injured dozens of activists and six soldiers .
Hundreds of activists -- many of whom were apparently Turkish -- were towed from the international waters to Israeli detention centers and hospitals .
International condemnation was swift and harsh as Israel scrambled to explain how what was meant to be a simple takeover of a civilian vessel went so badly awry .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly canceled a planned meeting with President Barack Obama in Washington to rush home .
The global reaction appeared likely to increase pressure to end the embargo that has plunged Gaza 's 1.5 million residents deeper into poverty .
Most of the information about what happened on the single ship where violence broke out came from Israel , which cut off all communication to and from the activists and provided testimony and video evidence that its soldiers came under attack by activists armed with metal rods , knives , slingshots and two pistols snatched from the troops .
Passengers reached at an Israeli hospital and journalists aboard the ship accused the soldiers of using excessive force .
One passenger , who identified himself as American , spoke briefly with reporters .
" I 'm not violent .
What I can tell you is that there are bruises all over my body .
They wo n't let me show them to you , " he said before he was pushed away by a security escort .
A soldier identified only as a sergeant told reporters at a military briefing that the activists on board " were armed with knives , scissors , pepper spray and guns . "
He said he was armed only with a paintball rifle .
" It was a civilian paintball gun that any 12 - year - old can play with , " he said .
" I saw my friends on the deck spitting blood . "
The high - seas confrontation was a nightmare scenario for Israel , which insisted its soldiers were simply unprepared for what awaited them on the Mavi Marmara , the ship carrying 600 of the 700 activists headed for Gaza .
Instead of carrying their regular automatic rifles , the Israelis said they went in with non-lethal paintball guns and pistols they never expected to use .
Israel intercepted the six ships carrying some 10,000 tons of aid for the isolated seaside territory , which has been blockaded by Israel for three years , with Egypt 's cooperation .
The Israeli government had urged the flotilla not to try to breach the blockade before the ships set sail from waters off Cyprus on Sunday and offered to take some aid in for them .
Israel has allowed ships through five times , but has blocked them from entering Gaza waters since a three - week military offensive against Gaza 's Hamas rulers in January 2009 .
Key regional ally Turkey withdrew its ambassador on Monday , the U.N. Security Council held an emergency session , the British foreign secretary demanded an end to the blockade of Gaza , and Jordan called Israel 's raid a " heinous crime . "
An al - Jazeera journalist delivering a report before Israel cut communications said Israel fired at the vessel before boarding it .
In one web posting , a Turkish television reporter on the boat cried out , " These savages are killing people here , please help " -- a broadcast that ended with a voice shouting in Hebrew , " Everybody shut up ! "
Al - Jazeera said that eight staff members were detained while covering the story , and asked for the Israeli government to release them immediately .
The military said naval commandos descending from a helicopter onto the deck of a Turkish - flagged ship were assaulted by armed activists .
Military footage showed activists swarming around the commandos as they rappelled from a helicopter one by one , hitting them with sticks until they fell to the deck , throwing one off the ship and hurling what the military said was a firebomb .
Speaking alongside the Canadian prime minister , Netanyahu expressed " regret " for the loss of life but said the soldiers " had to defend themselves , defend their lives , or they would have been killed . "
Activists said Israeli naval commandos stormed the ships after ordering them to stop in international waters , about 80 miles ( 130 kilometers ) from Gaza 's coast .
A spokeswoman for the Free Gaza movement , which organized the flotilla , said the group 's goal -- beyond just bringing supplies to the impoverished territory -- was to shatter the blockade .
" What we 're trying to do is open a sea lane between Gaza and the rest of the world , " Greta Berlin said in Cyprus .
" We 're not trying to be a humanitarian mission .
We 're trying to say to the world , ' You have no right to imprison a million and a half Palestinians . ' "
Israel 's international image had already taken a beating from allegations that it committed war crimes during its 2008 - 2009 winter war in Gaza , and from widespread global opposition to the blockade .
Hamas was also accused of rights violations in that conflict .
Relations with Turkey , a key supporter of the aid flotilla but also until recently Israel 's staunchest ally in the Muslim world , were badly damaged by Monday 's events , possibly irreparably .
Ankara announced it would recall its ambassador and call off all military exercises with Israel .
Around 10,000
Turks marched in protest .
At the U.N. , Turkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the raid " murder conducted by a state " and demanded an immediate Israeli apology , international legal action and an end to the blockade .
The bloody showdown came at a sensitive time for Israeli - Palestinian peacemaking .
Netanyahu had hoped to receive a high - profile expression of support from Obama after months of strained relations over Israeli settlement construction .
Obama voiced " deep regret , " over the raids , and the White House said he and Netanyahu agreed by phone to reschedule White House talks .
The U.S. recently began mediating indirect peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians following a 17 - month breakdown in contacts .
Israel 's immediate concern on Monday was what to do about the boats and their passengers .
It ferried the wounded to hospitals by helicopter and towed the six ships to port , giving each of the activists a choice of deportation or detention .
By late Monday , about 150 of the activists -- most from Turkey -- had been taken off the boats , Israeli Interior Ministry spokeswoman Sabine Haddad said , adding the process would continue into Tuesday .
She said about 30 had agreed to be deported , and the rest would be detained .
A commando who spoke to reporters on a naval vessel off the coast , identified only as " A , " said he and his comrades were taken off guard by a group of Arabic - speaking men when they rappelled onto the deck .
He said some of the soldiers were stripped of their helmets and their pistols and some had jumped overboard to escape the violence .
A high - ranking naval official displayed a box confiscated from the boat containing switchblades , slingshots , metal balls and metal bats .
Turkey 's NTV network showed activists beating one commando with sticks as he landed on deck .
Dr. Arnon Afek , deputy director of Chaim Sheba Medical Center outside Tel Aviv , said two commandos were brought in with gunshot wounds .
Another had serious head wounds , Afek added .
At Barzilai hospital in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon , a few activists trickled in under military escort , claiming they had been beaten during the assault .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli " massacre " and declared three days of mourning across the West Bank .
Ismail Haniyeh , leader of the rival Hamas government in Gaza , condemned the " brutal " Israeli attack and called on U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to intervene .
Ban condemned the violence .
" I am shocked by reports of killings , " he said .
" It is vital that there is a full investigation to determine exactly how this bloodshed took place . "
After nightfall , Hamas - linked militants fired a rocket that exploded in Israel , the militants and the Israeli military said .
Nobody was hurt .
The militants said the rocket attack was in response to Israel 's raid on the flotilla .

Poke a snail with a stick and it remembers for a day .
Poke a snail with a stick after you 've given it methamphetamine and it remembers for much longer .
Getting gastropods hooked on meth perhaps sounds cruel , but Barbara Sorg and her team are among those scientists trying to figure out how the drug works in the brain to produce intense connections that feed the addiction cycle .
In a study forthcoming in the Journal of Experimental Biology , the scientists show that , in snails at least , meth makes it hard to forget things that happened while on the drug .
Here 's the test :
The snails Sorg studied can breathe two ways , through their skin underwater and also through a breathing tube they can deploy when they surface .
The team kept two groups of snails — one on meth , one not — in separate tanks of shallow water .
And if the snails tried to surface and breathe that way , the scientists would poke them .
By poking the snails , Sorg 's team trained them to associate using the tubes with an unpleasant experience , and so keep them shut .
Only the snails on speed remembered their training the following morning , and in a separate experiment it took longer for them to " unlearn " the memory [ New Scientist ] .
The drug induces changes in the brain that last after the chemical is out of a snail 's system .
" These drugs of abuse produce very persistent memories , " explained Dr Sorg .
" It 's a learning process - drug addiction is learning unwittingly .
All of these visual , environmental and odour cues are being paired with the drug " [ BBC News ] .
Pinning down just what physical changes in the brain allow for that effect is the key to the ultimate end of this kind of research : Targeting the intense memory
associations that feed addiction as a part of drug treatment .
And the research on learning and forgetting could have wider implications as well , says George Kemenes of the University of Sussex , who also does mollusk research :
" Ultimately , the humble snail could help prevent and treat memory disorders or even enhance normal memory " [ BBC News ] .

Full Moonnames date back to Native Americans , of what is now the northern and easternUnited States .
Those tribes of a few hundred years ago kept track of theseasons by giving distinctive names to each recurring full moon .
Their nameswere applied to the entire month in which each occurred .
There weresome variations in the moon names , but in general the same ones were currentthroughout the Algonquin tribes from New England on west to Lake Superior .
European settlers followed their own customs and created some of their ownnames .
Since the lunar ( " synodic " ) month is roughly 29.5 days inlength on average , the dates of the fullmoon shift from year to year .
Here is alisting of all of the full moon names , as well as the dates and times for 2010 .
Unless otherwise noted , all times are for the Eastern Time Zone .
Jan. 30 , 1:18 a.m. EST -- Full Wolf Moon .?
Amidthe zero cold and deep snows of midwinter , the wolf packs howled hungrilyoutside Indian villages .?
It was also known as the Old Moon or the Moon afterYule .?
In some tribes this was the Full Snow Moon ; most applied that name tothe next moon .?
The Moon will also arrive at perigee ( it 's closest point toEarth on its non-circular orbit ) less than three hours later , at 4:04 a.m. ESTat a distance of 221,577 mi. ( 356,593 km. ) from Earth .?
So this is the biggestfull moon of 2010 .?
Very highocean tides can be expected during the next two or three days , thanksto the coincidence of perigee with full moon .?
Feb . 28,11:38 a.m. EST -- FullSnow Moon .?
Usually the heaviest snows fall in this month .?
Hunting becomesvery difficult , and hence to some tribes this was the Full Hunger Moon .? .
Mar. 29,10:25 p.m. EDT -- FullWorm Moon .?
In this month the ground softens and the earthworm casts reappear , inviting the return of the robins .?
The more northern tribes knew this as the Full Crow Moon , when the cawing of crows signals the end of winter , or the FullCrust Moon because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day andfreezing at night .?
The Full Sap Moon , marking the time of tapping mapletrees , is another variation .
In 2010 this is also the Paschal Full Moon ; the first full Moon of the spring season .?
The first Sunday following the Paschal Moon is Easter Sunday , which indeed will be observed six days later onSunday , April 4 .
Apr. 28,8:18 a.m. EDT -- FullPink Moon .?
The grass pink or wild ground phlox is one of the earliestwidespread flowers of the spring .?
Other names were the Full Sprouting GrassMoon , the Egg Moon , and -- among coastal tribes -- the Full Fish Moon , when theshad come upstream to spawn .
May 27,7:07 p.m. EDT -- FullFlower Moon .?
Flowers are now abundant everywhere .?
It was also known asthe Full Corn Planting Moon or the Milk Moon .
Jun. 26,7:30 a.m. EDT -- FullStrawberry Moon .?
Strawberry picking season peaks during this month .?
Europeans called this the Rose Moon .
There will be also be a Partial LunarEclipse that coincides with moonset from the western and central sectionsof the US and Canada and coincides with moonrise for parts of eastern Asia .
Atits maximum the Moon will be overhead for observersin the South Pacific ; nearly 54 - percent of the Moon 's diameter willbecome immersed in the Earth 's dark umbral shadow .???
Jul. 25,9:37 p.m. EDT -- FullBuck Moon , when the new antlers of buck deer push out from their foreheadsin coatings of velvety fur .?
It was also often called the Full Thunder Moon , thunderstorms being now most frequent .?
Sometimes it's also called the Full HayMoon .?
Aug. 24,1:05 p.m. EDT -- FullSturgeon
Moon , when this large fish of the Great Lakes and other majorbodies of water like Lake Champlain is most readily caught .?
A few tribes knewit as the Full Red Moon because when the moon rises it looks reddish throughsultry haze , or the Green Corn Moon or Grain Moon .
Since the Moonarrives at apogee about 12 hours later , this will also be the smallest fullmoon of 2010 .?
In terms of apparent size , it will appear 12.3 - percent smallerthan the full Moon of Jan. 30 .
Sep. 23,5:17 a.m. EDT -- FullHarvest Moon .
Traditionally , this designation goes to the full moon thatoccurs closest to the Autumnal ( fall ) Equinox .?
The Harvest Moon usually comesin September , but ( on average ) once or twice a decade it will fall in early October .?
At the peak of the harvest , farmers can work into the night by thelight of this moon .?
Usually the moon rises an average of 50 minutes later eachnight , but for the few nights around the Harvest Moon , the moon seems to riseat nearly the same time each night : just 25 to 30 minutes later across theU.S. , and only 10 to 20 minutes later for much of Canada and Europe .?
Corn , pumpkins , squash , beans , and wild rice -- the chief Indian staples -- are nowready for gathering .
Oct. 22,9:36 p.m. EDT -- FullHunters ' Moon .?
With the leaves falling and the deer fattened , it 's nowtime to hunt .?

Nov. 21,12:27 p.m. EST -- FullBeaver Moon .?
At this point of the year , it 's time to set beaver trapsbefore the swamps freeze to ensure a supply of warm winter furs .?
Anotherinterpretation suggests that the name Beaver Full Moon come from the fact thatthe beavers are now active in their preparation for winter .?
It 's also calledthe Frosty Moon .
Dec. 21 , 3:13 a.m. EST -- Full Cold Moon .
Onoccasion , this moon was also called the Moon before Yule .
December is also themonth the winter cold fastens its grip .?
Sometimes this moon is referred to asthe Full Long Nights Moon and the term " Long Night " Moon is a veryappropriate name because the nights are now indeed long and the Moon is abovethe horizon a long time .?
This particular full moon makes its highest arcacross the sky because it 's diametrically opposite to the low Sun . ?
In fact , themoment of the Winter Solstice comes just over 15 hours after this full moon , at6:38 p.m. EST .
Last , but certainly not least , this will also be the nightof a Total Lunar Eclipse .
North Americans will have a ringside seat forthis event ( totality will last 73 - minutes ) and , depending on your location , will take place either during the middle of the night or during the predawnhours .
Observers in Western Europe and western Africa will see the openingstages of the eclipse before the Moon sets ; South Americans will see the Moonset either during the total phase or as the Moon emerges from the shadow .?
Atmid-eclipse , the Moon will appear almost directlyoverhead for observers in southern California and Baja Mexico .

Making the deaths all the more tragic , perhaps , is that many are a result of forgetfulness rather than neglect , occurring when distracted but otherwise responsible parents or caretakers inadvertently leave a child in the car .
Newspaper articles and campaigns by safety advocates had brought some attention to the problem , but its visibility grew when a March 2009 article by Gene Weingarten in The Washington Post Magazine , “ Fatal Distraction , ” asked whether the mistake of forgetting a child in the back seat of a car was also a crime .
The article won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing .
Is increased awareness enough to prevent these tragedies , which are more likely now that children ride in back seats to avoid injuries that could result from an air bag deployment ?
Or would a technical solution from automakers be a better approach ?
George Osborne has vowed to push ahead with £ 6bn of spending cuts despite some badly needed positive news on the public finances that showed the country 's budget deficit was much smaller than first feared last year thanks to a windfall of taxes from the financial sector .
The Office for National Statistics said a surge in tax receipts at the end of the financial year had prompted it to revise down March 's public sector net borrowing – the gap between the Exchequer 's tax take and its spending – by £ 5.5 bn .
That and other revisions left the deficit for the year as a whole down by more than £ 7bn on previous reports to £ 156.1bn , excluding the cost of interventions to support the financial sector .
That is almost £ 11bn lower than former chancellor Alistair Darling 's final budget forecast of £ 167bn for the 2009 - 10 financial year .
The Treasury stressed that the deficit was still the worst since records began at the end of the second world war .
Much of the end of year uplift came from one - off tax effects as people rushed to sell shares or were given share options by employers ahead of a 50 p tax rate for high earners in April .
A Treasury spokesman said : " The chancellor has made clear that tackling the deficit must start now , which is why £ 6bn of savings this year will be set out on Monday .
It is welcome that borrowing has come in lower than expected for last year due to a windfall on tax receipts , but borrowing in April and for last year was still at record levels , which is why we need to act now to cut the deficit . "
There was a slightly stronger than expected start to the new financial year too , with the net borrowing for April coming in at £ 9.96bn , the highest April shortfall on record but below economists ' forecasts for £ 11bn .
Analysts noted that it was £ 1.1 bn worse than a year earlier , but the pace of deterioration in the public finances was slowing .
Alan Clarke , UK economist at BNP Paribas , said : " To put that into context , the pace of deterioration over the last year has been on average around £ 5 bn compared with the same time a year earlier and as high as £ 10 bn worse at times .
Hence this outcome and substantial downward revisions to borrowing for the previous month are encouraging . "
Against the backdrop of financial markets that are increasingly jittery about all countries ' fiscal health , many economists echoed the Treasury 's view that cuts were still needed despite the revised figures .
" This rather puts all of the pre-election bickering about the Conservatives ' proposed £ 6bn cuts in the deficit this year into context .
But it does not mean that a major fiscal tightening is no longer needed ...
A huge fiscal squeeze is still coming and we still think that the budget on 22 June will include plans , at least , for sizeable tax increases , " said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics .
Business group the CBI said there was no room for complacency and that the newly set - up Office for Budget Responsibility could well come out with a much bleaker outlook for the public finances .
The TUC said borrowing was " far from being out of control " and cutting too soon could derail a recovery in jobs and economic growth .
" With the economy still fragile , the new government would be wrong to put this at risk by introducing spending cuts now .
Not only will this damage the economy but it could create an even deeper deficit , " said general secretary Brendan Barber .
The other measure of the public finances , the public sector net cash requirement , came in at £ 8.85 bn in April .
That was also the highest April on record and worse than a forecast of £ 6.75 bn .
Replacing BP as the leader in the cleanup of the Gulf of Mexico oil leak is not an option and such calls are just a metaphor , Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen said on Monday .
As complaints about the federal government ’s response to the massive oil leak continued to grow , Allen , the national incident commander , briefed White House reporters on the Obama administration ’s efforts to deal with the spill , which began with the explosion and sinking of a deep - water oil rig last month .
As the oil has continued to flow into the gulf and onto some 70 miles of Louisiana coastline , the administration has upped the rhetoric on how the leak is being fought .
Throughout , the administration has maintained that it is doing all it can and that BP , which operates the well , is the responsible party for the cleanup .
Over the weekend , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar complained about BP ’s performance and threatened to have the federal government take over the operation , a possibility that the White House last week said could not be done .

A kicked - over trolley in a puddle of blood : that is the image stamped on the front of the new marketing guide Buyer 's remorse : why anti-brand values are killing consumerism .
The guide 's thrust is simple - kiss the shop - till - you - drop age of conspicuous consumption goodbye .
Greet the dawn of the " post - consumer " - a virtuous entity " more conscious of community rather than status , value instead of indulgence , and basic needs not bling , " writes the guide 's trendspotter author Alan Fairnington ( www.mext.com.au).
In Fairnington 's view , in response to the rise of ethical consumption , firms can and must raise their horizons : adapt or die - of shame , perhaps .
Shoppers are now after " basic needs not bling " .
Open consumption has become embarrassing , according to analyst Scott Goodson in a July 2009 Business
Week confession that he shops online when nobody is watching .
Underlining Goodson 's misgivings , a PricewaterhouseCoopers report released in March this year stated that " rampant and excessive consumption " is waning .
During the recovery , a business ' success will depend on recognising that shoppers remain in recession mode , the report said .
Quelling impulse , shoppers will spend with deliberation and purpose , it added .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) --
The U.S. military has begun testing massive high - tech dirigibles -- designed to provide battlefield commanders with a bird 's - eye view of cruise missiles or other threats -- in the skies over the Utah desert .
Two unmanned 242 - foot - long balloons were launched Wednesday morning about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City .
Vast tracts of military - owned desert were chosen for the testing because of their remoteness and resemblance to the mountainous , arid environment of Afghanistan , the military said in a statement .
Known as aerostats , the dirigibles are outfitted with radar and communications systems to provide long - range surveillance targeting threats from aircraft , ballistic and cruise missiles .
Waltham , Mass .- based Raytheon Co. was awarded a $ 1.4 billion contract from the Army in 2007 to design , build and test the aerostats .
Several more tests are proposed for Utah later in the year , including over the remote northern portion of the Great Salt Lake and parts of the Snake Valley .
The aerostats were first flight - tested in Elizabeth City , N.J. , last summer but were limited to a height of 3,000 feet .
In Utah , the dirigibles are expected to fly some 10,000 feet above the U.S. Air Force 's Utah Test and Training Range , where air space is restricted up to 58,000 feet , the military said .
The dirigibles are tethered to processing stations on the ground , and each is capable of staying aloft for a month .
Officials said the aerostats will be less expensive to maintain and operate than conventional aircraft - based radar while providing battlefield commanders a bird 's - eye view of threats in a given area .
" Not only will it expand the view well over the horizon , but do so at least cost to the taxpayer .
This is a critically needed capability as we continue to prosecute the global war on terrorism , " Col. William E. King IV , Dugway 's commander , said in a statement .
The program is known formally as the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System , or JLENS .

The chief executive of BP tells Sky News he believes the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill will end up having only a " very , very modest " environmental impact .
Experts had feared the Deepwater Horizon disaster could have led to one of the worst environmental catastrophes in U.S. history .
But the British oil giant has risked outrage along the Gulf Coast by predicting a far smaller impact .
" I think the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to have been very , very modest , " Tony Hayward said .
" It is impossible to say and we will mount , as part of the aftermath , a very detailed environmental assessment but everything we can see at the moment suggests that the overall environmental impact will be very , very modest . "
Click here to see video of Tony Hayward 's statement .
BP has begun capturing some of the leaking oil after inserting a suction tube into the fractured riser pipe on the seabed .
It is gathering up an estimated one fifth of the oil pumping out of the fractured well .
" Over the last 36 hours we have made a lot of progress on containment on the seabed , " Hayward said .
" We have a piece of technology engineering which we have developed and which is now allowing us to produce oil from the leak to the surface . "
The BP chief spoke to Sky News after completing a visit to Florida where he handed over $ 25 million to pay for an advertising campaign for the state 's tourism industry .
He appeared upbeat as he met teams at BP 's vast crisis control center in Houston .
The center has been working around the clock for more than three weeks trying to identify solutions to the crisis .
The company believes the next stage of its response effort could see the leak sealed completely within seven to 10 days if all goes to plan .
I can't say I ever wanted to knuffle Antonie van Leeuwenhoek before , but this adorable video may have altered my thinking .
Using stop- motion Lego animation , this short documentary — made by the owner of Brickfilms site — offers a great short history of the two Fathers of Microbiology :
The aforementioned van Leeuwenhoek and the better - known * Louis Pasteur .
For extra fun , the dialogue for both men is recorded in their native tongue ( with subtitles ) , so there 's none of that awkward " pretending everybody in history spoke English " thing .
Plus , you 'll learn how to say " wee beasties " in two languages .
Want more microbiology videos ?
I really must recommend microbiologist and blogger Cesar Sanchez 's playlist .
* The film also inadvertently answers the question of why Pasteur is more of a popular figure .

A Facebook phishing attack is on the loose this weekend — the third widespread attack on the site in the past three weeks .
The attack attempts to steal your Facebook login credentials , install malware on your computer and even get your home address .
The attack is spread via a " hilarious video " posted to Facebook walls , reports WebSense .
When clicked , a form appears requesting your Facebook login .
The attack then returns you to Facebook , installs an app called " Media Player HD , " and asks you to download the " FLV player " — doing so installs malware on your machine .
It gets worse : Depending on your location , you may also be presented with a contest to win an iPad ... if you just enter your home address .
To avoid getting caught , simply remove the " hilarious video " if you find it on your Facebook wall .
If you see it elsewhere on Facebook , do n't click it ... and of course remember the obvious rule :
Do n't enter your Facebook login anywhere other than Facebook.com .
If you already fell for the attack , change your Facebook password , uninstall the Facebook app ( often called " Media Player HD " ) , and run a virus / malware scan on your computer .
The video below , courtesy of Websense , explains the attack .
A Chinese automaker has taken every half - baked idea anyone 's ever had for eco - friendlier motoring and used them all in a wild concept car , the laws of physics be damned .
Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. is rolling into the Expo 2010 Shanghai China with the Ye Zi – literally , " Leaf " – concept that 's topped with a plastic leaf , runs on renewable energy and somehow emits oxygen , making it the world 's first " carbon negative " car .
The car is named for the leaf - shaped roof , which houses photovoltaic cells .
The flight of fancy continues with the wheel turbines , which spin like those god-awful wheels we used to see on Cadillac Escalades .
SAIC claims the turbines generate electricity as the car is moving .
The metal - organic framework chassis captures CO2 for use in a microbial fuel cell , which would emit water vapor .
But what really caught our eye was the laser generator .
According to a Google translation of a story posted at Autohome.com.cn , the car is capable of converting " the high concentration of carbon dioxide emissions from the laser generator light - electricity converter into electricity for the vehicle lighting . "
That , it says , makes the Leaf a " negative emissions " vehicle .
Maybe something was lost in translation .
No word from SAIC on the car 's specs , let alone how any of this technology works , because it has n't responded to the e-mail we sent .
But we ran all of this past Spencer Quong , an automotive engineer with 15 years experience in advanced vehicle technologies .
Before launching the consulting firm Quong & Associates , he was an alt - fuels expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists .
Quong said all of the technologies are feasible ways of producing electricity .
But they are n't terribly practical in automotive applications .
He suspects the metal - organic framework refers to microscopic lattices , which the Department of Energy is studying as a means of storing hydrogen in fuel cell vehicles .
The drawback to the technology is it 's heavy and it typically generates a lot of heat when storing the hydrogen molecules , so it requires a significant amount of cooling .
As for the wheel turbines , Quong said that , in general , they would create more drag than energy .
However , there are some circumstances where wheel turbines might be used to generate electricity during braking or when going downhill , but the engineering precision required to do so makes them impractical .
Kind of like the rest of the car .
" I think overall , the car is breaking the laws of physics because it requires much more energy to run all of their devices , " Quong said .
Too bad , because we like the idea of a laser generator .
UPDATE : 12 p.m. Eastern , April 15 : We 've just received an e-mail from SAIC informing us that the company " is still working on our Leaf concept car information " and " hopefully " it can provide more detail Friday .
Presumably they mean tomorrow .
Stay tuned .
UPDATE 6:25 p.m. Eastern , April 15 : A reader sent an email to say the translation of " laser generator " was , in fact , incorrect .
The literal translation is " light - electricity converter , " which means photovoltaic .
Thanks , Mingjie !
Also , judging from the comments , perhaps we should repeat that this is a concept car .
It almost certainly is n't headed to production .

The New York Times ’ slow - cooked plan to charge some readers for some of its online content will be put into place in January of next year , editor in chief Bill Keller told other journos at a dinner in New York on Thursday night .
The plan , which Times editors have talked about before , but often in vague , uncertain terms , has been solidified .
The paper ’s “ metered model ” will charge only heavy online readers — people who depend on Nytimes.com as their newspaper — while letting most Web surfers in free to read a few articles per month .
Subscribers to the Times ’ print newspaper will get free online access , Keller said .
By contrast , Wall Street Journal subscribers must pay an extra 40 cents per week to add the online Journal to their account .
Media Matters got Keller to talk more about the Times ’ plan via email .
Keller describes a system much less restrictive than a traditional “ paywall ” that requires a login to read anything :
“ Those who mainly come to the website via search engines or links from blogs , and those who only come sporadically — in short , the bulk of our traffic — may never be asked to pay at all .
People who have print subscriptions will get full website access without charge .
So we do not anticipate a major impact on overall traffic , which is important to maintain advertising .
“ We announced this months ago , and I ’m all for it .
It costs money to do the kind of deeply reported journalism our readers expect , and it ’s well worth paying for .
We assume there will be some impact on readership , aka traffic , but not as much as with a conventional pay model .
Under our metered model , basically people who use Nytimes.com as their newspaper , who read a lot and depend on it , will be asked to pay a small subscription price . ”
The Times ’ previous attempt to charge for content , TimesSelect , was canceled in 2007 because too few subscribers had signed up for what was basically a premium content package .
Most TimesSelect content was what newspaper editors categorize as commentary or opinion , rather than news reporting .
People were uninterested in paying an extra $ 50 per year to read the Times ’ columnists .
Keller ’s new plan takes a different angle from both TimesSelect and the Journal .
It ’s a different version of freemium than TimesSelect .
The old plan gave away news and charged for analysis .
The new plan will give away some of everything , but charge you if you want more of it .
Chances are Keller and company are still trying to calculate exactly how much to give away , and how much to charge for greater access .
Without those numbers , the only safe prediction is that they wo n’t start with a high bar to access .
Better to start with a lenient setting that blocks few readers , then ratchet it up to see what the market will bear .
Will it work ?
Probably .
The Wall Street Journal has proven it ’s possible to get a large number of people to pay more than $ 100 a year for online news .
WSJ.com reached one million subscribers in 2007 , the same year the Times killed TimeSelect .
Much like the Journal ’s model , the new Times approach wo n’t split content into two tiers .
It ’ll give away the Times ’ hottest content , then charge you when you crave more .

Michael Le , who runs a fan website calling for a boycott of the film , said : " It becomes very clear that it 's part of the historical pattern of Hollywood .
It 's because this is the standard procedure for Hollywood films , and it really should n't be .
It 's 2010 . "
Paramount , which made the film , said more than half of the credited speaking roles were filled by actors representing cultures from around the world .
By Ann Ivins Christina Hendricks : that ’s what real looks like , boys .
Today , women around the interwebs participate in Boobquake .
The brainchild of self - described “ liberal , geeky , nerdy , scientific , perverted atheist feminist ” blogger Jen McCreight , this Commemoration of Cleavage , Festival of Funbags , Jubilee of Jugs is in actuality a double - mam slap in the face to this jackass , Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi , whose charmingly magical thinking runs something like this :
“ Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray , corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society , which ( consequently ) increases earthquakes , ” Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi was quoted as saying by Iranian media .
Sedighi is Tehran ’s acting Friday prayer leader .
Wow .
I knew adultery , rape , disease , societal meltdown , bastard children and plagues of locusts were the fault of my dirty pillows , but earthquakes ?
Damn .
Tectonic plates minding their geologic business inching along beneath the earth ’s surface can be suddenly and violently shifted by the sheer force of my immodestly - displayed bazoombas ?
I am… humbled .
Ashamed .
Forgive me , girls .
I have apparently been wasting your mighty powers all these years on free drinks and the occasional cut in line .
Let me atone .
Let me now sing the praises of my constant companions these last twenty - five years : my breasts .
Advent
A classic late - maturing female , I was short , skinny and entirely unendowed for the first thirteen or fourteen ( okay , fifteen ) years of my long - ago youth , and a steady diet of Judy Blume books only reinforced my mammary - related fretting .
This is a universal phenomenon , I believe .
The earsplitting giggling , talking and shrieking of groups of early adolescent girls may in fact be nature ’s way of drowning out the faint , plaintive wail unconsciously emanating from at least two - thirds of them : when ?
When ?
Wheeeennn will my breasts arriiiiive ?
The answer for me was a ) the summer after my sophomore year and b ) seemingly overnight .
I distinctly recall one of my aunts seeing me in a swimsuit that June and gasping , ” Where the hell did those come from ? ” I did n’t know … and did n’t care .
Out of seven female cousins , two of us scored genetically atypical chi-chis ( C - cups on our hundred - pound frames – whoop ! ) , and our sympathy for the others was underwhelming .
“ Sucks to be you , bitches , ” just about summed it up .
From then on , it was both cannon on board and damn the stragglers .
The journey had begun .
Epiphany
Twenty years later , I know some of the home truths about breasts .
For example , sheer size , while eye - catching , is never as important as artful display ; artful display , while useful , is generally biologically irrelevant since straight guys and potential mates are looking anyway ; and while the social , political and gender issues surrounding female anatomy and dress are infinitely complex ( more about this later ) , the lesson learned latest is unfortunately the most important : ALL BOOBS COUNT .
Magazines , television , porn of all varieties swell with images of great big knockers .
Women , trained to be hypercritically focused on their appearance , have obviously bought the message hook , line and exploding silicone .
And that ’s a personal choice – like working or staying home , a choice more readily available to the well - to - do , and not one for me to judge , although of course I am .
Judging .
Bad implants are an aesthetic travesty : half - cantaloupes glued onto a bony thoracic plain , with the flat valley of fakery giving it all away … but far , far worse is the very real danger of losing a lot of highly enjoyable nerve sensation in order to look like a physiological freak anomaly .
Numb nipples ?
No , no , Nanette !
How I wish I could get inside those frightened , insecure , young ( or not so ) brains and pound into their amygdalas the simple , simple truth : to 99 % of the straight men on this planet , a boob in the hand is worth a million in the imagination .
Small , large , perky , floppy , looking slightly to the left or winking jauntily skywards … availability trumps any other rackular characteristic .
Add in enthusiasm and NON - NUMB NIPS and in the words of the immortal Theodore Geisel : oh , the places you ’ll go !
Ascension
And having now preached the Gospel of Loving The Gazongas You ’ve Got , I must admit that twenty - five years and quite a few pounds later , with the girls all grown up and gravity doing its treacherous best to make me fall over forward whenever I stand up , the thought of timely alterations has occurred to me more than once .
It ’s tough to watch faithful friends fall away .
But the process of hoisting the flags to pre-midlife levels is so invasive , so scarring , so potentially damaging …
I do n’t know .
The experts at Wacoal and Champion keep doing their jobs , structural engineering continues to evolve ; hell , I ’ll probably keep ’em natural .
So what if in another twenty years it takes a winch , a net and a butter paddle to wrestle them into their daily containment devices ?
That ’s what Lycra and Powermesh are for .
Cut them up , scoop them out and stitch them to my ears ?
Nah .
My boobs have been good to me .
They deserve better than that .
Next : the care , feeding and practical possibilities of knockers
When Platinum Dunes the production house created by Michael Bay Andrew Form and Brad Fuller first came into being it took on the father of modern horror films The Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
It ’s safe to say everyone expected it to be a total failure given who was involved ; when it turned out that it actually was n’t too bad of a film fans were justifiably surprised .
A few mid-level misfires later Platinum Dunes raised their aim at iconic horror franchises even higher bringing back TCM ‘s director Marcus Nispel to tackle Jason Voorhees .
Again people were n’t expecting much so it was another pleasant surprise that 2009 ’s Friday the 13th turned out to be a thoroughly entertaining respectful recombination of the cabin - in - the - woods slasher .
From there the studio did n’t even bother to go back to lesser franchises they notched their crosshairs as high as they could go ; Freddy Krueger .
Fast forward twelve months .
The main thing anyone will want to know about A Nightmare on Elm Street is whether it is at the very least a worthy remake of the original Wes Craven film about a slain pedophile who resurrects in the dream world to kill teenagers in their sleep .
The short answer is a resounding yes .
Samuel Bayer ’s film is the best remake in the Platinum Dunes stable ; Jackie Earle Haley is an excellent successor to the original ’s Robert Englund ; and Freddy Krueger is n’t just scary again he ’s the most disturbing he ’s ever been .
The long answer is of course a little more complicated and requires plenty of qualifiers .
Yes A Nightmare on Elm Street is the best remake Platinum Dunes has produced but the reason behind that is also the film ’s handicap .
For the most part Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer ’s screenplay hems incredibly close to Craven ’s original .
There comes a point in the film however where staying faithful to the source material becomes a bit too problematic .
Mainstream audiences particularly those who did n’t grow up with Krueger will be unaffected but horror fans may soon grow bored with the lack of individuality in the scripting department .
And then just as the film threatens to overthrow its predecessor by changing ( for the better ) Krueger ’s origin story it backs off once again sacrificing innovation for tradition .
It would appear to be a contradiction but that adherence to tradition in turn becomes the remakes ’ greatest strength .
Bayer and company dive even deeper into the Elm Street mythos giving the audience in the process two crucial looks at what Krueger was like before the parents of the molested preschoolers delivered their gas - can brand of mob justice .
Haley ’s astounding amount of talent makes profound use of every second of these brief glimpses into a pre-burn Freddy .
Then once the kind soft - spoken kid-loving mask of the pedophile - in - hiding has been literally burned off the true monster underneath emerges .
This contrast between the Freddy the kids knew and the Freddy they now know as teens makes for some legitimately bothersome bedroom nightmares toward the film ’s end .
As for the teens they too are marked improvements this time around .
Johnny Depp may have emerged from the ’ 84 classic but he was about it .
Rooney Mara Kyle Gallner Thomas Dekker and Katie Cassidy all do an admirable job with the at times thin characterizations they ’re given .
It ’s a testament to the talent of each of them that they overcome the limitations of the script to warrant some investment in their fight against their dream killer .
And as for that dream killer …Haley is the perfect replacement for Englund .
His take on the voice may be indistinguishable from his work as Rorschach in Zack Snyder ’s Watchmen adaptation but considering it fits Haley ’s commanding presence as Krueger as snugly as the iconic bladed glove whose newly stylized dragging across the pipes in Freddy ’s dream boiler room sounds skincrawlingly likely a cross between nails on a chalk board and an arc welder that ’s not too much of a complaint .
A little more worthy of complaint are a few failed attempts to reinact iconic moments from the original most notably Freddy ’s emergence from the wallpaper above Nancy ’s bed .
It ’s inexcusable that a special effect in the year 2010 should look worse than the effect from the 1984 film it ’s imitating but CGI the perpetual enemy of the horror fan once again rears its ugly head .
That embarrassing failure aside this film could not look better .
Bayer did a tremendous job of altering the reality of the dream world with subtle visual distortions ( a lot of straight lines are skewed obtusely outward while the edges of the frame curve oh so slightly inward ) when necessary .
And the effects work on Krueger ’s face is appropriately gruesome in all the right spots .
One can even forgive the terrible wallpaper CGI scene in exchange for inspired touches like a partial singed cheek that flaps slightly when he exhales or moves too quickly .
While this rebirth of Krueger no doubt boasts a number of glorious kills ( the bold opener sets the gore precedent quite nicely ) its biggest strength in the fear department is this new far more disturbing structuring of the character as a joyless disgusting psychopath .
Craven ’s original used Krueger ’s actions mainly as the logistical justification for why he would be killing these teenagers whereas Bayer ’s handling of the material leverages the origin story beyond just physical torture and into mentally disturbing psychosexual territory .
The original franchise gradually acclimated to the idea of Krueger as a sexual threat but this iteration makes no qualms about it .
It ’s not just the burns to Krueger ’s face that have been updated for realism ; his motivations have as well — and that makes this new Nightmare on Elm Street scary as hell .

Gardai Clash with protestors marching against government cutbacks outside the Gates of Leinster House in Dublin tonight
Protesters stormed Ireland 's parliament last night during a march against government plans to inject billions of euros into the country 's banks .
Dozens of people broke away from the march and ran at the gates of the parliament 's main building , Leinster House .
They wrestled with police , who tried to force them back and secure the gate .
At least one man suffered a head injury during the scuffles with organisers appealing for calm .
Officers stopped the protesters from breaching the gate .
Gardai said no arrests were made and the scuffle was brought under control within minutes .
One man was seen walking away with blood dripping from the back of his head .

Facebook , which has come under increasing fire for violating the privacy of users , had to shut down its chat feature temporarily today to fix a serious breach of user privacy .
A bug allowed anyone to view live chats and contact requests of their " friends , " and ironically enough , the loophole was only accessible through a link to edit your own privacy settings .
The chat feature has since been restored , with Facebook issuing a statement that " We worked quickly to resolve this matter , ensuring that once the bug was reported to us , a solution was quickly found and implemented . "
Poor software engineering and testing at the company has in the past led to messages from users ending up in the wrong inbox , and accidentally exposing the private email addresses of users .
Facebook 's increasing breeches of user trust have even spawned a new term , " zuckering , " as in " That user - interface totally zuckered me into sharing 50 wedding photos , " inspired by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , who once used private Facebook data to access email and other accounts of classmates while at Harvard .

West is this close to deleting his Facebook account , except that apparently doing so is complicated and Facebook would probably just archive the data anyway .
Historically , mainstream sports media has dumbed down baseball statistics .
Whether it 's displaying a player 's stats on the TV screen or providing support for why a hitter should be considered for the Most Valuable Player ( or any other offensive ) award , we 've been spoon fed three main statistics :
Batting Average
Home Runs
Runs Batted In
There are other statistics , but this is what we are supposed to care about most .
In fact , we 've been told that if you are a truly dominant hitter and lead the league in all three , you should be awarded the Triple Crown .
It 's the epitome of offensive performance in baseball .
Or so we 're told .
Lately , the Sabermetrics community has continued to chip away at these long held assumptions .
It seems that chicks will forever dig the long ball , but more and more fans are questioning the value of batting average and RBI , in particular .
While batting average may not be completely discarded ( instead , seen as a statistic of merit , but inferior to on base percentage ) , the Run Batted In is viewed by many stat heads as having little or no value at all .
Why the RBI is a Flawed Statistic
It was his work as an RBI machine that netted him a spot in the Hall of Fame ...
Because he played in the shadow of Johnny Bench , Joe Morgan , and Pete Rose , Perez was underappreciated during his career ... -- on Tony Perez , from Cooperstown : Hall of Fame Players
Each night , I read a page or two from this wonderful book to my eight - year - old son , giving him a nice history of the players who are in the Hall of Fame .
I could n't help but cringe when I read this passage .
It 's not that I do n't think that Tony Perez was a great hitter .
He had a long and distinguished career .
He may even be deserving of Hall of Fame status .
But insinuating that his inclusion as a baseball great falls entirely on this flawed statistic makes a very bad argument .
The problem is that the act of driving in runs is not an individual statistic .
It is reliant not only on Perez getting hits ( and timely hits ) , but having teammates who are on base .
It is additionally helpful if those teammates are average to above average base runners to maximize runs scored ( and therefore maximize runs batted in ) .
Perez played on some terrific teams .
Beyond the Hall of Famers listed above , he also played with Lee May , George Foster , Ken Griffey and Dave Concepcion .
Was he overshadowed ?
Or did Perez benefit as a result ?
Part of the reason Perez drove in so many runs was that the Reds were regularly on base .
His team scored the most runs in the National League four times from 1968 through 1976 and was second or third three other times during that span .
An example of a potential disparity of riches is represented in the 1975 season , one of the years the Reds scored the most runs in the National League .
In nearly 43 % of his plate appearances that year , Tony Perez came up with runners in scoring position .
He batted fourth or fifth 87 % of the time .
By comparison , Dick Allen of the Philadelphia Phillies ( a distant second in runs scored ) , batted fourth or fifth 91 % of the time .
Yet , he came up with runners in scoring position 32 % of the time ( which was actually the second highest rate of his career ) .
Perez needed to come through in clutch situations , and he did so frequently .
He had a .512 slugging percentage with runners on base that year compared to .403 with the bases empty .
But make no mistake , he was granted more opportunities to drive in runs than the typical player .
Even had he fared poorly in clutch situations , the vast opportunities assured him of a nice RBI total ( he finished with 109 in only 137 games , which was good for third in the NL and short of Greg Luzinski's mark of 120 despite playing in 24 fewer games ) .
And of course , part of the reason Perez was often up with runners in scoring position was that he hit either clean - up or fifth in the lineup 61 % of the time during his career .
This may seem obvious , but batters hitting third , fourth or fifth will have the most opportunities to drive in runs .
To again use 1975 as a comparison , the league leader in hits that season was Dave Cash , with 213 .
He played all 162 games that season as the Phillies lead - off hitter .
As a result , he came up with a runner in scoring position only 22 % of the time , resulting in a mere 57 RBI .
Of course , part of the reason Perez drove in more runs that year was also that he had more extra base hits than a guy like Cash , who was a singles hitter .
Yet , you can't discount the fact that Perez came up in prime position to drive in runs nearly double the time .
Moreover , we are led to believe that singles hitters do n't drive in runs because they are rarely in position to post high RBI totals .
The reality is that a guy like Cash who piles on singles throughout the season would put up comparable RBI totals to a clean - up hitter with many more home runs and a much lower batting average -- only if , of course , both hitters were to come up to the plate with identical opportunities .
No two players have the same opportunities to drive in runs , and in fact the disparity when comparing different teams and lineup positions is significant .
As a result , the RBI statistic is greatly flawed .
The Solution
Now , I 'm not the first to propose some sort of solution to this ( note : of course , I hoped I was but a Google search brought me back to reality ) .
Tom Ruane of Retrosheet wrote a piece about Joe Carter a while back .
Carter was a guy who would regularly hit for a low average but drive in a large number of runs .
Tom Tango , who developed the wOBA statistic , provided some inspiration for this study .
Tango 's stat is seen by many as being one of the most important measures of offensive worth .
Among other things , wOBA assigns a runs created value to each offensive result .
Runs created , however , combined both runs scored and runs driven in as a result of that outcome .
Luckily , Tom 's a very accessible guy , and he provided a general RBI value for a single , double , triple , home run , strikeout ( which is always zero ) , other out ( including sacrifices ) , walks and hit by pitch , both with and without the DH .
How ?
Lots of work , I 'm sure .
Taking all identical situations and averaging how many runs are batted in over several years of data .
First , the values ( which have been shortened to be more manageable ) :
Single = .22
Double = .43
Triple = .64
Home Run = 1.6 ( including driving one 's self in )
Strikeout = 0
Other Out = .0275
Walk / HBP = .02
What does this mean ?
It means , given the average situation -- runners on base , base running ability of those on base , etc. -- a single will result in .218 runs driven in .
It should be remembered that a batter does not need to get a hit to drive in a run , which is why outs , walks and hit by pitch are also included .
Suddenly , we can take the offensive output of any two players and determine which would have been the better run producer given identical circumstances .
It 's a wonderful stat , though of course it still is not perfect .
Such a stat would not consider if a player were more " clutch " in situations where runners are in scoring position .
Yet , the variation ( which I call XRBI ) is still a vast improvement over the current RBI statistic .
Below is a collection of the top 100 players in career XRBI , also including their total RBI and respective ranks .
While there are n't a lot of major differences at the top ( Hank Aaron is first either way ) , you 'll note that several players you do not normally consider run producers ( singles hitters like Pete Rose and Lou Brock ) move way up in run production given a level playing field of run producing opportunities .
Think that 's weird ?
Look outside the box .
Oh , and Tony Perez , though he did indeed benefit from playing on offensive minded teams , was still a great run producer in terms of XRBI -- still 41st overall .
BRIMFIELD , Ohio --
When police asked a Kent man why he drove into his ex-wife 's house Thursday evening , he had a simple answer : " I ca n't kill her unless I drive into the house . "
Brimfield Police Chief David Blough said Marlan Raymond drove his Toyota minivan into the house in the 3700 block of Neville Drive about 7 p.m. , jamming it into the front door .
He was arrested a short time later after a series of smaller accidents ended with his van crashed into a fence .
" Marlan drove up to the house , revved his engine and drove up onto the porch , aiming squarely at the front door , " Blough said .
" He knocked down much of the front porch and it was a porch beam that stopped him from busting into the house .
He hit and damaged the front door . "
Earlier version of story
Police said after the crash , he ran into the house looking for his wife , but left when she started to scream for help .
Police said Raymond drove into the parking lot of Brimfield Plaza , along the way striking four mailboxes on Tallmadge Road , a parked truck in the shopping center and coming to rest after striking a fence on Kelso Drive , police said .
Raymond was being held at the Portage County Jail .
" Marlan has a history of problems , " Blough said .
" In Kent , he 's known as the ' Tree Man ' because he climbs into trees that are going to be cut down and stays there until he is removed .
I told him we would get him some help , but first he had to go to jail . "
Blough said he asked Raymond why he rammed his van into his ex-wife 's house .
" He looked at me and he said , ' Chief , she makes me crazy . ' "
Georges Papaconstantinou , ministre des Finances grec s’interrogeait depuis longtemps sur l’insolente prospérité du très chic et très cher quartier de Kolonaki .
Un havre situé sur le flanc du mont Lycabette , en plein centre d’Athènes ; là où les boutiques de luxe le disputent aux 4 x 4 allemands ; là où l’expresso et les loyers atteignent des prix que l’on s’attend davantage à trouver sur les Champs - Elysées .
Sommé par l’Union européenne et par le Fonds monétaire international de mettre de l’ordre dans ses comptes , il a donc voulu faire un exemple .
Et demandé à ses services de lui fournir les revenus des médecins du quartier .
Pourquoi eux ?
Parce qu’ils ont la réputation de mener grand train .
Le fisc n’a pas pu lui fournir de liste précise .
Il a fallu passer par l’annuaire pour mettre la main sur les 150 médecins de Kolonaki .
Papaconstantinou a ensuite envoyé ses contrôleurs visiter les cabinets .
Surprise : les médecins ne déclaraient que 10 000 à 15 000 euros de revenus annuels .
En réalité , ils gagnaient de trois à dix fois plus .
Tout cet argent noir leur permettait d’acheter voitures , bateaux , résidences secondaires dans les îles huppées d’Hydra ou de Mykonos .
Les médecins de Kolonaki ont été redressés .
Mais c’est toute la Grèce qu’il faudrait redresser :
« Désigner ces seuls médecins à la vindicte , c’est du populisme , tout le monde fait la même chose » , s’emporte Spyros , chef de clinique dans un hôpital public .
Car la fraude fiscale tient du sport national .
Pratiquée avec la complicité du fisc .
« Les agents du fisc sont totalement corrompus , c’est la mafia » , juge Electra , propriétaire de plusieurs magasins sur la très chic rue Ermou et qui , dit - elle , se fait racketter .
« En Grèce , payer ses impôts , c’est être un con » , confirme Pedros , patron d’une PME de cosmétiques .
Rares sont ceux , en Grèce , qui croient donc en la capacité de l’Etat d’appliquer les mesures d’austérité ( 30 milliards d’euros d’économie sur trois ans ) exigées par l’UE et le FMI et que le Parlement grec a votées hier .
« Augmenter la TVA , c’est bien , mais il n’y a personne pour la récolter » , s’amuse , un rien désespéré , Yannis Pretenteris , chroniqueur vedette .
La Grèce ressemble à un « pays sans Etat » , explique - t - il .
Ou plutôt un pays dont l’Etat est au service de grandes familles ( les Papandréou à gauche , les Karamenlis à droite ) qui l’utilisent pour s’assurer une clientèle .
« Un système féodal , dénonce le journaliste Athanase Papandropoulos , une magouillocratie » .
D’où le nombre de fonctionnaires qui seraient plus de 1,1 million - toutes catégories confondues et clergé inclus - pour 11 millions d’habitants ?
« L’Etat n’a aucune idée précise de ses effectifs , raconte un diplomate européen , pour qui l’Etat ne sait pas non plus combien gagnent ses fonctionnaires . »
Ce qui est certain , c’est qu’ils sont mal payés .
D’où l’inefficacité .
« Un vice - ministre raconte que seuls les jeunes et 15 % du personnel travaillent » , rapporte Filios Stangos , journaliste à la télévision publique .
Cela explique - t - il la corruption généralisée ?
Ici , on ne dit pas « bakchich » , mais fakelaki ( «enveloppe » ) .
« Tous les secteurs de l ’Etat sont touchés : santé , éducation , justice , police , urbanisme , fisc » , assure Spyros au salaire de chef de clinique de 4 000 euros net ( sur 14 mois ) .
Dans son bureau , à l’hôpital , il a épinglé une affiche : « Je n’accepte pas de fakelaki . »
Mais « la plupart des médecins acceptent ces enveloppes qui permettent aux patients d’avoir l’assurance d’être bien soignés .
C’est le système .
Les citoyens ne comprennent d’ailleurs pas qu’on ne se plie pas à cette corruption généralisée » .
Les médecins multiplient ainsi leur salaire officiel par quatre , cinq , dix …
Les inspecteurs du fisc n’échappent pas à la pratique , bien au contraire .
Car le moteur de la fraude , ce sont eux .
« Ici , on parle , comme au foot du 4 - 4 - 2 : l ’inspecteur du fisc prend 4 pour lui , vous en laisse 4 et en donne 2 à l’Etat » , se désespère un patron .
« L’inspecteur du fisc négocie directement avec le comptable de l’entreprise , raconte Electra .
Il lui donne une enveloppe pour que le redressement soit minime voire inexistant .
L’inspecteur du fisc multiplie son salaire par trois ou quatre au minimum . »
Et pas question de le dénoncer .
« Son supérieur est dans le système , tout comme le policier qui sera chargé de l’enquête , s’indigne Pedros .
Donc on paye en silence sinon on sait qu’ils nous empêcheront de travailler .
C’est comme la mafia . »
Un diplomate l’avoue : « Evidemment , ce n’est pas avec les baisses de salaire que l’on va avoir des contrôleurs plus intègres . »
C’est ce qui explique la colère des Grecs contre cet Etat corrompu et clientéliste .
Ils craignent que les petits soient les seuls victimes du plan d’austérité , faute pour le gouvernement d’avoir les moyens humains - ou la volonté - de chercher l’argent des fraudeurs .
Car il y a de l’argent en Grèce , dans l’économie noire qui représente entre 30 et 40 % du PIB grec selon les chancelleries européennes .
On évalue jusqu’à 30 milliards d’euros l’évasion fiscale .
( CNN ) -- Professor Peter Furth has ridden his bicycle to work at Northeastern University each day for the past six years .
The two - mile trip through the Boston suburb of Brookline , Massachusetts , is usually without incident .
Furth 's journey is worlds apart from his former Boston commute , which for 13 years was a battle with drivers who wanted him on the sidewalk .
" I 've had motorists that drive a couple of inches from my elbow , trying to scare me , " he said .
Furth would catch up with drivers at stoplights and ask them whether they knew how close they 'd come to hitting him .
Invariably , they would say , " Yes , move over . "
It 's a cultural thing , he said .
In the town of Cambridge , motorists see bicyclists all over the place and are considerate .
In Brookline , only every now and then does someone honk or yell .
In the southern part of Boston , it 's not quite war , but the relationship is n't very friendly .
Although the street signs say " Share the road , " there 's still a long road to travel before that sign reflects the reality , bicyclists say .
Motorists often see bands of bikes on the streets on the final Fridays of each month as cyclists across the nation gather for evening group rides called Critical Mass .
The purpose , advocates say , is to make cars and trucks more aware of bicyclists .
But to some drivers , Critical Mass participants are nothing more than spandex - wearing , stop - sign - running Lance Armstrong wannabes who slow traffic .
' They think they own the road '
It 's somewhat symbolic of the tension on the roads .
" The roads were made for cars , " KTAR - FM radio guest host John Hook said in Phoenix , Arizona , last month .
" And bicyclists share the road , but sometimes they think they own the road . "
One caller to the program was a long - haul truck driver who accused many bicycle riders of failing to respect the law and not riding with the flow of traffic .
A caller who identified himself as Jeff said he witnessed an incident in which a pack of bicyclists almost hit a car that had the right of way .
Then the riders screamed at the motorist .
" I actually think the bikes are more disrespectful to the cars than the cars are to the bike , " Jeff said .
The number of cyclists is increasing .
Although bike sales took a dip during the recession of 2009 , more than 18 million were sold each year for the seven previous years , according to the National Sporting Goods Association .
About 27 percent of adults in the United States bike at least once a summer , according a survey released in 2008 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Most bicyclists ride for recreation or exercise , while a small percentage ride to work .
In Portland , Oregon , which is ranked second on Bicycling magazine 's list of Top 50 Bike Friendly Cities , more than 6 percent of residents commute by bike to work .
That 's up from 1 percent two decades ago .
See a map of the top 10 bike - friendly cities
Things are looking up , at least in the eyes of cyclists .
Many cities are putting in bike lanes and paths .
Google adds bike routes to maps
More than $ 730 million in federal stimulus funds has been allocated for bike and pedestrian projects , according to AmericaBikes.org .
Washington is getting into the act .
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood drew cheers from the cycling world in March when he blogged that the administration was " integrating the needs of bicyclists in federally - funded road projects " and advising state departments of transportation to treat biking and walking " as equals with other transportation modes . "
That drew an outcry from industry , which saw the new policy as taking money away from large transportation construction needs .
" Treating bicycles and other non-motorized transportation as equal to motorized transportation would cause an economic catastrophe , " Carter Wood , a senior adviser at the National Association of Manufacturers , told The New York Times .
" If put it into effect , the policy would more than undermine any effort the Obama administration has made toward jobs .
You can't have jobs without the efficient movement of freight . "
Five blocks of controversy
Michael Ritchey is an avid biker and believes that bike lanes are good idea .
He just thinks the project to add them to a five - block stretch of Hillsborough Street in Raleigh , North Carolina , is folly -- and dangerous .
Hillsborough Street is one of the main arteries in Raleigh and borders the northern part of North Carolina State University and its 30,000 students .
There are bars and shops and small restaurants .
And lots of cars .
The city , working with the state , has decided to redo the four - lane road , and when the project is done , there will be two lanes for cars , a center median and bike lanes on each side .
Ritchey , who owns Global Village Organic Coffee and is a weekend cyclist , fears that bikers will get hurt .
" They are putting [ the bike lanes ] in the wrong place , " he said .
" It 's more of a symbolic gesture . "
And it does n't help that the relationship between cars and bicyclists in the city is " antagonistic at best , " he said .
Ritchey is worried that distracted college students wo n't be on the lookout for bikers and someone will get hurt when a car door opens at the wrong time or someone texting will have an accident ( he 's seen that twice with cars ) .
He said one of his business neighbors opposes the projects because he fears that he will lose parking spaces in front of the bar .
City councilwoman Nancy McFarlane points out that the bikers are already there on Hillsborough and other in - town streets , and the city of 348,000 is growing quickly .
Many people are moving into the downtown area , and last year , the city revised its comprehensive plan .
" The old one was all about the car , and we want to become a multimodal city , " she said .
" That includes bikes , buses and light rail . "
Steve Waters is one resident in favor of bike lanes .
The freelance programmer works at home and uses his bike for short errands .
He said that although some Hillsborough Street business owners might be concerned about losing money because of less car traffic , the opposite is likely to happen .
" It enhances the local economy , " he said .
" It 's all about creating options . "

The best road bikes of 2010
Not every street should get a bike lane
Although opponents say the money is better spent on other road projects , cycling advocates say the lanes are needed to make the roads safer and less congested .
Denver , Colorado , is ranked 12th on Bicycling magazine 's list .
The city has little room for new roads , municipal bike planner Emily Kreisa said .
She said Denver is interested in using bicycles to eliminate congestion and to help the environment , but they do n't just add a bike lane anywhere .

Five cities to watch
" We look at the traffic volume , the turning issues and how much room we have in the right of way , " she said .
" In choosing any kind of [ project ] , the first thing is what is the connection to the system , then what is the characteristic of the road and then how do we need to provide for the cyclist . "
Denver received $ 250,000 of stimulus money for cycling projects and is going to add 11 miles of bike lanes .
The city is using its own funds to paint sharrows ( painted bike symbols on the asphalt with arrows showing cyclists the way ) to connect the roads of the network .
Kreisa , who bikes 10 miles to work , says Denver is by far the easiest place she has commuted on two wheels .
" I 've had one person honk at me and one person tell me to move over to the right , " she said of her two years in the city .
" There are a lot of active people here who are also cyclists . "
Bethlehem police said a Broughal Middle School student disrupted class Tuesday morning when she told her teacher , in front of a room of students , something nasty that 's four letters long , begins with F and is followed by " you . "
The student , a 14 - year - old girl of Wyandotte Street , was charged with disorderly conduct , police said .
The alleged incident occurred at 9:45 a.m .
I believe there are four rules to this art .
Rule # 1 – Dig Deep and Far
The first rule in the art of listening is to be what I call a musical historian .
Many times , a lot of beginners simply get stuck in listening to what ’s currently popular , or the classic songs and bands that everyone knows – i.e. the cool stuff .
They simply fail to go beyond the surface when it comes to listening .
What I ’m about to say is going to be hugely unpopular amongst a lot of guitarists but I feel it ’s the truth .
It saddens me these days that people think that the guitar revolves around only Jimi Hendrix , Eddie Van Halen , Slash and so forth i.e. that the guitar community has come to a stand - still since the times of these guitarists .
Whilst these guys have certainly contributed immensely to the guitar world , they are no means the only players .
The truth is , the guitar community has moved light years ahead since the days of Hendrix .
What was considered breathtaking and revolutionary guitar playing then now seems rather plain .
What saddens me is that we have more talented musicians and guitarists than ever before but these are failed to be acknowledged by the mass of audiences .
By talented , I do n’t just mean shredders and people with awe - inspiring chops – I mean people who also possess great musical writing abilities too .
Similarly , you can also make the mistake of listening to the new stuff and miss out on the old gems which are just waiting to be discovered .
For the shredders , who says old guitarists played slow stuff ?
You think Yngwie Malmsteen is the god of shred ?
Jazzers such as John McLaughlin and Pat Martino have been ripping it up at break neck speeds on stage decades before Malmsteen – whilst playing over complicated chord changes that require a bit of thinking too .
You think Stevie Ray Vaughan was the best blues player ?
Check out who influenced his blues playing .
Players such as Buddy Guy and Albert King laid the foundations of modern blues phrasing and warrant some much deserved attention too .
In fact one of the things that I like to do is to find out who influenced some of these big name players and listen to their stuff .
If such musicians were able to influence and shape the playing of the great players – surely , they must be worth checking out .
I actually knew about this while writing the other post , but it had n’t seemed to break publicly on the Net yet .
Well , now it has .
There ’s language in the new SDK agreement for iPhone OS 4.0 that appears to ban using any development environment or toolchain that Apple does n’t like .
Most especially , it seems aimed at preventing Adobe from marketing the flagship feature in CS5 : compiling for iPhone standalone apps .
3.3.1 — Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ , or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ , and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) .
CS5 launches on Monday , by the way , so this is a huge blow to Adobe .
There is already plenty of speculation as to whether this catches stuff like Unity , MonoTouch , Appcelerator ( they had a blog post up about it , but it ’s gone now ! ) , and who knows what else .
Basically , all cross-compilation tools , which is a large amount of the middleware out there .
This is the dark side of the last post I wrote .
Epically closed means , well , epically closed .
And in this case , it means creating barriers to content creation that effectively mean it costs more dollars to engage in the market .
That ’s what happens when you have closed - off production - and - distribution chains : smaller developers lose out .
Ranald Macdonald , proprietor and founder of Boisdale said : “ Gull ’s eggs are very rare and one of the short - lived gems of the season .

In a 1980 interview , Gabriel García Márquez told The New York Times that he had spent three years writing a book about life in Cuba under Fidel Castro .
But , he said , “ now I realize that the book is so critical that it could be used against Cuba , so I refuse to publish it . ”
In view of the Colombian author ’s past concern for the victims of Latin America ’s authoritarian regimes , it seems likely that what he called a “ very harsh , very frank book ” addressed Castro ’s systematic repression of dissent : the rigged trials behind closed doors , the abysmal “ reeducation ” camps , the long prison sentences .
Castro ’s methods may have seemed relatively tame when compared with the mass slaughter of civilians by US - backed regimes throughout the region , for example in Guatemala .
Yet as the cold war ended , these dictatorships gradually gave way to civilian rule , and the Castro government was left standing as the only one in the hemisphere that continued to repress virtually all political dissent .
García Márquez ’s book remained unpublished .
The fact that Latin America ’s most renowned writer would censor himself in this way may actually say more about the plight of Cubans under Castro than anything in his manuscript .
For the notion that to criticize Cuba is to abet its more powerful enemies was , for Fidel Castro , the key to achieving what his prisons alone could not — ensuring that his critics on the island remained isolated and largely ignored .
For years , many believed that the last thing keeping the region ’s democratic tide from sweeping across Cuba was the unique force of Fidel Castro ’s character — the extraordinary combination of charisma and cunning with which he inspired and corralled his supporters , provoked and outmaneuvered his enemies , and projected himself onto the big screen of world politics .
Under his leadership , Cuba had made impressive gains in health care , education , and the eradication of extreme poverty .
But the promise of the Cuban Revolution had been undercut by years of chronic deprivation , exacerbated by the US embargo , and brought to the brink of collapse by the dissolution of the Soviet Union , which had propped up the island ’s economy for decades .
Democracy would come to Cuba — the thinking went — as soon as Fidel Castro was no longer standing in its way .
Then in June 2006 , his health failing , Castro was forced to step down formally after nearly five decades in power .
And nothing happened .
No popular uprising in the streets , no Party shake - up , no coup .
Instead , his younger brother , Raúl , took up power and , though lacking Fidel ’s charisma , was able to keep the country running smoothly .
Within months , it seemed clear that Cuba ’s single - party system could continue without Fidel at the helm .
Some still held out hope that Raúl Castro would begin a process of political reform , a Cuban perestroika .
Those looking for signs of …
The MicroSight 's wafer - thin optical element is only about a quarter - inch in diameter .
Go down to the rifle range and fire a few rounds at a target 100 meters out .
Chances are you wo n't hit the bull 's - eye .
Even if you read the wind right and do n't twitch as you 're squeezing the trigger , you may well fall at the first hurdle : lining up the shot .
Aiming a weapon is harder than it looks .
Shooters need clear views of a distant object ( the target ) and a near one ( the iron sight at the end of the rifle barrel ) at the same time .
But the eye can't quite pull this off , as a simple experiment shows :
Point at a faraway house or storefront , then try to bring both your finger and the building into focus .
One or the other will be blurry .
Idaho National Laboratory 's innovative gunsight technology , the MicroSight , helps the eye solve this problem .
The MicroSight , a disc smaller than a dime , brings both the target and the iron sight into simultaneous focus , giving marksmen a better sight picture .
The new sight has national - security applications , as it could improve safety and performance for American soldiers .
Millions of target shooters and hunters should also benefit .
" The MicroSight gives you much of the performance you 'd get out of a holographic or telescopic sight , " says INL engineer David Crandall , who developed the technology .
" But it 's more reliable , much lighter - weight and much cheaper . "
The alternating rings on zone plates bring faraway and nearby objects into focus simultaneously .
The magic of zone plates
Crandall is not an optics specialist .
Most of his past work tended toward infrastructure engineering , like nuclear projects with INL 's Advanced Test Reactor .
But Crandall is a highly accomplished target shooter — he 's a member of the U.S. national long - range rifle team — and he 's come up with several other shooting - related inventions .
He patented a rifle - stabilizing shooting sling , for example , and a small , powerful breaching shotgun that could help law - enforcement personnel storm buildings more safely and effectively .
One day , Crandall was leafing through an optics textbook , and he stumbled across a section on " zone plates . "
Zone plates are optical devices that resemble lenses .
But whereas lenses focus light using refraction — essentially , changing the direction of light waves by changing their speed — zone plates use diffraction .
Diffraction describes how waves bend , break up , spread out and interfere with each other as they encounter obstacles .
The diffraction of sound waves , for example , explains how you can hear someone 's voice from around a corner .
Zone plates focus light via a set of concentric rings that alternate between transparent and opaque .
The transparent sections let some light waves pass through unchanged , focusing objects that are far away ( basically , at infinity ) .
But light passing the edges of the opaque rings gets diffracted , which brings nearby objects into focus .
The seemingly impossible result : sharp images of distant and near objects , simultaneously .
Zone plates are n't new .
Frenchman Augustin - Jean Fresnel worked out their underlying scientific principles in the early 1800s .
But it took Crandall , with his shooter 's eye , to recognize the potential zone plates held for improving gunsights .
" Competitive shooters are always looking for an edge , for something better , " Crandall says .
" You have to , when you 're going against the best in the world . "
Crandall took his idea to INL 's technology transfer division , which also saw the promise and agreed to fund his research .
He eventually found his way to phased zone plates .
Phased zone plates replace the opaque rings with transparent glass of varying thickness .
This accomplishes the same goal — diffraction — but does so without losing as much light , yielding brighter images .
After much tinkering , Crandall came up with the MicroSight .
INL engineer David Crandall , a highly accomplished target shooter , uses the MicroSight to take aim at a target 100 meters away .
A smaller , cheaper , more robust sight
Without help from zone plates , the human eye cannot focus on two different planes at the same time .
So shooters using only standard - issue iron sights see either a blurry target or a blurry sight .
Their performance can suffer as a result , sometimes with tragic consequences .
Every year , Americans die after being accidentally shot by hunters who fail to properly identify their target .
The MicroSight is n't the only gunsight technology that can overcome this problem , of course .
Telescopic sights magnify targets , bringing them into close , crisp focus .
And holographic sights project a red dot onto an image of the target , showing clearly where the shot will land .
But telescopic and holographic sights have their drawbacks .
For one thing , they tend to be bulky .
Both types of sight can add one or two pounds to the weight of a rifle — not a trivial concern for hunters or soldiers who must lug their weapons for miles over rough terrain .
Further , both are complex instruments with fragile components .
They can break , especially if dropped or banged against a rock or tree .
Red - dot sights require batteries , which can die .
And neither one is cheap : most red - dot sights cost more than $ 100 , and high - quality telescopic ones can run $ 1,000 or more .
Crandall recently demonstrated the MicroSight at an INL firing range .
Listen to a podcast about the event .
The MicroSight , on the other hand , is tiny — its zone plate is thin and only about a quarter - inch in diameter — and relatively cheap .
Crandall says the sight should cost significantly less than red - dot and telescopic sights when Apollo Optical Systems , which licensed the technology , takes it to market .
The company is currently working with gunsight manufacturers to design and develop various MicroSight versions .
In the future , some of these versions might add refractive power to the zone plate , achieving some level of target magnification .
The MicroSight could improve the accuracy of serious target shooters , who cannot use telescopic or holographic sights in competitions .
The technology could aid hunters and soldiers , too , either as a primary aiming reference or as a lightweight , inexpensive backup for other types of sights .
Crandall foresees other possible applications as well , such as in handguns and night - vision goggles .
In any situation that requires taking the long and the short view at the same time , this new INL technology could provide a clear edge .

An elementary school principal in Michigan is under investigation for authorizing a field trip last week for 30 black students to meet with an African - American rocket scientist .
Students who are not black were excluded from the outing -- a possible violation of a state law that bans racial favoritism in public schools .
" The district is investigating the allegations of violation of the State of Michigan Proposal 2 , " a spokeswoman for the Ann Arbor , Mich. , school district told FoxNews.com .
" There was no ill - intent or malice in the principal and teachers planning this field trip , " she added .
The principal , Mike Madison , who is black , said the trip was part of an effort to close the achievement gap between black and white students .
But some parents whose children were not included say it clearly was illegal .
The controversy began last week when the 30 students , members of an African - American academic support group , were taken to hear the rocket scientist , Alec Gallimore , speak at the University of Michigan , where he is an aerospace engineering professor and propulsion lab director .
The goal of the trip , Madison said , was to close test score gaps and inspire the students to consider careers in the sciences .
But parents of students who were excluded protested , and the children who went on the trip were booed by their classmates when they returned to school .
Earlier this week , Madison tried to quash the controversy by sending a letter home to parents , in which he wrote :
“ In hindsight , this field trip could have been approached and arranged in a better way .
" But as I reflect upon the look of excitement , enthusiasm and energy that I saw in these children ’s eyes as they stood in the presence of a renowned African American rocket scientist in a very successful position , it gave the kids an opportunity to see this type of achievement is possible for even them .
“ It was not a wasted venture , " he continued , " for I know one day they might want to aspire to be the first astronaut or scientist standing on the Planet Mars ....
“ The intent of our field trip was not to segregate or exclude students , as has been reported , but rather to address the societal issues , roadblocks and challenges that our African - American children will face as they pursue a successful academic education here in our community . ”
But Madison 's explanation only fueled the controversy , and parental complaints turned into allegations that the school had violated Proposal 2 , a newly enacted Michigan law that bans racial preference in public schools .
" If it was directed , guided , organized by the school district , they cannot say they are doing a field trip today for blacks only , or for whites only , or for Hispanics only or for Asians only , " Leon Drolet , the former chairman of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative , told the Detroit Free Press .
But district spokeswoman Liz Margolis said that bridging the gap in test scores between white and black students was a serious issue that legitimized the trip .
Plus , she said , the field trip was paid for by a private donation .
" We do n't feel that it at all violates ( Proposal 2 ) , but frankly , as with any group of students , if we identify a group of students that need support , we would be addressing that , " Margolis told the Free Press .
" But we also have to have better education for our parents so they know why it 's being done , " she said .
A parent - teacher meeting to discuss the issue is scheduled for Thursday night .
A female employee of the Marc Jacobs store on Mercer Street in SoHo received a package from California that contained cocaine — but she called the cops because she thought it was anthrax .
The FBI was called to the scene , and after investigating the package , concluded it was a local matter and turned the case over to the NYPD .
After running a test , cops determined the substance was cocaine , and took the employee in for questioning .
“ It appears to have been a huge mix - up , ” says our source .
“ The girl has no idea why she was sent it .
The cops are looking into whether it was intended for someone else in the building .
But she was not happy with how she was treated by the police and is considering filing charges . ”
The employee was not charged .
A rep for Marc Jacobs had no comment , while a manager at the store hung up .

DETROIT ( Billboard ) - Former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters is taking “ The Wall ” on the road this fall for a historic 36 - date North American tour starting September 15 in Toronto .
The trek will wrap December 13 in Anaheim , Calif .
The 1979 concept album has been performed only 31 times in concert -- by Pink Floyd in a handful of cities in 1980 - 81 , and by Waters with an all - star cast in July 1990 to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall the year before .
Waters , who played Pink Floyd ’s other opus “ The Dark Side of the Moon ” in its entirety during a 2007 - 08 trek , will reportedly take “ The Wall ” to Europe in 2011 , but no dates have yet been announced .
The tour will feature a 240 - foot - wide and 35 - foot - tall wall constructed and torn down as the show progresses .
Other props and special effects are expected to be part of the show .
Released in November 1979 , “ The Wall ” was a semi-autobiographical work revolving around a disaffected musician named Pink facing an existential personal crisis .
It spent 15 weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart , while the single “ Another Brick in the Wall , Part II ” also topped the charts .
A 1982 feature version starred Bob Geldof .
Since we launched Steam for the Mac a little over a week ago , one of the biggest complaints we have gotten is that we put game content into a " Steam Content " subfolder in the Documents folder .
This interferes with how many of our users backup their files , who want to be able to back up their entire Documents folder with Time Machine , Dropbox , or some other software , but who do not want to back up all of their game content .
Additionally , many users simply do n't like seeing files they do n't directly interact with in such a visible location .
So we thought we'd take a moment to tell you why we decided on the Documents folder in the first place , and what we plan to do about it .
Our original inclination was to put game content under " ~/ Library / Application Support / Steam " , along with the other support files Steam uses .
The problem is that uninstalling an application is meant to be as simple as dragging it from the Applications folder into the Trash .
However , uninstalling Steam this way will leave all of your game content on the drive , which could easily be quite a few gigabytes of wasted space .
Our solution was to put the content in a very visible and often used location so users could easily find and delete the game data if they did n't want it anymore .
That 's right , we chose the Documents folder specifically because it was visible and often used -- the very reasons users do n't want it there .
We 've taken your emails and forum posts to heart , and we 've come up with a different solution for users who uninstall Steam .
We are working on adding a feature to Steam to detect when you drag it to the Trash , and ask you if you want to delete your game content files as well .
This will allow us to put your game content in an non-intrusive location .
In an ideal world we would let you choose where the game content files are located , and in the long term that is a goal of ours , but due to architectural issues with our engine this is not as trivial as it may sound .
As soon as the feature to help users uninstall Steam completely when they drag it to the Trash is complete , we will be moving the game content folder into " ~/ Library / Application Support / Steam " .

French outrage over photo of man wiping his bottom on the tricolour flag
Its aim was to shock .
And this prize - winning photograph of a man wiping his derriere with the French flag has certainly succeeded .
So outraged is the French government that ministers are demanding the artist behind it is punished - even if the law needs to be changed to do so .
Justice Minister Michèle Alliot - Marie said ' criminal proceedings should be launched against this unacceptable act ' .
Sacre bleu !
The French government is demanding the prosecution of a man photographed wiping his bottom on the national flag
She added : ' Presumably the law can punish such an intolerable act against the French flag ?
If the existing law is not strong enough , then it should be revised . '
The photograph was taken on a public street in France by an unnamed artist and entered for a competition organised by a department store in Nice .
It was praised by judges and won a special mention in the ' politically incorrect ' category .
It was later published in a newspaper - to widespread disgust .
Eric Ciotti , an MP from the ruling UMP party , said : ' The image is utterly offensive and should be removed .
' I want the person who committed this outrage to be punished , and possibly those who published it too . '
He said he had received complaints - from French war veterans - while members of the public - told him the photographer should go to prison .
But Eric de Mongolfier , the Nice prosecutor , said the image did not constitute an offence because it was produced in a ' creative spirit ' .
Frederic Vezard , editor of the Metro newspaper which published the photograph , said : ' It is a question of knowing what the limits of art , provocation and freedom of speech are . '
' Insulting ' the French flag or the national anthem during a publicly organised event is punishable by up to six months in prison and a fine of £ 7,000 .

The fresh exodus of 400 families from the towns comes nearly three months after a massive counterinsurgency operation , involving thousands of Afghan and foreign troops .
While concluding the offensive , the troops said the districts had been cleared of the Taliban militants , allowing thousands of families to return to their homes .
However , residents complain the security situation has further deteriorated in the wake of Operation Mushtarak .
The people say they do not venture out of their houses to avoid being attacked by the fighters and security forces .
" We are under threat from the Taliban for cooperating with foreign troops , " said Haji Aminullah , a Marja resident .
He added they had never confronted such a situation over the past 30 years .
" We have trenches around us , set up by the rebels and foreign troops .
As a result , we are confined to our homes , " he said .
The resident also grumbled about parched crops that could not be watered .
Another resident , Sahib Khan , who recently arrived in Lashkargah from Marja , said innocent people were being killed in clashes on a daily basis .
" Taliban are asking us why we are working on projects , funded by foreigners or the Afghan government , " he said , accusing the fighters of carrying out attacks on troops from their houses .
" In retaliation , international soldiers hit our houses . "
An official of the Afghan Red Crescent Society ( ARCS ) accused the militants of attacking troops from civilian houses .
Speaking to Pajhwok Afghan News on the condition of anonymity , he alleged foreign troops had also been targeting civilian houses .
He went on to blame the NATO soldiers for failing to protect ordinary citizens during operations against militants .
" Under these circumstances , a large number of families have fled their houses , migrating to Lashkargah , " the official said .
ARCS provincial head Dr. Ahmadullah also confirmed the arrival of fresh families in the provincial capital .
" We have registered 256 such families , " he revealed .
The official explained most of the displaced families had been living with their relatives and a new call had been issued to the international community for assistance .
An official responsible for refugee affairs in the province , Haji Ghulam Farooq Noorzai , said 10 families arrived daily in Lashkargah .
Linking the displacement to frequent clashes , bomb blasts , search operations and threats from the Taliban , he said they had so far registered 379 families .
The American troops based in the region had distributed cards to local people to distinguish them from the Taliban , he said .
But the guerrillas have warned the people against accepting the cards .
Mass Effect 2 was brilliant .
So brilliant that we awarded it a ten out of ten review score .
But , as we all know , no game is perfect .
Here , in a special retrospective , BioWare lead producer Casey Hudson looks back at the game that redefined the action role - playing genre , discussing with VideoGamer.com what went right and what went wrong with the studio's epic science fiction adventure .
Q : Thanks for talking with us Casey .
Mass Effect 2 received pretty much universal acclaim .
It 's even managed some ten out of ten review scores .
Did the team know it would be received so well ?
Casey Hudson : I think it 's tied for the second highest Metacritic of all time .
Q : Did you think it had a chance at that ?
How did you feel about that ?
CH :
Well you can never really predict how a game is going to be reviewed but we knew that ...
I mean the first Mass Effect was really well received .
We knew this one was a lot better .
We thought it was .
So , that 's really the best we could do , is improve in every way that we are aware of based on our feedback and what we want to do .
Q : Were there any aspects of the game or specific features that could have ended up better ?
CH : Well , really when we release a game ... we wo n't release a game unless we 're happy with everything .
It does n't mean we wait until everything is perfect .
But we wait until we know that we 're comfortable with everything .
But there 's a difference though in that than when you turn it over to millions of people who play it and come to a consensus about different aspects of it .
That 's where you learn a lot about how the game plays from fresh eyes .
So with the benefit of feedback and hindsight there are things we would change which will therefore become part of the design for the next game .
Q : Any areas you have identified ?
CH : Yeah .
Obviously there 's a lot of great , really positive feedback .
But the stuff I think people have commented on that we 'll take to the future are things like the amount of emphasis we had on mini- games , the mining mini-game .
Obviously the game being really well received I think reinforces the decisions we made in terms of the way the interface works and the inventory , stuff like that .
But there are a lot of people that were happy with the amount of depth that was there , but people that wanted to see it as an RPG versus an action RPG or whatever , I think felt that it needed more depth in terms of your choices for inventory and stuff like that .
That 's certainly something we can do in the future .
We can only create a balance that we believe makes sense .
Q : You can't please everyone of course .
If you make Mass Effect a more accessible cover based shooter , the hardcore RPG fans start moaning .
But then if you had n't done that , others would moan about something else .
Does it do your head in trying to cope with everyone 's demands ?
CH :
What it means is we have to really think about how we interpret feedback .
Quite often feedback that appears to be conflicted is , if you think about it , quite often both sides are right , and there 's a way to resolve those things in a way that both sides can be right .
So in terms of the inventory issue , for example , I do n't think anyone 's arguing that the changes to the interface and whatnot were not good .
It comes down to kind of a separate thing which is , it 's always good to have a better interface that 's easier and more intuitive and whatnot .
But a separate question is how much depth is in there once you do that .
We had a lot of depth there , but there 's more that we can do .
Q : You mentioned the mining mini-game .
I found that strangely therapeutic , almost addictive , despite how long it took .
CH :
The feedback we had prior to releasing the game was generally exactly that .
It was like , ' It 's strangely addictive .
It 's kind of therapeutic ' .
But there were different personality types , too .
And one of the personality types that we had n't encountered was there were a lot of people that when they know that they can go and get resources through something like that , they literally want to mine the entire galaxy that night .
And then , yeah , when you spend eight hours in a mini- game , it does become ... there 's only so much too it .
And we never expected that it'd be played that way .
We thought people would noodle in it a bit , get a few resources to get an upgrade , and then go back and do the rest of the game .
Q : Are you ditching it completely for the third game ?
CH : No .
Again , when you look at the feedback , there are things that people liked about it , and functionally it serves a purpose .
I do n't think there 's a problem with any of those .
I think it 's the way people relied on it , and the way we relied on it maybe too much in parts of the story .
And also just when you think about the speed of it .
Q : I remember when I got the upgrade that made the scanning reticule faster , it felt like the greatest upgrade I 'd ever got in a game , because it cut so much time out of the process .
Another observation I had was that I did n't identify with a singular evil bad guy .
There was the leader of the Collectors , but I did n't identify with him in the same way I identified with Saren from the first game .
I also felt like the end boss came out of nowhere .
Is that feedback you 've found elsewhere ?
Are you taking that on board ?
CH :
We were happy with the way it came together .
Structurally it was a different kind of story .
There are good things about the way that structure worked .
It was kind of tied in with the fact that we had a suicide mission story , and that allowed us to make the character stories part of the main plot .
Even if their loyalty mission is something that 's not combat - oriented or whatever , it could be something that affects the way the whole mission goes in the end .
The fact that there 's all mystery around that end mission is really a cornerstone for the whole structure of the story .
But it also means that when you reveal the mystery , there 's always a risk in holding a mystery until the end and then revealing it .
For a lot of people they love the ending .
It just comes down to different types of players and personality types .
One of the reasons why we made an ensemble cast of characters is because we know everybody identifies with different people .
We do n't even know who the most popular characters are .
But even more importantly , for every different kind of person , there are different kinds of people in the game that you identify with , and they become your best pal in the game .
Q : Of the party members , who worked best and who worked least well ?
CH : For me it was one that a lot of people say they did n't like , which is Jack .
And for a reason that is opposite from what a lot of people say about her .
A lot of people want to think the worst and they 'll say , ' Oh she 's a marketing gimmick ' .
For me she is totally the opposite .
I think she was one of the most authentic characters .
I know people liked her .
She has her guard up , and the reason she has her guard up is because on the inside she is afraid .
If you ever get to that soft inside , she 's revealed something sensitive to you that you do n't want to hurt .
It 's an interesting dynamic that I think comes across in a really authentic way if you 're open to that being a real character .
Q : That 's interesting .
CH :
But there are people who are totally in love with Miranda .
She was a simpler character I think , but a lot of people really responded to her .
I 'm always amazed at the way people respond to different characters .
One of the most reproduced moments in fan art that I 've seen is characters female Shepard with Garrus in the end of their romance .
It 's not even a love scene .
They kind of hug and put their heads together .
Obviously for a lot of people that meant a lot to them because there are hundreds and hundreds of paintings out there that people have done of that moment that they 're sharing .

An Everett man who may have been on drugs was scaring women and children at the corner of Broadway and Cross streets on April 28 , police said .
When police approached Derek J. Goodwin , 29 , as he sat in the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Broadway , Goodwin allegedly told them , " You are dismissed I do n't recognize your authority . "
Police said Goodwin was irritated , slurred his speech and had pin pointed pupils .
When Officer Richard Lavey asked Goodwin his name , Goodwin allegedly said , " My name is Cheesy Beef Burrito . "
As Goodwin spoke , food was shooting out of his mouth , police said .
Police said Goodwin then stood up and started yelling at workers and customers , " Cheesy beef burrito , cheesy beef burrito . "
Goodwin tipped over chairs and a table in KFC as police tried to cuff him .
Police were originally called to Broadway and Cross street by a Department of Public Works employee who allegedly saw Goodwin scare a woman and child as they boarded a bus .
Goodwin then rap up to the employee , who was operating a mini street sweeper , and banged on the windshield .
Goodwin was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct .
Argentinian Politician's Proposal For New Anti-Plagiarism Law Plagiarizes Wikipedia

Britxardo alerts us to an amazingly ironic story coming out of Argentina .
It seems that an elected politician there , Gerónimo Vargas Aignasse , has introduced some new legislation against plagiarism ( Google translation of the original ) .
It seems odd enough that he would be outlawing plagiarism ( here in the US plagiarism is socially shunned , and could cost you your job , but is n't against the law unless it also reaches the point of copyright infringement , which is different ) , and it 's made even worse by the fact that it looks like he 's confusing plagiarism with copyright infringement -- noting in the explanation of the bill that " plagiarism " is harming the recording industry .
But that 's not the ironic part .
As unbelievable as it may seem , it appears that the text Vargas Aignasse used to explain the bill was plagiarized straight from Wikipedia ( Google translation of the original ) .
Seriously .
And not just a little bit .
The first three paragraphs of the Spanish Wikipedia page on plagiarism areto three paragraphs in the explanation of the bill Just to make sure someone did n't do the opposite and take the text of the introduction and make it the Wikipedia page , I looked , and as I 'm typing this , the Wikipedia page has n't been updated since April -- and it looks like the bulk of that page has actually been in place for quite some time .
The bill was introduced on May 6th .
It 's difficult to think of anything more ironic than introducing a bill that calls for " imprisonment from three to eight years " for plagiarism ... that plagiarizes the explanation for that bill .
It 's out and out plagiarism too .
The three paragraphs look to be copied completely , and no effort is made to identify the source .
It 's also a bit weird that the text from Wikipedia -- which is basically just a definition of plagiarism -- is being used as the explanation of the bill .
Nowhere does it describe why it's a problem or why it requires stringent jailtime .
But , perhaps that 's something Vargas Aignasse can ponder while serving three to eight years in prison for violating the law he just introduced ... with the law he just introduced .

Thank you for you interest in the survey .
An overview of results is available here , with some initial analysis here .
There are those days when you just want something cold and sweet to drink .
And then there are those days when you 'd like it boozy as well .
And in milkshake form .
With bacon .
All hail the arrival of the Pigshake , the new bacon - and - ice - cream boozy mash - up , now available off - menu at Flash 's .
We know — the thought of throwing some thick , ice - cold vanilla ice cream and a handful of salty , crispy smoked bacon chunks together in a blender ( along with some bacon fat and molasses to thicken the pot ) seems to violate some dinner - dessert - shake rule set long ago , probably by the mystics who built Stonehenge .
But rules were meant to be broken , in this case by some rogue bartender - warriors at Flash 's ( who luckily are n't too familiar with Stonehenge ) .
These renegades combine all of the above with plenty of Captain Morgan spiced rum , pour it into a chilled wine glass , and finish the whole thing off with some maple syrup to complete the sweet and savory frozen concoction .
It 's the kind of cold treat you 'll want to look to next time you 're relaxing in the Back Bay , with the sun burning high in the sky .
Your move , mudslide .

My story :
When our first child was born , the cards congratulated us on the arrival of our little bundle of joy .
I do n't recall any cards describing a little bundle of vomit , diarrhoea , rashes , phlegm and germs , with a temperature that goes up and down faster than a kangaroo on poppers .
Somewhere near the top of the long list headed " Things They Don't Tell You About Parenthood " is the fact that even perfectly healthy young children get ill with astonishing regularity .
When both parents are working , this is a source of constant stress and hassle – not just for their parents , but for their employers and colleagues as well .
Among the myriad unspoken assumptions about gender roles in our modern world , one of the most stubborn is that it is the mother who will suddenly drop everything in order to care for a sick child .
My partner is a teacher , and so cannot easily call in absent or rush home .
But I work flexible hours – it is rare that my appointment diary cannot be cleared in an emergency .
I 'm also fortunate to work in the community and voluntary sector , which is female - dominated and relatively family - friendly .
Even then , I expect to see a raised eyebrow or hear a note of surprise if I take unplanned time off to care for a sick child .
Men just do n't do such things .
I shudder to think what the reaction must be for those based in a more traditionally male environment .
My recommendation :
If we accept that it is desirable for this gender divide to be broken down , there are some legislative changes that could help drive social change .
At present either parent can take unpaid time off to care for sick dependants in an emergency , but it would be humane to expect employers to pay for the first day or two at least .
Otherwise it will always make financial sense for the lower - paid parent ( too often the woman ) to take the pay cut .
I 'd also suggest that employers are obliged to fully inform employees of their rights in this area – too many people are unaware of where they stand .

My story : I have a son who is 11 years old and has Down 's syndrome .
When we adopted him , he was of primary school age and went to a special school .
It seemed to go well , but we felt he was n't being stretched educationally or socially .
We decided to place him in a mainstream school , with one - to - one help .
This started out fine , and we believed he was integrating and performing well .
Then we received stories of bad behaviour , defiance and even violence .
One mother accused our son of putting his hands around another child 's throat .
I accept our boy is no angel , but we felt that some of the parents had set out to get him removed either through fear or ignorance , of which there still is a great deal when it comes to Down 's syndrome .
We moved our son again , this time to another special school .
It 's a good establishment with many sympathetic teachers and helpers .
Specialists tell us that children with Down 's syndrome learn pretty much all they will by the age of 11 ; if that 's true , we have less than a year to get him to a level where his English and maths will serve him well in his adult life .
The main problem with his current school is the classes , which are a mix of children with moderate to severe learning difficulties .
So far this year , my son has been hit by a flying chair twice and bitten several times .
It 's not the school 's fault , it 's a numbers game – too many statemented children , and not enough places .
Despite everything , I love my son as much as any parent loves their children .
To hear him read , to see him smile , to watch him play , makes me a very proud dad , and I would n't swap that feeling for anything .
My recommendation :
Our son is a bright boy , but getting his education right has n't been easy .
We believe our son could be educated in a mainstream school , but are convinced the support is n't there , or the assistants not properly trained .
Dealing with children with special needs is only an option for those taking NVQ teaching assistant courses .
Perhaps it should be a compulsory module , as it's a fair bet they will encounter statemented children some time in their working lives .
Special schools should also have staffing levels increased .
The severely disabled would get the attention they need , while the milder cases such as our son would also benefit .
I accept this costs money , but if my son was to get a job after his schooling , he would pay it back in taxes – everyone wins .

My story : Some years ago my marriage disintegrated .
It became a matter of when rather than whether I was going to leave .
So how was I to keep up with my two children ?
No matter how much my ex-wife intellectually accepted that it was for the good for the children to maintain contact , reality proved to be different .
I hung on as long as I could , so that they were at least well into their teenage years and could form their own independent opinion of me .
Once I left , I did n't press for formal arrangements to be made for visiting , but relied instead on contact by mobile phone and internet , supplemented by whatever arrangements could be made for trips out with them .
This worked fine with my son .
He 's the elder , and he had by then figured that the marriage was n't going to last .
By the time I left , we could already chat about life , the universe and everything in between , and not much changed .
My daughter was a bit younger and was fairly hostile for a few years .
I kept lines of communication open , did n't hold it against her , and waited .
The change , when it came , was sudden .
Soon after her A - levels , she and her mother had a massive row , and she moved out to stay with friends .
When I learned what had happened , I phoned her and very gently asked : " Would you like to tell me all about it ? "
It was the decisive moment – she had expected me to tell her off , and here I was being nice and listening instead .
My recommendation :
If you break up , know your rights so that you can fight for access if you have to .
But if you can manage a tolerable arrangement without making a battle of it , there is more chance of getting it to stick .
Most important , do n't give up on talking to your children .
Even if they are hostile , it is amazing what an occasional phone call can do to implant in their minds the idea that you do care really .
They will remember it .

My story : I may be a man , but Charlotte Church , Myleene Klass and I have a great deal in common .
I like a sing - song , I 'd look great in a bikini , and we all became parents within a few months of each other .
But when I read an interview with Church shortly after the arrival of our first bundle of joy , I realised we were n't exactly singing from the same hymn sheet : " It 's like she 's always been here .
I felt a bit weepy the other day because I looked at her , and she looked so lush and I thought about the birth and it was so perfect , so it was just with happiness . "
Well , I looked at our three - month - old and thought about chucking him through a window .
The birth was so far from perfect , and I thought I may be suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
I had almost every single one of the listed symptoms of postnatal depression .
So thank goodness for Myleene , the unlikely voice of reason : " I 'm not going to sugarcoat it , everyone says ' Oh , our baby brought us closer together ' , but it did n't bring us closer together initially .
It made me think ' Oh God , what have we done ! '
Sleep deprivation plays a big part .
The responsibility is huge . "
This was a reality I could identify with .
Recent estimates put postnatal depression in new fathers as high as one in four , but the untold reality of total exhaustion , relationship strain and culture shock is near universal .
But it passes .
In my case , it was n't medication that I needed but a good night 's sleep and the realisation that some of my feelings were normal .
Having a newborn child is just brain - meltingly hard at times .
With sleep returned some sanity .
Day by day I got used to this new reality and worked through mine and my wife 's roles in it .
We even have another child now .
My recommendation : Nothing does prepare you for fatherhood but I could n't make a single NHS ante-natal class , I never met a health visitor , and received not one piece of formal advice on this monumental life change .
Whether I was suffering from depression or just knackered and shell - shocked , the NHS does nothing to guide fathers through those killer early months .
It does provide midwives , health visitors , antenatal classes , home visits , checkups , scans and postnatal support for mothers .
These are all important , but while fathers are welcome to engage in this , none of it is aimed at them .
I 'd like to see fathers given legal protection to attend antenatal classes and at least one aimed exclusively at their questions .

My story :
By the time our children were two and five , I 'd been working on a career for about 10 years and my wife had defaulted into the role of full - time mother .
With the children developing a degree of independence , she began to regain a certain autonomy .
For me , fatherhood was restricted to making money and helping in the evenings and at weekends .
One night , my wife initiated a conversation .
She told me that she loved me , but that the future she saw for herself was not one she looked forward to .
Her problem was not with me as a person , but with the way our marriage had locked us into lives that prevented us thriving together .
Fighting the people our marriage had made us into could only happen because my wife identified and articulated the problem .
She 's strong , and that strength was given focus by feminist theory that gave her permission to require of herself more than a future of domesticity .
Likewise , if I had not read parts of The Second Sex I 'd have had a hard time framing my responsibilities .
For me , one of Simone de Beauvoir 's critical insights is that freedom is meaningless unless it can be made concrete : freedom has to be realisable .
For us , being truly equal partners in marriage was not attainable through attempts to redistribute our day - to - day responsibilities more equally , but from a complete redistribution of power – we needed a revolution .
My wife applied for a job in the US ( she 's American ) and got it .
I resigned my job and we emigrated and I looked after our youngest child at home for nine months before finding work .
It was only with this wholesale reconfiguration of the practical constraints on what motherhood and fatherhood could be that our marriage could become an expression of , rather than an obstacle to , our mutual love .
Looking back , we discovered together that heterosexual marriage is an institution that configures relationships between people in a way that is inherently conservative .
Without active resistance , married heterosexuals will find their lives defaulting into more or less unequal and predictable roles .
My recommendation : Remember that fatherhood in heterosexual marriage is as much a commitment to resisting obvious behaviours as to loving someone .
Steve Hill ( aka SteveHill )
My story :
In 2003 , at nearly 50 and widowed after 27 years together in a childless marriage , I quit a City career and a Hampstead chatterer home life and fled to the Cotswolds to lick my wounds and set up a hobby business – music , my first love .
I had a cottage for one and no thought of local schools or any such nonsense .
In October 2006 , I amazingly became father to a daughter , and in 2008 to a son .
Now " semi-retired " , I entered the bewildering , bizarre , breathtaking , beautiful world of babydom and pretty much became a stay - at - home parent .
After some initial qualms – surely it must be someone else 's job to change nappies ?
– I rolled my sleeves up .
I 'm used to long hours , but I 've always needed seven or eight hours of sleep a night .
Nothing prepares you for going on four years of sleep deprivation .
We do n't do Gina Ford 's Contented Little Parent book : if a child cries we see whether anything is wrong .
They probably take advantage , a bit .
I am acutely aware that my 30 - something self , able to stay up all night , has given way to a 50 - something who can't .
I explain this to my 30 - something wife .
I learn discretion is the better part of valour : she 's tired too .
And , of late , she 's also working .
It 's odd being the balding old fart on the pre-school run among mums 20 years younger .
Without a child on my arm , I would feel extremely undressed .
But I would n't change anything .
Poppy and Olly , for when you Google this : I love you to bits .
My recommendation : Compared to my parents ' generation – and talking to other fathers I do n't feel are exceptional – we seem to have come a long way .
Is there further to go ?
I guess so .
The social life for " househusbands " is curious when surrounded by other mums arranging pamper evenings with a beautician for school funds – not for me , thanks !
And I sometimes wonder if they really want a bloke around if they set up a coffee morning , or arrange a kids ' playdate .
Maybe we 've all got a little further to go ?
That said , I want what other parents do : the best for all our kids .
They say it takes a village .
The village includes men .

It does not stalemate as much as traditional 5 CP maps on public servers , and uses height more than most 5 CP maps .
The map comes off the heels of my other 5 CP map that has made it into many leagues .
I consider Indulge to be a refinement of my experience on cp_follower , and playtesting has shown the map has a lot of variation and strategies .
The development cycle was long , and there was plenty of time for anyone who wished to submit their feedback .
I listened to everyone , even if they did present things that were n't implemented .

A Brooklyn attorney hopes to break new ground this week when he offers a brain scan as evidence that a key witness in a civil trial is telling the truth , Wired.com has learned .
If the fMRI scan is admitted , it would be a legal first in the United States and could have major consequences for the future of neuroscience in court .
The lawyer , David Zevin , wants to use that evidence to break a he - said / she - said stalemate in an employer - retaliation case .
He 's representing Cynette Wilson , a woman who claims that after she complained to temp agency CoreStaff Services about sexual harassment at a job site , she no longer received good assignments .
Another worker at CoreStaff claims he heard her supervisor say that she should not be placed on jobs because of her complaint .
The supervisor denies that he said anything of the sort .
So , Zevin had the coworker undergo an fMRI brain scan by the company Cephos , which claims to provide " independent , scientific validation that someone is telling the truth . "
Laboratory studies using fMRI , which measures blood - oxygen levels in the brain , have suggested that when someone lies , the brain sends more blood to the ventrolateral area of the prefrontal cortex .
In a very small number of studies , researchers have identified lying in study subjects ( . pdf ) with accuracy ranging from 76 percent to over 90 percent .
But some scientists and lawyers like New York University neuroscientist Elizabeth Phelps doubts those results can be applied outside the lab .
" The data in their studies do n't appear to be reliable enough to use in a court of law , " Phelps said .
" There is just no reason to think that this is going to be a good measure of whether someone is telling the truth .
General fMRI data from research has been used in sentencing , but an individual 's brain scan has yet to be entered as evidence in a civil or criminal trial to help the jury determine whether someone was telling the truth .
Individual fMRI evidence was offered in at least one other case by a San Diego attorney defending a father accused of sexual abuse , but the evidence was eventually withdrawn and did not make it into the record .
But this case could be different , said Ed Cheng , a professor of law at Brooklyn Law School who may serve as a consultant to the plaintiff .
" It 's not like the sex abuse stuff that was going on in San Diego .
You can imagine that the case was in many ways a whole lot more complicated .
There 's a good reason to believe that the research studies do n't port to the sex abuse case .
But they port much better here , " Cheng said .
" This is a witness who arguably does n't have much at stake .
It 's not a criminal case . "
But Phelps strenuously disagrees .
She calls attention to the fact that the brain scan was done four years after the witness allegedly heard the CoreStaff manager 's remarks about the plaintiff .
But even in the best of circumstances , Phelps argues that fMRI evidence should not be allowed in court , even if there are at least two companies peddling the service to the legal profession .
" I always come down hard on these companies that are selling it , " she said .
" But these companies are going ahead and making claims already , based on some data that 's not so great , that they can do things that they can't really do . "
Cheng does not see the fMRI evidence in the same light .
Humans , he pointed out , are terrible lie detectors and yet our legal system is based on allowing them to make those determinations .
If slightly better than chance is the baseline , any improvement on that could be a reason to allow the evidence into court .
" The validation studies may have some problems , " he said .
" But if we can help the jury make this decision even a little bit better , it 's hard to defend keeping this stuff out . "
The latest attempt to use fMRI lie-detection evidence is sure to spark a contentious debate in court over whether the brain scans meet the standard for scientific evidence in New York , which is known as the Frye standard .
To clear the bar , the evidence must be " generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community . "
If Phelps is considered to be in the relevant scientific community – and she is – slipping past Frye may be difficult .
On the other hand , fMRI has become a well - accepted and oft - used tool for brain researchers over the last decade .
And of course , whether the evidence gets in wo n't just affect Cynette Wilson 's case .
Due to legal precedence , if fMRI brain scans are allowed in once , they 'll be more likely to be used in more trials down the line .
" Once you have precedent , it 's much harder to keep it out , " Phelps said .
" They 've yet to get it admitted as evidence .
So every time it comes up , it 's very important that it does n't get in . "
Beginning May 5 in the court room in Brooklyn , we 'll see another skirmish in what 's likely to be a long war over how fMRI machines should be deployed in pursuit of justice .
Cephos declined to comment on the open case .
Correction 11:16 pm EST : Ed Cheng teaches at Brooklyn Law School , not Brooklyn College .

Palm and HP seem like the happiest of corporate couples right now , but theirs was a heated courtship : according to Palm 's latest statement to shareholders , a total of 16 companies were contacted about a deal , and HP was the winner of a month - long bidding war that involved serious offers from five companies -- a bidding war that involved Jon Rubinstein personally warning HP that it had to " significantly and immediately " increase its offer to remain in the game .
What 's more , HP 's winning bid came in at just 20 cents a share more than its primary rival .

Here are the funniest moments of Conan O'Brien 's recent visit to Google 's Silicon Valley headquarters , including the comedian riffing on Google 's " entitled a - hole " staff — and a cutting impersonation of Jay Leno that apparently violated legal constraints .
One Googler last week uploaded short clips of the former Tonight Show host 's visit , but Google has subsequently released the full 48 minutes of footage .
We 've boiled down the best five minutes into the clip above .
In addition to joking about his friction with Leno and NBC , O'Brien riffed repeatedly on the arrogance of his well - paid , well - pampered host company .
The ribbing was good natured and fun , and it sounds like it killed with the audience , i.e. the target of the jokes .
But the digs about Google entitlement did well precisely because there 's been real concern inside the company about spoiled staffers ( see our prior coverage here and here , and our own take on Googler arrogance here ) .
Then there 's the other side of the coin , the cutbacks at Google , which inadvertently became fodder for an impromptu joke by O'Brien 's sidekick Andy Richter .
The Richter bit was well received , as were all of O'Brien 's ruthlessly funny digs at the company .
Like O'Brien himself , Googlers have had their unlikable , self - pitying moments in the spotlight .
But , also like the late - night host , they seem to have a sense of humor and perspective about their sorrows , and that humanity is ultimately what they 'll need to stay successful and keep growing .
Just like O'Brien .

You can't slip much past dedicated amateur astronomers .
A month after the United States Air Force launched its space plane , the X - 37B , under a veil of secrecy , backyard sky - watchers say they 've found it , along with clues to its mission .
Though the military still wo n't open up about what the classified X - 37B actually is , officers have been insistent about what it is n't : a space weapon .
Indeed , defense experts have guessed recently that the craft is testing next - generation spy satellite tech , and the observations back that up .
The amateur sky watchers have succeeded in tracking the stealthy object for the first time and uncovering clues that could back up the surveillance theory .
Ted Molczan , a team member in Toronto , said the military spacecraft was passing over the same region on the ground once every four days , a pattern he called “ a common feature of U.S. imaging reconnaissance satellites . ”
In six sightings , the team has found that the craft orbits as far north as 40 degrees latitude , just below New York City .
In theory , on a clear night , an observer in the suburbs might see the X - 37B as a bright star moving across the southern sky [ The New York Times ] .
In addition , the plane 's path would carry it over places the U.S. is interested in watching , like Iran , Pakistan , and North Korea , according to Greg Roberts , one of the astronomers to track the X - 37B .
More than uncovering its secret mission , he was interested in finding the plane because it was difficult .
Said Roberts :
" If the data were freely available , we would probably not have bothered with it .
I see little sense in tracking objects for which data is freely available .
It 's like reinventing the wheel .
So as long as there are missions with little or no information , I personally will be interested in the challenge of finding them " [ MSNBC ] .

Oil spill residue , Chenega , Alaska©1997 James Macalpine - PIF
With the Gulf Coast dying of oil poisoning , there 's no space in the press for British Petroleum 's latest spill , just this week : over 100,000 gallons , at its Alaska pipeline operation .
A hundred thousand used to be a lot .
Still is .
On Tuesday , Pump Station 9 , at Delta Junction on the 800 - mile pipeline , busted .
Thousands of barrels began spewing an explosive cocktail of hydrocarbons after “ procedures were n't properly implemented ” by BP operators , say state inspectors .
“ Procedures were n't properly implemented ” is , it seems , BP 's company motto .
Few Americans know that BP owns the controlling stake in the trans - Alaska pipeline ; but , unlike with the Deepwater Horizon , BP keeps its Limey name off the Big Pipe .
There 's another reason to keep their name off the Pipe : their management of the pipe stinks .
It 's corroded , it 's undermanned and “ basic maintenance ” is a term BP never heard of .
How does BP get away with it ?
The same way the Godfather got away with it : bad things happen to folks who blow the whistle .
BP has a habit of hunting down and destroying the careers of those who warn of pipeline problems .
In one case , BP 's CEO of Alaskan operations hired a former CIA expert to break into the home of a whistleblower , Chuck Hamel , who had complained of conditions at the pipe 's tanker facility .
BP tapped his phone calls with a US congressman and ran a surveillance and smear campaign against him .
When caught , a US federal judge said BP 's acts were “ reminiscent of Nazi Germany . ”
This was not an isolated case .
Captain James
Woodle , once in charge of the pipe 's Valdez terminus , was blackmailed into resigning the post when he complained of disastrous conditions there .
The weapon used on Woodle was a file of faked evidence of marital infidelity .
Nice guys , eh ?

Colus pusillus
[ Agaricomycetes > Phallales > Phallaceae > Colus . . . ]
by Michael Kuo
Is this thing cool , or what ?
Do n't bet the house on my identification , however ; the photos were sent to me from Australia in e-mails , and I have made my best guess , using a 30 - year - old source , without actually examining the mushrooms .
Normally , pages at this website represent North American mushrooms I have collected and / or studied -- but I 'm always willing to make exceptions for stinkhorns ( see Lysurus corallocephalus for an African example ) .
The fused arms that form a stem - like structure define the genus Colus , but species within the genus " are not clear cut , " according to stinkhorn expert D. M. Dring ( 1980 ) .
Colus hirudinosus is quite similar to Colus pusillus , and whether there is one variable species or several species with minor morphological differences is not clear .
As of 1980 , Colus pusillus was known from Australia , while Colus hirudinosus was documented from Europe , Africa , and the Caribbean .
Description :
Ecology : Saprobic ; growing alone or gregariously ; in woods or in cultivated areas ; year - round in tropical and subtropical areas ; possibly limited to Australia ( see above ) .
Fruiting Body : Initially a whitish " egg " up to 2 cm across , attached to white cords ; rupturing , with the stinkhorn emerging as a cage - like structure , 5 - 8 cm high , of about 10 corrugated , scarlet arms that are roughly triangular in cross-section and that fuse into a stem - like and slightly paler base composed of vertical columns ; the inner surfaces of the cage covered with foul - smelling , olive brown slime ; the egg tissue creating a whitish volva .
Microscopic Features : Spores 4.5-6 x 1.5 - 2 µ ; cylindrical ; smooth .

I have not collected this mushroom .
This site contains no information about the edibility or toxicity of mushrooms .
I 'm working on a completion ( intellisense ) facility for C# in emacs .
The idea is , if a user types a fragment , then asks for completion via a particular keystroke combination , the completion facility will use .NET reflection to determine the possible completions .
Doing this requires that the type of the thing being completed , be known .
If it 's a string , there 's a known set of possible methods and properties ; if it's an Int32 , it has a separate set , and so on .
Using semantic , a code lexer / parser package available in emacs , I can locate the variable declarations , and their types .
Given that , it 's straightforward to use reflection to get the methods and properties on the type , and then present the list of options to the user .
( Ok , not quite straightforward to do within emacs , but using the ability to run a powershell process inside emacs , it becomes much easier .
I write a custom .NET assembly to do reflection , load it into the powershell , and then elisp running within emacs can send commands to powershell and read responses , via comint .
As a result emacs can get the results of reflection quickly . )
The problem arrives when the code uses var in the declaration of the thing being completed .
That means the type is not explicitly specified , and completion wo n't work .
How can I reliably determine the actual type used , when the variable is declared with the var keyword ?
Just to be clear , I do n't need to determine it at runtime .
I want to determine it at " Design time " .
So far I have these ideas :
compile and invoke : extract the declaration statement , eg `var foo = " a string value " ; `
concatenate a statement `foo. GetType ( ) ;`
dynamically compile the resulting C# fragment it into a new assembly
load the assembly into a new AppDomain , run the framgment and get the return type .
unload and discard the assembly I know how to do all this .
But it sounds awfully heavyweight , for each completion request in the editor .
I suppose I do n't need a fresh new AppDomain every time .
I could re-use a single AppDomain for multiple temporary assemblies , and amortize the cost of setting it up and tearing it down , across multiple completion requests .
That 's more a tweak of the basic idea .
compile and inspect IL Simply compile the declaration into a module , and then inspect the IL , to determine the actual type that was inferred by the compiler .
How would this be possible ?
What would I use to examine the IL ?
Any better ideas out there ?
Comments ? suggestions ?
EDIT - thinking about this further , compile - and - invoke is not acceptable , because the invoke may have side effects .
So the first option must be ruled out .
Also , I think I cannot assume the presence of .
NET 4.0 .
UPDATE -
The correct answer , unmentioned above , but gently pointed out by Eric Lippert , is to implement a full fidelity type inference system .
It ;s the only way to reliably determine the type of a var at design time .
But , it 's also not easy to do .
Because I suffer no illusions that I want to attempt to build such a thing , I took the shortcut of option 2 - extract the relevant declaration code , and compile it , then inspect the resulting IL .
This actually works , for a fair subset of the completion scenarios .
For example , suppose in the following code fragments , the ? is the position at which the user asks for completion .
This works :
var x = " hello there " ; x.?
The completion realizes that x is a String , and provides the appropriate options .
It does this by generating and then compiling the following source code :
namespace N1 { static class dmriiann5he { // randomly - generated class name static void M1 ( ) { var x = " hello there " ; } } }
... and then inspecting the IL with simple reflection .
This also works :
var x = new XmlDocument ( ) ; x.?
The engine adds the appropriate using clauses to the generated source code , so that it compiles properly , and then the IL inspection is the same .
This works , too :
var x = " hello " ; var y = x.ToCharArray ( ) ; var z = y.?
It just means the IL inspection has to find the type of the third local variable , instead of the first .
And this :
var foo =
" Tra la la " ; var fred = new System.Collections .Generic.List < String > { foo , foo .
Length . ToString ( ) } ; var z = fred .
Count ; var x = z .?
... which is just one level deeper that the prior example .
But , what does n't work is completion on any local variable whose initialization depends at any point on an instance member , or local method argument .
Like :
var foo = this .
InstanceMethod ( ) ; foo .?
Nor LINQ syntax .
I 'll have to think about how valuable those things are before I consider addressing them via what is definitely a " limited design " ( polite word for hack ) for completion .
An approach to addressing the issue with dependencies on method arguments or instance methods would be to replace , in the fragment of code that gets generated , compiled and then IL analyzed , the references to those things with " synthetic " local vars of the same type .
Another Update - completion on vars that depend on instance members , now works .
What I did was interrogate the type ( via semantic ) , and then generate synthetic stand - in members for all existing members .
For a C# buffer like this :
public class CsharpCompletion { private static int PrivateStaticField1 = 17 ; string InstanceMethod1 ( int index ) { ... lots of code here ... return result ; } public void Run( int count ) { var foo = " this is a string " ; var fred = new System.Collections .Generic.List < String > { foo , foo .
Length . ToString ( ) } ; var z = fred .
Count ; var mmm = count + z + CsharpCompletion .PrivateStaticField1 ; var nnn = this .
InstanceMethod1 ( mmm ) ; var fff = nnn .? ... more code here ...
... the generated code that gets compiled , so that I can learn from the output IL the type of the local var nnn , looks like this :
namespace Nsbwhi0rdami { class CsharpCompletion { private static int PrivateStaticField1 = default ( int ) ; string InstanceMethod1 ( int index ) { return default ( string ) ; } void M0zpstti30f4 ( int count ) { var foo = " this is a string " ; var fred = new System.Collections .Generic.List < String > { foo , foo .
Length . ToString ( ) } ; var z = fred .
Count ; var mmm = count + z + CsharpCompletion .PrivateStaticField1 ; var nnn = this .
InstanceMethod1 ( mmm ) ; } } }
All of the instance and static type members are available in the skeleton code .
It compiles successfully .
At that point , determining the type of the local var is straightforward via Reflection .
What makes this possible is :
the ability to run powershell in emacs
the C# compiler is really fast .
On my machine , it takes about 0.5s to compile an in -memory assembly .
Not fast enough for between - keystrokes analysis , but fast enough to support the on - demand generation of completion lists .
I have n't looked into LINQ yet .
That will be a much bigger problem because the semantic lexer / parser emacs has for C# , does n't " do " LINQ .
Introduction
In evaluating the human condition , it is n't possible to overemphasize the significance of evolutionary theory .
This well - supported scientific theory influences our behavior in ways most of us can't begin to imagine .
This article explores how evolution provides answers to questions we might not otherwise think to ask .
In the past 150 years evolutionary theory has moved from being a philosophical curiosity to becoming a precondition for understanding human behavior .
There are certain aspects of our behavior that are easily explained and perfectly logical , while other aspects make no sense at all without the theoretical framework provided by evolution .
This article reveals our connection with evolution , and through that connection , with all life on earth .

When first discovered , antibiotics seemed to turn the tide against many historical infectious agents — they stopped tuberculosis ( TB ) , Bubonic Plague and other deadly ailments in their tracks .
These treatments appeared to represent an unqualified victory for modern medical practice .
But more recently , doctors have seen new bacterial strains spring up that cannot be treated with existing antibiotics , and a variety of TB now exists that is , for all practical purposes , incurable , and so dangerous that some individuals must be locked up to keep them from infecting others .
In a related development , hospitals have aggressively used multiple methods including antibiotics to control germs that would otherwise attack patients while they were in the hospital .
But those methods have backfired , and more Americans now die from hospital - borne Staph infections than from AIDS .
As things now stand , for many patients the hospital environment itself poses a greater risk than the disease they 're suffering from .
What 's going on ?
Are drug companies producing less effective drugs ?
Have doctors failed to prescribe antibiotics often enough ?
The answer to these questions is that we have n't been paying attention to the role played by evolution in this and all biological issues .
Here are some properties of evolution :
In response to environmental changes , organisms either adapt or become extinct .
The biological changes behind adaptation originate in random DNA mutations .
Most mutations are harmful and result in reduced fitness , but a minority happen by chance to meet new environmental challenges .
to meet new environmental challenges .
Organisms with beneficial mutations produce more offspring than those with harmful mutations until the fitter group represents the entire population , to be eventually replaced in a continuous process of adaptation .
The story of evolution is recorded in individuals and species that represent the best adaptation to their changing environments .
Evolution is not a gradual move from simple to complex , or from dumb to smart , but is a brutal filter that only notices survival and reproduction .
Evolution is not a plan , it is an algorithm , one in which random changes sometimes produce successful organisms by chance .
. Evolution has no final objective or end - point — it is not a means to an end , but a process .
In the evolutionary narrative , all species are temporary forms .
There are now incurable strains of TB , and dangerous Staph infections in hospitals , because the original infectious organisms evolved to meet the threat posed by antibiotics .
To be specific , the antibiotics killed all the bacteria except a tiny minority that happened to be resistant to antibiotics , and that minority eventually became the entire surviving bacterial population .
The TB and Staph stories are examples where , by ignoring a powerful , well - supported scientific theory , we have exposed ourselves to incredible danger .
Some people do n't understand evolution but are willing to learn its role in shaping the modern world , while others , by rejecting the very concept of evolution , proactively defend a breathtaking personal level of ignorance that must be witnessed to be believed .
Unfortunately for all of us , members of the latter group tend to sit on committees that decide what our children may learn in school .
Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel
About the time Darwin shaped his ideas about evolution , an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel was experimenting with pea plants and noticed certain predictable patterns of inheritance .
At that early stage in the history of evolution it could be said that Darwin recognized the consequences of adaptation at the species level , while Mendel witnessed the result of mixing particular genotypes , but neither saw the big picture or identified the source of genetic information .
The true significance , and relatedness , of Darwin's and Mendel 's work was not fully appreciated until long after their passing , in what is called the modern synthesis in biology , crafted between 1936 and 1947 .
Shortly thereafter Watson and Crick completed the picture by describing the structure of DNA .
It must be emphasized that the scientific evidence for evolution and natural selection is copious and widespread , and the above examples of quickly evolving bacterial strains , although headline news , are only representative of a large class of similar narratives .
As time passes , those who doubt the reality of evolution must ignore a greater corpus of evidence , and accept greater personal risk , in order to defend their ignorance .
Artificial Selection / Monocultures
People were manipulating genetic outcomes long before genetics was itself understood .
One example can be seen in dog breeding , where the wide variety of modern dog types were derived from the wolf by selective breeding .
Another example is the selective breeding of optimal strains of corn , wheat and soybeans to maximize their yield , robustness and resistance to pests .
The dark side of artificial selection can be seen in the story of the Irish Potato Famine .
In the 1800s Ireland became increasingly dependent on potatoes as a single crop to support its increasing population , and within that crop , a single genetic variety ( " lumpers " ) , with tragic consequences .
In retrospect it can be seen that , if a wider variety of potato strains had been allowed to exist , some of them would have been able to resist the blight that destroyed the entire crop for several successive years , resulting in about a million deaths by starvation .
The lesson of the Irish Potato Famine has yet to be learned .
Many modern agricultural strains , seemingly the best choice for a particular growing environment , are monocultures ( single genetic strains ) and therefore represent ticking biological time bombs .
One example is the widespread extinction of the U.S. corn monoculture in the 1980s , resulting in the loss of a billion dollars of agricultural output ( but no loss of life ) .
A hidden danger in modern agriculture is pressure to increase yields in order to feed growing populations , which can lead to dependence on a single optimal strain that produces the highest output per acre .
It seems we 've placed ourselves in the same position as the Irish of the 19th century , but because we understand what can happen , we have no excuse .
But the largest and potentially most tragic example of monoculture is the " Holocene extinction event " .
Although this sounds like one of those geological eras we identify by examining rock strata , the Holocene extinction event is happening now , and we are the cause — humans are selectively breeding ourselves in a way that excludes thousands of other species , and we are rapidly approaching a monoculture in which humans are the only surviving species .
When we look back at the Irish Potato Famine , it 's easy to say , " Wow , that was stupid !
How could those people not realize the risk they were taking in becoming more and more dependent on fewer and fewer biological species ? "
The unanswered question is whether we will recognize that we 're repeating the same mistake on a much larger scale .
Many people now accept that we are placing ourselves in danger by extinguishing all species but ourselves , but it 's much harder to figure out what to do about it .
Before my readers say , " That 's simple — all we have to do is reduce our numbers , " I have to say no , it 's not that simple .
Read on .
The Population Paradox
To briefly recapitulate the first part of this article , evolution is morally neutral and only notices what survives and reproduces , nothing else .
The evolution of distinctive traits , however much survival value they appear to have , cannot interfere with the bottom line , which is surviving offspring .
The absolute priority of reproductive fitness places firm limits on physical size , resistance to disease , visual acuity , or any other trait one can name , including intelligence .
Intelligence and Survival Evolution selects against overdesign — a physically large animal like a dinosaur may be able to dominate smaller creatures , but it can be ( and ultimately was ) outcompeted by smaller creatures who made up in number what they lacked in size .
A bird with extraordinarily acute eyesight will only prevail against other species if it can see a mouse other birds cannot see , otherwise the energy cost of maintaining its eyes will select against the trait .
Just as with physical size and visual acuity , intelligence has an upper practical limit , beyond which the trait reduces fitness and is selected against .
This is true at the level of species , but there is a version of this selection process in the lives of individuals that I call the " Population Paradox " .
The paradox works like this :

An intelligent , educated individual explains to his tribe that there are far too many human beings on the planet and that , by increasing our numbers , we risk our own safety and that of our children .
On hearing this information , the more intelligent , sensitive , caring listeners resolve to have fewer children .
On hearing the same information , the less intelligent , sensitive , caring listeners do n't change their behavior .
The result is fewer intelligent , sensitive , caring people in the next generation .
Yes , the Population Paradox really is as simple as that — to put it bluntly , people who care about the state of the planet are outcompeted by those who do n't .
( These facts can not be used as an excuse for irresponsible behavior , and we all must think and accept responsibility for our actions .
We just have to think more deeply . )
Transient Stupidity
Some readers may see what appears to be a flaw in the Population Paradox idea — there are some very intelligent people , those people have intelligent , healthy children at least some of the time , and this might stand as a counterexample to the paradox .
But because evolution 's absolute priority is reproduction , it performs an end run around intelligence and common sense — intelligent people continue to have children on a very overcrowded planet by temporarily becoming stupid , and this is not my idea , it 's an idea that has been put forth by many people including feminists .
One name for this syndrome is " pregnancy brain , " a temporary decline in reasoning and memory ability that accompanies pregnancy .
But this evolution - mandated drop in intelligence is by no means limited to women .
In my opinion and that of many others , we see its most extreme form in men , whose ability to reason plummets to near - zero around the topic of reproduction .
Consider two examples : Eliot Spitzer , former Governor of New York , former sanctimonious prosecutor , was discovered to have regularly engaged the services of prostitutes in an almost public way , and resigned in disgrace .
Some who hear this story are inclined to ask , " What was he thinking ? "
But that question includes an unwarranted assumption — that there was any measurable mental activity , at least above the equator .
Nadya Suleman , an unmarried , unemployed mother of six who lives on food stamps , decides six is n't enough and visits a fertility clinic .
The fertility clinic , in a breathtaking violation of the Hippocratic Oath , impregnates her eight times over , and all of them live .
As I see it , this is child abuse ipso facto — this woman 's 14 children are , for all practical purposes , orphans of an apparent clinical narcissist .
I can imagine future tell - all books in the tradition of Mommie Dearest , with memorable mommy - quotes like , " I really , truly , sincerely love you , number 11 . "
Consider two examples : Free Will
This section is meant to emphasize the fact that we have no chance to understand human behavior without first understanding evolution .
Evolution is such a powerful force in our lives that it offers a partial answer to the old question about the existence of free will : we may have free will in some parts of our lives , but as to procreation , we certainly do n't .
Some readers will see an obvious objection to the above claim — many people make intelligent decisions about reproduction , and this supports the possibility of free will in all areas of human life , even the most basic and instinctive parts .
I must agree that 's true , such things do happen , but by making intelligent decisions about reproduction , we remove ourselves from the gene pool .
Consider this example :
An intelligent person ( for this example a person possessed of an absurd degree of intelligence with no imaginable practical application ) sees a late - night advertisement that exhorts us to feed all the world 's starving children .
She responds to the advertisement by saying , " That 's absurd — a program to feed starving people , with no conditions or requirements ?
That can only lead to many more starving people in the future — how humane is that ?
Only the most superficial intellect could fail to see this program can only increase human suffering in the long term . "
She thinks a bit more and says , " If I choose not to feed those starving people , but proceed to have my own children , then I am a despicable racist and selfish hypocrite .
So for reasons of personal integrity I will not have any children . "
True to her word , our intelligent test subject does n't have any children .
After twenty years have gone by , we see another person watching another advertisement to feed all the world 's starving children .
Unencumbered by even a bit of extra intelligence , she says , " Yes !
I 'll show my compassion and humanity by feeding all those starving people ! "
Conclusion ?
Free will may exist in some areas , but as to reproduction issues , it does n't — we 're animals , as Freud said ( one of the few things he got right ) .
Placebo Environmentalism
The world is heating up — everyone can agree on that .
Now let 's just say for the sake of argument that this heating is at least partly caused by human activity ( I respect the views of those who disagree , but this is just an example and I do n't want to wander away from the topic ) and that the consequences of warming may be harmful , so what shall we do about it ?
Here are some recently proposed remedies : Scatter iron oxide on the oceans .
The iron oxide will support the growth of algae , which will sequester a lot of atmospheric CO 2 , the reduced CO 2 will decrease global warming .
, the reduced CO will decrease global warming .
Launch a bunch of tiny reflectors into Earth orbit .
The reflectors will bounce sunlight back into space , this will reduce the amount of sunlight that gets to the surface , this will reduce surface heating , which will cool the planet .
Spread huge reflective sheets across deserts .
The sheets will reflect more sunlight back into space than the sand can , this will reduce surface heating , that will decrease global warming .
There are many similar proposals , ranging from humorous to harebrained , but I ask my readers to notice what is missing from the list and from environmentalism in general — any discussion of world population .
To put this in the simplest terms , a warming world is a symptom , world hunger is a symptom , world wars and terrorism are symptoms — all symptoms of the underlying disease of overpopulation .
We can treat the symptoms , or we can treat the disease .
Reality Testing
It is one thing to see that we are emotional hostages of our own fertility , and to notice that discussions of population tend to be profoundly hypocritical ( it 's always " them " that have too many children ) , but it is quite another to refuse to even acknowledge the problem .
Environmental movements that do not address population treat symptoms while ignoring the underlying disease and have little reason to exist .
Every sanctimonious , green , save - the - whales , recycle - your - cans , wind and solar power movement that wo n't address population is as much a placebo ( a sham treatment with no real effect ) as giving a cancer patient a more comfortable pillow instead of surgery .
Imagine that all the well - intentioned , properly organized environmental causes succeed and our environmental impact is reduced to half its present level — half the oil , half the coal , half the nuclear power , etc . .
If we were to achieve that spectacular result , we would have to watch our victory be wiped out over the next 60 years as the world 's population doubles from its present level .
According to international population authorities and assuming the above optimistic environmental forecast , in 60 years we will find ourselves in exactly the same predicament , confronting the same problem we do now .
Does this sound pessimistic ?
Does it paint too bleak a picture ?
Well , no , not really .
According to Wikipedia 's article on population , " The last one hundred years have seen a rapid increase in population due to medical advances and massive increase in agricultural productivity made possible by the Green Revolution . "
Translated into everyday terms , before the Green Revolution children were starving , but the Green Revolution allowed those starving children to have children of their own , so now we have ... more starving children than there were before ( according to UNICEF , 10 million children under the age of five now starve annually ) .
What an accomplishment .
I should add that the Green Revolution depends to a large extent on monocultures and their attendant risks .
Within environmental causes , world population is the elephant in the room that no one cares to acknowledge .
There are several reasons for this — one is that environmentalists who discuss population quickly lose public support ( because people much prefer meaningless gestures to personal sacrifices ) .
Another is that there is little purpose in discussing population with people who can't imagine their role in the process .
A third reason is the perverse effect of the Population Paradox discussed above , in which open discussion of population issues only changes the composition of the future population , not its size .
But do n't despair , dear reader — there are ways to address these issues .
Read on .
A Modest Proposal
At this point in a typical essay , an author can be relied on to offer one or more hand - waving remedies for all the world 's problems .
But I do n't intend to insult the intelligence of my readers , and this article 's topic deserves a better , more realistic treatment .
Non-starters
First let 's dismiss things that can't possibly work or that have been tried and failed .
Racism and Eugenics are easy to dismiss because they pretend that we know more than nature and can substitute our own choices for those of evolution — if history teaches us anything , it is that we do n't , and we can 't .
Genetic Algorithms
Someone will surely object that the above represents a dismissal without substance , so in this digression I will give it a bit more depth .
When computer scientists attack a truly complex problem , they sometimes push the programmers out of the way and assign the problem to a " genetic algorithm " , a computer method that imitates natural evolution .
Well - designed genetic algorithms are very effective at solving complex problems and choosing optimal strategies , in ways that even their designers may not fully understand when the process is complete , just as with evolution in nature .
Traditional software design and problem - solving is organized top - down , that is to say , a broad statement of a problem to be solved is recursively broken down into subtasks .
But for many problems the top - down approach simply does n't work , and a genetic / evolutionary approach produces better results by attacking the problem in a less organized , more bottom - up way .
As the discipline of genetic programming has become better - established , its similarity to natural evolution has been recognized by many , indeed much of genetic programming is consciously imitative of natural evolution .
The key to the success of both natural and computer evolutionary algorithms is that all options are tested in parallel , without prejudgment , and the quality of the result depends on the algorithm 's impartiality .
To put this another way , the best evolutionary algorithms measure only results , not how the results are achieved .
It would be nice if human societies worked this way , but we are n't there yet .
Suffice it to say that impartial algorithms produce the best results .
Back to non-starters .
In deciding what to do about certain human problems and in my opinion , we should avoid assuming that our choices can stand in for those of nature .
This obviously can't work for all problems , but as to fundamental issues like the size of the human population , we need to stop assuming we can outwit nature .
Self - determination Readers may recall an earlier comment about a measurable decline in reasoning powers during pregnancy .
As it happens and for reasons of their own , some societies have assumed that women are always sort of stupid and their mental state during pregnancy is the norm for their gender .
Unfortunately for this viewpoint and its adherents , there is no evidence to support it — indeed , all available evidence points in a different direction .
In objective tests , women 's intellectual abilities are the same as those of men , and in some areas ( verbal reasoning and calculation , to name just two ) women score higher than men .
Courtesy Fertility and Education in WomenCourtesy The Population Reference Bureau
Is this issue germane to the topic of world population ?
You bet it is .
First , women are the fulcrum on which the population issue turns .
Second , in societies where they are free to speak out , women express a wish to control their fertility , and there is a strong worldwide correlation between womens ' social standing and educational attainments , and low fertility .
This means , when given a choice , women prefer smaller families , and the more intelligent and educated a woman is , the stronger this preference is .
Someone might object and ask if this idea collides with the Population Paradox — wo n't such intelligent , educated women with small families be outcompeted by others ( the " OctoMoms " of the world ) and disappear from the gene pool ?
Not if all women are guaranteed equal rights , equal educational opportunities , and equal access to fertility control measures .
Where those rights are in place , the educated , intelligent woman is n't outcompeted by anyone .
Another possible objection : is n't this idea of equal rights for women just another example where people try to impose something unnatural on nature ?
Well , no , for two reasons .
One , the present low standing of women is distinctly unnatural when compared to all of human history .
Two , evolution works better when more options are available — or " degrees of freedom " to use the engineering term .
This is n't a panacea ( there are n't any in nature ) , but it is a way for us to proactively coöperate with nature and respect her rules and methods .
This idea deserves to be given a chance , as do women .

Now for my all - time pet peeve , the imaginary dichotomy between geeky , nerdy , pocket - protector - wearing , socially inept mostly - males on the one hand , and poised , highly social , well - groomed , earth - mother mostly - females on the other .
There is no issue more influential in keeping women down than the imaginary divide between knowing how to think and knowing how to dance .
Geekophobia exemplifies the worst kind of sexism — the kind women volunteer for .
More words have been printed on this one issue than I care to re-read , but most make the same point — there are n't many women in mathematics , science and engineering , and no one knows why .
Those who offer theories about it tend to get it wrong , some falsely concluding that women have no aptitude for math and science .
This commonly heard position suffers from a minor defect — there 's no evidence for it and plenty of counterevidence .
Up to a certain age , girls do just as well as ( or better than ) boys in technical subjects , then , at about age 13 , poof ! — in spite of their proven ability , we see far fewer girls in advanced math and science classes .
The simplest explanations tend to be the right ones , and in this case the simple explanation is ... choice .
Most women choose not to enter these fields or develop an interest in these subjects .
Some researchers argue that peer pressure and false social stereotypes play a part , and that seems likely .
But innate ability is not the problem .
There is a supreme irony here — women who choose to stay away from mathematical subjects sometimes argue that they are making a more natural , earthy choice than their nerdy pocket - protector - wearing classmates , but in reality there is nothing more natural or earthy than mathematics , and the most accurate and reliable descriptions of nature take the form of mathematical equations .
I must add that mathematics is sometimes very beautiful , but just as with fine art , one must train one 's perceptions to see the beauty .
The Logistic Function
As an example , the " Logistic Function " describes the progress of biological colonies that are faced with limited resources ( e.g. all of them ) .
It 's not important that my readers understand this function on sight , only that they recognize that to someone who understands mathematics , this equation tells us something profound and beautiful about nature , in a concise and rigorous way .
Growth in a Biological Colony Now look at the graph of a typical biological colony as modeled by the logistic function .
The area at the left of the graph represents a time when the colony is essentially unconstrained and creates new members as fast as possible .
The area at the right represents a time when environmental limitations ( e.g. starvation ) prevent any significant increase in population .
As it happens , the human colony is at about the " 100 " point on the horizontal scale , meaning we must do something or a lot more people are going to starve .
An amazing thing about mathematics is that one could write 100,000 words on the topic of evolution and not get close to what the logistic function tells us .
Another , more general thing to know about mathematics is that , if you do n't learn it , people will successfully lie to you for your entire life .
Parenthood
Image courtesy of makinglemonade.com
No life experience can compare to parenthood for disorientation , confusion and shock — it 's almost impossible to picture in advance , and having an experienced person explain what 's going to happen does n't seem to do any good .
Finally , even when warned , almost no one hesitates .
Veteran parents typically report that their childrens ' teenage years were the unhappiest time in their lives ( for both the parents and the teenagers ) .
I doubt many parents have any idea what they 're getting into , and I suspect some would have second thoughts if they could see their own future .
Most parents do n't see the connection between evolution and childbearing — they expect to produce a miniature version of themselves , but , you know , better — smarter , nicer looking , more even - tempered .
But childbearing is the moment when evolution rolls its dice , and if the outcome were in any way predictable , childbearing would not exist .
To put this simply , parents expect something recognizable , but evolution requires something never seen before .
I can't think of a better moment to learn about evolution , but parents almost never consider the role of random mutation and natural selection in the development and behavior of their own children .
They do n't seem to realize that an unexpected outcome is the reason for childbearing — it 's the point , not a side effect .
To put this in its simplest terms , when your child does n't behave as you expect , that 's nature talking .
Parents ' responsibility toward their children is properly limited to protecting them from obvious dangers , not for molding them in the parents ' image .
But for parents to understand this , they have to grow up .
Conclusion
I can see why religious fundamentalists want to outlaw the teaching of evolution — it is a powerful idea with plenty of supporting evidence , and it provides us with basic truths about ourselves that appear to contradict religious dogma .
No educated person expects to be able to make an informed decision about anything remotely biological without understanding its evolutionary implications .
Since its inception , a number of bad actors have taken evolutionary ideas and distorted them to accomplish narrow , selfish ends , as in the example of Eugenics , which pretends that people can safely design our own future .
But we are n't qualified to do that — we must allow nature to take her own course .
Others have tried to use evolution as a cover for racism , but this requires another distortion , the idea that evolution has a preferred outcome ( it does n't ) .
Evolution is not a story with a fairy - tale ending , and it's not a plan with a goal .
Properly understood , evolution is a bottom - up process that works best when all possibilities are included .
The crowning irony of evolution is that it 's often presented only as " red in tooth and claw , " but in truth it 's nature 's way to give everyone an equal chance .
However my readers feel about evolution , whatever views they bring to the subject , before making a declaration or taking a position , my advice is to ... learn it first .
Many people do n't actually understand evolution and end up arguing about it from a position of ignorance .
A colleague once described physicist Stephen Hawking 's work as " so beautiful that it has to be true . "
This is a comment one often hears in science , where theories that require only a few principles to explain a lot are particularly prized .
Evolution is just such a theory — it uses a small handful of principles to explain a great deal of nature .
Which leads me to this closing remark — if religious fundamentalists actually understood evolution , they would try to give God credit for it .

As any rebellious young Parisian knows , there are many ways to jump the Métro .
There is the slick arm - lift - over - turnstiles ( upper body strength needed ) and the jump - and - tap ( if you 're tall enough to leap up and trigger the exit sensors ) .
And then there is the preferred method of Parisiennes who make up what they lack in athleticism with abject shamelessness : " Excusez - moi monsieur , can I slip in behind you ? "
For most who ride the city 's underground illicitly each year , the thrill of Métro hopping is tempered by the threat of being stopped by inspectors and fined up to € 72 ( £ 62 ) .
For an ingenious minority , however , there is no such deterrent : they pay a small monthly sum into an unofficial insurance fund , or mutuelle , which covers any charges in full .
As well as saving themselves money – members contribute between € 5 - €7 ( £ 4 - £ 6 ) a month to the pot , a snip compared with a € 53 ( £ 46 ) Navigo pass – the fare - dodgers believe they are striking a blow to a capitalist system which demands payment for public transport ( the RATP transport authorities estimate losses through ticketless travellers at € 80 m , or £ 69 m , a year ) .
Many members of the self - styled mutuelles des fraudeurs say they are combining personal financial gain with political idealism .
" Why do n't we pay for public transport ? " asked a recent edition of Lignes gratuites ( Free lines ) , the newsletter read by Paris 's dozen or so mutuelles .
" Because , just like education and health , we believe that public transport should be . . . free , " came the answer .
But , after an article in the newspaper Le Parisien this week , many of the mutuelles have adopted a more reticent tone .
They are meeting tonight to discuss how best to put their arguments – aware , perhaps , that it might not be received as warmly by the fare - paying public as by their fellow brothers in arms .
Indeed , Cyndie , an 18 - year - old Parisian queuing for the Métro yesterday , said the fraudeurs ' claims of an idealistic battle were a con .
" It 's just unfair because the rest of us have to pay , " she said .
" It 's all very well saying you want public transport to be free , but who 's going to maintain the stations and everything else ? "

We ’ve been eagerly anticipating the release of Jack Reacher , a film adaptation of Lee Child ’s 2005 novel , One Shot , following the various trailers and publicity stills showing glimpses of a promising car chase starring a Chevrolet Chevelle .
Having now seen it myself , I can vouch that the chase sequence in Jack Reacher lived up to my lofty expectations and was undoubtedly the standout scene of the film .
It ’s a gritty , visceral piece of filmmaking that harkens back to the car chase glory days of the 1970 ’s , where flashy CGI , overblown stunts and shameful shaky - cam were non-existent .
Even the initial setup has echoes of Bullitt and Gone in 60 Seconds .
Suspected for murder , Reacher , who is already on the tail of who he believes to be the culprit , pulls up to the scene of a crime surrounded by police officers .
There ’s a tense moment as Reacher and the lead pursuer knowingly stare at each other while the sound of the Chevelle ’s ticking engine pre-empts the action about to unfold .
Jack Reacher ’s chase firmly focuses on that most vital ingredient of a captivating car chase : the driving .
Unlike most films where the director will do their utmost to disguise the stunt driver who 's obviously wearing a wig to resemble the main actor , the film goes out of its way to constantly remind you that it is indeed Mr. Cruise performing his own stunts behind the wheel .
Those who saw his appearance on Top Gear will already know that Tom Cruise is blessed with some considerable driving skills , but , to me , hurling a lumbering old Chevrolet Chevelle around 90 degree corners is a more impressive feat than driving a Kia C’eed around the Top Gear test track with the aid of power steering .
Indeed , the Chevelle certainly gets an exhaustive workout , speeding down highways , sliding round corners and torturing the tyres with copious amounts of burnouts .
And yet Reacher is n’t portrayed as a perfect driver .
He makes mistakes , just as you and I probably would in the midst of a tense police chase , bumping into walls , clipping oncoming cars and misjudging corners , pushing the car to its limits .
In one scene , Reacher slams into a row of barrels after barrelling round a corner too fast , before stalling in his haste to chase after his elusive target .
According to Cruise , stalling the car was completely unintentional , but I ’m glad they kept it in the final cut – it all adds to the immersion and plausibility of the scene .
The Chevelle sustains a hefty amount of damage throughout the chase , becoming a battered wreck fit for the scrapyard by the end of the
scene , but the destruction never feels gratuitous .
A high speed and brutal tussle between the Chevelle and Jack Reacher ’s target in an Audi across a bridge causes the most damage , but a few police cars also find themselves on the receiving end of the Chevelle ’s front end for good measure .
There are no exceptionally flamboyant stunts to speak of , but this would detract from the gritty realism the director intended to achieve .
Watching the chase in a packed cinema was an absolute aural assault .
Like the very best car chases that repeatedly crop up in top ten lists , Jack Reacher ’s chase is completely devoid of incidental music , allowing the almighty sound of the Chevelle ’s guttural engine to dominate the scene , along with the wailing of sirens , crashes and screeching tyres .
The sounds are used to full effect , creating one of the most visceral chase scenes in recent memory .
There ’s an element of suspense , too .
At one point , Reacherends up in a cat and mouse sequence , creeping through alleyways after losing sight of the Audi which , unbeknown to Reacher , is hiding in the shadows ready to pounce .
Considering this is the first film Christopher McQuarrie has directed since 2000 ’s Way of the Gun , the director has little prior experience of directing a car chase , and yet the directing of Jack Reacher ’s car chase is superbly slick .
The cinematography is completely devoid of shaky cam and rapid - fire editing to create spurious tension as seen in many contemporary chases , instead opting for lingering shots that focus on Cruise ’s driving prowess .
This is best exemplified where , in an inspired piece of driving , Cruise performs a swift u-turn , mounting the Chevelle over a center divider , before darting back around to exit the highway in a glorious tyre - shredding tailslide .
The entire manoeuvre is seen in one clean shot , whereas many movies would most likely cram in three or four .
To some , the ending , which you will already have seen in the trailer anyway , may come across as something of an anti-climax .
We have a perception that all car chases must end with a spectacular stunt , such as the death of character or a devastating car crash full of carnage and explosions .
And yet Jack Reacher ’s chase could n’t end on a more casual note .
After all that drama , he simply pulls up , blends in with a nearby crowd and whisks away on a bus with the help of a passer - by ’s camouflaging cap .
It ’s a fitting end , however , that befits Jack Reacher ’s mysterious character .
In fact it ’s not too dissimilar to the conclusion of Drive ’s introductory chase which ended in a very similar fashion – it ’s no coincidence , since both characters share similarly shadowy personalities .
Much like last year ’s Drive and 2010 ’s The Town , Jack Reacher proves that relying on realism over flamboyance can create a truly thrilling , suspenseful , and gratifying car chase that fully immerses you .
A sure contender for the best chase of 2012 , then – find out if Jack Reacher came out on top in our annual VaRaces awards coming soon .

STEPHEN HAWKING :
How to build a time machine
By STEPHEN HAWKING
All you need is a wormhole , the Large Hadron Collider or a rocket that goes really , really fast
' Through the wormhole , the scientist can see himself as he was one minute ago .
But what if our scientist uses the wormhole to shoot his earlier self ?
He 's now dead .
So who fired the shot ? '
Hello .
My name is Stephen Hawking .
Physicist , cosmologist and something of a dreamer .
Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer , in my mind I am free .
Free to explore the universe and ask the big questions , such as : is time travel possible ?
Can we open a portal to the past or find a shortcut to the future ?
Can we ultimately use the laws of nature to become masters of time itself ?
Time travel was once considered scientific heresy .
I used to avoid talking about it for fear of being labelled a crank .
But these days I 'm not so cautious .
In fact , I 'm more like the people who built Stonehenge .
I 'm obsessed by time .
If I had a time machine I 'd visit Marilyn Monroe in her prime or drop in on Galileo as he turned his telescope to the heavens .
Perhaps
I 'd even travel to the end of the universe to find out how our whole cosmic story ends .
To see how this might be possible , we need to look at time as physicists do - at the fourth dimension .
It 's not as hard as it sounds .
Every attentive schoolchild knows that all physical objects , even me in my chair , exist in three dimensions .
Everything has a width and a height and a length .
But there is another kind of length , a length in time .
While a human may survive for 80 years , the stones at Stonehenge , for instance , have stood around for thousands of years .
And the solar system will last for billions of years .
Everything has a length in time as well as space .
Travelling in time means travelling through this fourth dimension .
To see what that means , let 's imagine we 're doing a bit of normal , everyday car travel .
Drive in a straight line and you 're travelling in one dimension .
Turn right or left and you add the second dimension .
Drive up or down a twisty mountain road and that adds height , so that 's travelling in all three dimensions .
But how on Earth do we travel in time ?
How do we find a path through the fourth dimension ?
Let 's indulge in a little science fiction for a moment .
Time travel movies often feature a vast , energy - hungry machine .
The machine creates a path through the fourth dimension , a tunnel through time .
A time traveller , a brave , perhaps foolhardy individual , prepared for who knows what , steps into the time tunnel and emerges who knows when .
The concept may be far - fetched , and the reality may be very different from this , but the idea itself is not so crazy .
Physicists have been thinking about tunnels in time too , but we come at it from a different angle .
We wonder if portals to the past or the future could ever be possible within the laws of nature .
As it turns out , we think they are .
What 's more , we 've even given them a name : wormholes .
The truth is that wormholes are all around us , only they 're too small to see .
Wormholes are very tiny .
They occur in nooks and crannies in space and time .
You might find it a tough concept , but stay with me .
A wormhole is a theoretical ' tunnel ' or shortcut , predicted by Einstein 's theory of relativity , that links two places in space - time - visualised above as the contours of a 3 - D map , where negative energy pulls space and time into the mouth of a tunnel , emerging in another universe .
They remain only hypothetical , as obviously nobody has ever seen one , but have been used in films as conduits for time travel - in Stargate ( 1994 ) , for example , involving gated tunnels between universes , and in Time Bandits ( 1981 ) , where their locations are shown on a celestial map
Nothing is flat or solid .
If you look closely enough at anything you 'll find holes and wrinkles in it .
It 's a basic physical principle , and it even applies to time .
Even something as smooth as a pool ball has tiny crevices , wrinkles and voids .
Now it 's easy to show that this is true in the first three dimensions .
But trust me , it 's also true of the fourth dimension .
There are tiny crevices , wrinkles and voids in time .
Down at the smallest of scales , smaller even than molecules , smaller than atoms , we get to a place called the quantum foam .
This is where wormholes exist .
Tiny tunnels or shortcuts through space and time constantly form , disappear , and reform within this quantum world .
And they actually link two separate places and two different times .
Unfortunately , these real - life time tunnels are just a billion - trillion - trillionths of a centimetre across .
Way too small for a human to pass through - but here 's where the notion of wormhole time machines is leading .
Some scientists think it may be possible to capture a wormhole and enlarge it many trillions of times to make it big enough for a human or even a spaceship to enter .
Given enough power and advanced technology , perhaps a giant wormhole could even be constructed in space .
I 'm not saying it can be done , but if it could be , it would be a truly remarkable device .
One end could be here near Earth , and the other far , far away , near some distant planet .
Theoretically , a time tunnel or wormhole could do even more than take us to other planets .
If both ends were in the same place , and separated by time instead of distance , a ship could fly in and come out still near Earth , but in the distant past .
Maybe dinosaurs would witness the ship coming in for a landing .
The fastest manned vehicle in history was Apollo 10 .
It reached 25,000 mph .
But to travel in time we 'll have to go more than 2,000 times faster
Now , I realise that thinking in four dimensions is not easy , and that wormholes are a tricky concept to wrap your head around , but hang in there .
I 've thought up a simple experiment that could reveal if human time travel through a wormhole is possible now , or even in the future .
I like simple experiments , and champagne .
So I 've combined two of my favourite things to see if time travel from the future to the past is possible .
Let 's imagine I 'm throwing a party , a welcome reception for future time travellers .
But there 's a twist .
I 'm not letting anyone know about it until after the party has happened .
I 've drawn up an invitation giving the exact coordinates in time and space .
I am hoping copies of it , in one form or another , will be around for many thousands of years .
Maybe one day someone living in the future will find the information on the invitation and use a wormhole time machine to come back to my party , proving that time travel will , one day , be possible .
In the meantime , my time traveller guests should be arriving any moment now .
Five , four , three , two , one .
But as I say this , no one has arrived .
What a shame .
I was hoping at least a future Miss Universe was going to step through the door .
So why did n't the experiment work ?
One of the reasons might be because of a well - known problem with time travel to the past , the problem of what we call paradoxes .
Paradoxes are fun to think about .
The most famous one is usually called the Grandfather paradox .
I have a new , simpler version I call the Mad Scientist paradox .
I do n't like the way scientists in movies are often described as mad , but in this case , it 's true .
This chap is determined to create a paradox , even if it costs him his life .
Imagine , somehow , he 's built a wormhole , a time tunnel that stretches just one minute into the past .
Hawking in a scene from Star Trek with dinner guests from the past , and future : ( from left ) Albert Einstein , Data and Isaac Newton
Through the wormhole , the scientist can see himself as he was one minute ago .
But what if our scientist uses the wormhole to shoot his earlier self ?
He 's now dead .
So who fired the shot ?
It 's a paradox .
It just does n't make sense .
It 's the sort of situation that gives cosmologists nightmares .
This kind of time machine would violate a fundamental rule that governs the entire universe - that causes happen before effects , and never the other way around .
I believe things can't make themselves impossible .
If they could then there 'd be nothing to stop the whole universe from descending into chaos .
So I think something will always happen that prevents the paradox .
Somehow there must be a reason why our scientist will never find himself in a situation where he could shoot himself .
And in this case , I 'm sorry to say , the wormhole itself is the problem .
In the end , I think a wormhole like this one can't exist .
And the reason for that is feedback .
If you 've ever been to a rock gig , you 'll probably recognise this screeching noise .
It 's feedback .
What causes it is simple .
Sound enters the microphone .
It 's transmitted along the wires , made louder by the amplifier , and comes out at the speakers .
But if too much of the sound from the speakers goes back into the mic it goes around and around in a loop getting louder each time .
If no one stops it , feedback can destroy the sound system .
The same thing will happen with a wormhole , only with radiation instead of sound .
As soon as the wormhole expands , natural radiation will enter it , and end up in a loop .
The feedback will become so strong it destroys the wormhole .
So although tiny wormholes do exist , and it may be possible to inflate one some day , it wo n't last long enough to be of use as a time machine .
That 's the real reason no one could come back in time to my party .
Any kind of time travel to the past through wormholes or any other method is probably impossible , otherwise paradoxes would occur .
So sadly , it looks like time travel to the past is never going to happen .
A disappointment for dinosaur hunters and a relief for historians .
But the story 's not over yet .
This does n't make all time travel impossible .
I do believe in time travel .
Time travel to the future .
Time flows like a river and it seems as if each of us is carried relentlessly along by time 's current .
But time is like a river in another way .
It flows at different speeds in different places and that is the key to travelling into the future .
This idea was first proposed by Albert Einstein over 100 years ago .
He realised that there should be places where time slows down , and others where time speeds up .
He was absolutely right .
And the proof is right above our heads .
Up in space .
This is the Global Positioning System , or GPS .
A network of satellites is in orbit around Earth .
The satellites make satellite navigation possible .
But they also reveal that time runs faster in space than it does down on Earth .
Inside each spacecraft is a very precise clock .
But despite being so accurate , they all gain around a third of a billionth of a second every day .
The system has to correct for the drift , otherwise that tiny difference would upset the whole system , causing every GPS device on Earth to go out by about six miles a day .
You can just imagine the mayhem that that would cause .
The problem does n't lie with the clocks .
They run fast because time itself runs faster in space than it does down below .
And the reason for this extraordinary effect is the mass of the Earth .
Einstein realised that matter drags on time and slows it down like the slow part of a river .
The heavier the object , the more it drags on time .
And this startling reality is what opens the door to the possibility of time travel to the future .
Right in the centre of the Milky Way , 26,000 light years from us , lies the heaviest object in the galaxy .
It is a supermassive black hole containing the mass of four million suns crushed down into a single point by its own gravity .
The closer you get to the black hole , the stronger the gravity .
Get really close and not even light can escape .
A black hole like this one has a dramatic effect on time , slowing it down far more than anything else in the galaxy .
That makes it a natural time machine .
I like to imagine how a spaceship might be able to take advantage of this phenomenon , by orbiting it .
If a space agency were controlling the mission from Earth they 'd observe that each full orbit took 16 minutes .
But for the brave people on board , close to this massive object , time would be slowed down .
And here the effect would be far more extreme than the gravitational pull of Earth .
The crew 's time would be slowed down by half .
For every 16 - minute orbit , they 'd only experience eight minutes of time .
Inside the Large Hadron Collider
Around and around they'd go , experiencing just half the time of everyone far away from the black hole .
The ship and its crew would be travelling through time .
Imagine they circled the black hole for five of their years .
Ten years would pass elsewhere .
When they got home , everyone on Earth would have aged five years more than they had .
So a supermassive black hole is a time machine .
But of course , it 's not exactly practical .
It has advantages over wormholes in that it does n't provoke paradoxes .
Plus it wo n't destroy itself in a flash of feedback .
But it 's pretty dangerous .
It 's a long way away and it does n't even take us very far into the future .
Fortunately there is another way to travel in time .
And this represents our last and best hope of building a real time machine .
You just have to travel very , very fast .
Much faster even than the speed required to avoid being sucked into a black hole .
This is due to another strange fact about the universe .
There 's a cosmic speed limit , 186,000 miles per second , also known as the speed of light .
Nothing can exceed that speed .
It 's one of the best established principles in science .
Believe it or not , travelling at near the speed of light transports you to the future .
To explain why , let 's dream up a science - fiction transportation system .
Imagine a track that goes right around Earth , a track for a superfast train .
We 're going to use this imaginary train to get as close as possible to the speed of light and see how it becomes a time machine .
On board are passengers with a one - way ticket to the future .
The train begins to accelerate , faster and faster .
Soon it 's circling the Earth over and over again .
To approach the speed of light means circling the Earth pretty fast .
Seven times a second .
But no matter how much power the train has , it can never quite reach the speed of light , since the laws of physics forbid it .
Instead , let 's say it gets close , just shy of that ultimate speed .
Now something extraordinary happens .
Time starts flowing slowly on board relative to the rest of the world , just like near the black hole , only more so .
Everything on the train is in slow motion .
This happens to protect the speed limit , and it's not hard to see why .
Imagine a child running forwards up the train .
Her forward speed is added to the speed of the train , so could n't she break the speed limit simply by accident ?
The answer is no .
The laws of nature prevent the possibility by slowing down time onboard .
Now she can't run fast enough to break the limit .
Time will always slow down just enough to protect the speed limit .
And from that fact comes the possibility of travelling many years into the future .
Imagine that the train left the station on January 1 , 2050 .
It circles Earth over and over again for 100 years before finally coming to a halt on New Year 's Day , 2150 .
The passengers will have only lived one week because time is slowed down that much inside the train .
When they got out they 'd find a very different world from the one they 'd left .
In one week they'd have travelled 100 years into the future .
Of course , building a train that could reach such a speed is quite impossible .
But we have built something very like the train at the world 's largest particle accelerator at CERN in Geneva , Switzerland .
Deep underground , in a circular tunnel 16 miles long , is a stream of trillions of tiny particles .
When the power is turned on they accelerate from zero to 60,000 mph in a fraction of a second .
Increase the power and the particles go faster and faster , until they 're whizzing around the tunnel 11,000 times a second , which is almost the speed of light .
But just like the train , they never quite reach that ultimate speed .
They can only get to 99.99 per cent of the limit .
When that happens , they too start to travel in time .
We know this because of some extremely short - lived particles , called pi-mesons .
Ordinarily , they disintegrate after just 25 billionths of a second .
But when they are accelerated to near - light speed they last 30 times longer .
It really is that simple .
If we want to travel into the future , we just need to go fast .
Really fast .
And I think the only way we 're ever likely to do that is by going into space .
The fastest manned vehicle in history was Apollo 10 .
It reached 25,000 mph .
But to travel in time we 'll have to go more than 2,000 times faster .
And to do that we'd need a much bigger ship , a truly enormous machine .
The ship would have to be big enough to carry a huge amount of fuel , enough to accelerate it to nearly the speed of light .
Getting to just beneath the cosmic speed limit would require six whole years at full power .
The initial acceleration would be gentle because the ship would be so big and heavy .
But gradually it would pick up speed and soon would be covering massive distances .
In one week it would have reached the outer planets .
After two years it would reach half - light speed and be far outside our solar system .
Two years later it would be travelling at 90 per cent of the speed of light .
Around 30 trillion miles away from Earth , and four years after launch , the ship would begin to travel in time .
For every hour of time on the ship , two would pass on Earth .
A similar situation to the spaceship that orbited the massive black hole .
After another two years of full thrust the ship would reach its top speed , 99 per cent of the speed of light .
At this speed , a single day on board is a whole year of Earth time .
Our ship would be truly flying into the future .
The slowing of time has another benefit .
It means we could , in theory , travel extraordinary distances within one lifetime .
A trip to the edge of the galaxy would take just 80 years .
But the real wonder of our journey is that it reveals just how strange the universe is .
It 's a universe where time runs at different rates in different places .
Where tiny wormholes exist all around us .
And where , ultimately , we might use our understanding of physics to become true voyagers through the fourth dimension .
' Stephen Hawking 's Universe ' begins on May 9 on Discovery Channel ( HD ) at 9pm
Some men define themselves by which part of the female anatomy they prefer : breasts , legs , arse , etc .
Personally , I 'm more a brains and face kind of guy .
I 've always been attracted to intelligent women with beautiful facial features , and my wife ticks those boxes for me .
Gail Trimble , the grand boffin of University Challenge who seemed to have a Google implant in her brain , has ventured into relatively uncharted territory for brainy women : she has become a media sensation .
Not only have her lightening reflexes and her supercomputer brainpower won her a legion of admiring fans , she has also even become something of a sex icon , complete with an offer to pose for a lads ' magazine – which goes to prove that there are lads out there who appreciate brains and not just " booty " .
However , not everyone was impressed , with some bloggers and tabloids railing against her for being " smug " and " superior " .
Shockingly , the Daily Mash reported that , despite the protective shelter of the body of Christ ( Corpus Christi ) , Trimble was to be burnt as a witch , apparently because she recites " the periodic table backwards in Aramaic while dancing naked in a circle with a murder of gigantic , two - headed crows " .
Of course , that 's far - fetched satire today , but this fate was a real occupational hazard for some of the brainiest women of yesteryear .
Take Hypatia of Alexandria .
The Hellenic polymath must have been well pleased with herself when she became the first woman to head Alexandria 's Platonist school and , in that great Greek philosophical tradition , donning her scholar 's robes , she toured the town engaging in public debate and interpreting the works of other philosophers .
However , trouble was a - brewing for Hypatia .
Although she was admired across the Hellenic world , she had amassed powerful enemies in the nascent church , especially in the shape of Alexandria 's bishop , Cyril .
Eventually , her " pagan " ideas and gender were to cost her her life as an angry Christian mob waylaid her chariot and brutally murdered her .
It is ironic that the first notable female scholar of the Greek tradition also became the last .
Hypatia is one of numerous brainy women through the ages with whom I have become familiar as part of a fascinating project – at least for me – I am co-operating on , which explores the contribution women have made to science over the centuries .
Based on the women I have researched , a certain pattern is discernible in their quest for success and recognition : they often had to become honorary men , they were forced into marginal areas of learning ( which ironically often put them at the cutting edge of new knowledge ) , and they quite literally felt compelled to be second to nun in their morality , forswearing carnal pleasures and embracing chastity .
Hypatia , for instance , reportedly rejected a suitor by showing him her menstrual rags , claiming that this showed there was " nothing beautiful " about carnal desires .
Of course , it was n't all black and white .
For instance , the German philosopher , physician and composer Hildegard von Bingen , who was saintly in her ways although she never quite became a saint , was an abbess and , hence , a virgin , yet she was possibly the first European to have described the female orgasm ( albeit in medieval terms ) .
To advance her career , Hildegard needed divine intervention : the visions she claimed to experience helped her to get around the medieval church 's restrictions on women preaching and practising philosophy and the sciences .
Of course , I use the term " science " here loosely .
Although she was at the cutting edge of learning for her time , the bulk of her work could only be described as superstition .
For instance , a remedy she proposes for a hangover in one of her medical works involves dunking a bitch in water and drinking the resulting murky liquid .
If any readers feel brave enough to try this , please report back on your findings .
In the 19th century things started to get decidedly better for women , although they still had to swim against a tide of prejudice .
Believe it or not , the world 's first computer geek was not a bespectacled , socially inept male teenager , but an English aristocrat of the female persuasion .
Ada Lovelace , the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron , who never met her erratic father , was a mathematical whiz - kid and the mother of all computer nerds .
She is credited with having written the world 's first " computer programme " for Charles Babbage 's Analytical Engine ( the " first computer " ) .
Babbage called her his " enchantress of numbers " .
In the 20th century , women played pivotal roles in many of the newest areas of physics and chemistry .
The most legendary is probably Marie Curie , the only woman to win two Nobel prizes .
Despite advances in the status of women , however , some did not get the recognition they deserved .
Rosalind Franklin is a prime example : her images of DNA were essential to the cracking of its now famous double - helix structure , but she did not receive a Nobel prize for it .
Even James Watson , despite his dodgy views on race , agreed that she should have also got one .
Unfortunately , Nobels are not awarded posthumously .
I thought I would change things up a little bit and offer up my preview of RSL 's match before the rest of my MLS weekend previews and picks .
Only in their first season in MLS has Real Salt Lake not won a match at the Home Depot Center , in 2006 it was a win over the Galaxy in May , in 2007 it was a win September win over the Galaxy , in 2008 it was a June win over Chivas , and in 2009 it was June win over the Galaxy .
The history of RSL and Chivas at the Home Depot Center is one of some big wins for Chivas , they hold a 19 to 4 goal advantage and a 7 - 1 - 1 record , but the last three times ( including the 2008 playoffs ) the record is 1 - 1 - 1 with each team scoring 4 goals .
RSL has been in rare form the last 3 weeks with dominating wins over Toronto , Philadelphia , and last week against Houston .
While Chivas has struggled in last two after a huge 4 - 0 win at New England , with a 2 - 0 loss at home to Houston , and then a heartbreaker last minute PK loss to Columbus last weekend .
Chivas are 2 - 2 - 0 in their 4 home matches , and 2 - 3 - 0 in matches at the Home Depot Center , they are even with 5 goal scored and 5 allowed in their home matches .
If you look at the overall Chivas season , they have a 3 - 1 - 1 record bookended with 2 losses on both sides for an over all 3 - 5 - 1 record with a - 2 goal differential .
Their 12 goals allowed is tied for worst in the Western Conference and their defensive woes may only get worse as Jazic and Kennedy continue to be listed as out , and both of their captains Jonathan Bornstein and Sacha Kljestan are gone to USMNT camp , they also have Justin Braun listed as questionable and both Galindo and Cuesta are listed as probable .
For RSL they too will be missing a couple of important players on national team duty as Will Johnson will join Canada for a match against Argentina and Robbie Findley is in the USMNT camp trying to earn a spot on the US World Cup roster .
The good news for RSL is that their only injuries reported are to Fabian Espindola and Nelson Gonzalez , but both are listed as probable .
The key matchups , the wildcards , and my pick for the match are after the jump :
Key Matchups
Alvaro Saborio vs. The Chivas Defense
Saborio is coming off his best week in MLS , two goals against Western Conference rival earned him MLS Player of the Week honors and a spotlight article on the MLS website .
I tend to agree with RSL head coach Jason Kreis , that we still have n't seen the best of Alvaro , and if the best is yet to come , there may be no better time to see it than this weekend .
RSL 's top two forwards coming into the season were Robbie Findley and Fabian Espindola , but this Saturday we will likely see another start for Saborio and next to him Pablo Campos .
Those two have seemed to start to form a great chemistry and have benefited from each others play in recent matches .
For Chivas their defense will be missing their leader , and for a defense that has only shut out tow teams , New York who have had real scoring issues lately , and New England who have scored just 4 goals in their last 6 matches .
So can the Chivas defense slow down the RSL offense that has only failed to find the back of the net once this year ?
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this matchup is the fact that Chivas will try to counter Saborio with two of Costa Rican National team members , Michael Umana and Dario Delgado , who Chivas acquired the rights to from RSL .
So while the paths of these three have intertwined in the past , I do n't expect it to be a friendly reunion , but who will come out on top ?
Justin Braun vs. His Hometown team
Braun has been on of the most consistent players this year for Chivas with two goals and two assists , but in 132 minutes of action against RSL he has never scored or assisted on a goal .
Justin is a player that slipped through the cracks at RSL , he played for Skyline High School and with no NCAA teams in Utah he played at Salt Lake Community College .
He was signed by Chivas in March of 2008 after playing in a tournament at the Home Depot Center .
RSL saw Braun in the 2008 playoffs when he was a dangerous player who has both size ( he is 6 ' 3 " ) and deceptive speed that allows him to get behind defenses .
Chivas has gone with a 4 - 5 - 1 formation in recent weeks with Braun being the target up top , we saw what happened the last time a team tried that formation against RSL , it was Toronto and the end result was a 3 - 0 win for RSL .
I do n't know what to expect from Justin , if he is healthy enough to get the start , but you have to believe if he can play at all that he will be in the lineup looking to finally make his mark against the team that plays in his hometown and failed to find him when he was in their backyard .
Martin Vasquez vs. Jason Kreis
I have n't featured a matchup of coaches yet , but both of the men in charge this week are faced with adjusting their lineups because of missing players and those adjustments along with the timing and selection of their subs will likely be a major factor in the end result .
The task for Jason may be much easier , while he is dealing with the loss of Robbie Findley , one of the teams offensive threats , he has depth with a number of players who can move up top and provide some offensive punch for the team .
Replacing Will Johnson also wo n't provide too much of a challenge as RSL can go with Grabavoy , whose form before his injury had him looking better than ever , or rookie Collen Warner , who in recent weeks has earned minutes and praise for his playing style .
Jason has done a good job in getting players minutes as only 2 field players and backup keeper Kyle Reynish , have n't gotten into a MLS match so far this year .
I believe the overall MLS knowledge of the RSL coaching staff ( Jason , Robin , and Jeff ) gives the team a real advantage as they understand how the league plays both from being players in the league and now from the sidelines .
For Martin Vasquez , the challenge is the same but more more complicated .
Chivas have a real lack of MLS depth on their roster , only one player has more than 125 MLS matches under his belt , that is goalkeeper Zach Thornton with 264 matches played ( RSL has 5 with that amount of experience ) .
That lack of depth is even clearer when you subtract their two USMNT players Bornstein ( 111 matches played ) and Kljestan ( 113 matches played ) .
After them you have to look to Saragosa ( 109 matches played ) , but he has been a role player for Vasquez with just 3 starts this year , and then you drop down to Galindo ( 64 matches played ) but again after coming back from injury has only played in 3 matches this year .
I think Martin has brought in some great talent for Chivas , but without veteran leadership who understand the league , their opponents , and the officials the task of assembling a solid squad is tough and I think that is part of the reason for the inconsistent start of Chivas this year .
It will be interesting to see who is wearing the armband for Chivas , and how that person leads the team on the pitch .
Wild Cards
Javier Morales
No player made a bigger impact in the first weekend of the MLS season and over the first 3 weeks it was a battle between Javi and LA 's Edson Buddle on who would be the player of the month , but then an injury and a bout with strep kept Javi out of the lineup for several matches .
Edson would claim the player of the month award for April , and made himself and early MVP favorite as well as the leader in the Golden Boot competition .
Javi has made it back from injury and in each of the last two RSL matches he has become more and more of a factor , and one has to believe with a couple extra days off last week that Javi is about to return to the form that won him MLS 's player of the week in week 1 of the season .
In week one it was two goals and 1 assist , last week it was 2 assists , what will Javier be able to do this week ?
Micahael Lahoud
Last year Lahoud was the first round draft pick of Chivas USA ( # 9 ) , he is a product of Wake Forest and was part of their 2007 NCAA Championship .
He was born in Freetown , Sierra Leone but his family moved to Washington DC when he was young .
He played several positions in college but has been used mostly in a midfield role since joining Chivas
He has only seem limited action so far this year and only has one assists , but at the end of 2009 he got several starts ( 7 of their last 8 and both playoff matches ) , he ended up with a single goal and a single assist last year .
He is a young player that RSL has never faced and he has some great skills on and off the ball and with so many new faces on the roster for Chivas he may be looking to make a name for himself with their new coach .
Yader Reyes
It has been a shame this year that so many matches have been impacted by the officials , for RSL and Chivas both have had results decided at the PK spot .
Heck both lost matches to Columbus because of PK's and bad calls .
In fact 6 PK's have been awarded against the two teams already this year , and neither side has had the official point to the spot for them .
So you have to wonder if in a match that is likely to be played at a high tempo by both teams , both of who also tend to be physical teams , if the official will once again be a wild card in what the final outcome of the match will be ?
Match Prediction
After a tough start on the road RSL has found their swagger again and last week they did something they had n't done in several years , they beat Houston .
Now they find themselves in a position to do something they have n't done in years again , get a win against Chivas at the HDC .
Chivas find themselves simply looking to figure out the pieces , they have a good team , solid players but so far they have lacked the consistency they have shown in the past .
Could it be all the new faces ?
Could it be a new coach with a new style ?
Could it be the lack of on field leadership ?
None of those will be answered this week , but Chivas will have a chance to gain face with their fans , and some self respect for themselves if they can knock of the defending Champs .
Like so many matches in MLS this one will likely come down to what team can score first , neither side has won a match this year when giving up the first goal .
This could be a great thing for Real Salt Lake who have scored 7 of their 15 goals in the first 30 minutes of matches , Chivas on the other hand has only 2 of their 10 goals scored in the first half hour of a match .
That trend holds up on defense as well , RSL have allowed only 2 goals in the first 30 minutes ( a huge improvement from 2009 ) , while Chivas have allowed 5 of their 12 in the first half hour .
Look for RSL to score early in this one and hold on for a 2 - 1 win .

 Quiere limpiar su imagen y dar un mensaje a la sociedad mexicana de que está atendiendo el caso , lo que no es cierto " , acusan
[ email protected ]
Padres de algunos de los 49 niños que perdieron la vida durante el incendio de la guardería ABC en Hermisllo , Sonora , el 5 de junio de 2009 , advirtieron que no acudirán el próximo miércoles a la ciudad de México a una reunión con el presidente Felipe Calderón pues consideran que la invitación , a tres días del primer aniversario de la tragedia , es “ oportunista ” y sólo para “ limpiar la imagen ” presidencial .
“ Queremos justicia , no la foto ” , dijo en entrevista Julio César Márquez Ortiz , vocero del grupo 5 de Junio y padre de una de las víctimas , quien anticipó que al menos la mitad podrían no aceptar la invitación para el encuentro en la residencia oficial de Los Pinos para el 2 de junio a las 17:00 horas .
“ No estoy dispuesta a servirle de servilleta a este señor , para que limpie su imagen ante la gente , porque le perjudica mucho que se diga que a un año no se ha dignado a atender a los padres .
No voy porque ( el Presidente ) no tiene interés ni voluntad de arreglar esto y no lo va a hacer a un año .
Esto se va a resolver en tribunales y no me voy a prestar a su juego ” , dijo Patricia Duarte Franco , madre del fallecido pequeño Andrés Alonso .
La semana pasada , funcionarios del Seguro Social convocaron a los padres a una reunión en Hermosillo , para explicarles cómo los recogerían en vehículos , los llevarían al aeropuerto y de ahí a la capital del país , donde se encontrarían con Calderón , para salir del Distrito Federal a Hermosillo alrededor de las 21:00 horas .
“ Quiere limpiar su imagen y dar un mensaje a la sociedad mexicana de que está atendiendo el caso de la guardería ABC , lo que no es cierto porque nunca tuvo las ganas de hacerlo desde un principio .
¡ Qué casualidad de que a tres días el primer aniversario nos llama a todos los padres ! ” , expuso Duarte .
De acuerdo con el testimonio de Duarte , el gobernador de Sonora , Guillermo Padrés , también los convocó de manera urgente el 27 de mayo pasado para reiterarles la invitación presidencial .
Indiferencia “ Tenemos 11 meses pidiendo una reunión con el Presidente .
Ha habido más de 15 marchas , una huelga de hambre , solicitudes formales , una carta entregada directamente a Fernando Gómez Mont ( titular de Gobernación ) y jamás ha habido respuesta .
Muy casualmente antes del primer año es cuando decide invitarnos ” , dijo Márquez Ortiz .
Julio César recordó que su petición siempre ha sido en torno a una reunión abierta , en Hermosillo , Sonora , no cerrada y en Los Pinos .
“ Lo más doloroso es que sea tan oportunista la convocatoria , a tres días del aniversario .
Eso duele muchísimo ” , expuso Márquez Ortiz en entrevista .
“ No se puede esperar mucho de la reunión .
A estas alturas qué se le puede solicitar al máximo representante del gobierno federal , cuando es algo que por sí solo debió haber impulsado .
Lo que se requiere son acciones .
Si no fue inmediatamente , a estas alturas … ” , sentenció .
El pasado 30 de abril , Día del Niño , luego de casi 11 meses de ocurrido el incendio que mató a 49 niños en la guardería ABC de Hermosillo , Sonora , por primera vez el presidente Felipe Calderón recibió a un grupo de 11 madres y padres a puerta cerrada en Los Pinos .
Ese 30 de abril , Francisco García , padre de un menor fallecido , se quejó porque no fueron convocados todos a la cita .
“ Discriminan al invitar selectivamente a quienes recibe , que son quienes han permanecido callados ” , declaró García .
Wikipedia 's launching a new feature for English readers :
The ability to create custom books from Wikipedia 's huge bank of free content .
Because of the way Wikipedia 's images and copy are licensed , they 're free for anyone to access , use and share in this way .
PediaPress is a book publisher for wiki content ; it 's in a long - term business relationship with Wikipedia to print these books .
PediaPress now offers paperbacks and will soon add hardcover books to its catalog , as well .
The price of each book varies , depending on the number of pages ; paperbacks start at $ 8.90 .
Users can also simply download a PDF of the " books " they create .
The book - creating tools are built into the website .
Starting today , users will see a " create a book " button in the print / export section of the left sidebar .
Here 's a short demo video explaining how the book creator works :
" When I came up with the idea , my colleagues told me my shower was probably too hot , " said PediaPress Managing Director Heiko
Hees in a release this morning .
" But I was tired of reading on the screen .
I believe that in this hectic age people cherish their offline moments more and more .
You wish you could access the most extensive and up - to - date knowledge in offline moments – on the train , at the seafront , in your bed . "
Compared to other services that have attempted to tackle this problem , like e-readers , Wikipedia has the disadvantage of only offering non-fiction content and having content that can and does change periodically .
But PediaPress has two distinct advantages .
First , content can be customized around any topic or topics the user desires .
The ability to curate content is one of the hallmarks of the latest wave of digital creativity .
Second , this medium is the absolute best for those who choose to spend time offline ; you 'll never need a power adapter or an Internet connection to enjoy a book .
PediaPress is already up and running in 17 languages , serving 33 countries .
What do you think of this new service ?
Is it a cool way to use free content , or are books destined for the media graveyard ?
Do you think you might use PediaPress to create a book for yourself or a friend ?
During Captivate 2010 , Capcom ’s yearly press event which was held earlier today on Hawaii , the Japanese publisher revealed its line - up for 2011 .
Major titles that were revealed include Marvel vs. Capcom 3 : Fate of Two Worlds , which was already leaked last week , Ōkamiden , a sequel to 2006 ’s Ōkami​ , and sequel to 2008 ’s remake of Bionic Commando : Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 .
More details regarding these games , as well as other games that were revealed at Captivate 2010 can be found after the jump .
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 : Fate of Two Worlds will be released during Spring 2011 for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 .
It is a sequel to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 : New Age of Heroes , which was released for arcades and the Sega Dreamcast in 2000 .
Ports for the Playstation 2 and first - generation Xbox arrived in 2002 , and the game was re-released during the summer of 2009 for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 .
Ōkamiden will be set many months after the events of the original Ōkami , which was released in 2006 for the Playstation 2 , and in 2008 for the Nintendo Wii .
The game will revolve around Chibiterasu , a small creature who appears to be somewhat similar to the protagonist of the first Ōkami , but apparently much younger .
A release window for the game , which will be exclusively available on the Nintendo DS , was not specified .
Nathan Spencer is set for a return to the Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Store with Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 at some point during Q1 2011 .
The retro-styled sidescroller will pit Spencer against an enemy known as General Sabio , and include several new features such as the ability to jump .
Other titles that were revealed include the hack - ‘n - slash title Sengoku Basara : Samurai Heroes , which is set for a release in the United States during Fall 2010 for Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii.
Samurai Heroes will be the fourth instalment in the Sengoku Basara series , and the second title to be released in the United States .
The original Sengoku Basara was released in the United States under the name of Devil Kings in 2005 .
Another Nintendo DS title scheduled for release late this year is Ghost Trick Phantom Detective , originally only intended for a release in Japan , but now also set to hit the United States and Europe .
The game will feature a murder victim known as Sissel , who becomes a ghost suffering from amnesia and must discover the mystery behind his own demise .
The game will be released during Winter 2010 .
New information regarding Dead Rising 2 was also revealed .
In Dead Rising 2 : Case Zero , which will be available exclusively on Xbox Live , players will be introduced to the protagonist of Dead Rising 2 : Chuck Greene .
This prologue to the game will be set two years after the events at the Willamete mall , and 2 before the events of Dead Rising 2 .
It was also announced that Dead Rising 2 will include a co-operative playmode .
Finally , packages of downloadable content were announced for Lost Planet 2 , Super Street Fighter IV and MotoGP 09/10 .
Capcom stated that it will release ‘ Silverstone Circuit ’ , a new track for MotoGP 09/10 and continue to update teams and liveries as the season progresses for free .
The DLC for Lost Planet 2 will include two new maps , and will be available at launch on May 11th 2010 .
Finally , downloadable content for Super Street Fighter IV will include new costumes for characters ( some of which will be available at launch ) , as well as a new Tournament mode that allows players to compete in a persistent championship against players from around the world .

JERUSALEM — Palestinian negotiators have surprised Washington with a bold opening offer to White House peace envoy George Mitchell that includes concessions on territory beyond those offered in past Palestinian - Israeli peace talks , according to officials briefed on the current negotiations .
The Palestinians ' unexpected offer has been greeted warily in Israel and by some members of the Obama administration , according to these officials .

New York is one of the states at highest risk of default and budget cuts are coming .
However , for now , those cuts will be limited to service cuts , dismissals and furloughs .
Public sector pensions remain an intractable issue that will move center stage when states and municipalities in the US realize that they can’t meet budget cuts without making adjustments to gold - plated pension plans .
Public sector unions are outraged , the New York Times reports .
In Yonkers , more than 100 retired police officers and firefighters are collecting pensions greater than their pay when they were working .
One of the youngest , Hugo Tassone , retired at 44 with a base pay of about $ 74,000 a year .
His pension is now $ 101,333 a year .
It ’s what the system promised , said Mr. Tassone , now 47 , adding that he did nothing wrong by adding lots of overtime to his base pay shortly before retiring .
“ I do n’t understand how the working guy that held up their end of the bargain became the problem , ” he said .
Mr. Tassone ’s ability to draw a pension at 44 which is now more than 25 % above his final salary speaks to the problem .
The New York Times cite analysts who calculate that state and local officials have made promises worth $ 5 trillion in public pensions to their employees .
However , they have only committed taxpayers to half this amount .
This pension disaster makes states and cities into financial basket cases and is the major reason the long - term financial outlook for cities and states is bleak .
But , this can go on for a long time .
If states and municipalities can close their budget gaps for this year without precipitating a double dip recession , the pro-cyclical nature of budget balances will make the cash flow constraints disappear .
The coming collapse of the municipal bond market is all about those cash flows .
When the economy is weak , spending for social programs increases even while tax revenue plummets .
These deficits set up another cash flow problem that has to be solved by budget cuts , increased tax rates or both .
Given how the shortfalls we are already witnessing , we could be at the breaking point in the next recession .
An inability to borrow in the public markets or the federal government ’s inability to pay municipal bills would spell the end of the line for pensions like Mr. Tassone ’s because cutting those pensions would become critical .
According to pension data collected by The New York Times from the city and state , about 3,700 retired public workers in New York are now getting pensions of more than $ 100,000 a year , exempt from state and local taxes .
The data belie official reports that the average state pension is a modest $ 18,000 , or $ 38,000 for retired police officers and firefighters .
( The average is low , in part , because it includes people who worked in government only part time , or just a few years , as well as surviving spouses getting partial benefits . )
Roughly one of every 250 retired public workers in New York is collecting a six - figure pension , and that group is expected to grow rapidly in coming years , based on the number of highly paid people in the pipeline .
The most breathtaking case in the Times article is that of Edward Stolzenberg , who once ran the Westchester Medical Center , a big hospital in the rich Westchester County suburbs of New York City .
His hospital was taken over by the state , bumping his salary way up to $ 400,000 ( even though this was less than in the private sector , remember he was then the county health commissioner – a public official ) .
He now gets over $ 200,000 in pension salary , while his successor makes $ 900,000 a year and is due for a pension based on this salary .
Federal tax law does put a cap on pension payouts , currently $ 195,000 a year .
Congress set this cap , which has risen with inflation , more than 30 years ago to keep employers from turning their pension funds into abusive tax shelters .
CONSERVATIVES FIND GREAT IMPORTANCE IN MISS USA PAGEANT ….
Who knew political conservatives cared so deeply about a beauty pageant ?
Last week , organizers of the Miss USA pageant published promotional photos recently of contestants wearing lingerie .
Fox News ’ Sean Hannity and Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - Texas ) were outraged , and Gohmert suggested the promotional shots can be linked to “ economic chaos , ” which in turn leads to Americans being “ willing to give up liberty . ”
Now that the pageant has come and gone , we can move on to more meaningful matters , right ?
Wrong — the right is outraged again , because conservatives disapprove of the winning contestant .
Indeed , it ’s apparently the single most important story of the day on far - right blogs .
One complaint was particularly amusing .
A new Miss USA was crowned last night , the first time a Muslim , Arab - American woman won the honor .
But for Daniel Pipes , a neocon pundit who writes for the National Review and was a Bush appointee to the Peace Institute , that ’s one too many .
On his blog yesterday , Pipes pointed out five other Muslim women who ’ve won beauty contests in the U.S. , Britain and France over the last five years .
“ They are all attractive , but this surprising frequency of Muslims winning beauty pageants makes me suspect an odd form of affirmative action , ” he wrote .
My favorite part of Pipes ’ conspiracy theory ?
He noted that the results “ prompted ” him to “ recall some prior instances of Muslim women winning beauty contests in Western countries . ”
In other words , a prominent conservative “ thinker ” is not only bothered by the winner of the Miss USA pageant , but he cares enough about the matter to “ recall ” similar instances — as if he actually keeps track of such things .
And Pipes is hardly alone .
Zaid Jilani noted one right - wing media personality who blamed the results on a “ politically correct , Islamo - pandering climate ” in America , adding that the winner is a “ Lebanese Muslim Hezbollah supporter with relatives who are top terrorists . ”
I realize right - wing political observers get worked up over strange things , but even for conservatives , this is bizarre .
Update : Adam Serwer notes , “ [ T ] he tone and substance of the fever swamp ’s reaction to an Arab - American winning a beauty contest is at least useful for pointing out how some people ’s political opinions are n’t based so much in questions of policy as anti-Muslim animosity .
The level of anger is just so plainly disproportionate to the matter at hand as to be self - implicating . ”
CNN -- A 13 - year - old American became the youngest climber to ever summit Mount Everest on Saturday .
Jordan Romero's journey was tracked through GPS coordinates on his blog , logging his team 's ascent up Everest , which is 29,028 feet ( 8,847 meters ) above sea level .
" Their dreams have now come true , " a statement on Jordan 's blog said .
" Everyone sounded unbelievably happy . "
Before Saturday , the youngest climber to scale Everest was 16 - year - old Temba Tsheri of Nepal .
" I know you would like to hear from the boy himself , but he is currently flat on his belly knocked out , " a member of Jordan 's climbing team said in a message posted Saturday on his blog .
" The effort he put out this last more like 48 hours is -- you 're not going to believe the story when you see it and read about it . "
Romero left for the peak from the Chinese side of the mountain after Nepal denied him permission on age grounds , according to nepalnews.com .
Before starting out , Romero , of Big Bear , California , said he wanted to climb Everest to inspire more young people to get outdoors .
" Obese children are the future of America , the way things are going , " he said on April 9 in Kathmandu .
" I am hoping to change that by doing what I do : climbing and motivational speaking . "
With a smile , he added : " I am doing this a little for myself , too , to do something big . "
Jordan now has climbed six of the seven highest peaks on seven continents , known as the Seven Summits .
" This is not an isolated vacation , " said Paul Romero , Jordan 's father , before the two embarked up Everest in Nepal .
" This is a lifestyle . "
Romero's family started tackling the Seven Summits in summer 2005 .
He was just 9 when they climbed 19,341 feet ( 5,895 meters ) to the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania .
There is a debate about whether the tallest mountain in Oceania is Kosciuszko in mainland Australia or Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia , so Romero and his family climbed both .
The only peak left for him to climb after Everest is the Vinson Massif in Antarctica , which is 16,067 feet ( 4,897 meters ) .
A trip there is planned for December .
Utah Republicans have denied Robert Bennett , a very conservative three - term senator , a place on the ballot , because he ’s not conservative enough .
In Maine , party activists have pushed through a platform calling for , among other things , abolishing both the Federal Reserve and the Department of Education .
And it ’s becoming ever more apparent that real power within the G.O.P. rests with the ranting talk - show hosts .
News organizations have taken notice : suddenly , the takeover of the Republican Party by right - wing extremists has become a story ( although many reporters seem determined to pretend that something equivalent is happening to the Democrats .
It is n’t . )
But why is this happening ?
And in particular , why is it happening now ?
The right ’s answer , of course , is that it ’s about outrage over President Obama ’s “ socialist ” policies — like his health care plan , which is , um , more or less identical to the plan Mitt Romney enacted in Massachusetts .
Many on the left argue , instead , that it ’s about race , the shock of having a black man in the White House — and there ’s surely something to that .
But I ’d like to offer two alternative hypotheses : First , Republican extremism was there all along — what ’s changed is the willingness of the news media to acknowledge it .
Second , to the extent that the power of the party ’s extremists really is on the rise , it ’s the economy , stupid .
China 's Shanghai Exchange ( SSEC ) has decisively broken below a trading range and is dropping fast , down 5 % Monday , 20 % since early May and 25 % so far for 2010 .
Just ten days ago , as China announced more tightening , Marc Faber warned of a China crash .
Dr. McHugh put out a crash !
call this weekend .
After the big drop off 2007 , it was first to rebound , starting in Nov08 , and the first to peak , in Aug09 .
It has been in a big sideways move ever since , but has now dropped below the lower trendline ( chart courtesy ContrarianAdvisor ) :
It is down 25 % in nine months , and well below the 200 DMA , both signals for a big bear market .
Earlier this month the momentum oscillator ( ROC ) crossed to negative , another bear confirmation .
When the 50 DMA fell below the 200 DMA in late March , it was a Death Cross signal :
Now , a case can be made that this is a short term drop , not a crash , but it is getting more difficult after the fast drop of the past two weeks .
Given the volatility of the SSEC , these signals may go away quickly ; also , while it looks like the SSEC is foreshadowing US markets , the reality is that it is much smaller and some pundits say it has little impact on the US .
Instead , it is more like the NASDAQ , driven by the retail investor , as compared with the other Chinese exchange , the ADR , driven by institutions .
( For a really good dissection of the SSEC , go here . )
Hence the views of Jim Trippon , who expects a bounce , and the blog trendlines , which follows China and India closely , that expects a bounce as well .
Trendlines reasons that while the SSEC is in a bear market , after the current downturn , it will go back above the Aug09 levels to complete a C wave of a big ABC off the Nov08 low .
So far it has only retraced 2 % of the big drop off 2007 , and a 50 - 62 % is more common , as we saw with the Hope Rally :
In some respects , however , the SSEC both presages and reacts to other changes globally .
It may not lead the US , but it acts as the most sensitive canary in the global coal .
As I will lay out more in a post on commodities , a fall in the SSEC preceded the big bubble peak in commodities in 2008 , and it may be signaling the peak of the bubble echo in commodities .
The logic is straightforward : China has become a huge buyer of commodities , and in the past year has been stockpiling .
A fall in the SSEC is the leading indicator of a pullback in China 's economy .
Also , Euro weakness may be hitting China .
Europe is a large trading partner with China , and the Euro drop may accelerate an SSEC drop , as it means less imports from China .
The SSEC may not yet be responding to that , but they will .
Most likely the SSEC is falling because Chinese manufacturing growth is slowing .
The tightening is having an effect .
This was signaled by the turndown of the Chinese PMI in Q1 :
It is interesting to read economist opinions on China 's red hot 11.9 % GDP growth in Q1 : largely sanguine about Chinese prospects even though the Q1 jump is largely an artifact of a weak Q1 a year earlier .
There have been concerns over suspicious Chinese stats .
They measure GDP differently - essentially when budgeted , not as actually produced .
The hot Q1 really means spending is out of control , hence the tightening , which includes some fairly dramatic nullifications of local government loan guarantees - an indication of out of control debt - fueld bubble .
Another indication was the surprising Q1 trade deficit .
Those sanguine economists opined it meant China was rebalancing , meaning increasing consumer spending ( imports from trading partners ) .
On the contrary , it was due to investment - growth , not consumption .
Imports surged due to stockpiling of commodities , and exports weakened due to weakness in the US and Europe :
Other than a passion for imported cars , which is driven by their version of Cash4 Clunkers , China is not on a consumption spree :
Instead , China seems to be careening down the Stimulus Road , out of control , and now trying to grab the steering wheel .
The WSJ has wondered what China will do to push back an incipient inflation , and believes they will have to allow the RMB to appreciate .
Mish then asks this question in regards to a rise in the RMB , given tightening :
What would happen if China stopped its stimulus cold turkey , pricked its property bubbles , and allowed the RMB to float freely , and in response the Chinese stock market collapsed , social unrest picked up , and hot money poured out of China ?
Well , the stock markets in China are crashing .
China 2010 may be Japan 1989 .
The huge Chinese stimulus has caused surges that look a lot like Japan after the Plaza Accord in 1986 , or the US in 1927 after the Brits went back on gold at the wrong level .
We ’ve all seen articles devoted to the various web desing “ rules ” out there .
In fact , they ’ve probably been drilled into all of our heads ad nauseum .
And for many , they serve as a comforting set of guidelines that make our lives easier , at least when it comes to design .
But what about those occasions when you have an idea that does n’t quite fit in the rules ?
Or what if you ’re just sick and tired of doing everything by the book and you want to challenge yourself creatively ?
Are the rules really set in stone ?
The answer to that is of course not .
For one thing , a lot of the rules are outdated .
So while they might have been true at one time , they ’re not anymore .
The other thing is that there are almost always circumstances that demand that the rules be bent or broken entirely .
And as designers , we need to learn to recognize those times .
Below are a bunch of commonly - accepted web design rules , along with the reasons you might want to break them , and how to do so effectively .
We ’ve also included examples for each and the one unbreakable rule .
Your Web Page Layout and Design Should be Consistent Throughout the Site
Consistency can help make your visitors feel at home on your site right away .
This makes them more likely to look around and spend more time there .
Comfort is a good thing .
Most of the time .
But there are two problems with this rule .
First , some designers interpret it to mean that every page should be virtually identical .
They use the same basic template for every page on your site , regardless of the content present .
This almost always results in a site that ’s boring and no fun to look at .
The other problem is that different content often calls for different design treatment .
Removing most of the consistency on your site can make for a much more interesting user experience .
Note that I said “ most ” of the consistency , though .
You ’ll want to choose one or two anchor points to keep your visitor from feeling like they ’re visiting a different site entirely every time they go to a different page .
Consider keeping either a design element like your header or color scheme or something as simple as your logo the same on every page on your site .
Case in Point : Jason Santa Maria
Jason Santa Maria ’s website uses a different page design for a large number of his articles .
It ’s refreshing and shows just how much thought he puts into the content he provides .
At the same time , it ’s worth clicking through to multiple posts just for the designs alone .
Always a good thing if you ’re looking for deep engagement from your visitors .
The unifying element that keeps you feeling like you ’re on the same site is the top navigation .
Do n’t Put Important Information Below the “ Fold ”
The “ Fold ” is a holdover term from the world of newspaper design .
In newspapers , it referred to the area in the top half of the front page .
This was the area of the paper that was visible if it was sitting at the newsstand .
The most important news and headlines for the day were located there to entice people to buy the paper .
But here ’s the thing : websites do n’t really have a “ fold ” .
It ’s often touted that the area visible on the home page without scrolling is above the fold , but that ’s not an accurate translation .
With a newspaper , that above - the - fold area was important because it enticed people to purchase the newspaper .
With a website , there ’s no decision like that necessary .
Visitors are already on your site and scrolling is n’t the same kind of psychological decision as handing over money to purchase something .
Case in Point : Sibley / Peteet Design
Most of the space “ above the fold ” is taken up by the header image .
You have to either scroll down or click to see more .
Avoid Using Too Many Different Fonts
The theory behind this rule is that too many fonts make a page look cluttered and unorganized .
And the improper use of too many fonts can result in an amteurish page at best , and a nearly unreadable one at worst .
But there are plenty of ways to use multiple fonts and create a gorgeous and usable website .
The keys are to pay careful attention to the fonts you ’re using and the sizes and weights you ’re using them at .
Use fonts that have similar weights , x-heights , and other related characteristics .
Be careful about mixing too many colors or styles .
If you ’re not comfortable using multiple fonts , you can always cheat and use mutliple weights and styles of a single font .
This is an easier technique that results in a very similar look , especially if you use a font that has a wide variety of variants ( like Georgia or Times New Roman ) .
Mixing italics , bold , small caps , all caps , and different sizes can result in a varied look that ’s still unified .
Case in Point : The Dollar Dreadful
The Dollar Dreadful site uses tons of fonts .
There are well over twenty just on the home page .
But the overall effect is impressive and works well within the theme of the site .
It definitely would n’t be as striking if limited to only one or two fonts .
Keep Everything Simple
Simplicity is overrated .
I ’m sure that single statement already has half of you up in arms and ready to stop reading .
Simplicity has its place .
But there are times when you want something to be complex .
To be multi-layered .
And there ’s nothing wrong with that .
Chances are , your visitors are intelligent enough to figure things out if you still design with them in mind .
There ’s nothing wrong with keeping a website simple if that ’s what you ( or your client ) wants .
But do n’t hold simplicity up as some kind of holy grail of web design .
There are plenty of instances where a more complicated solution is better , and ultimately more usable , than a simple solution would be .
Case in Point : Aussie BBQ Legends
The home page for Aussie BBQ Legends is anything but simple .
With plenty of content , animation , and a disorganized by easy to use navigation system , combined with a large background image , it creates a multi- layered and complex impression while still being easy and fun to use .
Put Navigation in Expected Places
Tradition tells us that navigation should be placed either in the header or the ( left ) sidebar of a website .
Secondary navigation is often placed in the footer , but never primary navigation .
Why ?
People only look to those places because they ’ve been trained to do so .
But there ’s a lot more space available on a web page that could be used .
And if done well , those places can be just as easy to use as navigation in the header or sidebar .
Case in Point : No One Belongs Here More than You
This site not only does n’t put navigation in the expected places ( it ’s in the lower right - hand corner of the page ) , it also uses linear navigation .
You can only go where the site ’s creator wants you to go .
Avoid Bright Background Colors
The idea here is that bright background colors make it difficult to read text placed over them .
But with appropriate contrast and font size , text can be nearly as readable on a bright background as it is on a white or other neutral background .
It all comes down to making appropriate choices for the design .
Case in Point : Helveticons
The Helveticons site has a very bright yellow background , but the use of a dark gray font makes everyone on the page easy to read .
Limit the Information on Each Page
The theory behind this one is that people do n’t like to read long articles .
They want bite - sized information when they ’re online .
Breaking up your content over multiple pages will supposedly help satisfy this desire .
But that ’s not always the case .
Sometimes a visitor is seeking more detailed information .
Clicking through to half a dozen different pages to find information that could have just as easily been placed on a single page is just a waste of time .
Instead , break content up with headers or similar elements to make it easy for those who are just looking for one piece of information to find it without making things more difficult for those who want to read the entire thing .
Case in Point : Wikipedia
Okay , so Wikipedia might not be raking in the design awards , but it does have a huge amount of traffic and excellent user engagement .
Some articles are short , but others might run a few thousand words ( or longer ) .
Wikipedia combines on - page navigation to major sections and headers , subheaders , and lists to create an excellent user experience that still puts a ton of information in a single page .
Focus on Lower Page Weight
This rule comes from the days when a large number of Internet users were connecting over a dial - up connection .
Nowadays , you ’re going to find a lot more visitors are coming to your page over a broadband connection .
And even those still using dial - up are probably used to have sites take ages to load .
Lower page weight is still important , though , to an extent .
You still want your content to load in a matter of a few seconds for the majority of your users .
But this can be achieved just as easily through good coding as purely by page size .
Simple steps like specifying the size of images within a post or page can help make the page more usable even before it ’s fully loaded .
Case in Point : MWP
The Modern Web Projects ( MWP ) site has lots of big images , mostly in the background .
But it pushes the page size well over a meg .
And yet the page still loads just fine on a broadband connection and the size is well worth the effect .
Do n’t Use Big Background Patterns or images
This one ties closely to the previous rule about page weight .
I ’ve seen sites that advocate that your background pattern should be less than 60 pixels square .
But with high - speed internet , that ’s not really necessary anymore .
Another argument against big patterns is that they can be distracting .
That can be true of small patterns , too .
Instead , just make sure the pattern you ’ve chosen to use complements the rest of your site and does n’t detract from your content .
Sometimes giving the background a bit less contrast or making it lighter or darker can help in this without changing the overall look too much .
Case in Point : McClanahan Studios
The background image for McClanahan Studios is huge .
There ’s literally one image for the entire background of the home page .
The same is true for each page on the site .
And yet the background not only does n’t slow down the loading of the site , but also contributes a ton to the feel of the design .
Do n’t Use Splash Pages
Splash pages and intros are often created for absolutely no reason other than to show off the designer ’s Flash abilities .
These types of splash pages should be avoided at all costs .
But that does n’t mean there ’s never a place for splash pages .
Sometimes a splash page that ’s intended for a particular type of visitor is in order .
Let ’s say you ’re a charity trying to get donations for a very specific project .
Instead of changing your entire home page and site design , why not throw up a splash page that invites people to donate ?
It ’s simpler than changing your home page and often times it ’s more effective .
This rule might have been more accurate if they ’d said not to use splash pages without a very good , very specific reason .
( And , “ because I want to ” is n’t a good enough reason . )
Case in Point : Kutztown University Communication Design Department
This splash page serves to simplify navigation for new visitors .
Since education websites traditionally have a ton of content for many types of visitors ( current students , prospective students , parents , alumni , etc. ) , simplifying the visitor ’s first experience is helpful and an appropriate use of a splash page .
Always Incorporate Social Media
This is another rule that a lot of you are probably ready to defend to the death .
But the truth is , not every site is going to benefit from incorporating social media functions .
Let ’s say , for instance , that you ’re designing a site for a product that treats an embarrassing personal problem .
Do you really think anyone is going to share a link or an article on Twitter ?
Are they going to post a link to a site like that on their Facebook wall ?
Probably not .
So there ’s really no point in spending the extra time to incorporate social media options .
Case in Point : Preparation H
No one ’s going to share a link to this on Twitter , so why even bother giving them the option ?
The Three - Click Rule
The idea that every page on your site should be accessible from your home page within three clicks is one of the most pervasive rules out there .
In extreme versions , it ’s not even from the home page , it ’s from every other page on your site .
This rule was invented to make designers more carefully consider their information architecture .
Which is a good thing .
But that does n’t mean that visitors are never going to see a page just because it would take them five clicks to get there .
The key is to use links and navigation to direct users in a way that makes them want to keep clicking .
Information should be easy to find .
But that does n’t mean it needs to be instantly accessible .
One tip , though , if you ’re going to use deeper navigation : include a prominent search box for those people who are too impatient to use your regular navigation options .
Case in Point : Barnes & Noble
Large online retailers are a great example of where the 3 - click rule falls apart .
If you go to the Barnes & Noble site to browse , it ’s virtually impossible to get to any specific category within three clicks .
And unless the book you ’re looking for happens to be featured on one of their main pages , it ’s unlikely you ’ll get to a book within three clicks either .
But B&N has excellent search funcionality , which means you can find whatever you ’re looking for if you ’re in a hurry , without sacrificing the ability to browse categories in a very intuitive and user - friendly way .
The Unbreakable Rule
Your user should always come first .
Whatever rules you ’re thinking of following or breaking , always ask yourself if it ’s going to help or hinder your user .
If you keep their needs and preferences in mind , no matter what rule you break , your site will still likely be successful within your target demographic .

NEW YORK -- A positive drug test notwithstanding , Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing is still The Associated Press NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year .
Five days after he was suspended without pay for four games , a nationwide panel of 50 sports writers and broadcasters who cover the NFL voted again to give Cushing the award .
He did n't receive anywhere near the 39 votes of his previous landslide victory , but the 18 he got in Wednesday 's revote were enough to reclaim the honor .
" I was just glad to hear the news , that people stuck by me .
Very honored , " Cushing said .
" I 'm very happy to have the award once again , and I 'm just happy with how everything turned out . "
Although Cushing said he took a non-steroid substance , the league still considers it a performance enhancer .
The AP decided to have a revote , in which Cushing finished five votes ahead of Buffalo safety Jairus Byrd .
Green Bay linebacker Clay Matthews III got 12 , Washington linebacker Brian Orakpo earned three votes , and St. Louis linebacker James Laurinaitis got one .
Three voters abstained .
In all , 19 voters switched from Cushing to another player , and one voted for Cushing after picking Byrd originally .
" I 'm good , " Byrd said , referring to the result .
" Yeah , I 'm fine with it . "
In the original balloting in January , Cushing received 39 votes to six for Byrd , three for Matthews and two for Orakpo .
Cushing said he was nervous waiting to hear the results of the revote .
What ’s amazing is how much difference some room makes .
I ’ve grown accustomed to reading games on digest - sized pages or not much bigger ; a full - sized book gives rules text and ( crucially ) examples the opportunity to be next to each other .
It ’s a small thing , but it really makes a text easier to get into your head .
( It ’s a bit unfair , this thing of reviewing the layout and the reading experience .
Some days I ’m just in a thick mood and I ’m not going to be able to comprehend anything .
I have the impression that the text in DFRPG v1 : Your Story is just the right balance of getting - to - the - point and spicing - things - up to get through my thick old skull , but maybe I just got lucky .
To make matters worse I read most of it on my new iPod , so this is hardly objective data : maybe I was just mesmerized by the shiny . )
So yes , I ’ve read through Your Story .
As of now I have n’t even cracked the virtual cover of Our World , and besides the occult - Chicago chapter ( wherein Ken Hite will be in his element twice over ) , I ’m unlikely to give it very careful attention .
I ’m approaching DFRPG as an engine for urban - fantasy and contemporary - occult gaming in general and have little interest in the Dresdenverse fiction .
( Although the well - executed margin notes in the voices of the characters have increased that interest . )
For those concerned that a wizards - noir game should n’t feel like Spirit of the Century , I can confirm two things that I half - remember Hicks talking about back in the day but have never been able to find again : the stress tracks work differently , and Fate point refresh works differently .
These two changes really transform the game .
Situations get bad faster , and you ’ll be making more concessions to the situation .
And high - powered characters ?
Well , those powers come with a direct cost to your refresh .
The more juice you can throw around , the fewer Fate points you ’ll get free each session to get out of scrapes with , and the more compels you ’ll need to seek out .
( All of this , of course , feeds right into interesting complication that keeps stories going .
Everything in the game that can hose you can also let you write the next twist of the knife . )
About those compels : yeah , people , it ’s called the Fate engine , not the Free Will engine , as someone said .
What the DF text does better than I ’ve seen anything else do , however , is really explain what that means and what players ’ options are .
Compels “ limit the responses available to a character in a certain situations , ” and can and should be negotiated between the player and the GM .
The page on negotiating compels is one of those hidden bits of system that can really rev an engine when well tuned .
The one chapter of the text where I bogged down a bit was Spellcasting .
Perhaps because I ’m not a Dresdenphile , the balance between fluff and useful tipped over a bit too much towards fluff for me .
It took the reference sheets in back to reveal to me that the two spellcasting systems ( one for instantaneous blasts , one for more considered projects ) strongly resemble skill challenges from D&D 4 .
Given the DF design team ’s work on the now - defunct One Bad Egg project , that influence is n’t a big shocker .
There ’s even a too - brief note in the Running the Game section about , well , using a near - clone of the spell systems as a generalized challenge system .
So there you go .
The last major thing to comment on here is city creation , which comes right up front in the book , before character creation even – and both city creation and character creation are set forth as explicitly collaborative activities , performed by the group together .
The best thing about the city - creation process is there ’s no way it can be mistaken for “ playing before you play ” – you put together a sheet that describes major themes of the city , plus their distillations into Aspects , then does the same for several locations and their possible NPC representatives .
It ’s all descriptive , not prescriptive , but it ’s also not shy about putting players in a position of some knowledge of and authority over setting , going in .
DFRPG spends fairly little time apologizing for its nature or explaining its differences in detail to people already familiar with RPGs .
It just says how things work .
That ’s going to be interesting once this thing hits Barnes and Noble , because it ’s going to be the biggest statement of the recent evolution of RPGs yet to appear in that environment .
On the other hand , it is n’t clear to me how broad the appeal of the license actually is , which could mitigate the effect of mass - market distro .
I look forward to the real - world test .
Valve Corporation 's foray into PC digital games distribution can't be defined as anything less than a success .
Steam , the service , has garnered tons of fanfare from users , critics , and publishers alike for its simplistic design and non-obtrusive DRM .
In early March Valve teased , and then revealed , that a Macintosh version of the client would be on its way .
Even better , the developer announced several of its games were slated to be ported as well .
I 've had the beta of the client , which officially hits on May 12th , for a week .
The two games currently available in the beta are Portal and Team Fortress 2 .
PC users , or Mac owners with Boot Camp , will feel at home with the client .
Its simple interface is mostly unchanged in the Mac beta version .
Tabs indicating its essential functions line the top of its window , displaying the virtual " Store , " your " Library " of games , patch and update " News , " and " Community " functionality .
Invitations from friends , as well as advertisements for games , still pop up with the speed and appearance of a Growl notification .
In fact , the entire program is smooth and fast .
It works and , most importantly , without a hitch .
Cross Platform
Steam for Macintosh and Steam for PC are married via " Steam Play . "
This feature allows you free access to any Mac ports of PC games you 've already purchased through the service .
Games like Portal and Team Fortress 2 support this option , while several more are sure to come .
And keep in mind that this sort of cross- platform approach is something the Valve crew is seemingly taking seriously .
Team Fortress 2
Mac owners like me have been playing with PC owners of the game on their very same servers during this latter end of the beta .
I expect more of this in the future .
On a tangential note : the Steam cloud also keeps all of your information in - line between the two versions .
Friends , profile and Library data is shared between both .
I 'm told that Steam for Mac , though , will have a specific Library option that displays what games you can play on the platform .
It 's currently not in the beta .
Two Source engine games , Portal and Team Fortress 2 , are essentially finished and available for play in the beta .
Both games run natively using OpenGL .
Portal and Team Fortress 2 feel and play like their PC counterparts , though they may not look quite the same for all users .
I , for example , had to do a bit of software - side tweaking to achieve fluid experiences : my 15 " Macbook Pro -- rocking the integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M video card only , 4 Gigs of RAM , and 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo -- could n't handle either game on its " High " settings .
( But do keep in mind that integrated graphics represent the low - end of graphics hardware and those with discrete chipsets should fare much better . )
Team Fortress 2 in particular needed to be brought down to its lowest lows in order to run well .
But even at this point , the game retains its characteristic charm -- both in terms of the over - the - top , manic multiplayer action and presentation .
I 'm not sure if these two titles are the best indicators of what Valve is doing with their ports , though : they 're both old titles .
In the near future Valve will be adding in Mac functionality to Left 4 Dead 2 and its predecessor , as well as the Half - Life series and Counter - Strike : Source .
These games should give us a better idea of what to expect .
As of now , though , I 'm left with the impression of promise and the minor satisfaction of playing games that I 've played on multiple platforms natively on my Macintosh .
Gamepad support , despite it being listed in the options menus for games , is not something the beta has .
I was told by Valve earlier that this support is definitely on their to - do list .
Other developers might have their own to - do lists , too .
As of right now , only one other developer , Tripwire Interactive , have pledged support .
That developer is releasing Mac versions of Red Orchestra Ostfront 41 - 45 and Killing Floor .
Other notable games I 've spotted with " Install " options for the Mac beta are : Torchlight , Peggle Nights , Altitude , Bejeweled 2 Deluxe , the Dash games , Dream Chronicles : The Chosen Child , the Tales of Monkey Island series , and World of Goo .
While there has n't been much to ogle over with the Mac beta of Steam , I still can't stop smiling .
There 's a lot to like with the functionality of Team Fortress 2 and Portal , and a lot to enjoy from Valve 's native - support of the platform .
Games will continue to hit on the service as it grows and grows , and we 'll be direct beneficiaries of its current -- and hopefully future -- dominance as more publishers join the fray .
Valve need only to convince publishers that Mac owners are consumers .
Steam for Mac should become publicly available on May 12th .
Enlarge By Karen Bleier , AFP / Getty Images file The U.S. Treasury building in Washington , D.C. Big banks scored a couple of key victories Tuesday in the battle to shape the sweeping overhaul of financial regulation , following recent gains by consumer advocates .
In a partial victory for banks , the Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly passed an amendment that would largely prevent states from writing new laws to protect consumers from questionable financial products even if no federal law exists .
However , the measure preserves states ' authority to enforce federal rules .
Separately , Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , used a procedural tactic to block a proposal to ban banks from making the kind of proprietary trades in high - risk securities that helped fuel the financial crisis .
The Senate could vote on the bill late this week .
It must then be reconciled with the bill the House passed .
The Senate passed the amendment limiting states ' powers by an 80 - 18 vote after a compromise was reached between Sen .
Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , the bill 's chief architect , and the amendment 's Democratic sponsors .
Under the compromise , federal bank regulators could more easily pre-empt states that pass new laws governing a financial product offered by national banks and thrifts .
Dodd 's original bill would have permitted states to pass such laws if a new consumer watchdog agency has not established similar rules .
Financial institutions say letting states enact a patchwork of laws would confuse consumers and increase costs for providers as they tailor mortgages and other products to various jurisdictions .
" We believe there should be strong consumer - protection laws , and they should be uniform , " says Scott Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable .
However , states would gain new power to enforce federal law .
The original amendment by Sen. Tom Carper , D - Del. , — and another that was defeated — would have rescinded that authority , granted in the Dodd bill .
Carper said the compromise " will give businesses certainty and provide an extra set of cops on the beat " to protect consumers .
Consumer advocates say the subprime mortgage crisis might have been averted if states had the power to write their own rules and enforce federal laws .
Ed Mierzwinski of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group says gaining " 50 state consumer cops " that can enforce federal law is a victory for consumers .
But Lauren Saunders of the National Consumer Law Center says states ' inability to write new laws " makes it harder for states to play their traditional role as first responders " to shady practices .
The amendment Shelby blocked would bar banks from making the types of trades that led to government bailouts and stop firms from betting against securities they sell .
Sen . Jeff Merkley , D - Ore. , a chief sponsor , said Republicans are " standing in the way of real reform . "

For all of the ink that has been spilled about the “ Tea Party movement ” recently , two things seem to have escaped the attention of some of this movement ’s most vocal and vociferous critics .
The first concerns the Constitutional claims the movement is making , and the second concerns the highly suspect version of history in which its members seek to locate themselves .
In making these observations , I also wish to suggest that there is no real evidence to suggest that this is a religious movement , and thus I am not convinced that the Tea Party movement is a symptom of something significant happening to the religious landscape in the United States ; both within the current conservative coalition that is the Republican Party , as well as in our increasingly media - driven global culture .
The Tea Party movement represents something perennial — not something new or novel — in the curious contours of North American society .
Religion ( as I think is very clear in the recent rhetorical decisions of Sarah Palin ) provides a veneer , one that is airbrushed over a movement whose primary images and self - understanding are decidedly economic and vaguely political , as well as nostalgically ( if quirkily ) historical .
Sometimes , it falls to the religion professor , and to the contemporary cultural critic , to remind an audience that religion is not important in some places , all the while admitting to its vast importance in others .
I am not convinced that religion is central to the Tea Party movement , for reasons similar to the ones that explain why religion is not even mentioned in the mission statement of “ Citizens United , ” the group that recently appealed successfully to the Supreme Court , and was rewarded with a vast , overarching ruling that effectively “ bans the ban ” on free and unfettered corporate funding of electioneering speech .
The name for this movement is telling .
Boston ’s original version of a Tea Party took place on the night of December 16 , 1773 , serving as the symbolic culmination of a several - month power struggle between the British Parliament and its North American colonists .
The Parliament , while it had reduced and eliminated some colonial taxes , retained the tea tax , as much as anything else , so as to insist on its right to tax , then and in the future .
Organized protests in major port cities like Charleston , Philadelphia , New York , and Boston , culminated in the extensive destruction of property by a group of colonial Boston agitators , unconvincingly disguised as “ Indians . ”
The fundamental issue at stake was “ taxation without representation . ”
That is important to keep in mind : the primary issue was economic , and the larger principle at stake was political .
Religion played no appreciable role in the affair .
After the success of the long Revolutionary War against these British interests , and the drafting of highly decentralized “ Articles of Confederation ” for the newly liberated colonies , commercial interests again came to the fore .
The virtual absence of centralized regulatory institutions made interstate commerce hopelessly confused and inefficient .
The new country functioned more like thirteen separate countries , or thirteen independent commercial markets .
And so the scattershot Articles were finally replaced by a new federalist Constitution , but not without a fight .
Outraged citizens burned copies of the proposed new Constitution in organized street protests from New York to South Carolina .
But eventually the thing was ratified , and a very different situation emerged , one in which US citizens could be taxed , but only by a federal government in which each of them had representation ( and thus a theoretical stake ) , especially in the legislative branch , which was given the authority to impose such taxes under the fledgling Constitution .
The idea that a centralized government could impose economic policy on all of the former colonies seemed like a dangerously centralized power to many former revolutionaries .
This “ federalist ” Constitution seemed to many of them simply too close to the kind of domineering royalism they had just waged war against .
Moreover , they sensed that the new centralized government , so proposed , might be expected to raise taxes immediately , given the horrible debts it assumed fighting the War for Independence .
The first warning shot fired in this long struggle against such centralized powers of taxation came in the waning years of the short - lived Articles of Confederation .
A rebellion broke out in the same state that had famously hosted the Tea Party just thirteen years earlier , before the revolution .
In 1786 - 87 Shays ’ Rebellion , an armed uprising , broke out against the state government of Massachusetts in response to the state ’s fiscal policy and the consigning of so many impoverished former rebels to debtor ’s prison .
This rebellion was quelled in relatively short order , and most of the rebels were immediately pardoned .
The main effect of Shays ’ Rebellion , ironically enough , was to shore up support for the very centralized powers that had been marshaled to put the rebellion down .
In a contest between the desire for security or decentralized state power , then as now , security wins .
Power centralizes .
Every revolution ironically wants to be the last one , the one that makes future revolutions unnecessary .
And so the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights was ratified by the states in the early 1790s , and shortly thereafter , on the advice of Alexander Hamilton , a new excise tax was imposed on the fledgling nation .
This prompted yet another rebellion , the so - called Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 .
This one started in nearby Pennsylvania , mostly among Scottish and Irish immigrants , for whom whiskey was an important commodity , as well as a way of life .
They did not accept the federal government ’s right to tax it .
President Washington found himself in the ironic position of assembling a federal army to put down the rebellion , which pretty well evaporated when he did so .
Once again , most of the rebels were pardoned , since the federal government had asserted and secured its right to tax , as well as to levy armies to put down an insurrection .
And that , it seems to me , is the relevant ( and perennial ) history symbolically in play today .
North Americans were a fastidiously rebellious people .
The primary issues that inspired such rebellion were economic , and the larger principles at stake were constitutional .
Religion played no appreciable role in these affairs .
The current Tea Partyers are exercising a fundamental Constitutional right , the right to peaceably assemble and to petition their government for the redress of grievances ( that is the language in the selfsame Amendment that earlier guarantees the “ freedom of religion ” ) .
The key terms here are peaceably and grievances .
The Tea Partyers may not assemble to incite violence , which is why it is important to keep in mind that the original Boston Tea Party was decidedly violent — as were the Shays ’ and Whiskey rebellions .
The violence is a part of what made them rebellions , rather than protests .
The Constitution offers no protection in that case ; if anything , such rebelliousness always ends up making the centralized government , and its monopoly on the instruments of violence , more secure .
It is not entirely clear what the grievance of these latter - day Tea Partyers ultimately is , apart from their general dismay at the current level of democratic dysfunction in Washington DC .
The Boston Party objected , quite appropriately , to the taxation of a people who enjoyed no representation in the political bodies doing the taxing .
The current Tea Partyers do enjoy such representation , even if it does n’t always feel that way ; they simply do n’t like the taxes their representatives are imposing on them .
So they ’re really a lot more like Whiskey Rebels than Tea Paryters — which is why the all - too - casual references to the necessity of “ re-loading ” is loaded language indeed .
Such language carries within it the ominous suggestion that , as latter - day Tea Partyers , they do not see themselves as part of the nation currently levying taxes upon them .
So it also announces the not - so - very - veiled possibility of rebellion , sooner rather than later .
This fascinating new movement is not a Party at all , and it is not “ religious ” except to the degree that religion and economics and democracy are breezily equated by some conservative thinkers these days .
No , this Party is a Rebellion in the offing .

" Ausstieg aus der gesamten moralischen Geschichte " Peter Bürger
Warum sich Joseph Ratzinger angesichts des sinkenden Kirchenschiffs kaum aus der Affäre ziehen kann
Als Frauen - und Männerpaare in Europa endlich Rechtssicherheit beim Eingehen fester Partnerschaftsformen erlangt hatten , sprach Kardinal Joseph Ratzinger wiederholt – mit großer Theatralik – von einem " Austritt aus der gesamten moralischen Geschichte der Menschheit " und einer gravierenden " Auflösung des Menschenbildes " .
Warum eine zärtliche Partnerschaft von erwachsenen Menschen gleichen Geschlechts das Tor zur Hölle eröffnen soll , kann das kirchliche Lehramt bis heute freilich nicht plausibel erläutern .
Erklärungen bleibt der Vatikan auch schuldig mit Blick auf die Schande der sexualisierten Priestergewalt an Kindern und Heranwachsenden .
Es handelt sich hierbei durchaus um kein " modernes " Phänomen .
Bei einer Fixierung auf die USA , Irland und – aktuell – auf den deutschsprachigen Raum werden die Enthüllungen kaum stehen bleiben .
Joseph Ratzinger ist als oberster Glaubenswächter und hernach als Papst verantwortlich für den restaurativen Kurs des Römischen Kirchenschiffs , das sich derzeit mächtig im Sinken befindet .
Zur bisherigen Bilanz seines Pontifikates gehören u.a. erneute Attacken gegen die Kirchen der Reformation und die lateinamerikanische Kirche der Armen , die Rehabilitierung der judenfeindlichen und dem letzten Konzil widersprechenden Tridentinischen Liturgie , der Skandal der Regensburger " Islam - Vorlesung " , ein neuer Eurozentrismus und Zentralismus der lateinischen Kirche , die von einem renommierten katholischen Sozialwissenschaftler als " Schrottpapier " titulierte Sozialenzyklika , ein durch die Blume ausgesprochener Häresieverdacht1 gegen den großen Konzilstheologen Karl Rahner ( 1904 - 1984 ) , ein spektakulär angekündigtes Papstbuch , das in Wirklichkeit die meisten Leser langweilt und viele Brücken zur Aufklärung hin wieder abreißt , ein verantwortungsloses Kondomvotum mit Blick auf den von AIDS heimgesuchten afrikanischen Kontinent , Rückwärtsgänge bezogen auf die interreligiösen und pazifistischen Verdienste seines unmittelbaren Vorgängers , der drohende Supergau einer Seligsprechung ausger echnet von Papst Pius XII .
sowie die Öffnung der Kirchentore für rechtsradikale Traditionalistenkreise …
Die Skandale um Sexualität und Priesteramt werden wohl die nachhaltigste Krise dieses Pontifikates bewirken , denn hier zeichnet sich erstmals ein durchgreifender Widerspruch aus dem bürgerlichen Kirchenvolk ab , der auch bislang unverdächtige Kirchengetreue erfasst .
Auf der Beliebtheitsskala macht der Pontifex einen Sturzflug nach unten .
Ratlose und depressive Theologen wissen in diesen Tagen kaum , wie sie angesichts all der abscheulichen Grabbeigaben des Karfreitags eine fröhliche Osterpredigt zuwege bringen sollen .
Äußerungen der besonders romtreuen Bischöfe rufen bei den Opfern sexualisierter Gewalt , aber auch bei vielen Gläubigen Empörung hervor .
Endlos ist die Geduld , mit der man unten Autismus und Unbeweglichkeit des römischen Systems zu tragen gewillt ist , wohl kaum .
On Tuesday evening , April 27 , in its heralded 30 for 30 sports documentary series , ESPN will broadcast in prime time the behind - the - scenes story — and tragedy — of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams ’ unfortuitous rise to pro football fame during this prolonged epoch of cannabis prohibition ( which began in 1937 ) .
For college and NFL football fans of the late 1990s , no player has grabbed more controversial headlines , over a longer period of time , for really nothing more than preferring cannabis to alcohol , than Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams .
In a fascinating , multi- year documentary by Sean Pamphilon , a former ESPN producer , for the first time the general public and massive NFL fan base can watch the story that tracks Ricky ’s amazingly erratic football career in Run Ricky Run , from his unwillingness to cut his dreads to play for the top- ranked and legendary University of Texas Longhorns ( where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1998 , college football ’s top honor ) to the New Orleans Saints where he was a top five draft pick , and finally the Miami Dolphins — all the while dogged by Ricky ’s personal choice to continue to use cannabis while hugely influential and powerful institutions in American society ( NCAA , U of TX , NFL and corporate sponsors ) wrestled with his very personal ( and consequential ) choice , largely punishing him and making him something of a martyr in professional sports .
I ’ve had the pleasure of seeing parts of this fascinating documentary in the past and recommend this final production ’s viewing as a way for us all to better understand the intersection of professional athletes , morality , the law and corporate public relations .

Wayne Treacy , the 15 - year - old who nearly killed a Deerfield Beach Middle School student , was charged as an adult .
News for Florida criminal lawyers -
Boy charged as adult with attempted murder after attack on Deerfield Beach Middle School student .
Deerfield Beach , FL — Prosecutors will charge Wayne Treacy , the 15 - year - old boy who attacked an eighth grade girl after she allegedly sent him offensive text messages regarding the recent suicide of his brother , as an adult in the premeditated attempted murder case .
The ninth grade offender was formally indicted on Friday , April 16 , 2010 , denied bond and arraigned via video on Saturday , April 17 , 2010 .
However , Treacy ’s attorney told him to remain quiet during the cyber arraignment and he is expected to plead not guilty to the charges at hand , according to information provided by the Palm Beach Post , United Press International and previous coverage by Justice News Flash .
As a result of the March 17 , 2010 beating , Ratley had to undergo surgery to reduce the swelling in her brain .
According to the victim ’s attorney in a news conference Wednesday morning , April 14 , 2010 , “ Josie is now awake and doctors have conducted a series of exams and tests on her .
Unfortunately , the results of that testing have confirmed their worst fears .
Josie has experienced a traumatic brain injury .
The area of the brain that has been most damaged is to the area that includes the ability to communicate .
Josie cannot speak , Josie cannot walk and Josie has limited function in her right arm , right hand and right fingers …
Josie will require extensive and long - term rehabilitative care , including physical therapy , occupational therapy and speech therapy .
Finally , Josie is scheduled to undergo surgery next Monday , April 19th . ”
Reports also noted 13 - year - old Kayla Manson , the young girl who allegedly led Treacy to Ratley on the day of the vicious attack , was charged as an accomplice in the beating .
Under Florida law , unless Ratley succumbed to her injuries , Manson could not be charged as an adult .
On Friday , Manson reportedly pleaded not guilty to the indictment of principal to attempted murder .
According to the attorney representing the defendant , Treacy , “ You had a rational 15 - year - old who at some point after his brother ’s death became irrational …
Something in his head snapped . ”
Treacy was transferred from a juvenile detention center and is being detailed in county jail .
If convicted of premeditated attempted murder , Treacy could spend his life in prison .

An army officer who is facing court - martial charges after refusing orders to deploy to Afghanistan has been attracting support from a number of prominent figures on the extreme right .
The most recent endorsement of Lt. Col .
Terry Lakin ’s claim that no orders issued by the US military are legitimate because President Barack Obama is not a native - born American citizen comes from Maj. Gen. ( ret. )
Paul Vallely , who stated in a radio interview featured on Friday by the conservative website WorldNetDaily that he believes Lakin has “ a valid point . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I think many in the military — and many out of the military — question the natural - birth status of Barack Obama , ” Vallely remarked .
“ I ’m not convinced that he is [ a natural - born citizen ] . ”
Even before Vallely weighed in on the case , Lakin ’s defiance was coming to be seen as something of a publicity stunt .
Dave Weigel , who blogs about the conservative movement for the Washington Post , headed a Friday entry , “ Yes , the birther soldier is doing this for publicity ” and described WorldNetDaily as “ the ground zero for coverage of this stuff . ”
WorldNetDaily previously promoted an appearance by Lakin and his lawyer on the syndicated radio show of convicted Watergate felon G. Gordon Liddy .
Jerome Corsi , author of the anti-Kerry Unfit for Command and more recently of a widely - criticized book slamming Obama , has also been publicizing the Lakin case in his role as a WorldNetDaily reporter .
Vallely ’s participation brings a new dimension to the case , however .
His words may appear to carry more weight because he is a former military officer , but they also raise certain suspicions because of his extensive history of involvement in propaganda operations .
Vallely first came to prominence as the co-author of “ From PSYOP to Mindwar : The Psychology of Victory ” ( 1980 ) which advocated “ the deliberate , aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win that war . ”

Since retiring from the Army in 1991 , he has served as a military analyst for Fox News , and he was named by The New York Times in 2008 as a participant in a Pentagon propaganda operation which covertly employed retired officers to support the Bush administration ’s war on terror .
Vallely is also known for his claim that he had heard Joseph Wilson boasting in 2002 that his wife , Valerie Plame , was a CIA officer — well before she was outed by Robert Novak .
Wilson ultimately threatened to sue both Vallely and WorldNetDaily unless the claim was retracted .
And finally , Vallely spent much of 2003 insisting that Saddam Hussein ’s weapons of mass destruction had been smuggled out of Iraq prior to the war and hidden in Syria .
He is also a long - time advocate of regime change in Iran and a supporter of the terrorist group Mujahedeen e-Khalq ( MEK ) .

Vallely ’s latest shift from Middle East warhawk to birther may seem like a strange transition .
It does suggest , however , that there is more to the Lakin case than has so far met the eye .

5 Eye-Opening Methods to Stop Spending Money and Start Saving
Did you know that people who make more than $ 75,000 per year are the ones most
The tour starts at a restaurant just outside Colorado City .
It 's called the Merry Wives Café , which is ironic because there 's nothing very merry about this remote and windswept town on the border between Arizona and Utah , since local authorities have n't got round to re-legalising the sale of alcohol following the end of Prohibition in 1933 .
But if we 're going to split hairs , the people who named the café deserve credit for at least one thing : the local community does indeed contain an awful lot of wives .
Our guide , Richard Holm , should know .
He 's been married three times : first , to his childhood sweetheart , Shauna , in 1971 ; then to a much younger woman , Lorena , in 1985 ; and finally , to a girl called Alice , in 1996 .
Between them , these lucky ladies bore him 17 children .
Oh , and in keeping with local custom , all three were married to him at exactly the same time .
That 's because Colorado City is a polygamist community , and for many years , Richard was one of its most enthusiastic members .
Today , things are different .
The 57 - year - old still lives in the town , with its vast , 30 - room homes holding extended poly - families , but he's no longer a member of the Mormon sect which has safeguarded the tradition of plural marriage there since the 1930s .
He 's abandoned organised religion , divorced all three wives , and recently launched a new career as a tour guide , taking bus parties of curious visitors around his hometown , on a trip he calls " The Polygamy Experience . "
" Tourism is such a big industry in the region , with Vegas a few hours away and Zion National Park around the corner , but this has always been a closed community , " he explains .
" I want to change that .
I want people to stop in Colorado City : to look round , spend a bit of money , and try to understand .
Locals have their doubts : they say they do n't want to be treated like monkeys in a zoo , and I understand that .
But I aim to be respectful . "
Richard packs small tour parties into his car , and transports larger groups around the dusty streets of Colorado City in a 30 - seater bus .
The tour lasts four hours , costs $ 70 each , and consists of a compelling mixture of local history and Richard 's well - worn personal anecdotes , interspersed with faintly - bawdy jokes .
" Why the prairie dresses and long braids ? " reads a leaflet advertising the tour , illustrated with pictures of local women in their traditional outfits .
" Why take more than one wife ? "
Find out for yourself , from guides who " have lived and loved The Creek " – the name locals give the town .
Our trip this week took in the town cemetery , where " prophets " are buried , and its parks framed by red cliffs , where locals like to hold their massive family picnics ( Holm had 34 brothers , 25 sisters , and 11 " mothers " ) .
At the end , we stopped to buy home - made ice cream and cheese from the local dairy .
You may have heard of Colorado City because it's home to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints ( FLDS ) , which was thrust to the centre of a media firestorm in 2008 when police raided one of its compounds in Texas and took 400 children into care .
The kids were returned to their parents , but not before roughly a dozen senior figures connected to the church had been charged with offences including corruption , fraud , and child abuse .
The church 's leader , Warren Jeffs , is a somewhat notorious figure .
To followers , he 's a prophet with a hotline to God ; to outsiders he 's a silver - tongued cult leader and fraud , who marries underage girls off to his elderly cronies .
Either way , he spent time on the run from the FBI , who added him to the " America 's Most Wanted " list , before he was arrested and convicted as an accessory to child rape .
He 's serving 10 years to life in Utah State Prison .
Last month , two of his closest associates were jailed on similar charges .
Against this backdrop , Colorado City views outsiders with suspicion .
Residents take exception to being gawped at by tour parties , and dislike being photographed in their traditional outfits : prairie - style dresses , big hair , and no make - up for the ladies to symbolise modesty .
Richard is adamant his tours will reinvigorate the local economy and increase understanding of a vilified way of life .
" At its best , polygamy teaches self restraint and love , and self - discipline , " he said .
" It teaches you to share and to build a community .
I do think it can go too far : the underage marriages , and the abuse and fraud that takes place under the cover of secrecy and darkness , that 's got to stop .
But consenting adults should be allowed to live how they like within the umbrella of decency and the law , and if they want , have more than one wife . "
Ever wondered about the nuts and bolts of daily life in a plural marriage ?
Richard says domestic arrangements are organised in a way familiar to viewers of the TV series Big Love : wives " share " a husband by sleeping with him in rotation , and taking joint responsibility for bringing up each others ' children .
These extended families inhabit Colorado City 's enormous homes , generally hidden behind high fences , walls , and " keep out " signs .
The tradition of polygamy began with the Mormon Church , whose founder Joseph Smith decided that , to make it into heaven , a man needed to have at least three wives .
It was abandoned by the organisation in the late 19th century , after Smith 's death , so Utah could be allowed to join the United States .
At the time , Mormon elders claimed to have experienced a " revelation " in which God told them to revert to normal , exclusive marriages .
But some followers refused to buy that .
They formed conservative sects in remote regions of Utah , Arizona and Idaho , and carried on practising polygamy .
An estimated 37,000 remain .
The FLDS is one of the most successful of the breakaway sects and Colorado City , with 8,000 residents , has grown into the biggest polygamist town in the US and possibly the world .
The church , which controls all the town 's land via a trust , has built its own hospital , a zoo , and several schools .
One prominent local runs a well - known luxury hotel chain .
Like most Mormon sects , the FLDS is headed by a " prophet , " or elder who has declared himself in direct contact with the Heavenly Father .
He controls the organisation 's finances , collected via a monthly levy or " tithe " on members .
More importantly , he 's also put in charge of deciding when a man ought to be allowed to acquire new wives .
" Each month , I would go to see the Prophet and pay him my tithes , " said Richard .
" I 'd give at least 10 per cent of my income .
I did well for myself in the construction business , so that was a decent sum of money .
One day , over a decade after I 'd taken my first wife , the Prophet said he'd had a revelation and that I should get married to Lorena , who I 'd never met .
That 's how I became a polygamist . "
The flip side of the enormous power wielded by church elders is of course that it can be abused .
Richard experienced this first hand when the FLDS prophet Leroy Johnson died , to be replaced first by an elderly man called Rulon Jeffs , and later by his son , the now - notorious Warren , who took charge in 2002 , and promptly added his father 's several dozen wives to his harem of over 100 .
Warren spent millions of dollars of the church 's money supporting his extravagant lifestyle and building a new community , called the Yearning for Zion ranch , at Eldorado in Texas , where he moved with 1,000 followers .
During childhood , Warren had often clashed with Richard ; once in power , he decided to get even , ejecting him from the FLDS in 2003 .
" One by one , my wives were called to see Warren and told he'd had a revelation from God , telling him I was wicked and sinful , and they should leave me and marry someone else , " said Richard .
" By November that year , they 'd gone , taking my children with them . "
Richard spent $ 200,000 on a court battle to be given access to his kids ( which he won ) .
He was evicted from his home by the church ( a move he overturned ) .
And his construction firm collapsed when one of his ex-wives , on the advice of Jeffs , remarried his brother and business partner , Edson .
In all , he says , it cost him $ 2 m .
Church followers are banned from having television sets , and their internet access is closely monitored , since the local web provider is a company run by a church elder .
They live , for the most part , in closeted isolation .
Despite this , and because of heroic efforts by people like Richard , Colorado City is slowly becoming more open .
Members of the FLDS , who number at least 6,000 locals , largely believe Jeffs to be a martyr who has fallen victim to religious persecution .
" His defence , " said Richard , " is that no court or government has the right to tell God 's prophet what to do . "
But others have grown sceptical of his reign , during which the FBI believes $ 96 m was siphoned from the local community .
A feature - length documentary about the FLDS , Sons of Perdition , is attracting buzz on the film festival circuit , and hits cinemas this summer .
It tells the story of young men expelled as teenagers to prevent them attempting to marry girls who church elders would rather have for themselves .
And with Jeffs in prison , and many associates awaiting trial , the FLDS has abandoned some of its excesses .
From the church itself , however , there remains a deafening silence .
When Richard first announced that he was launching his tours , shortly before Christmas , FLDS spokesman Willie Jessop complained to a local newspaper that " [ Visitors ] want to come into the community like it's a spectacle , when for us , it 's like the circus is coming to town .
We hope people have more of a life than to be suckered into that sort of scam . "
A deputy director of China 's most powerful economic ministry has come out swinging against climate change denial .
Senior Chinese government figures have described the view that climate change is not man-made as an " extreme " stance which is out of step with mainstream thought .
The comments were made during China 's annual sitting of the National People 's Congress .
During the congress , a series of press conferences are held which , in many cases , are the only chance to put questions to members of China 's power elite .
Last night , one such press conference was held on the subject of climate change .
The ABC asked the panel what they thought of the view that climate change had nothing to do with human activity and was in fact a natural phenomenon .
Xie Zhenhua , a deputy director at China 's powerful economic ministry , the National Development and Reform Commission , answered that he believed that made - made climate change denial is , at best , a very marginal view .
" Climate change is a fact based on long - time observations by countries around the world , " he said .
" There are two different views regarding the causes for global warming .
" The mainstream view is that climate change is caused by burning of fossil fuel in the course of industrialisation .
" There 's a more extreme view which holds that human activity has only an imperceptible impact on the natural system . "
He said the responsibility for this climate change rested squarely with the Western world , so the onus was on it to clean up the mess caused in the rush to industrialisation .
" The climate in China is warming .
It 's something every one of us can feel , " he said .
" Climate change is having an impact on China in terms of the instability of agricultural output .
" There 's now more flooding in the south of China and increasing shortages of water in the north .
Forests and grasslands are being eroded and there are more typhoons and storm surges along our coast .
" So , if you look ahead to the long term , climate change may have a huge impact on China 's food security and the life and property of our people . "
The chairman of the Congress Environmental and Resources Protection Committee , Wang Guangtao , also spoke .
He acknowledged there were some experts who believed current statistics on climate change were not reliable enough .
But he said that merely meant more work needed to be done on the minutiae of the statistics .
He said that did not detract from the pressing need to reduce fossil fuels and expand the world 's forest coverage .
Redwood City , California ( CNET ) --
Apple pressed local police to investigate the loss of a next - generation iPhone a day after Gizmodo published photographs , telling investigators that the prototype was so valuable , a price could not be placed on it , according to court documents made public Friday .
In response to arguments made by CNET and other media organizations , a San Mateo judge unsealed documents that provide a detailed glimpse into an April 20 meeting between Apple lawyers and executives , and law enforcement .
They also highlight a madcap dash for evidence that evening that led a police detective to a gas station , a church , and a bush in Redwood City where a thumb drive and a 1GB Lexar Media compact flash card were allegedly hidden .
During the meeting with law enforcement , Apple attorney George Riley told detectives that the publication of evidence of the device by Gizmodo -- part of Gawker Media - - was immensely damaging .
" People that would have otherwise purchased a currently existing Apple product would wait for the next item to be released , thereby hurting overall sales and negatively effecting Apple 's earnings , " Riley said , according to an affidavit prepared by a police detective made public on Friday .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs personally contacted Gizmodo editor Brian Lam to request the prototype 's return the day the story was published on April 19 , but Lam refused to do so , unless the company provided " confirmation that it is real , from Apple , officially , " according to an e-mail message that was also made public .
" Right now , we have nothing to lose , " Lam wrote .
" The thing is , Apple PR has been cold to us lately .
It affected my ability to do my job right at iPad launch .
So we had to go outside and find our stories like this one , very aggressively . "
( Gawker Media had offered to pay anyone who gave it or lent it an Apple prototype . )
Brian Hogan , a 21 - year - old Redwood City , Calif. , resident , found the phone in a bar .
But the affidavit prepared by detective Matthew Broad in the San Mateo County Sheriff 's Office reveals that an important tip came when Hogan 's roommate , Katherine Martinson , called police on April 21 to let them know that he had examined it .
Hogan told her that Gizmodo had offered him $ 10,000 for the phone , and showed her a camera box containing $ 5,000 in $ 100 bills , according to the affidavit .
It says : " Martinson said Hogan also told her that he will receive a cash bonus from Gizmodo.com in July , if and when Apple makes an official product announcement regarding the new iPhone . "
Broad , the San Mateo County detective , began to prepare a request to search the apartment on Farm Hill Blvd .
the following day when , he said , he received an urgent phone call just before midnight from Martinson , saying Hogan and their roommate Thomas Warner were removing any evidence about the iPhone from the apartment and leaving in two separate cars .
Broad said he tracked Hogan down at his father 's house , also in Redwood City , and learned that Hogan 's computer had been left at a nearby church .
Warner showed up the house at 1 a.m. and was arrested on two outstanding misdemeanor warrants .
Warner claimed that a prototype sticker from the iPhone fell out of his wallet at a Chevron station , and later said a 512MB thumb drive and 1GB Lexar compact flash card were under a bush on Harding Avenue , the affidavit says .
Police say they recovered all the discarded hardware .
A First Amendment Fight
In a response to a motion from a group of media companies that included CNET , the Associated Press , Bloomberg , the Los Angeles Times , and Wired.com , Judge Clifford Cretan reversed his earlier ruling and ruled on Friday that circumstances had changed , and now secrecy was no longer necessary .
" It appears appropriate to me at this time to unseal the affidavit , " Cretan said .
" I can no longer say there is an overriding interest in sealing . "
On Friday , San Mateo County District Attorney Chris Feasel told the judge that there is no precedent that gives " the court the authority to unseal the search warrant at this time . "
Feasel had argued that until charges were filed and there was a criminal defendant , news organizations had no right to access the documents .
Cretan ordered that the affidavit to search Gizmodo editor Jason Chen 's home and his April 28 order sealing the affidavit be made available to the public no later than 2 p.m. PDT Friday .
" It 's gratifying that the judge was willing to reconsider his decision and recognize that circumstances have changed , " Roger Myers , the San Francisco attorney who represented the media coalition , said after the ruling was made .
Background
The story began in March , when Gray Powell , a 27 - year - old Apple computer engineer , forgot what may be a 4G iPhone phone at a German beer garden in Redwood City , Calif . , after a night of drinking .
With the help of friends , Hogan allegedly approached multiple tech news sites before finally selling the handset to Gizmodo for $ 5,000 .
( Sage Robert Wallower , a 27 - year - old University of California at Berkeley student , was allegedly one of those friends who contacted technology sites . )
Prosecutors in the case say they are conducting a felony theft investigation , but no charges have been filed .
On April 23 , just hours after CNET reported that Apple had contacted law enforcement officials about the phone and an investigation was under way , police showed up at Chen 's home in Fremont , Calif. , across the bay from San Francisco .
After breaking down his door , they confiscated three Apple laptops , a Samsung digital camera , a 32 GB Apple iPad , a 16GB iPhone , and other electronic gear , according to documents Gizmodo posted .
Apple ranks among the most security - conscious companies , and it has gone to great lengths to prevent leaks about its products .
To secure trade secrets , the company has not shied away from high - profile courtroom fights .
It filed a lawsuit against Mac enthusiast Web site Think Secret , for example , to unearth information about a leak .
A state appeals court ruled in favor of the Web site .
In that case , Apple argued that information published about unreleased products causes it significant harm .
" If these trade secrets are revealed , competitors can anticipate and counter Apple 's business strategy , and Apple loses control over the timing and publicity for its product launches , " Apple wrote in a brief .
Under a California law dating back to 1872 , any person who finds lost property and knows who the owner is likely to be -- but " appropriates such property to his own use " -- is guilty of theft .
There are no exceptions for journalists .
In addition , a second state law says any person who knowingly receives property that has been obtained illegally can be imprisoned for up to one year .
Knowing that an item probably belonged to someone else has previously led to convictions .
" It is not necessary that the defendant be told directly that the property was stolen .
Knowledge may be circumstantial and deductive , " a California appeals court has previously ruled .
" Possession of stolen property , accompanied by an unsatisfactory explanation of the possession or by suspicious circumstances , will justify an inference that the property was received with knowledge it had been stolen . "
A California law says lost property valued at $ 100 or more must be turned over to police .
And here 's another tidbit from the affidavit , explaining Steve Jobs ' involvement :
" Apple General Counsel Bruce ]
Sewell told me that after Gizmodo.com released its story regarding the iPhone prototype on or about 4/19/2010 , Steve Jobs ( Apple CEO ) contacted the editor of Gizmodo.com , Brian Lam .
Jobs requested that Lam return the phone to Apple .
Lam responded via the e-mail address ... that he would return the iPhone on the condition that Apple provided him with a letter stating the iPhone belonged to Apple . "

So , hey , reader question .
( Not the kind you ask me so I can show off my expertise on my blog .
The kind of question I ask you , gentle reader .
Why ?
Well , I ’m not a big fan of open threads , but I am a fan of y’all , and I ’ve been kind of inspired by the conversations we ’ve been having by riffing on a simple , open - ended question down at Vegas Anarchist Cafe ; makes me curious about how some of these things go in other communities I ’m part of ) .
Anyway , what I ’m wondering right now , is –If you think of yourself as an Anarchist , how did you become an Anarchist ?
( Take that as you will — how you came to accept the ideas , or how you came to call yourself an Anarchist , or …. )
Or , if you do n’t think of yourself as an Anarchist , what do you think of yourself as ?
And how did you get to be that ?
What do you think ?
Let ’s talk in the comments .
A US federal court has ordered a documentary film - maker to hand over footage relating to pollution in the Amazon to the oil giant Chevron , the latest twist in a multibillion - dollar lawsuit .
Judge Lewis Kaplan , of the district court in Manhattan , yesterday ruled in favour of Chevron 's request to view 600 hours of outtakes from the award - winning film Crude : The Real Price Of Oil .
The 105 - minute film sympathises with the victims of an environmental catastrophe in Ecuador 's oil - producing Amazon region , but Chevron hopes unused segments will help it to fend off potential damages of $ 27.3 bn ( £ 17.9bn ) .
Joseph Berlinger , who directed the documentary , said turning over footage would violate journalistic privilege and undermine the lawsuit in Ecuador , one of the biggest in history .
Environmentalists fear Chevron will get ammunition and investigative film - makers fear their that integrity and ability to protect sources will be compromised .
But the judge ruled that transparency and justice would be served by allowing the company to view footage shot in Ecuador and the US over three years , including interviews with environmental activists such as Sting and his wife , Trudie Styler .
" Review of Berlinger 's outtakes will contribute to the goal of seeing not only that justice is done , but that it appears to be done , " the ruling said .
" The court expresses no view as to whether the concerns of either side are supported by proof of improper political influence , corruption or other misconduct affecting the Ecuadorian proceedings . "
Crude , released last year , focuses on the 17 - year legal battle between Chevron and 30,000 Ecuadorians who say their land , rivers , wells , livestock and own bodies were poisoned by decades of reckless oil drilling in the rainforest .
The plaintiffs say Texaco – which was taken over by Chevron in 2001 – dumped 68bn litres of waste water between 1972 and 1990 , causing an epidemic of diseases such as leukaemia .
Some have called it the Amazon 's Chernobyl .
Chevron says scientific tests show the water is safe , that the diseases have other causes , that Texaco cleaned up the site and pollution since then is the fault of the state company , Petroecuador .
An Ecuadorean judge based in Lago Agrio , a jungle town named after Texaco 's headquarters , is expected to rule on the lawsuit within two months .
Chevron , braced for defeat in what it says is a biased tribunal , has vowed to fight on .
Kent Robertson , a Chevron spokesman , welcomed the US ruling .
" The raw footage from Crude is an objective account of what is truly occurring in the shadows of this lawsuit and we are eager to bring these events to light .
Given the level of opposition to Chevron gaining access to the outtakes , we have to believe there is ... damning content that was left on the cutting room floor .
It 's in the interest of justice that these events are known more broadly . "
He said Berlinger may have unwittingly captured misconduct by the Ecuadorean court and the plaintiffs ' legal team .
He cited a scene allegedly showing the legal team participating in a focus group with a supposedly neutral court expert – a segment included in the Sundance film festival screening but edited out of the DVD version .
The director said there was no smoking gun and the controversial scene was not of a focus group but a routine meeting that indicated no wrongdoing .
Crude was a balanced film that gave Chevron 's side of the story , Berlinger said .
Maura Wogan , Berlinger 's lawyer , said the ruling would cause " grave harm " to documentary film - makers and investigative journalists , adding : " We 're very surprised by the court 's lack of sensitivity to journalists ' privilege . "
Berlinger said he had received support from hundreds of other filmmakers who feared a " chilling " impact on documentaries if sources ' protection could not be guaranteed .
The director said he would appeal against the ruling .

Image caption Adobe has repeated a desire to " move away " from Apple products .
Adobe has posted a short response to the letter Apple boss Steve Jobs has written about Flash technology .
In it , Adobe said the legal terms Apple imposed on software developers had led it to shift its focus away from Apple .
Mr Jobs used the open letter to defend Apple 's decision not to allow Flash on many of the firm 's products .
In it he criticised Flash , saying it was not fit for an era of smartphones and touchscreen devices .
Critical stance
Kevin Lynch , Adobe 's chief technology officer , wrote in a blog posting : " We feel confident that were Apple and Adobe to work together as we are with a number of other partners , we could provide a terrific experience with Flash on the iPhone , iPad and iPod touch . "
Image caption Adobe will concentrate on Android and other devices .
Currently , none of these products can run the Flash technology which is used on many websites to power media players , games and other animations .
However , added Mr Lynch , Adobe has decided to shift its focus to get Flash working well on gadgets made by Google , RIM , Palm , Microsoft , Nokia and others .
He said Adobe expected to release Flash Player 10.1 on Google 's Android operating system in May and then for it to be on general release in June .
" From that point on , " he wrote , " an ever increasing number and variety of powerful , Flash - enabled devices will be arriving which we hope will provide a great landscape of choice . "
The letter came soon after Adobe announced it would stop making tools that allow developers to quickly translate Flash code to run on Apple gadgets .
These allowed developers to make applications once and then distribute them for use on various phones and operating systems , including Apple 's iPhone .
Adobe 's announcement followed a change to the terms and conditions of the licence that software developers must sign when writing code to run on Apple products .
That change banned developers from using automatic translation tools , effectively forcing them to develop two applications - one for Apple products and one for everything else .
Hypocrisy
Other Adobe executives have commented on Mr Jobs ' letter .
Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen told the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) that " when you resort to licensing language " to restrict development , it has " nothing to do with technology " .
He said it was now " cumbersome " for developers who were forced to have " two workflows " .
Mr Narayen said the problems highlighted by Mr Jobs were " a smokescreen " .
He added that if Flash crashed Apple products it was something " to do with the Apple operating system " .
He said he found it " amusing " that Mr Jobs thought that Flash was a closed platform .
" We have different views of the world , " Mr Narayan told the Wall Street Journal .
" Our view of the world is multi-platform . "
Crashing Macs
In his lengthy open letter titled Thoughts on Flash , Mr Jobs said the reason Apple did not want people to use Adobe 's automatic translation tools was because experience had shown it results in " sub- standard apps " .
He described Flash as a closed system and said that it was bad for the smartphone era because it did not support multi- touch systems and helped drain battery power unnecessarily .
He also pointed out that there were now alternatives to Flash technology , particularly for web video .
The Apple boss added that Flash fell short on security and was " the number one reason Macs crash " .
The letter provoked an avalanche of comments online , with many saying Apple 's restrictions on what can be done with its software go far beyond those on Flash .
In an editorial on OS News , Tom Holwerda said Mr Jobs ' letter was " hypocritical " because Apple was guilty of many of the faults it levelled at Adobe .
Rent Seeking Cotton Farmers of the World Unite !
It always warms my tender heart to hear about rusticating farmers who care about each other .
Take these U.S. cotton farmers .
About 20,000 of them .
The U.S. government provides these tillers of the American pastoral with a subsidy of about $ 3 billion a year .
And all was good .
But then , the WTO had to get nosy –I know , the nerve ! –because as part of a big bad trade agreement , the U.S. promised not to harm farmers elsewhere in the world , like in Brazil .
Et in arcadia ego , those Brazilians say .
I guess they had trouble competing against a heavily subsidized American way of life .
Go figure .
So anyway these cotton farmers in Brazil sued the U.S. for breaking its trade agreement .
And they won .
What would be the sensible thing to do here ?
Keep your trade agreement and end the subsidy to U.S. farmers , right ?
No , instead , the U.S. agreed to subsidize the Brazilian farmers .
Yes , you read that correctly .
Rent seeking has gone global .
Time reporter Michael Grunwald is on the case :
What could be more outrageous than the hefty subsidies the U.S. government lavishes on rich American cotton farmers ?
How about the hefty subsidies the U.S. government is about to start lavishing on rich Brazilian cotton farmers ?
If that sounds implausible or insane , well , welcome to U.S. agricultural policy , where the implausible and the insane are the routine .
Our perplexing $ 147.3 million–a - year handout to Brazilian agribusiness , part of a last - minute deal to head off an arcane trade dispute , barely even qualified as news ; on Tuesday , April 6 , it was buried in the 11th paragraph of this Reuters story .
( The New York Times gave it 10th - paragraph play . )
If you ’re perplexed , here ’s the short explanation :
We ’re shoveling our taxpayer dollars to Brazilian farmers to make sure we can keep shoveling our taxpayer dollars to American farmers — which is , after all , the overriding purpose of U.S. agricultural policy .
Basically , we ’re paying off foreigners to let us maintain our ludicrous status quo .

The Consumers Against Retail Discrimination Alliance or " CARD Alliance " is a project of the Electronic Payments Coalition , whose members include Visa , MasterCard , Bank of America , JP Morgan Chase , U.S. Bank , Citi and virtually every banking association .
The group purports to be concerned about consumers paying fees on purchases when they use debit cards .
The financial industry created the " group " in response to an item in a regulatory reform bill that would protect consumers by allowing the federal government to limit on debit card acceptance fees for retailers .
The " CARD Alliance " casts this effort as " retail discrimination " and says the measure would force people " to have to carry around cash at all times . "
The group uses the slogan , " Tell Congress : Hands off My Wallet " ( Similar to the " hands off my health care " slogan of Americans for Prosperity in the health care debate . )
The Washington Post exposed the CARD Alliance as a front group in an article published on May 25 , 2010 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]

WASHINGTON — For three months , the White House has refused to say whether it offered a job to Representative Joe Sestak to get him to drop his challenge to Senator Arlen Specter in a Pennsylvania Democratic primary , as Mr. Sestak has asserted .
But the White House wants everyone who suspects that something untoward , or even illegal , might have happened to rest easy : though it still will not reveal what happened , the White House is reassuring skeptics that it has examined its own actions and decided it did nothing wrong .
Whatever it was that it did .
“ Lawyers in the White House and others have looked into conversations that were had with Congressman Sestak , ” Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said Sunday on “ Face the Nation ” on CBS .
“ And nothing inappropriate happened . ”
“ Improper or not , did you offer him a job in the administration ? ” asked the host , Bob Schieffer .
“ I ’m not going to get further into what the conversations were , ” Mr. Gibbs replied .
“ People that have looked into them assure me that they were n’t inappropriate in any way . ”

Alex Graves is in early negotiations to direct the pilot episode for Fox ’s midseason series Terra Nova , which is executive produced by Steven Spielberg and Peter Chernin .
The direct - to - series project , which was well received at the network ’s upfront presentation , features a family from 2149 when the planet is dying who are transported back to pre-historic Earth where they join Terra Nova , a colony of humans with a second chance to build a civilization .
While the producers of the show initially were looking to cast a lead first , the priority quickly shifted to finding the right director .
The West Wing director - producer Graves , who has helmed several pilots , including the one for sci-fi Fox series Fringe , emerged as the top choice last week .
He then met with all key producers and executives involved in the project and , after his final sit - downs with Spielberg and Fox ’s entertainment chairman Peter Rice today , which I hear went very well , he received an offer to direct the pilot .
Fox has not scheduled Terra Nova yet because of the extensive post - production and visual effects involved .
But the network ’s brass are hoping to launch the series as early as the week after the Super Bowl to use the big sporting event as a promotional platform .
Terra Nova , from 20th TV , DreamWorks TV , Kapital Entertainment and Chernin Entertainment , is executive produced by Spielberg , Chernin , the pilot ’s writers Craig Silverstein and Kelly Marcel , showrunner Brannon Braga , David Fury , Aaron Kaplan , Katherine Pope , Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank .
Graves is repped by CAA .
The world cup is almost upon us , which is brilliant news for me because I 've planned to be out of the country for the duration .
What 's more , I 'm going to America , a country where the World Cup is roughly as popular as necrotising fasciitis .
The idea is to take a month - long coast - to - coast road trip , during which I 'll be behind the wheel for precisely zero miles because I still have n't passed my test .
I 'll still have plenty to offer , mind : I can program the sat-nav and fiddle with the iPod .
And since I 'll be well - rested , when we inevitably get abducted by crazed mountain people who want to kill us and carve out our stomachs and wear them like hats , I can run for help really quickly .
Certainly faster than anyone else .
Or at least , that 's what I 'm hoping .
Anyway , the primary appeal of a road trip is the lack of a plan : you have a start point and a finish line , and what you do in - between is up to you .
Having said that , I know from bitter experience that it's a good idea to draw up a sort of " fuzzy itinerary " , just to make sure you keep on the move .
Otherwise there comes a point about two - thirds of the way through where you realise you 've got to cover 2,000 miles in four days , and your car is instantly transformed into a mobile close - quarters confinement unit : a cell with pretty scenery zipping past the windows , but a cell nonetheless .
You drive until it gets dark , then endure a tense hunt for a motel .
Inevitably , when you 're at your most frazzled , the town you 've chosen to stop in will be holding a UFO convention or a bizarre asparagus - worshipping parade or something , and all hospitable rooms will be taken , forcing you to spend the night in a cheap and sinister motel room .
More than once , I 've been able to sleep only with a chair jammed up against the door handle , in the deluded belief that this might thwart opportunistic killers .
( In all likelihood it 'd simply annoy them – after all , if you 're the sort of person who randomly murders tourists in motel rooms , it 's fair to say you 're an exceptionally " driven " individual , and for all your faults , it takes more than a blocked doorway to prevent you from living your dreams . )
All of which means it 's a good idea to plot a loose string of waypoints , with plenty of " wriggle room " time - wise , in case you break down or get plucked off the road by a tornado and thrown into the middle of the sea .
The next problem is working out what bits you want to see .
Which is where guidebooks come in .
I have a big problem with guidebooks .
I can't stop buying them .
It 's a sickness .
I can't embark on any sort of trip without the necessary guidebook .
If they sold a guidebook telling me what to see and do in my own garden , I 'd buy it .
On some level , I must believe a guidebook is a sort of magic shield which protects the user from misfortune , confusion or disappointment , even though actual experience tells me they 're often a distraction at best and a holiday - wrecking dictator at worst .
If I 'm in London , and I 'm peckish , I 'll pop into the nearest acceptable - looking sandwich shop .
If it turns out to be disappointing , it 's no big deal .
If I 'm on holiday , I have to stand awkwardly on the pavement outside a cafe , squinting at its entry in the guidebook before I 'll consider stepping inside , as though a ) an underwhelming meal might kill me , and b ) the guidebook is n't full of shit anyway , like the Time Out Guide to Paris , which once made me schlep 500 miles to sit in a pretentious Parisian version of a Hoxton gastropub , where the seating was deliberately rickety and uncomfortable ( and in some cases broken ) because apparently it would n't have been cool to relax in a comfy chair – an anti-conformist philosophy which also prevented the staff from providing any kind of identifiable service whatsoever , apart from standing behind the bar reading texts and nodding in time to the music .
Rather than learning from experience , and not buying a guidebook at all , I now have to buy more than one .
For my last holiday , I purchased three .
For my upcoming trip , I already have five .
Five guidebooks .
Some are generic ( covering the entire US ) , others are more specific ( such as the two different " road trip " books I 've bought ) .
But that 's still not enough .
I 'm also obsessively creating routes on Google maps , and researching nearby attractions online – which I can then cross-reference in the guidebooks .
In short , I 'm trying to guarantee every experience in advance – the polar opposite of what a road trip is supposed to be all about .
Clearly it 's time to toss all my guidebooks out once and for all .
But I can't .
Because no one 's written a guide to the best kind of skip to throw them into .
Yet .
Of the many lessons my daughter teaches me ongoingly , perhaps the most noticeable is that the critical moments in our lives and relationships show up with no notice , no plan and no place to hide .
Intimacy , relatedness and honesty do n't pussyfoot around .
So , I closed the laptop and looked at her .
I told her that it is an insult used on women , by people that want women to feel small , shameful and bad for being human and to tell women that they are not good .
I said that all mammals have sex and that humans are mammals .
I told her that in many cultures , women are insulted for a great many things , treated like property and denied the right to enjoy many ( if not all ) freedoms that men have .
I said that I know some women who embrace the word themselves , to claim the right to enjoy their own lives in their own terms .
I said that the word , like any attempt at insult is only powerful if a person believes that other people define that person .
I told her that if someone insults her , the insult is not important .
What is important is that she learn the many ways of dealing with insults .
Most of all , I informed her that no word will ever be who she is , whether spoken by an enemy or a friend .
The definition of who she is , will always be a gift that only she can give herself .
No one - NO one on this earth can ever take that away from her .
I shared this on twitter because I thought it was pretty funny .
( Almost as funny as the time I used the word " orgasm " in front of her and had to explain that ... to my bride 's amusement at my lump - headedness ) .
One person suggest that I bail on the explanation and pass it off to " mommy " .
That 's not really my style , though .
I 've embraced digging myself out of awkward moments for a host of reasons .
- I am this girl 's male relationship role model .
If I do n't show her what an honest conversation from a man looks like , who will ? -
We do n't have that kind of marriage .
We do n't run from those moments .
We cherish them because they will never come again .
Each one is special .
Rather than treat them as disasters to avoid , we hold them into our lives and share them with each other as gifts of the tales of our lives alone and together .
-
In those awkward , uncomfortable moments between people - there is an opportunity for honesty and relatedness .
That awkwardness catches us off guard because we do n't have scripted platitudes , prejudices , reactions , assumptions .
These moments are gifts and they startle us with their immediacy , their undeniable presence and the sudden awareness that we not alone .
Someone else is with us , right now and they are as aware of us as we are of them .
- I like to spare my acts of cowardice for real emergencies ( like NOT wearing my Bears jersey to a Packers home game ... again )
As I considered and digested the event and that comment , I ventured back to a familiar train of thought for me :
The gift of a girl child .
We only have one , so she 's the first , oldest , best , etc .
I have been able to interrupt , notice and replace my own internal sexist assumptions and behaviors - every day for the last 10 years .
I am fairly certain that I would have passed on and glossed over a great deal of sexism to a boy child , given the knowledge of what I 've learned since she was born .
Being married to an amazing feminist woman as I am , I 'm sure these things would still have come up .
But , she 's a real gift - as I believe all girl children ( whether cis or trans ) are .
In face of the selective abortions of girl fetuses , abandoned girl babies & murdered female infants , she is a miracle .
Given what a scheming revolutionary I am , working against the kyriarchy / patriarchy / military / religious / financial model of oppression as I am ... she is going to be more than capable of carrying on the family business .
Any gender is a good gender to me .
That said , the presence of this girl child is the most amazing and powerful gift of all my born days .
She is the promise of a life that will not be dull - ever .

All - in - one skinsuit , tri-bars , wetsuit , number belt , elastic laces ... just some of the gear you may – or may not – need for a triathlon
When I did my first triathlon last year , there were many things that took me by surprise – how scary it is when someone swims over you in open water , for example , and how difficult it is to get out of a wetsuit when you 're in a hurry .
But what really amazed me was quite how much kit everybody else had schlepped with them .
I thought I had come well - prepared for the 400 m swim , 20 km bike ride and 5 km run .
I had reluctantly bought the wetsuit that is mandatory in many open - water swims .
I had remembered my bike , bike shoes and trainers and even had two towels .
But when I turned up at the lake on the morning of the event , it became apparent that I had totally underestimated what constitutes normal preparation in the tri-world .
Everyone else was carrying their stuff in huge plastic crates , ready to place by their bikes in the first transition .
I , meanwhile , was swinging a Sainsbury 's carrier bag containing everything I believed I needed .
No fancy all - in - one tri-suit for me , guv – after the swim I had a vest and leggings to change into for the ride and run .
And surely I could just use safety pins to attach my race number without the help an overpriced piece of elastic ( £ 5.50 for the tri-belt , madam ) ?
I persisted in this low - fi approach across three triathlons last summer , but , after a number of embarrassing experiences in transition – which not only cost me precious minutes but also my dignity – I have started to rethink the gear I need for this year 's events .
Am I a sucker for contemplating spending £ 79.00 on an unforgiving bit of Lycra that will make it impossible for me to go to the loo , even if it will mean that I can hop straight on my bike after the swim ?
It would certainly save my blushes – during the Goole triathlon in East Yorkshire last August , I made such a hash out of changing out of my wetsuit and into capri pants that I drew a crowd .
What was worse was that my boyfriend 's dad captured all four agonising minutes of my ordeal on his new camcorder , which he played on the family 's gigantic TV when we got home .
The other day I got a tantalising email from the online sports shop Wiggle promising 12 % off everything – including the triathlon section .
Within 10 minutes I found myself at the checkout with £ 150 worth of kit in my basket , wondering if I should go back and get a fancy attachment for my handlebars to make me more aerodynamic .
I had already convinced myself that I could shave seconds off my time by putting plastic laces in my shoes .
I was just about to type in my credit card details when I came to my senses .
I do not want to join the kit cult of triathletes which dictates that you more or less have to be in the top tax bracket to keep up .
Do n't believe me ?
Back in 2006 , the UK 's 40,000 triathletes spent £ 13 m on kit .
The reason I like swimming , running and cycling is that you do n't need expensive gear to do it .
Am I wrong ?
The defence secretary , Liam Fox , wants to speed up the withdrawal of British troops from Afghanistan , saying that Britian is not a " global policeman " .
His comments came as he joined the foreign secretary , William Hague , and the international development secretary , Andrew Mitchell , on a trip to Afghanistan to meet political and military leaders in the capital , Kabul .
While Hague indicated that the new coalition government was not planning a strategic break with existing UK policy on Afghanistan , Fox said expectations of Britain 's role in the country needed to change .
He also risked angering the president , Hamid Karzai , by describing Afghanistan as a " broken 13th - century country " .
In an interview with the Times , published ahead of their arrival today , Fox said the goals of the mission in Afghanistan were primarily military rather than humanitarian .
" We have to reset expectations and timelines , " he told the paper .
" National security is the focus now .
We are not a global policeman .
" We are not in Afghanistan for the sake of the education policy in a broken 13th - century country .
We are there so the people of Britain and our global interests are not threatened . "
Fox said he would like the forces to return to the UK as soon as possible , and ruled out any transfer of British troops from Helmand province to neighbouring Kandahar .
His comments were a contrast to those of Mitchell , who told journalists on the flight to Kabul that development was " absolutely crucial " .
" We need to ensure that we help the Afghan people to build a functioning state , " he said .
" That 's about providing basic education and healthcare facilities , but it's also about ensuring there are opportunities for promoting livelihoods so that people have jobs .
" If we are going to prioritise making sure there is a functioning state in Afghanistan , then development , the work we are doing in that respect , is absolutely crucial . "
Aides insisted there were no differences between the three ministers .
Hague told reporters on the flight that " the question is how to support the efforts of the Afghan government and our Nato partners , not whether to support them " .
" We are taking stock as a new government , we want to see how things are working , we want to hear the military advice , we want to talk to the Afghan government themselves , we want to discuss the detail with the United States . "
The visit was the first to Afghanistan by members of the new government and is intended to reflect the high priority being given to the conflict .
It came as the death of another British serviceman was confirmed yesterday , the 286th in the campaign and the first fatality since the Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition took office .
On arrival the ministers , all Conservatives , met General Stanley McChrystal , the US commander of Nato operations in Afghanistan , and other military leaders .
Britain has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan – part of a US - dominated force that is expected to grow to around 140,000 at its height in a few weeks .
Washington is sending more troops in a bid to seize insurgent - held areas before a planned withdrawal starting in July 2011 .

I find it surreal to have people guessing at my motivations when they could just ask me .
On top of all that , I find it weird that people spend so much time with in - fighting .
I just want my system not to suck .
Some time ago ( during in the Ubuntu Karmic development cycle maybe in September 2009 ) , I started having giant problems with my build system .
All I/O would start to stall , wait times would surge , and usually my entire system would just go unresponsive with the disk light on solid .
This scared the crap out of me , and it was n’t entirely obvious what was triggering it .
No one else seemed to be seeing it .
I managed to start tracking things using “ latencytop ” , and saw stuff like liferea going crazy .
As I eliminated more and more things , I eventually settled on it being a problem with umount , and I reported an Ubuntu bug .
It seemed to look like an upstream bug that no one else but the reporter could reproduce either .
Since no one else was seeing this issue , and it seemed related to LVM snapshots , I migrated off of snapshots , and started using aufs overlays for my builds .
For a while , it seemed like things went away .
It did n’t , and I started hitting it again .
I opened a new ( now famous ) bug in Ubuntu , since now snapshots were n’t in the picture , and I did n’t want to confuse the earlier history .
I managed to find a relatively minimal test - case too .
A few other people commenting on the bug were seeing the problem now too , but it was less pronounced for them .
As an aside , this was n’t a “ just wait a few seconds longer ” kind of issue on my system .
A single umount would last 30 - 40 minutes .
And when I ’m doing parallel builds of security updates , this would turn into my system being unavailable for hours at a stretch .
Since none of the kernel developers I was in contact with were able to track down the root cause , I asked Ted Ts’o in email if he could just quickly peek in on this for me , since I figured he’d be in a good position to confirm or deny it .
I did n’t want to start wasting upstream time with this if it was n’t reproducible ( see earlier upstream kernel bug ) .
To my great relief , Ted found a few minutes to check it , and was able to immediately confirm it and give me a viable work - around ( “ sync ; umount … ” ) for the time being .
I confirmed the work - around , and went off to do other things .
A while later , Ted came back to deliver a bit of a rant , the purpose of which was not clear to me , but I ultimately ignored it — I did n’t seem directed at me .
I just wanted my system operating normally , and he ’d done me a favor to check in on it and got me a work - around .
More time passes , and I eventually get caught in another I /O - wait melt - down .
On investigation , it seemed that the in - kernel work - around in the Ubuntu kernel totally back - fired on me in some cases , rendering even the user - space work - around useless .
After investigating the Ubuntu - specific work - around , I re-read Ted ’s rant in the course of researching what had happened during this bug ’s triage .
It seemed that Ted was basically saying :
– this is an upstream problem
– RedHat has n’t run into it and he did n’t know why
I figured I should confirm for myself if Fedora was affected , so downloaded and installed Fedora to double - check there .
Since I was able to reproduce it there , I opened an upstream bug , linking back to the original Ubuntu bug , and then went to open a bug in the Fedora tracker , linking back to upstream .
And it seems to be these actions that everyone has jumped on .
I will now bore you with the reality of my motivations : I wanted to fix the bug so no one would end up experiencing the same pain I ’d been through over the last 6 months .
The bug was , from my perspective , a serious issue .
Since I ’d managed to reproduce it in another distro , it was my duty as a Free Software developer to report it to them .
And , in what I felt was an unambiguous gesture , I made sure to include the link to the upstream kernel bug .
Reproducing it in Ubuntu , in Fedora , and with a stock kernel had me confident that it was an upstream issue .
While Ted did correctly suspect the issue was upstream , I really did n’t want to just open an upstream bug and have it be ignored .
I wanted some additional proof of reproduction , which I got when I tested it on Fedora .
So , I ’m rather saddened that so many people spent so much time questioning my motivations , making fun of Canonical , or doing anything other than trying to just simply solve this problem .
I ’m totally disinterested in inter -distro fighting .
Instead , I continue to assume we ’re all on the same team , fighting a philosophical battle against close - source software .
And in that regard , I think it ’s still true .
If I ignore the rants and jeering , I come away thankful for all the people that spent time trying reproduce the issue at Canonical , at RedHat , and in the larger community .
I ’m hugely thankful that Ted made some time to let me know I was n’t crazy , and there was actually a problem .
I ’m thankful for having some work - arounds , and I ’m thankful that the root cause was eventually ferreted out , with some possible solutions .
I ’m even thankful that some people on the LWN thread saw that , far from malicious , I was trying to be helpful with the bug .
I just wanted my filesystem not to eat my computer .
And I was hoping other people could maybe help me , since I ’m not a filesystem expert .
The drama around this bug is pathetic , and now by talking about it for almost 1000 words , I ’m just as guilty .

In the gloomy half light , a bulldozer strains to pull something through a roughly cut tunnel .
It 's over 2 m ( 6.5 ft ) high and close to 3 m ( 10 ft ) wide , propped up by wooden supports .
Workers shout encouragement as the ceiling begins to collapse .
Suddenly a car , headlights glaring , lurches forward .
Filmed deep underground on the border between Gaza and Egypt , the mobile phone footage obtained by the BBC is conclusive proof of what has been rumoured in Gaza since last year - the tunnelling operation is now so advanced that entire brand new cars are now being smuggled into Gaza .
Desperate times " What else could I do ? " says Ahmed Bahloul , a successful businessman who owns a car garage , standing next to his brand new black Hyundai saloon .
" I wanted a new car , but because of Israel 's blockade , the only way I could get it is through the tunnels . "
We only have one car in the showroom ...
I can't sell it because it is the only new car I have to put on display
Marwan Kishawi , Car dealer
For the past three years , Israel has enforced a tightened economic blockade on Gaza , only allowing in limited humanitarian aid .
Israel says this is necessary to stop weapons being smuggled in to Palestinian militant groups inside Gaza and to put pressure on the Islamist movement Hamas , which controls the Strip .
Egypt has also closed its border with Gaza , only opening it occasionally .
But hundreds of tunnels have been dug under the border , through which a vast range of goods is smuggled in from Egypt .
Mr Bahloul paid $ 38,000 ( £ 25,000 ) for his new car .
Of that , $ 10,000 went to the tunnel operators , he says .
" It 's a lot of money , but I wanted a new car , " he says .
Bigger tunnels
There are very few new cars in Gaza .
Locals estimate that only around 200 have been smuggled in through the tunnels in the past three years .
In the past , cars were cut up to smuggle them though narrower tunnels .
But the tunnels have now been widened .
Ahmed Bahloul , proud owner of a brand new Hyundai
The lack of new cars means many cars in Gaza have seen better days .
It is not uncommon to see cars 20 or 30 years old belching black smoke from the exhaust .
Many Gazans resort to re-spraying old cars to make them look new .
In a busy paint shop just outside Gaza , workers in face masks are sanding down the bodywork of old cars before repainting them .
" Lots of people come back here over and over again , " says Mohammed who works in the paint shop .
" Some of the cars are 30 years old . "
The number of motorbikes in Gaza has risen dramatically in the past three years because they are easier to smuggle .
Empty showrooms
There are still new car dealers in Gaza , but their showrooms are virtually empty .
Marwan Kishawi's family has been dealing Mercedes cars in Gaza City for more than 40 years .
Mohamed 's paint shop does a thriving business " Now we only have one car in the showroom , " he says pointing at a bright yellow stretch taxi limousine .
" I have had this car for seven years .
I have had many offers to buy it , but I can't sell it because it is the only new car I have to put on display . "
Mr Kishawi says he used to import more than 100 cars a year from Israel , as well as $ 300,000 ( £ 200,000 ) worth of parts a year .
Mr Kishawi says he cannot bring his cars in through the tunnels because they are too valuable and his suppliers at Mercedes will not allow it to happen .
He says he is spending thousands of dollars to keep the cars he has bought in storage at the border because Israel and Egypt will not allow them in .
" I have n't sold a new car for almost three years , " he says , shaking with frustration .
" It 's desperate now . "

Let ’s start the day with something which made me smile last night , via 1UP .
Adam West in a guest editorial of Videogaming and Computergaming Illustrated .
Key quote …
In the same way a painting allows us to gaze upon the faces and souls of people from another age , or a book permits us to linger on the thoughts of great figures from history and fiction , videogames can expand our awareness of the world as it is , was , or might be .
The medium is still in its infancy , but read this again in a few years and see if this prediction has n’t come true : as videogaming grows , we will grow .
If only as many non-gamers could look at the form with a similarly open mind .
You ’ll find the rest here .
Mini Review : Dante 's Inferno : Trials Of Lucida
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 14th of May 2010 - 02:32 PM ]
Is it worth the $ 10 ?
Will it keep people playing Dante 's Inferno until the inevitable sequel ?
Let me tell you my thoughts .
My first thought was excitement to give Trials of Lucida a good go .
I was curious as to how the co-op / multiplayer would work for Dante 's Inferno .
Something that I found to be a let down shortly after I loaded the new content .
Once entering the main screen listing all of the trials , I was quickly bombarded with a list of Trophy / Achievement
Whore levels made simply to gather the new trophies / achievements that came with the DLC .
None of it was challenging - mainly 15 - second levels to quickly collect medals and meet the requirements .
I was severely disappointed , especially to see that most of them were ranked at 4 or 5 stars for level design .
Now do n't get me wrong , there are some serious levels made by fans of the game in the mix , but they mostly have been marked with a low star rating .
Some were rated low without warrant , some with good reason .
The impression I have is that it was the fact that since they did not help with the Whoring , they received poor voting .
That lead me to moving on to play the EA created levels .
Hoping that these would be something more , at least after I saw this was an option .
I will admit that it is partially from my lack of dissecting the menu system and partially from it not be prominent , but I almost missed the fact that EA had made challenges in the first place .
It should really be the first thing we see , but whatever .
There are actually decent maps out there from EA to make up for the Whore maps from the community .
Now outside of the challenge playing , which was fun for a bit , is the challenge building .
Something that when you actually take time to do , can be more fun then playing them .
Yes , I actually took more enjoyment in building a challenge using the limited toolbox .
There are just so many options to choose from and you are able to tweak damn near every stat .
The only thing I found lacking about it is that there were predetermined places everything had to go on the map .
Which means no crazy hidden traps or placing spawn points in weird spots to trip up players .
You can pretty much know where everything is going to be , just not what enemies or traps until you start up the level .
One feature I liked with these maps is that you can see if anyone has successfully beaten your map or not and change it based on how long it is up without a person being able to beat it .
I , for one , have two maps still up that have yet to be beaten as of this article .
To me , that means either the combo required to beat the wave is too great or there are very few people out there playing real maps and not just the trophy / achievement maps .
In the end , this DLC is a nice concept , and it could have worked well if it was used properly by the community .
I will most likely poke my head in every now and then to see what EA has to offer for maps , but that will be about it .
The community seems to truly only care about their trophy level and gamer score , making this DLC not completely worth the $ 10 .
If it was n't for that , I can see people finding great appeal in the tools that have been produced .
Even mini-tournaments to make the best challenge , but I do n't see that happening unless EA cleans up the community .
As of now , I 'd wait until the price drops for the DLC .
By then hopefully it will be $ 5 and EA will have a few safeguards in place for the community .
Like maybe clearing out the 75 + " Get A Platinum Medal In 15 Seconds " maps .
There is no need , humans .
If you truly want to whore , leave just one up there and call it a day .
Dante 's Inferno : Trials Of Lucida was developed and published by Visceral Games and EA for the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 on April 29th .
Requires a copy of Dante 's Inferno .
A code for the DLC was provided by the publisher for review purposes .
I spent about three hours trying levels and building my own .
That 's the advantage Democrats now have over Republicans with the Latino vote .
It was just 22 points six years ago .
More :
68 % of Latinos approve of Obama ’s job ( compared with 48 % of overall respondents and 38 % of whites ) , and they view the Democratic Party favorably by a 54 % - 21 % score ( versus 41 % - 40 % among all adults and 34 % - 48 % among whites ) .
And their views of the Republican Party ?
In the poll , the GOP fav / unfav among Latinos is 22 % - 44 % .
What ’s more , Latinos think Democrats would do a better job than Republicans in protecting the interests of minorities ( by 58 % - 11 % ) , in representing the opportunity to move up the economic ladder ( 46 % - 20 % ) , in dealing with immigration ( 37 % - 12 % ) , and in promoting strong moral values ( 33 % - 23 % ) .
The only advantage they gave Republicans was in enforcing security along the border ( 31% - 20 % ) .
And Latinos remain a sleeping -- yet growing -- political giant : 23 % of them are n’t registered voters ( compared with 12 % of whites and 16 % of blacks ) .
If this is a long game , Obama 's got this .

What Calbuzz does not know about corporate finance fills mountains of textbooks .
But because we expect it wo n’t be long before we ’re hearing a lot about charges of stock spinning against Meg Whitman , when she was CEO of eBay , we asked David Shapiro , a specialist on financial fraud at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York , to spell it out for us .
Here ’s his offering :
By David Shapiro
Special to Calbuzz
In April 2005 , Meg Whitman , CEO of eBay from 1998 - 2008 , settled – without admitting wrongdoing – a case in which she and others had been charged with “ spinning ” initial public offerings ( IPOs ) that had been made available to her at a discount by Goldman Sachs in exchange — it was alleged — for Goldman getting eBay ’s investment banking business .
Whitman and co-defendants Pierre Omidyar and Jeffrey Skoll agreed to disgorge their profits and pay $ 3 million ( Whitman ’s share was $ 1.78 million ) into an eBay fund that was supplemented by a payment of $ 395,000 from Goldman Sachs .
( Robert Kagle , another co-defendant and former member of eBay ’s Audit Committee during the relevant period , did not contribute to the fund apparently because he did not earn any profits from spinning IPOs . )
“ Spinning ” is obtaining , from securities firms such as Goldman Sachs , shares of stock in start - up companies ’
IPOs at a preferred price ( that is , a discount ) not available to ordinary retail investors .
This enables investors like Whitman to make a short - term profit by selling the stock in the secondary market , days if not hours later , to retail investors at non-discounted prices .
The practice is now expressly illegal because it was deemed to be theft by favoritism .
The social harm that now is outlawed entails the wrongful delivery of the monetary value of the discounts to preferred investors selected by securities firms .
The start - up company selling the IPO could have obtained a higher price by selling directly to ordinary investors if the securities firm had not sold them to selected investors at a discount .
Whitman has insisted that Goldman Sachs ’s motivation in giving her opportunities to spin IPOs was due to her status as a pre-existing wealthy client of theirs , which she was , and not as disguised kickbacks or commercial bribery from Goldman Sachs to get eBay ’s investment banking business , which they did in fact obtain .
The issue has been spun by Whitman apologists and others into :
What were Goldman Sachs ’ and Whitman ’s respective motivations and intentions in giving and accepting the opportunities to spin ?
Issues such as the appearance of impropriety , conflict of interest , breach of ethics , breach of duty of loyalty , etc. presumably take a backseat , while voters in California ponder :
What exactly were those motivations and intentions ?
I seek to avoid this “ he said , she said ” cul - de-sac .
Conduct has two parts under our legal system :
The act and the accompanying state of mind of the actor .
Apparently , the best that Whitman can argue is that while she did perform the acts – receiving and then rapidly selling discounted shares unavailable to ordinary retail investors from a vendor ( Goldman Sachs ) competing for work from her principal ( eBay ) – she is not a criminal because Goldman Sachs had other reasons for favoring her : for example , she was rich .
No formal fact - finder such as a judge or jury has passed judgment on what happened , including Goldman Sachs ’s alleged innocence in demonstrating favoritism to Whitman , who also served briefly on the Board of Directors of Goldman Sachs .
Therefore , she ’s not a criminal under the law .
But was she ethical ?
The House Financial Services Committee released data to the public in early October 2002 regarding the spinning issues , naming beneficiaries of Goldman Sachs that included Whitman .
According to eBay ’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by eBay in 2002 under the section “ Receipt of Favors and Gifts ” Whitman ’s conduct in the spinning adventures would have been expressly unethical had these principles and rules been effective while she spun , notwithstanding her pre-existing wealth or Goldman Sachs ’s alleged innocent reasons for favoring her .
Essential issues , such as whether Whitman requires express and detailed guidance from others in order to behave ethically and whether she can admit to having acted unethically , are still unresolved .
The excuse that “ it was n’t expressly prohibited when I did it ” might have proven useful in fending off regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission , but how persuasive is this excuse in the context of determining what is ethical ?
Could n’t Whitman have determined , on her own , the implications of receiving favors and gifts from vendors ?
Is she to be held to the same standard as my 12 - year - old daughter who ate all of the chocolate chip cookies because I did n’t say she could n’t ?
Whitman may be many things , but naïve is not likely one .
Unfortunately , receiving favors and perks on account of wealth and position is neither unusual nor novel , and determining precisely whether Goldman Sachs ’s favors were attributable to her highly valued personal portfolio of investments or her position as eBay CEO is presently irrelevant .
The existence of express prohibitions in eBay ’s Code of Business Conduct against receiving the kinds of favors and gifts that she had received from Goldman Sachs might have been a condition of settlement with regulatory authorities or perhaps indicative of the proverbial “ closing the barn door after the horses have left . ”
I do n’t know .
Whitman has neither conceded that her spinning conduct was unethical nor conceded that there ’s something broken in a social system that allows the wealthy to benefit at the expense of the ordinary .
California voters will have to decide what that says about Meg Whitman ’s ethics and her fitness to be governor .

Get ready for some big Facebook changes
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Facebook , the world 's largest social network , is set Wednesday to unveil changes at its f8 developers conference that have already caused a stir .
Though Facebook has n't officially announced any new features , hints have emerged about what will be included .
One of the more controversial changes : Facebook is expected to announce that it will start providing users ' personal information to some select third - party Web sites .
Sites could use that information to display what a user 's Facebook friends have read on that site .
Users could also share more between their social network and the outside Web .
Critics have already expressed concern about the privacy implications of such a service .
A similar program called Beacon , unveiled in 2007 , caused such a stir among users that the company canned it last year .
Some experts say Facebook learned from its mistakes with Beacon , but it still needs to frame the argument better to get its customers on board .
Instead of waiting until Wednesday , Facebook somewhat covertly made the proposed change to its privacy policy late last month and opened it up for public comment .
" It 's not a surprise that the feedback has been quite negative so far , " said Augie Ray , social networking analyst for Forrester Research .
" Facebook needs to start framing these issues in ways that make the benefits to consumers clear .
They 're being much more transparent , but there 's still a lot of room for improvement . "
Despite some pushback from users , the move is part of a big effort from Facebook to continue to grow beyond facebook.com .
" It 's evident that Facebook wishes to expand its reach , " said Ray .
" Facebook has created a very effective and valuable destination site that eats up enormous amounts of users ' time , but for the most part , users have to go to facebook .com to get that value . "
Other changes on the docket
Universal " like " button :
One big change that users will probably see as early as this week is a " like " button displayed on Web sites outside of Facebook .
Users are very familiar with the " like " button on Facebook , which broadcasts to a user 's network that he or she likes a photo , comment or post .
Facebook is expected to announce Wednesday that " like " buttons will start to show up across the Internet , enabling users to share items with friends when they 're not physically on facebook.com .
Location : Like Twitter , Facebook is a little behind on the location - based service craze , as much of that thunder has been stolen by companies like Foursquare and Gowalla .
Still , none of those services has nearly the number of users that Facebook has .
If Facebook successfully launches a service that shows comments about specific places , it could prove invaluable to both users who are looking for reviews of events and locations and companies who are looking to target those people .
" It 's clear that Facebook wants to know where you are , " said Ray .
" It recognizes how valuable that information is both for advertisers and users . "
Real - time search :
Also among the biggest rumored announcements is real - time search on third - party search sites , similar to Twitter 's service .
Facebook is expected to announce that users ' public posts will be available for search on sites like Google and Bing .
" It remains to be seen how consumers would adopt real - time search of Facebook feeds , " said Ray .
" It 's a different kind of search from Google and Twitter -- would you want to search on Google to see what your friends say ? "

BP spent Monday preparing possible solutions to stem oil leaks from an undersea well off the Louisiana coast , and fending off new accusations about its role in the widening environmental disaster .
Crews were building a containment dome , a 4 - story , 70 - ton structure that the company plans to lower into place over one of the three leaks to catch the escaping oil and allow it to be pumped to the surface .
The company was also planning to install a shutoff valve at the site of one of the leaks on Monday , but the seas were too rough , delaying that effort .
Heavy winds damaged miles of floating booms laid out in coastal waters to protect the shoreline from the spreading oil slick , which appeared to be drifting toward the Alabama and Florida coasts and the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana ’s southern tip .
On Monday , lawyers representing environmental groups , workers from the oil rig and fishermen who have been hurt by the leak leveled fresh accusations against BP , as well as Transocean and Halliburton .
BP leased the rig from Transocean .
Halliburton was providing several services on the rig , including cementing , which is a method of sealing the well to control pressure from the oil and gas beneath .
( CNN ) -- A Maryland funeral home has lost its license after investigators found about 40 bodies stacked on top of each other , leaking fluid , in a garage , a state official said .
The state Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors revoked the license of Chambers Funeral Home & Crematorium in Riverdale , Maryland after an April 26 visit to the site .
Hari Close , president of the the state funeral board , told CNN Tuesday that some of the bodies were cadavers who had been donated to a local university for research .
Other bodies came from other funeral homes , Close said .
The bodies were supposed to be cremated , but investigators were alarmed at how they were stored in the garage while they awaited cremation .
" Even somebody who donates their body to science , they still should be treated with dignity , " said Close .
" Not to mention the health and safety issues with the body fluids flowing out . "
William Chambers , co-owner of the funeral home , told CNN - affiliate WJLA said that he hopes to work with the state to resolve the alleged violations .
When investigators inspected the funeral home they were warned by an employee , who told them , " Do n't get upset about all the bodies in there , " according to documents released by the state funeral board .
Inside the room was a " large pile , approximately 12 by 12 feet , of body bags containing human remains strewn on the floor of the garage in front of a removal van .
There was visible leakage from the body bags as well as a pungent odor , " the documents said .
" The investigator also observed writing on some of the body bags , " they said .
" However , fluid leakage from the body bags caused the writing to smear and become illegible .
As a result , it was not immediately possible to determine the identity of the remains . "
There will be a hearing at the end of the month to determine whether the funeral home will get its license back , Close said .
CNN 's Patty Lane contributed to this report .

' On Veganarchism ' by political prisoner Jonny Alberwhite
Taken from the ALF SG Newsletter April 2009 Originally titled ' Why Veganism is for the Common Good of All Life ' Taken from the ALF SG Newsletter April 2009
Veganism bursts through all delusory speciesist barriers , it universalises and authenticates compassion and gives practical form to biological altruism : if altruism is the instrument , then Veganism is the music ; one of the means for total species success and survival .
Homo - sapiens cannot survive without other life forms being left alive and so we will perish , long before we are supposed to , long before the Sun has burned cold .
Veganism is a method of mutually satisfying our moral needs and evolutionary requirements , naturally selected altruistic phenomena that will ensure the building blocks of harmonious life on this planet continue .
Veganism is that important ; it is a contingent facet of our evolution as sharing members within hugely sensitive and bio - diverse ecosystems ( there are few left we do n’t occupy ) .
Like Albert Schweitzer , what I would argue then is that requirements for value should rest not just upon issues of sentience but also upon issues of life : thus lakes are valued because they house fish ; rocks are valued because they house woodlice and soil has value because it houses plants ad infinitum .
Since all inanimate objects directly or indirectly support animate life , with very few exceptions - if any at all - then the totality receives moral consideration .
Thus for the benefit of abundant success of all species , Veganism is the default position , for it respects and preserves all life .
All animal abusing industries ( be it factory farming , vivisection , fur farming etc ) have successfully helped to socialise the mass of people on this planet into using and consuming animals as part of their normal , ‘ normalised ’ and habitual existence .
This is an immoral , consumerist ideological construct that is based on the anthropocentric delusion that our own species deserves predominance over all others : in fact , not only is it delusional , it is wholly destructive to all beings .
This daily advertised discourse atomises and reduces the classical ‘ whole ’ to its composite ‘ parts ’ , the whole biosphere and all its animal and plant contents become a resource for the use of the human ‘ self , blind to the realisation that the self cannot function without the whole .
These barriers and borders have been purposefully constructed over centuries to separate species and classes of people , to maintain the hierarchies of powerful elites , traditionally by royal patriarchies but currently by the ubiquitous Trans - National Companies we all abhor .
( Joel Bakan ’s great book and DVD ‘ The Corporation ’ illustrates their psychopathic tendencies so well ! )
Capitalist ideologies that advocate self - interest and inequitable over - consumption of the few at the expense of the many are transient cultural artifices enforced by violence , indoctrination and the manufacture of consent .
Such cultural creations have no evolutionary basis and so will be short - lived in real , evolutionary terms .
This is especially relevant today as we are witnessing the depletion of the very fossil fuels they need to power and perpetuate themselves .
No fuel , no capitalism , no oppressive ideology !
( Again , see elements of www.transitionculture.org).
This is where a full understanding of exploitation , of capitalism , of hierarchy and of the political implications of Veganism become so vital .
That ’s why I totally loved reading Bob Torres ’ Making a Killing .
He comprehensively introduces Karl Marx ’s main beliefs and Murray Bookchin ’s readings on hierarchy and oppression .
( Bookchin received a lot of inspiration from Kropotkin ’s Mutual Aid ) .
I first read Bookchin ’s analysis of contemporary hierarchical culture when travelling many , many years ago , mostly from Peter Marshall ’s stupendous Nature ’s Web ( if you can get it , get it ! )
It is so important to gain an understanding of what Bookchin called ‘ social ecology ’ .
Loosely speaking , it is ‘ anarchy ’ ; but you must ditch immediately any stereotypical preconceptions and notions about that word - they are negative and deliberate connotations that have been purposefully bound in the propaganda of capitalist dialogue .
Bob Torres effectively ‘ Veganises ’ Bookchin ’s antidotes to contemporary speciesist society , outlining how a Vegan ‘ social ecology ’ movement ( ‘ Veganarchy ! ’ ) of decentralised power will ensure that our diet is given a resolute , political form .
Politics is everywhere and we have to incorporate our Vegan vision into that .
We ’re not Vegan just because the food ’s good !
( And , let ’s face it , it has n’t always been ! )
But if we de-politicise Veganism we ’ll be prone to assimilation into commodity culture and will revel in the fact we can finally buy Vegan ice cream without understanding the forms of exploitation that allow the mass dissemination of all consumer commodities , whether they ’re Vegan or not .
“ Unless we broaden our horizons and deepen our perception of both the universe and our fellow members of society , we may all perish in persisting to manipulate each other and our ecosystem with materialism and exploitation . ”
( Jan Lundberg : see elements of www.culturechange.org)
To struggle all our lives just to ensure there is a ‘ Vegan option ’ on every meat menu is obviously missing the point .
Such consensus will be our downfall .
As Torres effectively explains , Veganism must be the baseline and beginning of all liberation struggles .
That ’s why I used to love eating Vegan food on demos ; food prepared and shared by other dynamic , engaged Vegans was fuel for the march , fuel for the protest ; it was empowered and empowering !
Moreover , it would have been stripped of all that power if I ’d just been munching at home , watching the telly and congratulating myself on being Vegan !
The Vegan belief in reverence and respect for all life must be compatible with effective , pervasive and immediate action and education .
Veganism must be an active , consciousness raising project - to empower and engender our understanding and appreciation of all
life and to feed our bodies and our intellect - there are no species barriers , no circles of ethical separation , just one circle of universal compassion .
So Veganism is not just a diet ; it is the product of a powerful biological urge for liberation and equality , a vital element of the global justice movement that has struggled for centuries to liberate animals , humans and the planet from tyranny
and abuse .
“ Veganism is the daily , lived expression of abolition in one ’s life , and a rejection of the logic of speciesism (...)
If we want to eradicate exploitation we must begin by ending it in our own lives and encouraging others to do the same . ”

I propose Veganism is for the common good of all species ; for human - animals , animals and , in fact , for the entire biosphere .
The philosophical ‘ Golden Rule ’ that threads timelessly through history proposes that we should “ Do unto others as we would have done to ourselves ” .
Though it is not an inherently perfect code , it is a bloody good start !
But where does it come from ?
It is reiterated - in philosophers and prophets from Lao - Tzu , the Buddha , Jesus , and Immanuel Kant , from the 7th century BC to the Enlightenment and beyond .
Like Kant , I believe it is wholly necessary to locate the purpose of this law outside of the metaphysical preoccupations of religion and abstract philosophical enquiry - this law is manifest in our biology and thus in our treatment of all ‘ others ’ , regardless of species , it is rooted and embedded in our genetic heritage as a cooperating and reciprocally altruistic species of primate .
This Golden Rule therefore is simply the psychological and verbal expression of a biological imperative , a necessary adaptation that favours selfless cooperation towards others ; what Petr Kropotkin so famously called ‘ Mutual Aid . ’
It is therefore a law that will guarantee the success of our species and so of all species .
I believe the greatest manifestation of this imperative is Veganism .
Veganism bursts through all delusory speciesist barriers , it universalises and authenticates compassion and gives practical form to biological altruism : if altruism is the instrument , then Veganism is the music ; one of the means for total species success and survival .
Homo - sapiens cannot survive without other life forms being left alive and so we will perish , long before we are supposed to , long before the Sun has burned cold .
Veganism is a method of mutually satisfying our moral needs and evolutionary requirements , naturally selected altruistic phenomena that will ensure the building blocks of harmonious life on this planet continue .

That ’s why I used to love eating Vegan food on demos ; food prepared and shared by other dynamic , engaged Vegans was fuel for the march , fuel for the protest ; it was empowered and empowering !
Moreover , it would have been stripped of all that power if I ’d just been munching at home , watching the telly and congratulating myself on being Vegan !
The Vegan belief in reverence and respect for all life must be compatible with effective , pervasive and immediate action and education .
Veganism must be an active , consciousness raising project - to empower and engender our understanding and appreciation of alllife and to feed our bodies and our intellect - there are no species barriers , no circles of ethical separation , just one circle of universal compassion .
So Veganism is not just a diet ; it is the product of a powerful biological urge for liberation and equality , a vital element of the global justice movement that has struggled for centuries to liberate animals , humans and the planet from tyrannyand abuse .
“ Veganism is the daily , lived expression of abolition in one ’s life , and a rejection of the logic of speciesism (...)
If we want to eradicate exploitation we must begin by ending it in our own lives and encouraging others to do the same . ”

Earthworms eat seeds and seedlings , scientists have found .
The discovery they eat live rather than just dead plants will change the way we think about earthworms , which had been thought to benefit plants by recycling soil nutrients .
It may offer a way for gardeners and farmers to encourage more earthworms into their soil , for example .
But it also means invasive earthworms could be reducing populations of plants in once pristine soils .
Confirmation that earthworms feed on living plants is published in the journal Soil Biology and Biochemistry by Dr Nico Eisenhauer of the Georg - August - University Göttingen in Germany .
Earthworms function as seedling predators
Dr Nico Eisenhauer
With colleagues , Dr Eisenhauer made the discovery studying the behaviour of Lumbricus terrestris , an anecic earthworm that inhabits soils around the world .
Originating in Europe , the worm occurs in grasslands , agricultural fields and forests and is invading soils across the US , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .
Previous studies have shown that some earthworms will swallow plant seeds , while others appear to collect seeds , burying them in their burrows .
But it was not clear why , whether the earthworms were actually seeking rotting seeds , or whether they derived any nutritional benefit from the habit .
So Dr Eisenhauer set up a series of experiments to find out , offering earthworms housed in the lab a selection of food , including seeds and seedlings from different plant species .
WORM WONDERS
Earthworms form herds and make " group decisions " , scientists have just discovered Watch video of a monster worm and sea star frenzy
The results were startling .
The earthworms selectively fed on slow - germinating , nitrogen - rich seeds and seedlings , actively ingesting the plant material , killing the young plant .
Earthworms allowed to feed on live plants gained weight , and their performance would vary depending on what plants they were offered , such as legumes or grasses , suggesting they do derive nutritional benefits from such a diet .
" However , the most convincing evidence is the change in the N15 signature in earthworm tissue , " Dr Eisenhauer told the BBC .
Compared to grasses , legumes generally have lower levels of a isotope of nitrogen called N15 , due to the way they fix nitrogen from the air .
When the researchers examined the ratio of N15 within the tissue of earthworms offered legume seeds , it decreased significantly , demonstrating that earthworms feed upon , and prefer , legume seeds and seedlings .
" It was somewhat surprising that we could detect the signature of legumes in plant tissue , " says Dr Eisenhauer .
Earthworms ' taste for seeds and seedlings could alter the way we think about both the worms , and plant communities .
SOURCES
Visit Soil Biology and Biochemistry to read more about earthworms ' taste for seeds and seedlings Earthworms play a fundamental role in nutrient cycling , and in most contexts cannot be regarded as pests of plants , says Dr Eisenhauer .
In agricultural or horticultural settings , farmers or gardeners may even be able to use certain seeds to encourage more earthworms into their soil .
But is some parts of the world , they may pose a previously unrecognised problem .
" They are invading several regions previously devoid of earthworms such as northern North America , " says Dr Eisenhauer .
Studies have already shown this can cause the extinction of some plant species , and Dr Eisenhauer 's research provides one explanation why .
" The finding that earthworms function as seedling predators highlights the necessity to prevent the further anthropogenic spread of exotic earthworms , " he says .

NEW YORK -- Authorities say paramedics found former major league pitcher Jose Lima , 37 , in full cardiac arrest at his home in Pasadena Calif. , early Sunday , and he was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead .
A statement from the Pasadena Police Department says a specific cause of death is unknown , and Los Angeles County coroner 's officials will perform an autopsy .
Police detectives also responded to the scene because of the undetermined cause of death and will work with the coroner 's office , the statement said .
Lima 's wife Dorca Astacio said the cause of death was ruled a heart attack .
" Jose was complaining while sleeping and I just thought he was having a nightmare , " Astacio told ESPNdeportes.com 's Enrique Rojas .
" I called the paramedics , but they could n't help him . "
Lima , who often referred to his outings as " Lima Time , " was 89 - 102 in 13 seasons with the Detroit Tigers , Houston Astros , Kansas City Royals , Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets .
He was selected to the All - Star Game with Houston in 1999 , when he won a career - high 21 games .
Lima did n't return to the major leagues after being released by the Mets in 2006 , when he went 0 - 4 in four games pitched .
Last winter , Lima played for the Aguilas Cibaenas in the Dominican Republic and had announced plans to do the same in the upcoming season .
" This is a shock for us because Lima was a young man who seemed healthy and nobody imagined this , " said Tomas Jimenez , manager of the Aguilas Cibaenas .
Lima is survived by his wife and five children .
Jose Lima attended a game Friday at Dodger Stadium and received a round of applause when he was introduced .
Jon SooHoo
The Los Angeles Police Department 's forensic unit told Lima 's family that his body would be released Wednesday .
Lima 's family confirmed to ESPNdeportes.com that he would be buried in the Dominican Republic .
Mets shortstop Jose Reyes , a native of Santiago , the same Dominican region in which Lima was born , said he thought of Lima like an older brother .
" I could always reach out to him when I needed guidance and advice , " Reyes said in a phone interview .
" His passing truly hurts . "
Astros president of baseball operations Tal Smith called Lima " certainly one of the most entertaining personalities to ever don an Astros uniform . "
" For two years , he was one of the most successful pitchers in franchise history , winning 37 games and pitching a total of 479 innings in those two seasons , " Smith said in a statement on the team 's website .
" He pitched and lived life with great flair and enthusiasm . "
Astros owner Drayton McLane reflected on Lima 's off - the - field attributes .
" He could dance , he could sing , but his best gift of all was that he was an extremely happy person , " McLane said in a statement .
" He just lit up our clubhouse with his personality , which was his greatest asset .
Jose was not shortchanged in life in any way .
He lived life to the fullest every day . "
" Everyone will remember Jose for his antics on the mound , " said former Astro Craig Biggio , a teammate of Lima 's , according to the team 's website .
" But he was a tremendous teammate and a great competitor .
It 's a big loss for the Astros baseball family . "
Those sentiments were seconded by Tony Pena , who coached Lima with Kansas City and Aguilas Cibaenas .
" A lot of folks thought he was crazy , but Lima was an innate competitor , " Pena said .
" When Lima was on the mound , he would refuse to give the ball away until the game was over .
I have lost a son . "
Royals designated hitter Jose Guillen , who played with Lima for the Escogido Lions of the Dominican winter league , said he heard of Lima 's death before Sunday 's game in Kansas City against Colorado .

“ The most allergenic plant we have is ragweed , ” says Dr. Filley , “ It is less common on the West Coast or in New England .
Therefore there is less pollen in those areas . ”
About 75 % of Americans who have plant allergies are sensitive to ragweed , according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America .

Iceland 's supply of renewable power has won its first high - profile international data center customer .
Web browser developer Opera Software was announced today as the first customer of the Thor Data Center .
The facility in Hafnarfjorour is one of several new data center projects underway in Iceland , which has been actively marketing itself as a destination for data centers .
Thor DC said its facility will feature data center containers from Spanish tech firm AST Global that use fresh air cooling , allowing servers to run without the use of chillers for air conditioning .
Thor said the container - based design allows for quick assembly of the data center , and flexibility in scaling to adapt to a client 's needs .
Opera , which has 110 million users of its browsers , will deploy " a significant part of its electronic data traffic " to the Thor Data Center via submarine cables run by the Icelandic telecommunications company E - Farice .
But the primary attraction for Opera was not bandwidth , but the ability to power its servers with renewable energy .
" The reason Opera Software came to sign an agreement with Thor Data Center is that the company can offer us energy from 100 % renewable sources , " said Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner , founder of Opera Software .
" In coming years Iceland will be able to provide a more stable supply of energy than most other areas in the world .
This fact , combined with the excellent technical knowledge of Thor DC ’s staff , is the main reason why Opera Software has decided to base its data in Iceland . "
Thor Data Center has secured 3.2 megawatts of electricity to be provided by HS Energy on the Reykjanes peninsula , with an option to expand its capacity to 19.2 megawatts if needed .
In early 2007 the government of Iceland began been touting the country as an affordable destination for data center development , citing its abundant supply of geothermal power .
At the time , we noted that companies considering Iceland “ not forget the source of all that geothermal energy : Iceland sits atop an active volcanic rift . ”
Early this year Verne Holdings announced that it had secured funding from the UK's Wellcome Trust to complete the first phase of a new data center in a former NATO Command Center in Keflavik , Iceland .
But what about placing data centers near active volcanoes ?
Iceland ’s predominant wind and weather pattern flows from West to East , so Verne and Thor have chosen sites to the west of the country ’s active volcanoes , so any ash plumes would be blown away from the data center .
World 's Best Job : Beach Tanning Butler
Meet the people with the most unique hotel jobs in the world .
March 23 , 2010  --
Imagine being paid to walk around the beach all day , chatting with beautiful people basking in the Florida sun .
Sounds good ?
Well , hurry and send in your application to the Ritz - Carlton , South Beach in Miami Beach , Fla. , which is looking for a new " tanning butler . "
That 's right .
The luxury hotel actually has somebody on the payroll whose sole responsibility is to help you get lathered up in sunscreen .
The service has been in place since the Ritz opened six years ago .
The high - visibility butlers , however , usually do n't last too long -- the first was discovered on the pool deck and moved to Milan two months later for a modeling career .
" The tanning butler patrols the pool deck and beach in an effort to ensure every guest returns home with a golden South Beach tan , " said Michelle Payer , the creator of the program and a spokeswoman for the hotel .
The tanning butler is just one of the unique hotel jobs we found around the globe .
From coin washer to peacock manager to fireplace butler , ABC News sought out some of the most unique jobs in the hospitality industry .
Stay Up to Date on the Latest Travel Trends From ABC News on Twitter
The Ritz Carlton 's tanning butler wears a custom - made holster filled with sunscreens of varying SPFs .
Not only is the lotion free , but he also offers to apply it to hard - to - reach back , shoulder and neck areas that easily burn .
" His holster also contains a cool water mister and sunglass cleaner for the ultimate in multi- tasking service , " Payer added .
Malcolm Vincent held the job for nearly three years and still calls it today " a phenomenal experience . "
He was born and raised on Maui and said , " I was just a natural at it . "
" I just tried to provide a really over - the - top experience for the guest , " Vincent said .
He got to meet celebrities staying at the hotel and says he enjoyed providing the service , which was a pleasant surprise to countless sunbathing guests .
So , was it more enjoyable to apply sunscreen to some people than others ?
" I was an equal opportunity tanning butler , " Vincent said .
" For me , a guest is a guest .
I was just there to make sure they did n't get that nasty sunburn . "
It 's not only the ultimate in pampering but also a great story to take home .
" I can't tell you the hundreds of photo albums the tanning butler must be in worldwide , from Stockholm to Tokyo , " Payer said .
" He 's a hit , and a service that guests expect . "
A few years ago , a girl even called and asked the tanning butler to be her prom date .
The ideal candidate for the job , Payer said , is outgoing , gregarious , well - spoken , a true people person who enjoys engaging in conversation and understands his role as an ambassador of a luxury brand .
School of Falconry
Across the ocean , we found a very different type of job .
Weighing hawks does not play a huge , or indeed any , part in the average hotel employee 's day , but Emma Ford is not your average hotel employee .
She is director of the British School of Falconry , which is located at the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland .
Her morning work routine begins with weighing her precious Harris Hawks .
" A fat hawk wo n't fly , " Ford explains , so the morning weigh - in is crucial and gauges how much food and exercise the bird will have that day .
The school offers two kinds of falconry sessions .
Guests can chose between a short , 45 - minute introductory session , at $ 100 per person , or a longer half - day hunt with the birds out in the wild for $ 350 per person .
" I have probably one of the best jobs in the world .
The reaction from the guests is incredible , " Ford said .
In both sessions , the bird flies off and then returns to a glove worn by the guests .
" We aim to get a falcon on a guest 's hand within five minutes , " she said .
For most people , it 's the first time they 've had such close contact with any bird , let alone a hawk .
" They discover they are n't as scary as they thought , " Ford said .
She has been a falcon fanatic every since she first locked eyes with one aged 8 when a new neighbor moved in next door .
She looked over the wall into a hawk 's eyes and was hooked .
And through falconry , Ford has also found love .
At the age of 14 , she met another keen falconer , now her husband , who helps her run the school at Gleneagles .
They have never had any accidents with the hotel guests and the birds .
" They 're not vicious creatures .
They love being in the company of humans , " she said , but did offer one word of warning : if you turn up in a fur coat you 'll be asked to take it off .
" You do n't want to look like a very large rabbit " when around falcons , Ford said .
They might just get the wrong idea .
Other amazing hotel jobs include :
Sleep Concierge : The Benjamin Hotel in New York takes its guests ' sleep very seriously .
In fact , they guarantee a good night 's sleep or your money back .
To this end , they have hired a sleep concierge .
Anya Orlanska contacts guests prior to their stay , e-mailing them the hotel 's pillow menu .
Once they arrive , she is on hand , always ready to give sleep advice to guests .
They offer a selection of 12 different kinds of pillows , including the Snore - No - More , Lullaby , and Gelly Neck Roll .
" The Swedish Memory [ foam ] is the most popular , " Orlanska said .
" It 's a space - age design by NASA .
It even keeps you cool in the summer and warm in the winter . "
She 'll also talk guests through how best to prepare for a good night 's sleep .
" We advise them not to eat a heavy meal before bed .
No BlackBerry or computer in the bedroom , " she said .
" We encourage guests to keep the bedroom for sleeping . "
Orlanska 's secret weapon ?
A peanut butter and jelly sandwich made with banana bread which , she claims , spurs the production of sleep - inducing melatonin .
The role is clearly a rewarding one for Orlanksa , although it was not one she sought out , having originally interviewed for a regular concierge job .
" I like my job very much , " she said , adding that she enjoys helping people sleep .
" You feel useful . "
Coin Washer : The Westin St. Francis in San Francisco has employed a coin washer since the mid-1930s , when women always wore white gloves and hats to come downtown .
The story goes that a hotel general manager noticed that the ladies attending the weekly fashion shows in the Mural Room were soiling their white gloves on the change they were using to pay for lunch .
So to keep gloves clean , the hotel started washing all its coins .
For the last 10 years , Rob Holson , who today also runs the hotel 's business center , has been washing the coins .
" It 's a side job , basically , " he said .
Each week he washes about $ 700 to $ 800 in coins in an old manually operated machine once used to polish the hotel 's silverware .
Fireplace Butler :
At the Taj Boston , guests can call this butler to ensure that their wood - burning fireplace is properly ablaze .
The butler will help the guests choose the type of wood they prefer from the hotel 's " firewood menu . "
For instance , pick cherry wood to scent the room , or birch for a quick - burning fire .
Pigeon Chaser : The Oberoi Rajvilas in Jaipur , India , has a designated pigeon chaser armed with a flag on a long pole to ensure guests and the temples do n't get , well , covered in pigeon droppings .
YouTube Concierge : The San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casinoin Puerto Rico helps guests share their vacation experience with those back home via free online video postcards .
The YouTube concierge spends time each day around the resort offering guests the chance to record a quick 30 - second video which can be sent to friends , family or co-workers back home .
Peacock Manager : Kirkland Johnson has been the head groundskeeper at Royal Plantation Ocho Rios in Jamaica since the resort reopened in 2001 , and is also responsible for managing the on - site peacock population .
Kirkland is responsible for feeding all 18 peacocks once a day ( they get high - protein organic birdseed ) in addition to nest upkeep and monitoring peacock eggs and chicks ( who are often targeted by the local mongoose population . )
Water Sommelier : In Germany , the restuarant at the Regent Berlin has two Michelin stars and one water sommelier .
Arno Steguweit offers guests a water list .
He pairs menu items and meals with certain mineral waters , based on guests ' " palates . "
His decision to pursue water sommelier service actually stemmed from attending whisky tastings , where he noticed that minerals in certain waters would actually fortify the spirit's flavors .
Beekeeper : David Garcelon , executive chef at the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto , is also the hotel 's beekeeper .
Three rooftop hives are a natural extension of the decade - old rooftop herb garden .
And the bees deliver irresistible honey for guests .
Candle Lighter : Lighting the 450 candles in the dining room at Le Sirenuse hotel on Italy 's Amalfi Coast might seem a rather simple and menial task .
Yet it is one that entails patience , a firm hand and equilibrium .
This delicate task has been assigned to Raffaele , a charming waiter from the nearby village of Praiano who has been with Le Sirenuse for more 40 years .
He starts but climbing a ladder and lighting each candle from above ( each is held in a transparent handmade glass container to protect them from a sudden gust of wind . )
Then he goes from table to table lighting all of those candles .
At the end of the night , the remnants of each candle must be removed so the glass containers can be cleaned .
Director of Elephants : John Roberts is the director of elephants at the Anantara Golden Triangle Resort & Spa 's elephant camp and conservation center in northern Thailand .
The camp helps the government 's preservation efforts and offers employment for local elephant drivers ( mahouts ) .
Roberts also organizes an annual elephant polo tournament on the resort 's grounds .
Running Concierge : Westin Hotels & Resorts has a program at some of its hotels where a staff member leads guided runs through the neighborhood .
Through the RunWESTIN program , the concierge leads warm up sessions , distributes water and towels and then highlights distinct points along the three - mile route .
Duke beat Butler 61 - 59 for the national championship Monday night , a win that was n't secure until after the buzzer sounded -- when Gordon Hayward 's halfcourt , 3 - point heave for the win barely missed to leave tiny Butler one cruel basket short of the Hollywood ending .
Singler scored 19 points and Brian Zoubek rebounded Hayward 's miss with 3.6 seconds left -- the first of two chances Butler had to win it -- to end the overachieving underdog 's try for a real - life " Hoosiers " sequel .
" We just came up a bounce short , " Butler coach Brad Stevens said .
That bounce went in favor of the Blue Devils ( 35 - 5 ) , who snapped Butler 's 25 - game winning streak and brought the long - awaited fourth national title back home to Carolina and the Cameron Crazies .
The " Big Three " -- Singler , Jon Scheyer ( 15 points ) and Nolan Smith ( 13 ) -- won the Big One for coach Mike Krzyzewski , his first championship since 2001 and the fourth overall , tying Coach K with Adolph Rupp for second place on the all - time list .
" First of all , it was a great basketball game .
I want to congratulate an amazing Butler team and their fans , " Krzyzewski said .
" Fabulous year .
We played a great game , they played a great game .
It 's hard for me to say it , to imagine that we 're the national champions . "
Nobody figured this would be easy , and it was n't -- no way that was going to happen against Butler , the 4,200 - student private school that turned the tournament upside down and drove 5.6 miles from its historic home , Hinkle Fieldhouse , to the Final Four .
Butler ( 33 - 5 ) shaved a five - point deficit to one and had a chance to win it , when its best player , Hayward , took the ball at the top of the key , spun and worked his way to the baseline , but was forced to put up an off - balance fadeaway from 15 feet .
He missed , Zoubek got the rebound and made the first of two free throws .
He missed the second one intentionally , and Duke 's title was n't secure until Hayward 's desperation heave bounded out .
" I can't really put it into words because the last couple of plays were just not normal , " said Singler , the Final Four 's most outstanding player .
What a game to end one of the most memorable tournaments in history , filled with close games , upsets and underdogs ; the kind of tournament that some fear could be history if the NCAA goes ahead with an expansion to 96 teams -- something very much on the table for next year .
It was the closest margin of victory since Michigan defeated Seton Hall 80 - 79 in 1989 .
" Both teams and all the kids on both teams played their hearts out , " Krzyzewski said .
" There was never more than a couple , a few points separating , so a lot of kids made big plays for both teams . "
Nobody led by more than six .
Playing against the Bulldogs and working against a crowd of 70,930 with very few pockets of Duke fans , the Blue Devils persevered -- never leading by more than six but never falling behind after Singler hit a 3 - pointer with 13:03 left for a 47 - 43 lead .
The Blue Devils won with defense .
They held the Bulldogs to 34 percent shooting and contested every possession as tenaciously as Butler , which allowed 60 points for the first time since February .
Zoubek , the 7 - foot - 1 center , finished with two blocks , 10 rebounds and too many altered shots to count .
He also came out to trap the Butler guards and disrupt an offense that was already struggling .

THE ABILITY OF WINNERS TO WIN AGAIN
Even people who are n’t avid baseball fans ( your DSN editor included ) can get something out of this one .
When two baseball teams play each other on two consecutive days , what is the probability that the winner of the first game will be the winner of the second game ?
[ If you like fun , write down your prediction . ]
DSN ’s father - in - law told him that recently the Mets beat the Phillies 9 to 1 , but the very next day , the Phillies beat the Mets 10 to 0 .
How could this be ?
If the Mets were so good as to win by 8 points , how could the exact same players be so bad as to lose by 10 points to the same opponents 24 hours later ?
Let ’s call this situation ( in which team A beats team B one one day , but team B beats team A the very next day ) a “ reversal ” , and we ’ll say the size of the reversal is the smaller of the two margins of victory .
In the above example , the size of the reversal was 8 .
Using R ( code provided below ) , DSN obtained statistics on all major league baseball games played between 1970 and 2009 and calculated how often each type of reversal occurs per 100,000 pairs of consecutive games .
The result is in the the graph above .
Big reversals are rare .
A reversal of size 8 occurs in only 174 of 100,000 games ; a size 12 reversal happens but 10 times per 100k .
A size 13 reversal never happened in those 40 years .
One might think this is because it would be uncommon for a team that is so good to suddenly become so bad and vice versa , but note that big margins of victory are rare : only 4 % of games have margins of victory of 8 points or larger .
Back to our question :
If a team wins on one day , what ’s the probability they ’ll win against the same opponent when they play the very next day ?
We asked two colleagues knowledgeable in baseball and the mathematics of forecasting .
The answers came in between 65 % and 70 % .
The true answer : 51.3 % , a little better than a coin toss .
That ’s right .
When you win in baseball , there ’s only a 51 % chance you ’ll win again in more or less identical circumstances .
The careful reader might notice that the answer is visible in the already mentioned chart .
The reversals of size 0 , ( meaning no reversal , meaning the same team won twice ) occur 51,296 times per 100,000 pairs of consecutive games .
[ At this point , DSN must admit that it is entirely possible that it has made a computational error .
It welcomes others to reproduce the analysis with the code or pre-processed data at the end of this post . ]
What of the adage “ the best predictor of future performance is past performance ” ?
It seems less true than Sting ’s observation “ History will teach us nothing “ .
Let ’s continue the investigation .
Here were plot the probability of winning the second game based on obtaining various margins of victory in the first game .
We simply calculated the average win rate for each margin of victory up to 11 games , which makes up 98 % of the data , and bin together the remaining 2 % , comprising margins of victory from 12 to 27 points .
( Rest assured , the binning makes the graph look prettier , but does not affect the outcome . )
The equation of the robust regression line is : Probability ( Win_Second_Game ) = .498 + .004 * First_Game_Margin which suggests that even if you win the first game by an obscene 20 points , your chance of winning the second game is only 57.8 %
Still in disbelief ?
Here we do no binning and plot the margin of victory ( or loss ) of the first game winner as a function of its margin of victory in the first game .
The clear heteroskedasticity is dealt with by iterative reweighted least squares in R ’s rlm command .
Similar results are obtained by fitting a loess line .
This model is Expected_Second_Game_Margin = -.012 + .030*First_Game_Margin
One final note .
The 51.3 % chance you ’ll win the second game given you ’ve won the first is smaller than the so called “ home team advantage ” , which we found to be a win probability of 54.2 % on first games and 53.8 % on second games .
When the home team wins the first game , it wins the second game 54.7 % of the time .
When the home team loses the first game , it wins the second game 52.8 % of the time .
When the visitor wins the first game , it wins the second game 47.2 % of the time .
When the visitor loses the first game , it wins the second game 45.3 % of the time .
Surprisingly , when it comes to winning the second game , it ’s better to be the home team who just lost than the visitor who just won .
So much for drawing conclusions from winning .
Decision Science
News has always wondered why teams are so eager to fire their coaches after they lose a few big games .
Do n’t they realize that their desired state of having won those same few big games would have been mostly due to luck ?
There you have it .
Either we have made an egregious error in calculation or recent victories are surprisingly uninformative .

Spectacular view of our home Planet Earth and the Sun as seen from the Space Shuttle
The solar system is around 4.6 billion years old .
At the center of the solar system is the sun , a yellow dwarf star which produces vast amounts of energy .
There are eight major planets and over 100 moons in the solar system .
Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars are the small inner rocky planets .
Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune are the large outer gas giants .
All the planets orbit the sun in an elliptical , oval shaped path .
Many of the planets in the solar system are visible to the naked eye .
Other objects in the solar system include dwarf planets , asteroids and comets .
The solar system is in a galaxy known as " The Milky Way " .
It is estimated that at least a third of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way are orbited by one or more planets .
The Voyager 1 spacecraft is the furthest man-made object in the solar system , it is around 13.7 billion miles ( 22 billion km ) from the sun and is still sending data back to Earth .
Birth of the Solar System
Material accreting around the sun in the early solar system
Planets of the Solar System
Our solar system began as part of a massive nebula cloud of molecular hydrogen and dust around 4.6 billion years ago .
In a region of this dark cloud conditions allowed gravity to begin condensing the hydrogen until a substantial mass began to grow ever larger and hotter , eventually this mass collapsed in on itself , forming the early stage of a star called a protostar .
The gravitational pull of the embryonic star caused a large disc of gas and dust to begin forming around it .
Over millions of years pressure began to build up inside the protostar as it became hotter and denser until eventually nuclear fusion began in its core , giving birth to the sun as we know it .
During this time the disc of gas and dust that had formed around the star had also began condensing into ever growing orbiting bodies .
In time they would go on to form the planets , moons and other objects in our solar system .
Planet Saturn , one of the eight planets in our solar system
The nearest planet to the sun is Mercury , aptly named after the swift footed messenger god it orbits the sun in only 88 days , quicker than any other planet in the solar system .
Next comes Venus , often referred to as Earth ’s sister planet but underneath her thick clouds lies a hellish oven baked landscape with temperatures hot enough to melt lead .
Third planet from the sun lies Earth , a striking blue sphere covered with oceans of liquid water and the only planet known to us which harbors life .
The last of the rocky inner planets is Mars , consisting of a thin atmosphere this red body was once covered in oceans just like Earth but is now a desert where dust storms can engulf the entire planet .
Moons of the Solar System
Almost 800 million kilometers from the sun we find the first of the gas giants , Jupiter , enormous in its size it would take over a 1,000 Earths to fill its volume .
Saturn is the second of the gas giants and is unlike any other planet in the solar system with its spectacularly colorful rings made from dust and ice particles .
Then comes the first of the planets known as ice giants , Uranus , this large turquoise ball of gas lies tilted on its side with freezing atmospheric temperatures of - 371 Fahrenheit .
At 4.5 billion kilometers from the sun we find the last of the planets , Neptune , a blue ice giant where winds in the atmosphere reach over 2,000 kilometers per hour .
The volcanic moon
Io , one of the many fascinating moons in our solar system
Other Bodies in the Solar System
As mankind explores space we have found that some of the moons in our solar system are equally and at times even more fascinating than the planets themselves .
Jupiter ’s wonderfully colored moon
Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system , Saturn ’s moon Titan has a thick nitrogen based atmosphere which rains methane producing liquid lakes on its surface .
Another of Saturn ’s moons Enceladus has volcanoes which erupt with water ice and possibly has a liquid ocean underneath its icy surface .
Then there is the ice world of Europa , another of Jupiter ’s fascinating moons , underneath its surface lies a vast ocean of liquid water which is 100 kilometers deep and possibly teeming with life .
The Sun lies at the center of our solar system .
Life in the Solar System
At the center of the solar system is our sun , a massive ball of hydrogen and helium over a hundred times larger in diameter than Earth producing immense heat and enormous explosions which jettison solar winds millions of miles into space .
Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter lies the Asteroid Belt , millions of rocks reside in this area some as large as 60 miles ( 100 km ) in diameter .
Beyond Neptune we reach the Kuiper Belt where we find most of the dwarf planets including Pluto , at one time considered the ninth planet in our solar system this tiny body orbits the Sun at an average distance of almost 6 billion kilometers .
Comets originate in the Kuiper Belt or the even more far flung Oort Cloud , a massive spherical cloud of icy bodies that surrounds the solar system .
A future probe searching for life in the underground ocean of Europa
Human kind has often pondered whether life exists elsewhere in the solar system , and if so what kind of life ?
Up until the mid 20th century it was thought every planet could harbor some kind of life forms , possibly even more advanced than ourselves .
In the 1930 ’s an Orson Welles radio production of the novel “ War of the Worlds ” by H.G Wells caused widespread panic as listeners mistakenly thought it was real .
This is an indication of how much the belief in advanced alien life forms from neighboring planets was held in the common psyche .
Of course now we know this is just science fiction and that we 're not under imminent attack from an alien civilization on Mars or Neptune .
So is there life anywhere in the solar system apart from Earth and who are the suspects ?
Well you may be surprised to learn that there are several candidates in our varied solar system .
Let 's begin with Mars , the planet that captures our imagination the most .
Even though we now know there are no canals on Mars or advanced civilizations , scientists involved in the Viking lunar landings still expected to find signs of life in the Martian surface .
Viking 1 landed on Mars in June 1976 and analyzed samples of the Martian soil , but found nothing .
Subsequent missions have also found no signs of life but there 's still hope , and it lies underground .
The reason for this theory is that surprisingly methane is present in the Martian atmosphere and one way methane can be produced is biologically .
In the warmer summer months on Mars the presence of methane increases dramatically giving more credence to the idea that there are organisms living deep under the surface , possibly around hot vents .
There are two fascinating moons around Saturn which could possibly support life .
Both are very different from one another , they are Enceladus and Titan .
Enceladus is a very small icy world with an area only slightly larger than Texas but under its surface there is believed to be a salt water ocean .
How can there be warm water in such a cold area of the solar system ?
Well the tremendous gravitational force of Saturn pushes and pulls the small moon heating up its interior and melting the ice underneath its surface .
If so this could provide an environment for micro-organisms or some other forms of life to exist .
Enceladus 's near neighbor , well 600,000 miles away , is another of Saturn 's moons , Titan .
This moon is exceptional in the solar system as it is the only one with a significant atmosphere .
What 's even more surprising is that its atmosphere is comprised mainly of nitrogen , just like our own planet .
Even more amazing is that it is the only object in our solar system apart from Earth to have large areas of liquid on its surface , not of water but liquid methane .
Methane on Titan acts like water on Earth , there are methane clouds which produce methane rain and methane lakes .
Titan is often compared to primordial Earth , but unfortunately it's in deep freeze with surface temperatures around - 179C ( - 290 F ) .
It is still possible that methane based microbial life could exist there breathing hydrogen instead of oxygen .
Our Galaxy and the Universe
Lastly we come to an icy moon orbiting around Jupiter called Europa .
It is believed this moon , just slightly smaller than our own moon , presents the best possibilities for life in the entire solar system .
The force of Jupiter 's gravity produces tremendous tidal heating inside Europa , warming its interior and producing a salt water ocean which is 62 miles ( 100 km ) deep .
It is possible that there is twice the amount of liquid water on Europa than there is on Earth !
It 's been speculated that Europa 's ocean could be teeming with life , not just bacteria but complex organisms could be swimming in the warm water .
Around the year 2025 NASA hopes to land a probe on Europa 's surface which will then melt through the ice and investigate the ocean for signs of life , maybe then we will find out that we are not alone in the solar system .
The Andromeda Galaxy
In the context of the size of the universe , the Earth and indeed the entire solar system is insignificant .
Our sun is just one of 200 billion stars in our galaxy , and our own galaxy , the Milky Way , is just one of over 100 billion galaxies in the known universe .
The solar system is located in a quiet area of our galaxy , far from its busy center where there also exists a supermassive black hole which has 4 million times the mass of our sun .
The Milky Way is in fact a giant among galaxies , spanning 100,000 light years in diameter , there are more than 30 other galaxies in our " neighborhood " of which only Andromeda ( pictured right ) is larger .
The best explanation we have as to how the universe was created is The Big Bang theory .
Around 14 billion years ago a superdense , superhot mass billions of times smaller than a proton began expanding , in time creating the stars , planets and galaxies we have in the universe today , indeed it is still expanding .
It is not known how the initial mass came to be .
The other day I was about to embark on a little bit of Facebook maintenance ( no really , it was n’t to play Farmville , YoVille or any of the popular web games ) when to my surprise I received a “ Security Check ” informing me that there was a logged attempt to access my account from the United Kingdom .
If anything looks unfamiliar , we ’ll help you change your password ( this will help prevent people in the future from accessing your account without permission ) .
Do you recognize the account activity listed above ?
I was presented with two options : Yes , I recognize it or No .
It looks unfamiliar .
Since I did not recognize the activity , I clicked on the latter .
The security check reminds me of the mechanism Google introduced to GMail in March of 2010 that alerts you when your account has been accessed from different geological locations , prompting you to acknowledge the alert or ignore it .
Once I determined that I have never attempted to access my Facebook account from the UK , the next step is to create a new password .
To help keep your Facebook account secure in the future , please select a new password .
If any of your other online accounts ( such as email ) are using your current Facebook password , you ’ll want to select a new , unique password for each of those accounts too .
While there are still privacy issues on Facebook , they deserve a big thumbs up on this one .
I am glad to see that they are incorporating these types of validation checks given its user database exceeds 350 million users .
Way to take responsibility !

The Limits of float May 30 , 2010
Roscoe , N.Y .
One of the first things the veteran C# programmer notices when learning XNA programming is that all floating - point values are single - precision float rather than double - precision double .
This not only reduces storage space ( 4 bytes each rather than 8 bytes ) but also improves performance — at least in theory .
( My extremely brief experimentation of the performance differential on the PC reveals something in the range of only about 5 % improvement , but it may be more substantial on other devices . )
Although float is fine for most purposes in computer graphics , it can be problematic is some circumstances .
For example , suppose you want to animate some graphic or text by continuously rotating it 360° every second .
Both the Draw and DrawString methods of SpriteBatch have overloads that accept a rotation angle of type float .
It 's common to store this rotation angle as a field :
float angle ;
A new value is then calculated during every call to the Game derivative 's Update method .
Recently I 've been using a calculation that looks something like this :
angle = MathHelper .
TwoPi * ( float ) gameTime.TotalGameTime.TotalSeconds ;
The GameTime argument to the Update method has a TotalGameTime property of type TimeSpan indicating the total time since the game began .
The TotalSeconds property of the TimeSpan object is of type double .
I simply cast that to a float and multiply it by MathHelper .
TwoPi ( an XNA static field of type float ) to obtain an angle in radians .
From the very first time I typed in a statement like this , I 've known two things :
In the short term , the code works fine .
In the long term , the code will fail .
I knew the code would fail because of the insufficiency of float to maintain accuracy with large values .
But I did n't have an intuitive sense of when the " short term " became the " long term " !
As you might know from reading Chapter 23 of my book Code : The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software , the ANSI / IEE Standard 754-1985 , also known as the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating - Point Arithmetic defines single - precision floating - point values with a 1 - bit sign ( s in the formula below ) , a 23 - bit significand fraction ( f ) , and an 8 - bit exponent ( e ) .
In the normal case , a number stored in this format can be calculated as :
( –1 ) s × 1.f × 2e–127
Let 's take an example .
Suppose I write a program with some code that calculates an angle value in the way I 've shown .
After the program has been running a full day , the TotalGameTime property represents a TimeSpan of 24 hours or 86,400 seconds .
In binary , that 's 1 0101 0001 1000 0000 .
Because the leading digit is always 1 in conversion to binary , it does n't have to be stored .
The remaining binary digits become the first 16 digits of the 23 - bit fraction value :
s = 0
f = 010 1000 1100 0000 0000 0000
e = 143
Or :
86400 = ( – 1) 0 × 1.0101 0001 1000 0000 0000 000 × 2143 –127
Those 7 additional bits in the significand fraction allow the representation of fractional seconds .
Thus , the values are accurate to 1/128 of a second .
Since the video frame rate in XNA ranges from 30 frames per second ( for a Zune or Windows Phone 7 ) to 60 or so ( for a PC ) , accuracy of 1/128 second is fine .
Here 's a shortcut technique for visualizing the float representation of numbers greater than 1 : Simply write the number in binary with a leading 1 and exactly 24 digits .
For example ,
86400 = 1 0101 0001 1000 0000.0000 000
Notice the binary point preceding the fractional 7 digits .
This shows clearly that numbers in this region have 7 - bit fractions for an accuracy of 1/128 .
Now let 's run the game for a week .
At the end of a week , the TotalGameTime property is a TimeSpan representing 604,800 seconds .
Write that as a 24 - bit binary :
604800 = 1001 0011 1010 1000 0000.0000
Now the fractional part is only 4 bits , and the number is accurate to only 1/16 second .
As you cast this TotalSeconds property of the TotalGameTime to a float you are essentially rounding to the nearest 1/16 second , and effectively reducing your frame rate to 16 frames per second .
Between one day and seven days , as the float value becomes increasingly unable to accurately represent total time , you 'll get some visible jitter and skippiness in the animation .
Might it help to perform the calculation using the original double value of the TotalSeconds property and cast to float when storing the final value ?
Here 's the code :
angle = ( float ) ( Math .
PI * gameTime.TotalGameTime.TotalSeconds ) ;
Now I 'm using the regular .
NET Math .
PI static field of type double rather than the XNA MathHelper .
Pi static field of type float .
After one week , the angle value is calculated as 604,800 × 2 π which is about 4,301,109.8988 or in 24 - bit binary :
604,800 × 2 π = 11 1011 1011 0000 1001 1100.10
Now there 's only a two - bit fractional part , so the angle is accurate to 1/ 4 radian , or 45° .
No good !
( This problem also exists with the original code but I chose to focus on the time rather than the resultant angle . )
You 'll have the same problem if you increment the angle based on the ElapsedGameTime property of the GameTime argument :
angle += MathHelper .
TwoPi * ( float ) gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds ;
The ElapsedGameTime is ( usually ) the time between video frames , either 1/30 or 1/60 second or thereabouts .
That 's fine for a float and the multiplication is OK as well .
The problem occurs when accumulating that incremental value in an already large angle field .
What 's the solution ?
The easiest solution is simply assuming that nobody 's going to be running your games for more than a few hours !
But probably the best solution involves performing the calculations using double and then normalizing the result between 0 and 2 π by finding the remainder using the modulus operation ( % ) .
Then it 's safe to cast to a float :
angle = ( float ) ( 2 * Math .
PI * gameTime.TotalGameTime.TotalSeconds %
( 2 * Math . PI ) ) ;
Or , increment the angle field using the ElapsedGameTime property and then normalize the result :
angle += MathHelper .
TwoPi * ( float ) gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds ;
angle %= MathHelper .TwoPi ;
Either version will preserve adequate calculational accuracy well beyond a week and for at least a millennium .
Most people around the globe think of America as a great “ capitalist ” economic machine , but the truth is that the U.S. financial system is essentially one massive betting parlor at this point .
In fact , there has been a whole lot of easy money made in this betting parlor over the past several years by our politicians and by the big financial players down on Wall Street .
So how did they make all of this money ?
They did it by betting against America .
By betting that the U.S. economy would do badly , a lot of very powerful people have gotten insanely wealthy .
Literally billions of dollars have been made over the past five years simply by betting that the U.S. housing market would go into the toilet .
But is all of this “ short selling ” and are all of these “ side bets ” actually good for the American economy ?
How is the U.S. economy supposed to succeed when the big banks and so many of our politicians are actively making bets against it ?
Just take a moment and check out some of the folks that have been betting against America … .
* A Wall Street Journal analysis of congressional disclosures shows that 13 members of the U.S. Congress or their wives were engaged in substantial short selling during the financial crisis of 2008 .
* An individual by the name of Jeff Greene made hundreds of millions of dollars during the real estate collapse by making huge bets against the residential housing market .
Now he wants to use some of that money to run for the U.S. Senate in Florida .
* Goldman Sachs openly and brazenly bet against its own clients as the housing market began to implode back in 2007 and 2008 , and they made a TON of money by doing so .
* John Paulson ( with the assistance of Goldman Sachs ) has quickly become one of the richest men in the United States by betting against America .
Shorting the subprime mortgage market enabled his firm , Paulson & Co. , to make 15 billion dollars in 2007 .
John Paulson alone made approximately 4 billion dollars that year .
* Legendary investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday that he ’s bearish about the ability of all currencies to hold their value over time because of massive deficits being run up by governments in the wake of the global financial crisis .
* The Federal Reserve holds credit - default swaps on the debt of Florida schools , and on debt owed by the states of Nevada and California .
So the Federal Reserve would profit if one of those states defaulted on its debt .
* JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , and Citigroup are offering “ municipal credit default swaps ” that enable investors to make big money if U.S. states and cities end up defaulting on their debts .
It is one thing to make a legitimate profit on an investment .
It is another thing entirely for the biggest financial institutions in the United States and our politicians to be making massive amounts of money off of the economic collapse of America .
You see , those making huge bets against the U.S. economy also have an incentive to do what they can to make those bets profitable .
So for those who have the power to do so , does there come a point where they give the U.S. economy a little “ push ” in the wrong direction so that their bets will pay off ?
The reality is that we have created a financial environment where fear rules .
For example , very few people want to back U.S. home loans anymore .
So now the U.S. government has to do it .
According to Inside Mortgage Finance , U.S. government - related entities backed 96.5 % of all U.S. home loans during the first quarter of 2010 .
This was up from 90 % in 2009 .
We should really rethink a financial system where a few people make a ton of money off of the fact that everyone else is doing badly .
Sure a few people are laughing all the way to the bank , but America as a whole is hurting .
Just consider the following charts .
U.S. national income has never experienced such a radically negative change in modern times ….
All of these economic problems have caused the revenue of the U.S. government to dramatically decline at the same time expenditures are rocketing into the stratosphere … .
As the U.S. economy continues to tank , the U.S. national debt is going to keep spinning wildly out of control .
Back in 1980 , the U.S. national debt was approximately 1 trillion dollars .
Today it is accelerating rapidly as it pushes past 12 trillion dollars and towards 13 trillion dollars … .
The truth is that the massive deficits being run up not only by the U.S. government , but by governments all over the world , are something that is clearly not sustainable .
In fact , Warren Buffett recently made an interesting remark about how painful it is going to be when the debt party ends … .
“ How the world weans itself off huge deficit financing is going to be difficult to watch . ”
In fact , there are some nations that are in bigger trouble with debt than even the United States is .
Japan ’s gross public debt has reached 201 % of GDP , and the only way that the government of Japan can avoid bankruptcy at this point is by borrowing ever - increasing amounts of money .
But the truth is that this game cannot be played forever .
There has never been a time when so many nations around the world have piled up so much debt so quickly .
When the sovereign debt bubble pops , things are going to get really messy and the dominoes will start falling really quickly .
But when that happens one thing is for certain – there will be a lot of people ready to make a lot of money by betting on the financial failures of others .
STATES ALONG the Gulf of Mexico have bet their fishing and tourism industries on the safety of oil drilling offshore , and that bet , which New England has refused to make , has turned into a losing one .
The nation as a whole should take the growing oil spill in the Gulf as a warning — that there are consequences to relying so heavily on fossil fuels , and that domestic oil production is no panacea for US energy needs .
President Obama announced earlier this year that he would permit more offshore drilling .
Even under that policy , the waters of New England and especially the fertile fishing grounds of Georges Bank would still be off - limits .
Yesterday , Obama sensibly said there will be no new drilling anywhere until engineers learn what caused the Deepwater Horizon oil rig to explode and its “ blowout preventer ’’ to fail .
That inquiry should begin even while efforts continue to stop the discharge of oil into the Gulf — currently at the rate of 5,000 barrels a day — and contain the massive leak .
It ’s vital to prevent more disasters .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has ordered teams to inspect the 30 drilling rigs and 47 production platforms in deepwater locations in the Gulf .
Four decades ago , an oil - rig spill off Santa Barbara in California helped give birth to the environmental movement .
Since then , the oil drilling industry has had a generally good record .
That was one reason that Obama ended the moratorium on drilling from Delaware to Florida .
By doing so , he hoped to win support from drilling advocates for the broader energy and climate change legislation working its way through Congress .
If that did n’t change minds , the current disaster should .
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 and threatens the wildlife and beaches of the Gulf Coast , follows closely on the Upper Big Branch coal mining disaster in West Virginia , which killed 29 .
Both of these fossil - fuel disasters pale in comparison to the much greater one that continued reliance on hydrocarbons will produce — a planet made drastically different by climate change .
Obama should seize this moment to get Congress to act .
When it comes to slowing global warming , US leadership is a blowout preventer that could work .

A mole - like thermal drill designed to cutthrough the icy surface of Jupiter ?s moon Europa could be on a future missionslated for launch in 2020 .
Sucha device would represent the best of both worlds by using heat to melt throughthe ice and rotating drill blades to clear away rocky material .
The drill wouldbe nestled inside a larger penetrator probe that would burrow itself into Europa 's icy shell .
" Penetratorsare the most feasible , cheapest and safest option for a landing on Europatoday , and the knowledge to build those is there , " said Peter Weiss , apost - doc now at the National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) in France .
He and his colleagues at the Hong KongPolytechnic University worked with other researchersat the Institut fuer Weltraumforschungin Graz , Austria on a study detailed in the January issue of the journal Advancesin Space Research .
NASAand the European Space Agency ( ESA ) have teamed up on the Europa Jupiter SystemMission ( EJSM ) , with both Russia and Japan also showing interest .
The mission could becomposed of several orbiters peering down at Europa , but Russia has its eyes on a possible lander ?
and the Russians have already built penetrators forpast missions , such as the failed Mars 96 mission .
" Athermal drill could be the ' nose ' of a penetrator , to taste the ice of Europa , " Weiss explained .

Anylanding probe that wants to search for signs of life on Europa must go deeperthan two meters into the surface ice , because heavy radiation and particlebombardment would have erased any biological traces in the top layer .
Havinga robotic lander make a soft landing before preparing to drill would be a morecomplicated and expensive task compared to a penetrator , Weiss said .
A thermaldrill could simply deploy from the side of the penetrator after impact , andbegin drilling through the pristine ice below to sample material at depths ofup to 10 meters .?
Estimatesfor the thickness of Europa ?s ice shell vary between a few kilometers and tens ofkilometers , but Weiss says it doesn?t make sense to go much deeper than 10 meters because of the current state of technology .?
For instance , the drill would be tethered to thepenetrator by a communicationcable , and the length of cable would be limited based on how much the probecould carry .
This cable would allow data collected from the drill to snake backto the main scientific instruments in the penetrator , and then the data wouldget beamed up to an orbiter .
Labexperiments showed how a thermal drill design fared much better in dealing withthe combined challenge of ice and regolith , as opposed to a melting probe suchas the Cryobot that relies upon heat alone .
Innerpressure inside the hole is expected to increase and allow for liquid water oncethe initial borehole has refrozen .
That would allow the drill to sample waterby using a micro-pump , but the refreezing hole would also protect the pristineice against possible contamination from the outside .
Forgetthe submersibles
Someconcepts of a submersible exploring the supposed ocean depths of Europa haveappeared in past years , and NASA has tested robotic subs in the frigid lakesof Antarctica .
ButWeiss , who draws upon several years working with sub-sea robotics , said thatcurrent technology cannot deploy a submersible on Europa .
Just packing in allthe cabling that would connect a submersible to the main landing craft wouldrepresent a problem .?
Whilethe ice shell is thought to be at least several kilometers thick , no one knowsexactly how far down the ocean may be — there could be a thick layer of slushbetween the ice shell and ocean .?
Another question is the distance down to theocean floor .
" Theocean beneath — if existent — could be 100 kilometers deep , " said Weiss .
Roboticsubs on Earth have reached ocean depths of 11 km ( 6.8 miles ) , but weighedseveral tons and required huge surface support ships .
That does n't work for a missionto Europa that needs to travel light .
" Institutesthat pretend to develop sub - sea robots ' to explore the bottom of Europa ? socean ' should be financed by Hollywood , not NASA , " Weiss said .
Waitingfor a call
Theresearchers have so far tested their drill in both pressure and vacuumenvironments , but still want to boost its efficiency .
A next logical step mighttest how well a thermal drill survives impact aboard a penetrator .
Whetheror not a thermal drill or any sort of landing probe gets a shot at Europa 's icysurface remains up in the air .
But even as the different space agencies figureout their roles and budgets , Weiss says there ?s a sense of urgency to find outwhat 's going on with Europa .
Amission that consisted of only orbiters might find more interesting evidencethat supports the possibility of life on the Jovian moon , but would not have the ability to go down and find proof .
And a follow - upmission might not even launch until the 2040s — good reason for the currentgeneration of scientists to want some surface explorer element .
" Otherwise , we won ? t have any confirmation on astrobiology on Europa — or maybe even in thesolar system — during our lifetime , " Weiss said .
Welcoming the news , the families of the crash victims said it raised hopes but they quickly added that they would hold off on any celebration until the flight recorders were raised to the surface .
ESPN.com senior writer Ed Hinton reports what he saw leading up to the American open - wheel civil war and the consequences it wrought .

The Damage Done - Part 2
On the afternoon of July 3 , 1995 , I was faxed a preview of a document that amounted to the Kansas - Nebraska Act of major open - wheel racing in the United States .
It was sure to lead to civil war .
But unlike the American Civil War , both sides would be devastated , and neither side would recover .
From this one document would ensue 13 years of mutual destruction between two leagues , sending the Indianapolis 500 plummeting from the pinnacle of all the world 's motor racing , and eroding Indy car racing to second class in the American public mind .
There they languish today , two years into the aftermath of the war , going into the 94th Indy 500 , the 15th one since the split .
That fateful fax was preceded by a phone call from an anxious - sounding Bob Walters , then chief publicist at Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
" I want to run something by you , " he said .
" We 've prepared a press release , and I want to hear your thoughts before we send it out to the rest of the media . "
Why me ?
Probably it was where I worked at the time , and maybe experience .
I was a senior writer at Sports Illustrated , then the most influential sports publication in the U.S. , if not the world .
I was the auto racing specialist , having covered all forms of the sport for more than 20 years .
The release stated that beginning with the 1996 Indianapolis 500 , 25 of the traditional 33 starting spots would be reserved for teams from the new Indy Racing League .
This was astounding because the IRL had yet to turn a wheel on a racetrack , and had yet to demonstrate that it could even attract 25 cars .
This was a blatant surprise attack on the powerful Championship Auto Racing Teams Inc. ( CART ) , which since 1979 had accounted for most of each Indy 500 field .
Now , if these teams complied , they would have to come on their knees with upwards of 40 cars to compete among themselves for only eight starting positions in the 500 .
And this was revolutionary :
The edict would shatter Indy 's most inviolable tradition -- that " the fastest 33 cars start the race , " no matter where in the world they came from .
The intent of the " 25 and 8 rule , " as it would come to be called in notoriety , was to force CART teams to compete not just at Indy but in all races of the new IRL , if they were to gather enough points to get Indy 500 reservations .
Outside Indy in May , CART owned the rest of the year with its own series , which was the most lucrative ever developed for open - wheel cars in the U.S .
Clearly , CART would never stand for the new rule .
The glamorous teams would stay away from Indy entirely .
Then inevitably would come the terrible test of who could do without whom : CART without the cornerstone race , or the Indy 500 without CART and its supporting series of races .
I phoned Walters back immediately with my opinion :
This would be taken by CART , and by the motorsports media nationwide , as nothing short of a declaration of war .
This would rip open - wheel racing asunder , just when there was enough trouble maintaining prestige and popularity with one series .
But Indy car racing was in denial about the growing threat from another form of racing , rising rapidly out of the South and spreading nationwide , into mainstream popularity : NASCAR .
Walters listened , then sighed .
" Well , " he said , with a resigned tone in his voice , " Tony wants to go with it . "
Even before the fax cleared the machine , the impact was clear :
If this edict were carried out , the destruction of Indy car racing would be a matter of time .
Anton Hulman " Tony " George had ascended the throne of Indianapolis Motor Speedway by hereditary right in 1990 , at age 30 .
Tony George arrived with a plan for sweeping change © Getty Images Enlarge
He was the only male heir to his grandfather , Anton Hulman , who had saved the Speedway and the 500 after World War II .
Tony George arrived with a plan for sweeping change , and a chip on his shoulder .
Indy had run too long on tradition , he decreed , and henceforth it would be run as a business .
I liked that .
And I liked him -- still do , even now that he has fallen almost completely out of auto racing , his 20 years of bold plans no less noble for their terrible failures .
What had passed as tradition at Indy had seemed to be largely stodginess to me .
But with young George in charge , the air seemed fresher and the grounds brighter every time you drove through one of the tunnels into the infield .
He was making large - scale physical changes , fast .
And he was plunging into new business that would bring far more racing to Indy than just the 500 .
He had begun hosting NASCAR races in 1994 -- even though traditionalists deemed it heresy -- and the first two Brickyard 400s had been landslide sellouts .
He had entered into a transoceanic flirtation with the treacherous , ruthless realm of Formula One and its czar , Bernie Ecclestone , with an eye toward bringing a U.S. Grand Prix to Indy .
So , going into the declaration of war in ' 95 , Tony George had been a bullet train of change in motor racing .
Except for that chip on his shoulder .
Throughout the years of Indy car civil war , many would believe it was all about money through control of the sport .
I thought that was true on the CART side , but never on George 's side .
His motive , I still believe , was mainly a matter of family honor and noblesse oblige toward open - wheel racing .
As a teenager he had followed his grandfather around Gasoline Alley , meeting the tough and towering figures of Indy 's golden era : A.J. Foyt , Parnelli Jones , Bobby and Al Unser , Johnny Rutherford , Lloyd Ruby … Americans all .
Then the late 1970s brought a series of annually occurring tragedies into the young life of George .
On the night of the 1976 Indy 500 , when Tony was 16 , his father , Elmer George -- a former driver married to Tony Hulman 's only child , Mari -- was shot and killed in an argument with a trainer at the family 's horse farm outside Terre Haute , Ind .
When Tony was 17 , his grandfather died , and even the hallowed Speedway itself seemed somehow orphaned without its gentlemanly owner / dictator , known throughout motor racing simply as " Mr. Hulman . "
When Tony was 18 , in 1978 , former Formula One and Indy driver Dan Gurney circulated a letter to other progressive team owners .
It proposed that America 's premier open - wheel series , then controlled by the United States Auto Club ( USAC ) , could and should be much bigger , better and richer than just a satellite tour to the cornerstone Indianapolis 500 .
USAC was essentially a puppet of the Speedway , and rejected Gurney 's proposals .
So in late ' 78 he and other owners , such as Roger Penske and U.E. " Pat " Patrick , formed CART , and soon gathered most of the top teams into their alliance .
The glaring exception was the irascible , indomitable Foyt , the most independent - minded man in motor racing , coming off his unprecedented fourth Indy 500 win in ' 77 -- and fiercely loyal to the Hulman - George family and USAC .
When Tony was 19 , in 1979 , CART lawyers hand - delivered entries for 44 cars , right on deadline for that year 's 500 , to the Speedway .
The entries were accompanied by demands for what it would take for that huge , vital group of cars and drivers to show up .
Then the CART teams set off to inaugurate their own series , with two races prior to the Indy 500 , and await the Speedway 's response .
They got it that April .
As they unloaded in the garages of what was then called Atlanta International Raceway for their second race as an organization , there erupted something of a commotion among them , and I began asking them what was the matter .
They had received a telegram telling them they were not welcome at the Indy 500 that year , they said .
Almost immediately they began discussing litigation .
They would go to court for the right to compete in the 500 .
They would succeed .
From there , they effectively seized control of Indy , even though technically USAC remained the sanctioning body for the 500 .
What the CART teams wanted at the Brickyard , the CART teams usually got .
Quickly the USAC " championship trail " of other races died out , displaced by the CART series .
CART owners unabashedly tried to emulate Formula One , with emphasis on road courses and street circuits in addition to oval tracks .
The street circuits especially made business sense , because events could be held in and near major cities by simply laying out temporary courses , rather than building permanent racetracks .
But road and street racing also meant a different kind of driver .
The tough Americans , who'd come up to Indy off the heartland oval dirt tracks , were phased out , displaced by Europeans , South Americans and Australians who'd been trained from childhood as road racers .
Slowly , American fans grew apathetic toward the imported personalities , and yearned for a resurgence of the Foyt ilk .
But the Americans would never return in significant enough numbers .
So , arguably , the downfall of Indy car racing began with CART 's shift to road racing .
Tony George had to witness and stomach all this .
But he was an heir in waiting .
Not until he was 30 , by family tradition , would he be given command .
Meanwhile he apprenticed in racing from the ground up , starting out as a fuel man on the pit crew of his idol and in some ways surrogate father , Foyt .
Independent as Foyt was , he had always deferred to the Hulman - George family , and worshiped them .
From the outset , he acknowledged to young Tony just how important they were .
Foyt , left with no alternative , eventually participated in CART , but never cottoned to it .
He longed for the USAC days when he reigned supreme at Indy , before the uppity barons in their Gucci loafers seized control in 1979 .
From early on at the helm of Indy , George was chronically at odds with the barons of CART -- Penske , Gurney , Patrick , and by the '90s Chip Ganassi , Barry Green , and most of all , the militant Carl Haas and his even more militant business partner , actor Paul Newman .
The barons treated young George more as a new force to be felt out and somehow dealt with .
Word was , they considered him a punk .
Publicly they treated him , as Haas would later put it , as " a track promoter , " just one of many -- even though George 's track was unchallenged as the greatest in the world .
They granted George a seat on the CART board of directors , but only as a non-voting member .
They thwarted his every suggestion at every turn through the early '90s , saying no when he proposed an engine formula compatible with Formula One's , saying no when he proposed a neutral Indy car czar such as the roundly respected Leo Mehl , then Goodyear 's director of worldwide racing .
George wanted to achieve what not even his grandfather had .
He wanted to make Indy -- which previously had stood in splendid isolation -- a full - fledged , and certainly prominent , member of the worldwide racing community .
The CART barons continued to vote for what was best for their own series -- and their own individual business interests .
Finally , thoroughly exasperated , George walked out of a CART meeting , resigned from the board , and began working on a plan for his own racing series .
Traditionalist racers and fans had always resented CART as something of an occupying force on the hallowed ground of Indy , usurpers , dripping with opulence and arrogance and racing more for profit than passion .
In addition to importing road racers , CART teams had adopted the European tradition of drivers " buying rides " -- that is , bringing lucrative sponsorships or enormous personal wealth with them .
That added yet a second padlocked gate to keep out young Americans raised on the dirt tracks .
" We went on our knees to the CART teams , " Jeff Gordon 's stepfather , John Bickford , told me as Gordon rose to stardom in NASCAR .
" They basically said , ' Show us the money and we 'll show you the seat , ' " Gordon would tell me later .
So George had to watch helplessly , with mixed emotions , while Gordon , the kid who'd grown up as a sprint - car prodigy in nearby Pittsboro , Ind. , won the inaugural Brickyard 400 -- a NASCAR race .
Even then , George was watching yet another local prodigy tearing up the dirt tracks in USAC midgets , sprint cars and Silver Crown cars , winning in everything he drove -- but with no hope of buying a CART ride .
That was Tony Stewart of nearby Columbus , Ind .
Enough was enough .
Somehow , George determined , he would reopen the path to Indy for the likes of Gordon and Stewart .
In 1994 he announced the founding of the Indy Racing League , with Stewart as his poster boy .
At every turn , old - liners whispered encouragement into George 's ear .
His was a glorious cause , making Indy again the showplace for American talent risen from the Saturday - night tracks .
He meant to accomplish this in part by simplifying technology and lowering costs , so that teams would n't need drivers who could bring money , and could afford to hire drivers who brought only their sheer ability .
Not the least of the old - liners , constantly in George 's ear , was Foyt himself .
" Tony 's a brilliant boy , and so's his mama , " Foyt told me in one of his classic malapropisms , as the winds of Indy war began to blow .
Foyt would abide by -- and indeed influence -- every move the Hulman - George family made in breaking free of CART .
Many , including me , failed to take the IRL seriously enough when it was announced in ' 94 .
I thought it was mainly a bargaining ploy by George , to bring CART back to its senses from extravagance .
" The IRL will never turn a wheel in competition , " I assured European journalist friends who were familiar with CART due to its international expansion , and concerned about a possible devastation of Indy car racing and the greatest single race in the world .
But as I read and reread the fax of July 3 , 1995 , and realized the magnitude of the " 25 and 8 " edict , I felt about as prescient as the North Carolina politician who in 1861 had dismissed the imminent conflict as so minor that he would " wipe up every drop of blood shed … with a handkerchief … "
The Fort Sumter of the Indy car civil war was , of all places , Walt Disney World near Orlando , Florida .
The first shots were fired by the IRL , in holding its first race on Jan. 27 , 1996 , on a hastily constructed , three - cornered track built by Indy engineers on Disney property .
All the previous fall , there had been hope that Indy and CART would somehow reconcile -- as they had after various bickering over the previous 17 years -- and that perhaps George would even rescind the " 25 - 8 " rule for the Indy 500 .
But now , a walk through the paddock at the Disney track made the gravity of the situation clear .
Conspicuous by their absence were the affluent CART teams with their posh entertainment tents , luxury motor coaches and glitzy paint schemes for lucrative corporate sponsorships .
They 'd kept their vow not to give in to George 's attempt to force them to compete in IRL races -- even though at this point in the technical transition , mere tweaks to the CART cars would have made them IRL - legal .
Instead , here were the upstart IRL teams , fielding mostly second - hand CART cars , or old cars from the independent owners who annually fielded teams on a " one-off " basis , for the Indy 500 only .
Tony Stewart had arrived as poster boy and was filling his role magnificently , telling any journalist who asked that there was no way he ever could have gotten a ride in CART .
The IRL , with its open arms to American dirt - trackers , was a career - changer for him .

Walking among the patchwork teams in the paddock , Gordon Kirby of the British magazine Autosport asked me , " What strikes you as starkly different ? "
" Pretty ragtag , " I said .
But there was something more profound .
" No sponsorship logos , " Kirby said .
And he was right .
There were hardly any .
Where were they getting the money to compete ?
Word was already spreading that George was subsidizing teams out of his own pocket , or at least the Indianapolis Motor Speedway coffers .
This was a radical departure from any other racing league 's financial model , ever .
For just this one race , you could understand : Leagues and tracks often paid " appearance money " to top teams and drivers just to show up , so their names could be used in ticket promotions .
But a full season ?
If you 'd driven the 55 miles up to Daytona Beach and proposed to NASCAR czar Bill France Jr. that he subsidize the Cup teams for a season , he'd have laughed you out of his office .
The sanctioning body provided the forum , the tracks provided the prize money , and other than that , the teams were on their own .
That was the NASCAR model .
Then again , not even the France family could match the vast family wealth of the Hulman - George family , and its Hulman & Co. , founded as a wholesale grocery company by Tony George 's great - great - grandfather , Herman Hulman , in 1879 .
Now the company was broadly diversified , not only with ownership of Indianapolis Motor Speedway but with holdings ranging from Clabber Girl baking powder to television stations and the Telex communications company .
Oh , and there was one more enormous contributor to George 's war chest : NASCAR itself .
Both NASCAR and Formula
One had taken public positions of neutrality in the coming Indy car war , but it was no secret that the other two giants did n't care much for CART .
F1 had fought CART 's international expansion in the early '90s and had no love for the bellicose American barons who'd pushed into Australia , Canada and Europe , with designs on Japan -- all traditionally F1 turf .
But NASCAR 's interest was closer and more fundamental .
Organizations such as CART , in which team owners pushed the sanctioning body and track promoters around , were anathema to NASCAR 's ruling France family .
When NASCAR 's founder , " Big Bill " France Sr. , summoned the various kingpins of stock - car racing from around the nation to Daytona Beach in 1947 , he knew he had to seize absolute control of the new league .
An adviser had warned him that this would work only as a dictatorship -- that a governing board would be disastrous .
And fear of any sort of union was fresh in France 's mind as he formed NASCAR -- in May 1947 , Anton Hulman had put down a bitter drivers ' strike at the Indianapolis 500 .
Now , in the mid '90s , there was undercurrent talk in the NASCAR garages that a CART - like organization of powerful team owners might arise , to take advantage of an upheaval in track ownership and demand higher purses .
Standing under umbrellas in the rain at Talladega one weekend , in an otherwise deserted garage area , one powerful team owner had posed an intriguing question to me privately .
" How much would you pay for NASCAR right now ? " he asked , amid rumors that giant corporations such as Rupert Murdoch 's NewsCorp , or even Disney , might be interested in buying .
" You mean if I were Murdoch ?
Oh , $ 2 billion , $ 3 billion , I do n't know , " I said .
" Now then , " and here the owner pointed to the haulers of NASCAR 's top six or seven teams , " if those rigs were suddenly gone , those teams were out , how much would you pay for NASCAR ? "
" Oh , " I mused , " about $ 1.99 . "
" Exactly , " he said , and walked away in the rain .
The point was , without its major teams and stars , NASCAR would be worthless .
This came precariously close to the thinking that had started CART .
What had started the NASCAR rumblings , in parallel to the Indy car conflict , were the activities of O. Bruton Smith .
A long time France family rival , Smith was chairman of Speedway Motorsports Inc. , a track conglomerate he'd taken to Wall Street as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange .
The France family , which owned NASCAR outright and controlled International Speedway Corp. , another track conglomerate , was watching Smith closely as he gobbled up tracks with built - in NASCAR race dates .
He already owned the tracks at Charlotte and Atlanta , bought existing tracks such as Las Vegas and Bristol , and planned to build new ones , his crown jewel - in - progress being Texas Motor Speedway .
Smith was acquiring tracks so fast , and had disagreed with the Frances so much for so long over how NASCAR should be run , that there was much conjecture that he might start a rival stock - car series .
Then Smith , not yet able to get a Cup race scheduled for his yet - to - open Texas track , hinted that he might just run a non-sanctioned or " outlaw " race , after the NASCAR season was over , with an enormous purse .
That got the attention of the NASCAR owners , and that in turn fuelled rumblings of a CART - type council of team owners to sell their services to the highest - bidding series .
Amidst all this , Bill France Jr. , second czar in the NASCAR dynasty , publicly postured himself as neutral in the Indy car conflict .
NASCAR 's funding of Tony George 's war chest was indirect , in the form of the enormous revenues
Indy took in from the new , but firmly established , NASCAR race there , the Brickyard 400 .
George would tell me years later that there was " no question " this additional bonanza from his NASCAR race emboldened and bolstered him for the IRL venture .
There was another connection with NASCAR : John Cooper , a longtime friend and sometimes business associate of the France family , and onetime NASCAR marketing director , was now one of George 's closest advisers .
After working for NASCAR in the ' 70s , Cooper in late 1979 had been named president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway in something of a quiet move , and served until 1982 .
Then , in the early '90s , Cooper had helped facilitate the partnership of Indy and NASCAR for the Brickyard 400 .
On Jan. 26 , 1996 , the eve of the first Indy Racing League event , the IRL threw a lavish cocktail party in a tent outside the new track on the Disney property .
I noticed Cooper standing to the side , taking it all in .
I walked over to check out some rumours I 'd heard .
" Hey , John , you know what I hear ?
I hear the CART barons were scrambling to settle this thing , and that Tony was listening , " I said .
" That right ? " he asked .
" Yeah .
And then I heard you to told Tony , 'f --- 'em , ' " I said .
" And that was it . "
Cooper demurred , smiled , contemplated the ice cubes in his vodka and soda , then took a sip .
" Well , " he said , " I might have said something along those lines . "
From about 1895 to the mid-1920s , and following the bicycle craze of the 1890s , electric cars shared the road with petrol and steam powered cars .
EV's were comparatively slow , heavy , and had a smaller range than their alternatives .
During the very early years , however , electric automobiles were the most popular option for a short time , mainly because of two reasons .
Firstly , they were easy to start , while a gasoline car had to be cranked up and a steam powered car required a long firing - up time ( not unlike a wood gas car ) .
Secondly , there were few paved roads outside the city at the turn of the 20th century , which made the limited range of EV's not that problematic .
The production of electric vehicles peaked in 1912 : during that time there were 30,000 EV's on the road in the United States , two - thirds of these were used as private passenger cars .
Europe had around 4,000 electric vehicles .
By 1912 , the gasoline car had already taken over the largest share of the automobile sales ( more than 90 percent ) .
They were faster and could drive longer distances - not only because of their better range but also because of a more elaborate refuelling infrastructure .
The rapidly expanding paved road network worked in their favour , too .
Internal combustion engines became much cheaper than electrics .
In 1908 , Ford introduced its mass - produced ( and gasoline powered ) Model - T , which initially sold for 850 dollars - two to three times less than the price of a similar electric vehicle .
In 1912 , the price of the Model - T came down to 650 dollars .
That same year , the electrical starter for gasoline vehicles appeared , and took away one of the last selling points of EV's .
Last but not least , gasoline had become much cheaper than it had been at the end of the 19th century .
The only advantage left was the ( potential ) cleanliness and noiselessness of electric vehicles , the reason we want them back today .
In 1914 , Henry Ford announced the marketing of a cheap mass - produced electric vehicle , but this automobile was never produced .
In Europe , electric passenger cars were gone in 1920 , in the US they survived for a decade longer .
Electric trucks , outside the scope of this article , remained successful for a longer period .
The manufacturers of early electric cars made several strategic mistakes .
For instance , it took them until 1910 to develop a standard for the charging of the batteries .
But , at the heart of the failure of the early electric car lay the limited capacity of the storage battery .
Then and now : 100 miles
If today 's supporters of EV's would dig into the specifications and the sales brochures of early 20th century electric " horseless carriages " , their enthusiasm would quickly disappear .
Fast - charged batteries ( to 80 % capacity in 10 minutes ) , automated battery swapping stations , public charging poles , load balancing , the entire business plan of Better Place , in - wheel motors , regenerative braking : it was all there in the late 1800s or the early 1900s .
It did not help .
Most surprisingly , however , is the seemingly non-existent progress of battery technology .
The 100 mile Fritchle electric poster
Columbia Victoria Mark VII
" Very quick acceleration is an objectionable feature in electric vehicle design , because a vehicle constructed with this feature puts a heavy overdraft on the battery " .
The Nissan Leaf and the Mitsubishi i-MiEV , two electric cars to be introduced on the market in 2010 , have exactly the same range as the 1908 Fritchle Model A Victoria : 100 miles ( 160 kilometres ) on a single charge .
The " 100 - mile Fritchle " was a progressive engineering feat for its time , but it was not the only early electric that boasted a 100 mile range .
I have only chosen it because its specifications are most complete , and because its range was certified .
The first electric cars ( 1894 - 1900 ) had a range of 20 to 40 miles ( 32 to 64 kilometres ) , still better than the 20 km " range " of a horse .
The average second generation EV ( 1901 - 1910 ) already boasted a mileage of 50 to 80 miles ( 80 to 130 km ) .
The third generation of early electric cars ( 1911 - 1920 ) , including larger vehicles that could seat 5 people comfortably , could travel 75 to more than 100 miles ( 120 to more than 160 km ) on a single charge - and this is still the range of electric cars today .
( See our overview on early electrics for the specifications of individual vehicles ) .
In fact , the range of the Nissan Leaf or the Mitsubishi i-MiEV may be far worse than that of the 1908 Fritchle .
The range of the latter was ( officially ) recorded during an 1800 mile ( 2,900 km ) race over a period of 21 driving days in the winter of 1908 .
The stock vehicle was driven in varied weather , terrain and road conditions ( often bad and muddy roads ) .
The average range on a single charge was 90 miles , the maximum range recorded was 108 miles .
( sources : 1 2 ) .
The range of the Mitsibushi i-MiEV and the Nissan Leaf was tested in a very different manner .
On rollers instead of on actual roads , and in a protected environment , but that 's not all .
Both manufacturers advertise the US " EPA city " range , a test that supposes a 22 minutes drive cycle at an average speed of 19.59 mph ( 31.5 km /h ) , including one acceleration to 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) during no more than 100 seconds .
Critics blame today 's manufacturers for not displaying the " EPA combined cycle " range , which also includes trips on the motorway ( the " EPA highway cycle " ) .
Contrary to vehicles with an internal combustion engine , electric cars are more fuel efficient in cities than at steady speed on a highway - an electric motor uses no energy when it is idling , and regenerative braking works best in city traffic .
Darryl Siry , former CMO of Tesla , estimates that the correct range of the Nissan ( and other modern electric cars ) will be around 70 % of the advertised range .
That would bring the range of today 's electrics to the same level as the 1901 Krieger Electrolette ( 68 miles ) .
Even the " EPA combined cycle " figures should be considered as an upper limit .
Firstly , with an average speed of 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) the highway tests are outdated .
Secondly , the range of a car is also affected by other factors : not only excessive speeding and fast accelerations , but also the use of headlights at night , the use of heating or air - conditioning , the use of other options onboard , driving over hilly roads or in headwinds - or all of these factors combined ( the EPA has added new test cycles in 2008 to address these points , but the results are not yet available for the EV's we are talking about ) .
Some of these factors not only concern today 's electrics , but also those of yesteryear .
However , the Fritchle 's range was tested on varied terrain and in varied weather conditions , which was not the case for the Nissan or the Mitsubishi .
Moreover , early electrics had no air - conditioning and few had heating systems - drivers and passengers dressed warm in winter .
Mitsubishi warns its clients that the use of the heater might cut the range in half .
All in all , the range of a 2010 electric vehicle will be closer to 50 miles ( 80 km ) than to 100 miles ( 160 km ) .
And that 's to be expected from a battery at the beginning of its life - after 5 years , the capacity will be at least 20 percent less .
In spite of this , the 2010 vehicle has a much better battery under the hood than the 1908 vehicle .
The Fritchle Electric had lead - acid batteries , like all its contemporaries , with an energy density between 20 and 40 Wh/kg ( early 1900 batteries had energy densities of only 10 to 15 Wh/kg ) .
The Nissan and the Mitsubishi have a more powerful lithium - ion battery with an energy density of around 140 Wh/ kg .
The Nissan 's battery can thus store 3.5 to 7 times more energy for a given weight than an average early electric from about 1910 .
This could have resulted in a vehicle with a 3.5 to 7 times better range ( 350 to 700 miles or 560 to 1,130 km ) , but this is not the case .
The technological improvements could also have been translated into a 3.5 to 7 times lighter ( and smaller ) battery , and consequently a lighter and more fuel efficient vehicle , but this is not the case either .
The battery of the Nissan Leaf is only 1.6 times lighter than the battery of the Fritchle : 220 kg ( 480 pounds ) versus 360 kg ( 800 pounds ) .
The Nissan vehicle ( including the battery ) weighs more than the Fritchle : 1,271 kg ( 2,800 pounds ) versus 950 kg ( 2,100 pounds ) .
The most obvious difference between the specifications of the old and new cars is the power of their motors .
The 1908 car had a 10 HP motor , the 2010 car has a 110 HP motor .
In other words , the Nissan Leaf has the motor output of 11 electric Fritchles .
The smaller and lighter Mitsubishi i-MiEV ( 1,080 kg or 2,400 pounds ) has the motor power of 6.5 electric Fritchles .
The maximum speed of the Fritchle was 40 km/h ( 25 mph ) , the Nissan does 140 km/h ( 87 mph ) and the i-MiEV is not far behind ( 130 km /h or 81 mph ) .
Acceleration data cannot be compared , but there is no doubt that the 2010 cars will accelerate many times faster ( and can climb hills much more easily ) than their early 1900 cousins .
Today , fast acceleration times are one of the selling points of EV's .
The risks of more powerful electric motors were already recognized in the early 1900s .
The Hawkins Electrical guide ( 1914 ) states :
A few years earlier , members of the Electric Vehicle Association of America tried to impose a standard maximum speed of 32 km/h ( 20 mph ) for electric vehicles , because power requirements increased rapidly above that limit .
They feared that higher speeds would threaten the all - important range of the automobiles .
They did not succeed .
Too many manufacturers tried to compete with gasoline cars ( and with each other ) by designing faster electric vehicles .
A car consumes 4 times more fuel to drive twice the speed , so it seems clear that velocity is the reason why the range of today 's electric cars did not improve in spite of better batteries .
However , it is more complicated than that .
The " EPA - city " range that the modern EV 's advertise , is based on an average speed of 20 mph or 31 km/h - below the 25 mph top speed of the Fritchle , and almost exactly the same as the speed at which the vehicle could drive 100 miles on one charge .
While high speeds are definitely a significant factor when considering the real - world range of today 's electric cars , it cannot explain the disappointing " official " range .
Faster acceleration might play a role , but the EPA - tests described above do not consider aggressive driving either so there must be other factors at play .
Oversized cars & motors
The first is weight .
While the battery of the Nissan is lighter than the battery of the Fritchle , the Nissan vehicle including the battery is 321 kg ( 706 pounds ) heavier .
Without the battery , the Nissan weighs almost twice as much as the Fritchle : 1,051 kg ( 2,310 pounds ) versus 590 kg ( 1,300 pounds ) .
Early electric car chassis
" A large number of people interested in stored power are looking forward to a revolution in the generating power of storage batteries , and it is the opinion of many that the long - looked - for , light weight , high capacity battery will soon be discovered . " ( source , 1901 ) .
" The demand for a proper automobile storage battery is so crying that it soon must result in the appearance of the desired accumulator [ battery ] .
Everywhere in the history of industrial progress , invention has followed close in the wake of necessity " ( Electrical Review , 1901 ) .
So while batteries became more than 3 times lighter in 100 years time , the weight of the vehicle itself ( without battery ) doubled .
The extra weight of the Nissan already nullifies a significant portion of the progress : a 35 percent higher mass can lead to a 28 percent reduction in range ( sources : 1 2 ) .
The second factor is directly related to the massive increase in horse power .
Electric motors are ( generally ) most efficient around 75 percent of their rated load .
Their efficiency drops dramatically below 25 percent .
The Fritchle was most efficient at a speed of around 20 mph .
The much more powerful motor of the Nissan Leaf , however , is most efficient at a speed of around 105 km/h , far above the average speed in the tests .
Today 's EV 's consume less energy at low speeds than at high speeds because of other factors , but compared to early electrics with their much less powerful motor they are probably less efficient at speeds of around 20 mph .
( source - pdf ) .
The third factor is the electronics .
Modern cars have , depending on the model , 30 to 100 microprocessor - based electronic control units onboard ( source ) .
These computers add weight but also consume energy in a direct way .
Part of this direct energy consumption is not included in the EPA - tests - electronically adjustable windows and mirrors , for example .
However , many other electronics are activated whenever the vehicle is driving .
Examples are power brakes , active suspension , safety sensors , dashboard instrumentation and the management of the battery itself ( not required for a lead - acid battery but critical for lithium - ion storage technology ) .
All this electrical energy has to be supplied by the battery .
While a higher performance cannot explain the relatively low official range of today 's EV's , all factors described above are at least partially a consequence of it .
Lower speeds would make most safety - related electronics unnecessary and they would do away with the need for larger motors and batteries which , just like the electronics , add more weight .
Some of you might wonder why I do n't compare the 1908 Fritchle to the 2008 Tesla Roadster .
This car has a range of 244 miles ( 393 kilometres ) , 2.44 times better than the old timer and the modern Japanese cars - and this according to the " EPA combined cycle " , not the " EPA city " figures .
( Although the " EPA - combined " range advertised by Tesla is of course as much suited for a sports car than the " EPA - city " range is suited for a family vehicle like the Nissan Leaf ) .
The Tesla Roadster is less progressive than it seems , though .
The battery of the sports car weighs twice as much ( 450 kg ) as the battery of the Nissan ( 220 kg ) .
Since both batteries have a similar energy density , you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to calculate that the heavier battery has about twice the capacity : 53 kWh to be exact , compared to 24 kWh for the Nissan 's battery ( and 16 kWh for the i- MiEV ) .
Considering the fact that both cars have a similar weight , a 2.5 better range for a battery with more than double ( 2.2 times ) the capacity is far from a revolutionary engineering feat .
Doubling battery capacity is one way to increase the range of an electric vehicle ( see also the Mini E , which sacrifices its rear seat for a larger battery and gets 104 miles ) , but this option is far from sustainable since it also doubles the amount of energy needed to manufacture the battery .
It also doubles the costs , of course .
The battery of the $ 109,000 Tesla Roadster sells for $ 30,000 , as much as an entire Nissan or Mitsubishi vehicle .
Nobody has investigated how much energy it takes to produce a Tesla Roadster battery , or any other EV battery for that matter , but you can get an idea of it using an online tool from Carnegie Mellon University .
Corresponding to these data , $ 30,000 of economic activity in the storage battery sector ( including the production of li-ion batteries ) equals an energy consumption of 23,222 kWh - that 's almost 6 years of electricity consumption by an average British household .
The battery has to be replaced after a maximum of 7 years .
These figures suggest that the embodied energy of the battery - not considered in any research paper that investigates the ecological advantages of electric cars - makes up for a substantial amount of the total energy cost of an electric automobile .
At the advertised energy use of 21 kWh per 100 miles , 23,222 kWh would take the Tesla 109,938 miles 176,929 km ) far .
That 's almost 30,000 km ( 18,600 miles ) per year , or 80 km ( 51 miles ) per day .
The low " fuel " costs are only half the story if the " fuel tank " itself is that energy - intensive .
Today , just like 100 years ago , EV proponents are divided on the question of how to market electric vehicles .
Some keep emphasizing the fact that most people never drive further than 30 miles per day - therefore the current batteries are well suited to perform their task .
Most cars will be charged overnight , battery charging stations and fast - charging will do the rest .
Others , however , keep hoping for a revolutionary storage technology that will eventually give EV 's a similar range to that of gasoline cars .
This belief is supported by press releases like this : " Nanowire battery can hold 10 times the charge of lithium - ion " .
It is interesting to note that the arrival of such a miracle battery has been " just around the corner " for over 100 years now :
Edison himself promised a radical improvement to the lead - acid battery at the turn of the 20th century .
It took almost a decade before the Edison battery appeared on the market , and even though it had some advantages over the others , it was very expensive ( the price of a gasoline powered Ford Model - T ) and far from revolutionary .
The promise of a miracle storage technology reared its head again in the 1960s and 1970s , when electric cars went through a short revival :
" The consensus among EV proponents and major battery manufacturers is that a high - energy , high power - density battery - a true breakthrough in electrochemistry - could be accomplished in just 5 years " ( Machine Design , 1974 ) .
The range of most electric ( concept ) cars in the 1960s and 1970s was considerably lower than that of early 1900 electrics .
This was because they were still making use of similar lead - acid batteries , while the cars themselves were already much heavier and more powerful .
Realistic electric vehicles - scenario 1
The miracle battery might one day arrive , but history teaches us not to count on it .
What would definitely yield results , on the other hand , is to use existing technology and downsize the car .
There are two ways to do this , as was briefly noted above .
The first is to go back to early 20th century electric vehicles and equip them with modern batteries .
This would extend their range spectacularly , as much as a ( not yet existing ) nanowire battery could .
Charging early electric car 1909
Babcock electric roadster 3
If you were to put the lithium - ion battery of the Nissan Leaf in the 1908 Fritchle , the vehicle would have a range of about 644 km ( 400 miles ) .
If you put a lithium - ion battery with the same weight of the Fritchle - battery inside , you get about 700 miles ( 1,127 km ) range .
Add to this the fact that we now also have lighter and more efficient motors ( and other vehicle parts ) and the range will become even greater .
Even with the headlights and the heating on , driving home over windy hills and muddy roads , such a car would give a safe and comfortable range , similar to that of today 's gasoline vehicles .
Moreover , it would consume less energy : the Fritchle used around 7 kWh /100 km , the Nissan Leaf at least 15 kWh / 100 km .
A better range is much more than a convenience for the driver .
It would also mean that we need fewer charging and battery swapping stations , which would greatly lower the costs and the embodied energy of the required infrastructure .
In short , slower EV's would make EV's a whole lot more likely .
Interestingly , we do n't even have to streamline them .
Early electrics had style , and at low speeds aerodynamics is not an important factor in energy consumption .
Of course , slow vehicles with the appearance of a horse carriage will not appeal to everybody .
But there is another way .
We could also downsize the electric car by designing much lighter and fuel efficient vehicles .
This is shown by a concept EV like the Trev .
This vehicle 's performance is comparable to that of the Nissan Leaf or the Mitsubishi i-MiEV : it has a top speed of 120 km/h ( 74.5 mph ) and it accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h ( 60 mph ) in less than 10 seconds .
However , its battery is almost 5 times lighter ( 45 kg or 99 pounds ) and the vehicle itself ( including the battery ) weighs only 300 kg ( 660 pounds ) .
In spite of its higher performance , it consumes as much energy as the Fritchle : 6.2 kWh /100 km , half the fuel consumption of the Nissan .
Yet , the range of the Trev is similar to that of the Nissan or the Fritchle : 150 km or 93 miles .
The reason is of course that if you design a much lighter vehicle , it will also have a much smaller battery that consequently holds less energy .
With gasoline powered automobiles , the potential of weight reduction is much larger .
Nevertheless , a vehicle like the Trev would have almost as much benefits as a Fritchle with a 2010 battery .
It would still require an elaborate charging infrastructure , but because of its much smaller battery it would seriously relieve the problem of peak demand : fast - charging could become a realistic option without the need to build hundreds of new power plants .
It would also have the substantial advantage of holding a battery that is much less energy - intensive to produce .
Of course , there are many more possibilities than the two scenario's outlined here .
It would not kill us to drive at speeds of 20 mph , on the contrary , but there is so much potential in downsizing the automobile that we do n't have to go all the way back to the early 1900s to get a decent range .
We could tune them up a bit so that they could get 60 km/h or 40 mph ( only slightly faster than the 1911 Babcock Electric Roadster pictured above ) and accelerate just fast enough to leave a crime scene or flee from a mad elephant .
At 60 km /h or 40 mph a trip of 600 kilometres or 400 miles would take 10 hours , instead of 5 hours at a common motorway speed .
This does not sound like the end of the world .
It 's definitely a whole lot faster than going by foot ( 120 hours ) or by bike ( 30 hours ) .
We could also equip the Trev with a somewhat larger battery so that it gets a better mileage at the expense of a somewhat lower speed .
Or , yet another possibility : keep the Trev like it is but limit its speed to that of the Fritchle .
If we want more speed , we have to sacrifice range .
If we want more range , we have to sacrifice speed .
If we want to keep the ( energy ) costs of the charging infrastructure within reasonable limits , we have to sacrifice speed or size .
The lesson to be learned here , is that we cannot have it all : range , speed and size .
And yet , that 's what we are trying to do . ©

Sources ( in order of importance ) :
Last week the evangelical humanitarian organization World Relief , which is affiliated with the National Association of Evangelicals , announced that it would formalize its 65 - year policy of discriminating in hiring against non-evangelicals .
Or , to put it in World Relief ’s terms , “ hiring according to our faith . ”
Although World Relief claims it wo n’t require employees to be Christians , it will require them to affirm its mission statement , which requires following Jesus .
Religious organizations are exempt from the discrimination prohibitions in federal civil rights laws , but President Barack Obama had promised during the campaign to reverse Bush - era rules that extend that exemption even to religious organizations that receive federal funding .
Obama still has n’t changed the policy , instead saying his administration would assess instances of discrimination on a “ case - by - case basis , ” angering civil liberties advocates who have been pressing him for well over a year to implement a policy change .
World Relief received over $ 14 million in federal funding in FY 2009 , from the U.S. Agency for International Development , State Department , and Department of Health and Human Services .
In addition to its recent announcement of enforcement of its hiring and retention policy , World Relief has come under fire for refusing to hire a Muslim interpreter who had volunteered for the organization for six months in its refugee resettlement work .
Refugee resettlement is one of the programs for which World Relief receives federal funding .
( I ’ve asked the White House whether World Relief has been subject to that “ case - by - case ” review and will update with any response . )
As the health care reform debate played out over more than the first year of Obama ’s term in office , anti-reproductive rights advocates — including , most notably , the Catholic Church — complained vociferously and ceaselessly about how they did not want their tax dollars going to pay for another person ’s abortion .
( Never mind that the bills under consideration protected against that , and that the bill that became law protected against it ; the anti-choice coalition still opposes the law and is even suing over it . )
Yet , even though polling shows that overwhelming majorities of Americans oppose federal funding for religious organizations that engage in hiring discrimination , the taxpayer - funded discrimination policy has not changed .
The group of anti-choice organizations opposing health care reform had a Stop the Abortion Mandate coalition .
Would a Stop the Discrimination Mandate coalition be as effective ?

“ We live frugally , we do n’t drink , we do n’t smoke , we do n’t party , and we live within our means , ” Mr. Franks said by phone earlier this year from Nova Scotia , where friends had given them use of an empty house .
“ We pay all our bills , we do n’t have car payments , we pay our credit cards off every month , and that seems to count against us . ”
Daniel Maranci , a lawyer in Boston who represented the Franks , said the couple met the test of earning more than enough to make a living because they had enough to hire three or four Americans as waiters and to pay for their properties .
“ The marginality requirement is fairly subjective , ” Mr. Maranci said .
“ U.K. nationals are saying there has been a shift generally in the way these cases are being adjudicated , with a more draconian view of marginality . ”
Over the last two and a half years , 8,468 requests for E - 2 extensions have been filed , and their approval rate does appear to have dropped , according to figures provided by William G. Wright , a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services .
So far in the 2010 fiscal year , he said , 82 percent of the applications have been approved .
In 2009 , 84 percent were approved , and in 2008 , 91 percent .
The service does not track the reasons for denial , so the extent to which marginality was a factor is not clear .
The Franks said the vagueness of the standards made them hard to meet .
“ Because there are no hard and fast rules , they can get you on whatever they want , ” Mrs. Franks said .
Mr. Wright , who said he was speaking generally about the process and not about the Franks ’ case , said that the most recent internal reviews of the decision - making process showed that adjudicators abided by proper standards in 97 percent of cases .
“ The adjudicators are doing their job , ” he said .
Mr. Paparelli , the California immigration lawyer , said that in recent years , E - 2 visa holders were being foiled by a confluence of trends , including an increased vigilance by government officials after the Sept. 11 attacks ; a perception by officials that “ evil people ” may be using these visas fraudulently to get into the United States ; a bureaucratic disinclination to take the time to examine applications by mom-and - pop operations ; and immigration officers ’ perceptions that local economies already hurt by the recession and job losses could not sustain more businesses .
If , as he says , the monster spill was his highest priority from Day 1 , he needed to communicate that from Day 1 — or at least Day 3 or 4 .
It took five weeks for him to tell the nation what he and his administration were doing .
The result was visible in the press conference yesterday .
He was on the defensive .
He needed to be on the offensive — from early on .
The choice is not doing or communicating .
It is doing and communicating .
His narrative :
This is a tough , unprecedented situation , but I ’m in charge , and I ’ve been very busy , in the Situation Room where I belong , not on tv .
I ’m fully competent .
I ’m a good policy wonk — ask me any question about details .
I ’m honest .
I admit my few policy mistakes .
I think about the details day and night .
Do n’t think I ’m oblivious .
It ’s defensive , trying to overcome criticism that should never have been allowed to accumulate .
But worse , it ’s weak when it needs to be strong .
The president did do the required minimum .
He placed a moratorium on offshore drilling and cancelled oil leases in the Gulf and off Virginia .
He appointed a commission to make safety recommendations .
And he is reorganizing the Mining Management Service .
All to the good , but ...
Crises are opportunities .
He has consistently missed them .
Today was a grand opportunity to pull together the threads — BP and the spill , Massey and the mine disaster , Wall Street and the economic disaster , Anthem BlueCross and health care , the Arizona Immigration Law , Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell — even Afghanistan .
The press threw him fastballs straight down the middle , and he hit dribblers every time .
It ’s not that he said nothing to tie them together .
But there was no home run , no unifying narrative , no patriotic call to the nation on the full gamut of issues .
Instead , there were only hints , suggestions , possible implications , notes of concern — as if he had been intimidated by the right - wing message machine .
And yet , Obama of all political leaders , could have done it , because he did before in his campaign .
The central idea is Empathy .
Democracy is based on empathy , on people caring about one another and acting to the very best of their ability on that care , for their families , their communities , their nation , and the world .
Government must also care and act on that care .
Government ’s job is to protect and empower its citizens .
That idea is what draws together all the threads .
The bottom line for corporations ( whether BP , Massey , Anthem or Goldman Sachs ) is money , not empathy .
The bottom line for those who hate ( whether homophobes , the Arizona Legislature , or al Qaeda ) is domination and oppression , not empathy .
Empathy , and acting on it effectively , is the main business of government .
And Obama knows it in his heart .
Yet the right - wing has intimidated Obama into dropping not just the word " empathy , " but the idea .
Empathy is a positive deep connection with other people in general and with all living things , the ability to see and feel as they do .
The right - wing , which shows little empathy , has confused empathy with a bleeding - heart sympathy for individuals , which they see as a weakness .
And though Obama has repeatedly made the distinction clear , he has allowed the right wing to intimidate him into abandoning " the most important thing my mother taught me . "
At the very end of the press ’ questions , there was a hint of the campaign Obama .
... I think everybody understands that when we are fouling the Earth like this , it has concrete implications not just for this generation , but for future generations .
I grew up in Hawaii where the ocean is sacred .
And when you see birds flying around with oil all over their feathers and turtles dying , that does n't just speak to the immediate economic consequences of this ; this speaks to how are we caring for this incredible bounty that we have .
And so sometimes when I hear folks down in Louisiana expressing frustrations , I may not always think that they 're comments are fair ; on the other hand , I probably think to myself , these are folks who grew up fishing in these wetlands and seeing this as an integral part of who they are -- and to see that messed up in this fashion would be infuriating .
So the thing that the American people need to understand is that not a day goes by where the federal government is not constantly thinking about how do we make sure that we minimize the damage on this , we close this thing down , we review what happened to make sure that it does not happen again .
And in that sense , there are analogies to what 's been happening in terms of in the financial markets and some of these other areas where big crises happen -- it forces us to do some soul searching .
And I think that 's important for all of us to do .
Here , at the very end , he allows the empathy and the moral vision to come out .
Future generations , the sacredness of nature over the immediate economic consequences , caring for this incredible bounty that we have , identifying with folks who see fishing as part of who they are , analogies to what ’s been happening in the financial markets , soul searching .
That should have — and could have — been the central narrative drawing all the threads together .
The narrative about the daily competence and effort should have been in service of the central narrative of his administration .
It should be , and can be , the central narrative of American democracy .
But to make it central and powerful would be confrontational .
It would bring him head - to - head with right - wing ideology — empathy - free , self - interest maximizing , with disdain or even hatred for those seen as lesser beings .
It is self - reinforcing : a value - system that above all promotes that value - system itself .
That is why right - wing Republicans always vote no to his proposals .
Because to vote yes would strengthen an empathy - based moral system and weaken their own .
Because right - wing ideology takes precedence over empathy , there will be little or any real bipartisanship with those on the hard - core right .
The right is provoking confrontation .
It can not be avoided .
The president should be confronting the right - wing on all issues — not issue - by - issue as a policy wonk , but with the master moral narrative that makes sense of our country ’s values .
Here ’s what that would mean .
The following " shoulds " are not mine .
They follow naturally from President Obama ’s own values as he articulated them is his 2008 campaign , and as they leaked out , largely unnoticed , during his press conference .
The president recognizes that financial reform requires dealing with systemic risk , which means not mere regulation , but restructuring the financial system to minimize , and if possible eliminate , systemic risk .
Applying the analogy to oil spills , it would mean no more deep - water drilling because major systemic risks ( " worst case scenarios " ) cannot be eliminated when you drill starting a mile down where no human being can go and drilling three miles deeper .
Like other large corporations , BP uses cost - benefit analysis to maximize profits .
It is no surprise that , to save money , BP chose inferior materials in Deepwater Horizon , materials whose defects may well have caused the explosion .
The use of cost - benefit analysis for a corporation ’s benefit ( and not the public ’s ) is a dangerous practice in many industries .
Cost - benefit analysis itself , used this way , should be considered as an important component of systemic risk by the President ’s commission on safety .
The president should support the Cantwell - Collins CLEAR ACT , which will actually cut gasoline consumption radically by 2050 and carbon emissions by 80 % by 2050 , while stimulating the economy by providing significant financial dividends to all adult citizens , eliminating government imposition on business , and making those who profit from selling polluting fuel pay to clean it up and develop alternative energy .
CLEAR is far superior to cap - and - trade alternatives .
The president should generalize from oil spills to coal mining , banning the blowing up of mountain tops and the fouling of streams , and imposing serious safety restrictions on all mining .
The president should review the covert operations imposed by the military and cancel those that are inconsistent with American values .
The president should order military leaders under his command to support the elimination of Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
The president should ask the First Lady to sponsor a major government program to do research on and support empathetic parenting , along the lines of his 2008 Father ’s Day speech .
And much more .
A great deal follows from a unified moral stance .
Empathy and the discipline to act effectively on it , when seen as the basis of democracy and American values , can be powerful .
It can unify the major policies of the administration , and unify people of good will — and that is a majority of our citizens .
But only if the president communicates empathy effectively , and acts on it consistently .
Empathy Now !
Cory Doctorow is currently on tour promoting his new book , For the Win .
It ’s about gold farmers in MMORPGs that unionize to combat the terrible working conditions of their computer sweatshops .
If you ’ve read Cory ’s short story , Anda ’s Game , which is the first fiction based on gold farming and nearly one of the first reports on the practice , you will feel right at home with the characters and situations in For the Win .
If not , do not fear !
Cory ’s writing does not assume you have anything but an open mind .
The book has a number of primary characters scattered all over the world , connected in the virtual gaming space .
Following a reading — wherein a Bay Area local boy interacts with some Chinese gold farmers who turn out to be more than he imagined them to be —
Cory gave a talk about copyright and how it is perceived by the copyright holders and producers .
Cory then talked about appliances .
These are devices like the Apple iPad , an Amazon Kindle and most mobile phones .
Like Jonathan Zittrain , Doctorow finds the proliferation of appliances troubling .
The problem , in a nutshell and in my own words is that appliances are purpose - built devices with one aim : to lock the consumer into a vertical market from which there is no escape , except a complete re-purchase of a different device and all the content ( games , videos , music , books , etc ) that the user of the appliance has already paid for .
Cory had a great anecdote about a friend that argued that dishwashers were appliances , so are they equally as bad ?
Cory ’s rebuttal was that manufacturers do not create a dishwasher that can only clean pre-approved dishes and then follow up with a lawsuit if you attempt to use different dishes in the machine .
Some random notes and quotes from the talk :
There were a couple of little jabs at Bono , who has proposed to use Chinese firewall technology to block the trading of files on the Internet .
If you have to ask , you will never get it .
Do not buy into the BS .
Canadians : we ’re everywhere , like serial killers .

Music industry is gullible and will buy magic boogieman charms but then get knifed by mandatory 99 cent downloads .
You can have a megalomaniac in a turtleneck that tells you how things should be , and still have a checkbox that says “ I ’m an adult , I can make my own decisions ” .
Copyright is abstruse and listening to people talk about it is often like listening to 12 year olds talk about sex .
But essentially , the message of the talk is that it ’s time to stop making excuses and compromises .
Telling yourself that buying a locked - down device is okay because you will only use it for a short time is disingenuous : it supports vertical business models and closed , Cathedral systems .
You ’ve missed SFO , AUS & RDU , but if you live in NYC or YYZ , you can still catch Cory ’s book tour .
He is a great and impassioned speaker , so I highly recommend seeing him .

How Mark Webber has left world champions Button and Hamilton trailing in his slipstream
By Malcolm Folley
At his local petrol station in Buckinghamshire , Mark Webber drew some quiet , congratulatory comments when he returned home from Monaco last week .
' Usually , people tell me that if Lewis or Jenson can't win , they support me , ' said Webber .
' I 'm the third cab off the rank , but that 's understandable . '
Not any longer .
In the space of eight , unforgettable days , Webber , a 33 - year - old Australian who has taken root in England , has turned the established order of Formula
One on its head with back - to - back victories in Spain and Monaco .
Leading the way : Webber won his second consecutive grand prix in Monaco
After eight largely unprofitable years spent predominantly at the wrong end of the grid , Webber , at 6ft 2in preposterously tall for a racing driver , has become an overnight sensation .
At the start of the season , nobody envisaged the Aussie with the lean , muscular build of a fast bowler - and a steel rod in his right leg as the result of an accident suffered in the unlikely circumstances of a charity cycling event - travelling this fast , or this far .
The year was supposed to be dominated by reigning world champion Jenson Button joining forces with his predecessor , Lewis Hamilton , to form a British dream team at McLaren .
Fernando Alonso's Ferrari was meant to be their most potent threat , while the return of seven - times world champion Michael Schumacher at 41 was expected to present a force for younger men to fear .
All smiles : Webber leads the championship withe Sebastian Vettel
And if Red Bull were to become a team of substance , then 23 - year - old Sebastian Vettel was the driver earmarked to advance their claims .
Yet last week , the man being showered with champagne and compliments was Webber , who until a fortnight ago had enjoyed just two wins from 142 F1 races .
After winning the Monaco Grand Prix last Sunday , leading from first corner to last with a composed , masterful drive in his Red Bull - just as he had done at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona the weekend before - Webber has thrust himself to the head of the World Championship standings .
' I suppose it 's amazing because , only three or four weeks ago , everyone was talking about the dream team at McLaren or Michael doing this or that , ' said Webber .
' But I 'm not getting carried away ; our sport changes in a flash . '
Over recent days Webber has received a deluge of calls and messages from racing men like Nigel Mansell , Sir Stirling Moss , Alain Prost , Jody Scheckter and Jack Brabham , as well Australian cricketers Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting .
He feels humbled by the acclaim .
' It seems a lot of people watch the Monaco Grand Prix , ' he said .
Webber 's success is sweeter for having endured years of hardship with under - funded teams since making his debut with Minardi in 2002 .
Flat out : Webber has turned the world of Formula One upside down
Years in the outback of the sport followed with Jaguar and Williams , teams condemned to compete with little money and even less hope of winning .
Then , cruelly , just as he appeared to be turning the corner with a new team , Red Bull , Webber feared his career could be stolen from him .
Seventeen months ago he was knocked over by a car when he was cycling in his own charity event in Tasmania .
He suffered a double compound fracture of his right leg , along with a broken shoulder .
Webber was given just 82 days , from entering hospital in Australia to passing a fitness test set by his Red Bull paymasters , to get himself fit to continue racing for the team in 2009 .
' It was an aggressive time - frame with the injuries I had , ' he said without complaint last week .
' The team were putting a huge amount of effort into being successful against Ferrari and McLaren week in , week out and you can't have one of your key personnel messing you around .
Taking a dip : Webber celebrates after winning the Monaco Grand Prix
' I admit they were difficult times , but I had good people around me and I was determined to make it .'
The steel rod holding his right leg in place is a legacy of his battle ; but , then Webber is a man who defies stereo - typing .
Just recently , he watched surgeons perform open - heart surgery at a hospital in Nottingham .
' I wanted to see other professional people perform under pressure , ' he explained .
His mother , Diane , had successfully undergone a similar operation at home in New South Wales .
' I was n't clever enough to study medicine , but I 've always been fascinated by physiology and the human condition , ' he added .
Making a splash : Webber has won two races inside eight days
When he called home from Monaco on Sunday , he shared his elation with his father Alan , hugely instrumental in assisting Webber 's journey from the small country town of Queanbeyan , near Canberra , to Formula One .
' But mum could n't get any further than , " Hello " , because she was too emotional . '
The family remembered only too well the odds that Webber surmounted .
Without a £ 54,000 interest - free loan from Australia 's maverick rugby star , David Campese - until then the most famous inhabitant of Queanbeyan - he would have run out of money during his apprenticeship in Formula Three in Britain .
By then , Webber was already in a relationship with an Englishwoman , Ann Neal , who had worked as a consultant with Ford in Australia after her marriage had broken down .
Tough times : Webber 's 2009 season was in doubt after his accident
She was with Webber when he dined with Prince Albert as guest of honour at the traditional post -Monaco Grand Prix black - tie gala party on Sunday night .
' I was in jeans , but smart jeans , ' he insisted .
' Ann did well but , true to form , females need more time to get ready !
Still , I was let in and Prince Albert seemed happy to see me .
' It struck me that , at that dinner with the Prince , I was part of history .
never forget them peeling back roof of the building for a fireworks display .
It was a great conclusion what had been a unique , dramatic week in my life . '
Webber 's celebrations came attached with a health warning .
To escape madding crowd wanting to share triumph at the end of the race , Webber made an unconventional return to team 's HQ , a three - storey palatial restaurant - bar - business centre , with its own swimming pool , that was beside the paddock .
All smiles : but Hamilton is yet to open his winning account this season
Along with Vettel , who secured Red Bull a memorable one - two result , Webber jumped into the harbour from a height of around 20ft and swam back .
' I 've got to admit the water did n't taste too good , mate , ' said Webber .
On Monday , he had a hangover made in heaven .
' I drove round the track again in my road car looking to see where the rubber was , just taking in the moment , ' he explained .
' The last time I 'd driven it , I 'd been pretty wired !
I am not one for the glitz or glamour , but I know how tough it is to win there .
A small error and your race is over .
I just wanted another look on Monday . '
What he saw was how he had placed himself among the most exalted company .
And at the end of an exceptional week 's work , Webber is now deemed in control of the driver market .
His contract ends this year and he is attracting the attention of Ferrari , who are widely expected to part company with Felipe Massa this year .
Yet , with the wisdom acquired from years in the business , Webber is unexcited about his sudden change of status .
' I 've just won two races , back - to - back , and people are asking me where I 'm going to drive next year , ' he said .
' I 'm very close to the guys at Red Bull , we 've been through a lot , and I have a great relationship with them .
Yet things happen and change very fast in this business , and you never know what 's around the corner .
' At the moment , I 'm only thinking about the next race , in Turkey next weekend .
The rest will take care of itself .
There are hundreds of points up for grabs and I 'm concentrating on the job in hand .
I imagine the picture will be clearer in another six weeks or so .
But what matters most is I still have a great desire driving me .'
In Australia , his triumph last Sunday had eased the nation 's pain at losing to England in the Twenty20 world championship final as he took the headlines .
' If you want to call that cricket , England are world champions , ' said Webber .
' But wait for the Ashes this winter - the Monaco of cricket ! '
Last week Webber settled back into the pace of rural Buckinghamshire , unfazed by his new stardom .
' We came close to moving abroad a couple of years ago , but I 'm glad we did n't .
I can read the newspapers in the morning , watch sport on TV , and go to a few football matches .
When the weather 's good , it 's a great part of the world . '
Last week it had never felt better .
Image caption VAT cuts helped boost consumer sales in 2009
VAT is set to rise under the new coalition government , according to a BBC survey of influential economists .
Of 28 independent economists currently used by the Treasury to assist its forecasts , 24 said they expected the rate to rise in the coming parliament .
The majority predicted a rise from the current 17.5 % to 20 % before the end of 2011 .
Analysts say a 20 % rate would raise an estimated £ 11.5 bn a year .
VAT was temporarily cut last year to 15 % to aid the economic recovery .
But the tax on consumer goods is seen as an attractive way to boost the government 's tax income , with cutting the country 's budget deficit a priority for the new Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition .
' Drop in the ocean '
On Wednesday the coalition said it wanted to see " a significantly accelerated reduction " in the country 's borrowing , with £ 6bn of cuts planned in the first year .
Any changes to VAT and other taxes are likely to be unveiled in an emergency Budget to be announced within 50 days .
It 's a very complex and costly thing to do for retailers Justin King , Sainsbury 's chief executive
Economist Azad Zangana , from Schroders , who is predicting a rise in VAT to 19 % , said that the UK economy is probably strong enough to withstand the expected cuts and tax rises .
" While earlier cuts in public spending are inevitably going to dampen economic growth , the UK recovery appears to be gathering pace , " he said .
He added , however , that £ 6bn in public spending cuts were only " a drop in the ocean " compared to what would be required to tackle the current £ 166bn deficit .
Speaking to the BBC the chief executive of Sainsbury 's , Justin King , admitted that a rise in VAT looked " more likely than not " .
But he said any rise had to be well - timed by the government , in order to minimise the impact on retailers .
" If it is to go up from the 17.5 % rate , let 's get good advance notice of that and then have stability for the longer term , " he said .
" It 's a very complex and costly thing to do for retailers to change the rate of VAT . "
Following is a brief explanation of the importance of tree - ring data from Ireland .
Why does Earth have a climate ?
Climate exists because of heat from the sun .
Heat from the sun , i.e. sunlight , is most intense in the tropics .
The climate system redistributes that heat : it continually transports heat from the tropics towards the polar regions ( some heat is also converted to kinetic energy ) .
The climate system has two main mechanisms for transporting heat : air ( the atmosphere ) and water ( the oceans ) .
The atmosphere can move quickly , i.e. winds .
The oceans move more slowly .
The oceans , though , hold much more heat than the atmosphere ; e.g. the top 15 cm ( 6 inches ) of ocean waters contain more heat than the entire atmosphere .
Over time , say years or decades , ocean heat transport can significantly change .
Those changes can have an effect on global heat redistribution , that is , on climate .
Deep water
The circulation of the oceans is driven by two main factors : winds and the formation of deep water ( “ deep water ” is ocean water that is more than about 1500 meters below the surface ) .
A figure illustrating where deep water is formed , and how deep water circulates , is shown below .
Schematic figure showing the three main areas where deep water is formed : in the Labrador Sea , in the Greenland / Iceland / Norwegian Seas , and in the Antarctic Weddell Sea .
Deep water is formed when water cools and sinks , thereby releasing heat to the air .
After sinking , the water circulates around the world ocean ( eventually rising up in the Indian and North Pacific oceans ) .
Deep water is formed in the North Atlantic as follows .
Warm surface water flows from the tropical South Atlantic , through the Caribbean , and is then transported , via the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift , to the northernmost North Atlantic .
En route , there is substantial evaporation ; so the water becomes more saline , hence more dense .
The water also cools , further increasing its density .
Water that reaches the Nordic ( Greenland , Iceland , Norwegian ) and Labrador seas is additionally densened in winter by salt from sea-ice growth ( ice has no salt ) , and by more cooling .
Some water is densened enough to cause it to sink .
Water that sinks sufficiently forms deep water .
Deep water formed in the North Atlantic is the dominant source of deep water for the world .
Variability in the formation of North Atlantic deep water will lead to climatic change downwind from the northern North Atlantic ; it will also influence other areas of the world ocean .
Irish tree rings
Ireland is immediately downwind from the North Atlantic Drift .
Changes in the strength and temperature of the Drift — which correlate with changes in the formation of deep water — will strongly affect the climate in Ireland : temperature , precipitation , etc .
Such climatic effects will naturally influence trees growing in Ireland .
As discussed elsewhere , each ring of a tree indicates what the climate was like during the year in which the ring grew .
Thus Irish tree rings would seem to contain annual data on the global climate system .
There are currently tree - ring measurements from Ireland covering the past 7000 years or so .
Those measurements are thus valuable for the study of Earth 's climate .
I first found out about the foregoing in 1997 , when I attended a conference at Cambridge University ( this was the conference that led to the founding of the Cambridge Conference Network ) .
One of the speakers at the conference was Michael G.L. Baillie , who is a professor of tree - ring studies at Queen 's University Belfast , in Northern Ireland ; Baillie is also the researcher who has gathered most of the tree-ring samples in Ireland .
During his talk at the conference , he discussed the above .
Empirical tests
Baillie has thus far refused to release most of the data ( for discussion of this , see here ) .
A small portion of the data has been released , though ; I used some of that to do a partial test of the foregoing .
The tree -ring data for the test was from a site in western Ireland , Garryland Wood .
I compared that tree - ring data with the average annual temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere .
( I ignored the Southern Hemisphere ; although the Southern Hemisphere is affected by the climate off Ireland , the effects do not occur in the same year — because oceanic transport and interhemispheric mixing of the atmosphere are too slow . )
The records of annual temperatures were obtained from NASA ( GISTEMP ) .
The comparison spanned years 1880 ( the first year of the temperature records ) through 1997 ( the last year of the tree - ring data ) .
The correlation between the temperatures and the tree rings is substantial : 0.41 .
The growing season of the Irish trees is about March–October .
The trees , though , can be influenced by the climate outside the growing season , e.g. more snow during the prior winter might enhance growth .
Furthermore , the growth of a tree during any one year inherently affects how well the tree grows during the subsequent year .
Hence , when using tree rings to estimate the temperature in a given year , we should consider not only the ring that grew in that year , but also the ring that grew one year earlier and the ring that grew one year later .
There are many ways to consider the earlier and later rings .
As a simple example , we could just add together the data from three consecutive years .
Doing the additions gives a new series , whose correlation with the hemispheric temperatures is 0.52 .
Obviously more sophisticated methods could be used to determine the new series , which would increase the correlation further .
Additional issues
The above correlations are based on the average of data from trees at a single site in Ireland .
A problem that can occur when using trees at a single site is that the trees might have been affected by some local event , such as an insect attack , or young trees breaking through the forest canopy and growing with little constraint .
Those problems could be at least partially addressed by considering the individual trees at the site , rather than the average for the site , and also by considering trees at other sites in the British Isles .
Doing so would presumably lead to additional increases in the correlation .
Another issue is to determine what climatic variables the trees are responding to .
The trees obviously cannot be responding directly to the temperature of the whole hemisphere .
Could they be responding largely to local temperatures ?
Local temperature data is available beginning in 1901 .
This data shows that the tree rings have a correlation with local temperatures that is much less than the rings have with hemispheric temperatures ( explaining only about half as much of the variation ) .
So what climatic variables explain the high correlation between the tree rings and hemispheric temperatures ?
The regional climatology suggests that the trees are responding to the energy flux from the adjacent ocean to the atmosphere .
This energy flux will have a substantial influence on hemispheric temperatures .
The energy can be thermal ( heat ) or kinetic ( wind ) .
And it is associated with a variety of climatic effects that influence tree growth ( in addition to temperature ) .
As an example , for air at a fixed temperature , an increase in heat content generally implies an increase in humidity , which can affect tree growth .
Increased heat and wind would also tend to increase cloudiness , which again can affect tree growth .
Increased heat and wind would additionally increase thunderstorms , which bring much precipitation during a short time and typically in large drops ( which are more likely than small drops to break through the forest canopy and undergrowth ) — although there is ample precipitation in western Ireland ; so it seems unlikely that tree growth is substantively limited by moisture .
It has also been suggested ( by L. Pearson ) that increased lightning , from the thunderstorms , could affect trees , e.g. through the release of nitrogen .
Modeling the climatic factors affecting tree growth is extremely difficult , but the Garryland Wood trees do seem to be responding , somehow , to the energy flux .
Finally , although the Irish data seems quite good , it should obviously be combined with other data from different regions of the Northern Hemisphere .
Using a small number of sites with high - quality data ( e.g. a few sites downwind from each of the three oceans ) might well yield a quality temperature reconstruction for the hemisphere , extending back millennia .
Relevance for global - warming studies
The biggest concern with global warming is , arguably , that warming will itself cause further warming .
For example , the polar ice caps reflect sunlight back into space ( thereby cooling Earth ) ; if the caps shrink , due to warming , then they will reflect less sunlight , and so Earth will warm further .
It is claimed to be possible that Earth warms so much that it reaches what is called a “ tipping point ” , where the global climate system is seriously and permanently disrupted — like when a glass of water has been tipped over , and the water cannot realistically be put back into the glass .
There is much scientific debate over how much Earth has to warm before reaching a tipping point .
No one knows for sure .
About a thousand years ago , though , there was a time known as the “ Medieval Warm Period ” , when Earth ( or at least the Northern Hemisphere ) appears to have been unusually warm .
It is not currently known just how warm the Medieval Warm Period was .
Clearly , though , the warmth then was below the tipping point , because Earth 's climate continued without problem .
Suppose that during the Medieval Warm Period , Earth was 1 °C warmer than today .
That would imply that the tipping point is more than 1 °C higher than today 's temperature .
For Earth 's temperature to increase by 1 °C might take a century ( at the rate of increase believed to be currently underway ) .
So we would not have to be concerned about an imminent disruption of the climate system .
Finding out how warm the Medieval Warm Period was is thus of enormous importance for the study of global warming .
It is one of the most important questions for science today .
And the Irish tree - ring data can provide a substantial portion of the solution .

You have probably heard about the recent release of GCC 4.5.0 .
One of the new features in this version is the support for plugins .
You can now write a shared object ( .so ) that can be loaded into GCC and hooked into various stages of the compilation process .
In the past couple of months I have been working on a new project ( what it ’s about is a secret , for now ; UDATE : no longer a secret ) that uses GCC and the new plugin feature in order to parse C++ and then to generate some code based on it .
Writing a plugin to accomplish this was both fun and frustrating .
Fun because GCC has a very rich abstract syntax tree ( AST , sometimes called C++ Tree in GCC documentation ) .
The amount of information available about parsed C++ is amazing ; there is n’t much you ca n’t infer about the code .
It was frustrating because this AST is very complex and very poorly documented .
So is the plugin API .
Most of the time I was reading the AST headers to learn more about the API and studied the GCC compiler source code to understand how to use it .
While there are a few other plugins around ( and more will probably be written in the future ) , most of them concentrate on either optimizations or code generation ( a good example of the latter is LLVM ’s DragonEgg plugin ) .
The only exception is probably Mozilla ’s Dehydra / Treehydra set of plugins .
However , Dehydra simply exposes a flattened subset of GCC ’s AST as a set of JavaScript objects ( for example , there is no namespace or # include information ) .
Treehydra relies on GIMPLE which is a representation one level below ( towards the machine code ) from the parsed C++.
As a result , there is n’t much information or source code examples that show how to work with the GCC’s C++ AST .
And since I have already figured out most of the basics , I was thinking about writing a series of blog posts that show how to use GCC plugins to parse C++.
What you do based on this information is up to you .
Some of the potential applications include static analysis , ( source ) code generation , documentation generation , binding to other languages , editor / IDE support , etc .
In today ’s post I am going to show how to set up the plugin infrastructure for this kind of tasks .
If there is interest , future posts will cover various aspects of working with GCC’s AST .
So if you would like to read more on this topic , drop a line in the comments and if there is enough interest , I will write more on GCC plugins .
GCC plugin API is covered in Chapter 23 , “ Plugins ” in the GCC Internals documentation .
As described in this chapter , there are several compilation events ( or phases ) that the plugin can register for .
Unfortunately none of the existing events are suitable for the kind of task that we want to perform .
What we want is to be called just after the AST has been constructed and before any other passes are performed .
We do n’t want to perform any other passes since that would only be a waste of time .
All we need is the C++ AST .
At first it may seem that PLUGIN_FINISH_UNIT is a good place to run our code .
However , a number of passes are performed before it ( you can test this by registering a callback for the PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE event which will allow you to see all the passes that are being executed ) .
One way to achieve what we want would be to register a callback for the PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE event .
This callback is called before every pass and it allows the plugin to decide whether to run the pass in question .
The first call to this callback will then by definition be before any other pass has run .
We can then call our code from this first execution of the callback and then terminate GCC .
Here is the skeleton for this callback :
extern " C " void gate_callback ( void * gcc_data , void * ) { //
If there were errors during compilation , // let GCC handle the exit . // if ( errorcount || sorrycount ) return ; int r ( 0 ) ; // // Process AST .
Issue diagnostics and set r // to 1 in case of an error .
// // Terminate GCC . // exit ( r ) ; }
errorcount and sorrycount are GCC variables that contain the error counts .
The plugin API includes all the internal GCC headers so a plugin can access all the data and call all the functions that the code in the GCC compiler itself can .
Now we have set up the entry point for our plugin in the overall compilation process .
There is , however , another thing that we need to take care of : the compiler output .
When you execute something like this :
g++ -fplugin=plugin.so -c test.cxx
g++ is n’t the executable that will actually load plugin .
so .
g++ is a compiler driver that runs several other programs under the hood in order to translate test.cxx to test .o ( use the -v option to see what ’s actually being executed by g++ ) .
It first runs the program called cc1 plus which is the actual C++ compiler and which will load the plugin .
The output of cc1 plus is an assembly file .
Once the assembly file is generated , g++ invokes as to translate the assembly file to test .o .
Our plugin is altering the GCC compilation process .
Instead of the assembly file we want to generate something else ( or maybe no output files at all in case of a static analysis tool ) .
Do you see the problem now ?
While our plugin is producing some other output , g++ assumes it will produce an assembly file which it will then try to pass to the assembler .
While we can try to invoke cc1 plus directly , it is an internal program of GCC and is invoked by g++ with some additional options which we would rather not deal with .
Instead , we can ask g++ to produce an assembly file by passing - S instead of - c .
In this case g++ is not going to invoke the assembler and nobody will care that the output assembly file does not exist .
So this part is sorted out then .
Well , not quite .
While we terminate GCC quite early , before any assembly can actually be generated , the output assembly file is still created .
To get rid of this file we need to add the following line in our plugin_init ( ) :
asm_file_name = HOST_BIT_BUCKET ;
HOST_BIT_BUCKET
is defined as " / dev/null " .
Here is the complete source code for the skeleton of our plugin :
// GCC header includes to get the parse tree // declarations .
The order is important and // does n't follow any kind of logic .
// #include < stdlib.h > # include < gmp.h > # include < cstdlib > //
Include before GCC poisons // some declarations .
extern " C " { #include " gcc-plugin.h " # include " config.h " # include " system.h " # include " coretypes.h " # include " tree.h " # include " intl.h " # include " tm.h " # include " diagnostic.h " # include " c-common.h " # include " c-pragma.h " #include " cp/cp - tree.h " } # include < iostream > using namespace std ; int plugin_is_GPL_compatible ; extern " C " void gate_callback ( void* , void * ) { //
If there were errors during compilation , // let GCC handle the exit . // if ( errorcount || sorrycount ) return ; int r ( 0 ) ; // // Process AST .
Issue diagnostics and set r // to 1 in case of an error .
// cerr << " processing " << main_input_filename << endl ; exit ( r ) ; } extern " C " int plugin_init ( plugin_name_args * info , plugin_gcc_version * ver ) { int r ( 0 ) ; cerr << " starting " << info -> base_name << endl ; // //
Parse options if any .
// //
Disable assembly output . // asm_file_name = HOST_BIT_BUCKET ; // Register callbacks . // register_callback ( info -> base_name , PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE , &gate_callback , 0 ) ; return r ; }
You can compile and try it out like so :
$ g++-4.5 - I`g ++-4.5 - print- file-name=plugin` / include \ - fPIC - shared plugin.cxx -o plugin.so $ g++- 4.5 - S - fplugin=./plugin.so test.cxx starting plugin processing test.cxx
Update : Starting with version 4.7.0 , GCC can be built either in C or C++ mode .
And starting with version 4.8.0 , it is always built as C ++.
If you try to run the above example using GCC built in the C++ mode , you will get an error saying that the plugin cannot be loaded because one or more symbols are undefined .
The reason for this error is that now all the GCC symbols have C++ linkage while we include them as extern " C " .
The solution to this problem is to remove the extern " C " { } block around the include directives at the beginning of our plugin source code ( note that the following functions should still remain extern " C " ) .
Another option that you will probably want to add to the plugin invocation is - x c++ .
It tells GCC that what ’s being compiled is C++ regardless of the file extension .
This is useful if you plan to compile , for example , C++ header files ( in this case and without this option , GCC will try to generate a precompiled header instead of an assembly file ) .
Having to remember to specify the two options ( - S - x c++ ) could be quite inconvenient for the users of our plugin .
The plugin can also have options of its own which are specified on the g++ command line in the following form :
- fplugin - arg -< plugin - name >-< key >[ =< value > ]
This is quite verbose and can also become a major inconvenience for the users of our plugin .
To address the above two problems it makes sense to create a driver for our plugin , similar to how g++ is a driver for cc1 plus .
The driver will automatically pass the - S - x c++ - fplugin=./plugin.so options to g++ and convert plugin options to the - fplugin - arg - format before passing them to g++ .
For my project I wrote a plugin driver that uses the following conventions .
The driver recognizes the commonly used options such as - I , - D , etc. , and passes them to g++ as is .
Otherwise the -x option can be used to pass extra options to g++ ( for example , - x - m32 ) .
If an argument to -x does not start with ‘ - ‘ , then it is treated as the g++ executable name .
Everything else is converted to the - fplugin - arg - format and passed as plugin options which are then handled in the plugin code with the help of cli .
So if you execute :
driver -x g++- 4.5 -x m32 -- foo bar test.cxx
Then the g++ command line will look like this :
g++-4.5 - m32 - S -x c++ -fplugin=./plugin.so \ - fplugin-arg-plugin-foo=bar test.cxx
And that ’s it for today .

“ I think they were wrong and I think I was wrong to take ” their advice . ” - President Bill Clinton , April 18 , 2010 on on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
>
In Bailout Nation , I held Bill Clinton , and his two Treasury Secretaries , Robert Rubin and Larry Summers , responsible for signing the ruinous Commodity Futures Modernization
Act that exempt Derivatives from all regulation and oversight .
The CFMA was passed as part of a larger bill by unanimous consent , and that Clinton signed on December 21 , 2000 .
Bill Clinton now joins Alan Greenspan in admitting his contribution to the credit crisis .
The former president admits his error :
He said his Treasury Secretaries — Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers — were wrong in the advice they gave him about regulating derivatives .
And , he was wrong to follow their advice .
Bloomberg has the details :
“ Their argument was that derivatives did n’t need transparency because they were “ expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of people will buy them and they do n’t need any extra protection , ” Clinton said .
“ The flaw in that argument was that first of all , sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency . ”
“ Even if less than 1 percent of the total investment community is involved in derivative exchanges , so much money was involved that if they went bad , they could affect 100 percent of the investments , ” Clinton said . ”
Clinton does n’t only throw Rubin and Summers under the bus — he also blames his successor , George W. Bush :
“ Clinton also said the Bush administration contributed to the financial crisis with lax regulation .
“ I think what happened was the SEC and the whole regulatory apparatus after I left office was just let go , ” Clinton said .
If Clinton ’s head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , Arthur Levitt , had remained in that job , “ an enormous percentage of what we ’ve been through in the last eight or nine years would not have happened , ” Clinton said .
“ I feel very strongly about it .
I think it ’s important to have vigorous oversight . ”
He certainly has a point about the SEC — the Bush appointees for SEC chairman ranged from bad to worse .
Other actors who have yet to come clean include Harvey Pitt , Hank Paulson , Phil Gramm and George W. Bush .
I am not holding my breath waiting for any of their mea culpas . . .

If you reckon state and local government have created their own guaranteed - to - go - bankrupt pension problem , you'd be half - right : the Federal Reserve 's policies of the past two decades are the crumbling foundation beneath the nation 's unsustainable pension plans .
Here 's a precis of how the nation 's local government pension plans were set to implode .
1. Public unions formed an unholy alliance with elected officials ( in effect , an oligarchy ) to establish politically untouchable protected fiefdoms .
( Please seeSurvival + for more on asymmetric stakes in the game and protected fiefdoms . )
In a typical labor - management nexus , labor negotiates with capital for a slice of the profits from the enterprise .
In local government , the unions lavishly funded the election campaigns of state and local politicos , who then awarded unions lavish pensions and other benefits .
There was no " push - back " against union demand except elections , and the unions stupendous " investment " in buying politicos ensured elections were never a threat to the fiefdom 's rising share of the tax swag .
Here is an MSM ( mainstream media ) summary of the public - union / politico oligarchy :
The Bankrupting of America
We have a ruinous collaboration of elected officials and unionized public workers .
2 . As the stock market bubbled ever higher in the 1990s , managers of pension plans ratcheted up their expectations of future " permanent " growth , giving politicos the go - ahead to ramp up pension pay - outs .
In essence , pension plans which were once constructed on the long - term expectation of 4 - 5 % returns on capital now based future earnings and pay - outs on the stock market 's " average return " of 8 % annually .
As any reasonable person might have foreseen , the bubblicious stock market of the 1990s was not a " new permanent plateau " but in fact a bubble which imploded .
Real returns in the past decade have been literally half what was anticipated , and as a result state and local governments are having to make up the difference with cash out of general fund tax receipts .
Going for broke in L.A. ?
Currently , Riordan says , the city is struggling to meet its pension obligations , and that 's assuming it will receive 8 % annually on the money invested on retirees ' behalf .
In fact , the average return over the past decade has been just 4 % .
As tax receipts plummet in the " slow - growth , " jobless recession , then state and local governments are forced to gut their programs to fund the oligarchy / fiefdom 's pension promises .
Pension issue balloons with soaring costs :
Los Angeles officials say Riordan 's prediction is overstated .
But pension costs are soaring to $ 800 million , tripling during the last decade , as Los Angeles faces years of projected budget deficits even with deep cuts in services and staff .
Since the pension pay - outs were based on plump stock market returns , the pension plan managers had no alternative but to gamble in the stock market on a massive scale .
With " safe " bonds paying so little in the Fed 's low - interest universe , the only way to get an 8 % yield was to speculate in real estate or stocks .
As the sharpy behind the three - card - monte card table could have told you , the pension fund sheep got sheared along with all the other marks :
The main driver of higher pension costs is the stock market crash .
CalPERS gets about 75 percent of its revenue from investment earnings .
Its portfolio peaked at $ 260 billion in 2007 , fell to $ 160 billion last year and now is about $ 204 billion .
Now that the stock market is setting up for a long - term crash , CalPERS will be lucky to have $ 100 billion in its coffers in two years .
And that wo n't be enough to fund the bloated promises made in the go - go 1990s :
A political issue is benefit increases enacted a decade ago , when pension systems had surpluses during a strong economy .
A major increase for state workers , SB400 in 1999 , even included retirees .
A typical state worker can retire after 40 years of service with a pension equal to their final pay .
The formula for the Highway Patrol , 3 percent of final pay for each year served at age 50 , became a statewide trendsetter for police and firefighters .
In the usual gaming favored by gutless politicos desperate to cling to their diminishing power to channel tax funds to their cronies and masters , elected officials are setting aside their pension fund contributions until next year , in the hopes that " growth " will magically save them next year .
As this article explains , that is a vain hope without foundation in the real world :
Why economic growth is n't enough to fix budgets :
But under the laws now dominating government budgets , many expenditures essentially are or will be growing faster than both revenues and the rest of the economy .
In fact , in many areas of the budget , automatic expenditure growth matches or outstrips revenue growth under almost any conceivable rate of economic growth .
Now , so much spending growth is built into permanent or mandatory programs that they essentially absorb much or all revenue growth .
Meanwhile , we 've also cut taxes , widening the gap between available revenues and growing spending levels .
Consider government retirement programs .
Most are effectively " wage - indexed " insofar as a 10 percent higher growth rate of wages does n't just raise taxes on those wages , it also raises the annual benefits of all future retirees by 10 percent .
Meanwhile , in most retirement systems , employees stop working at fixed ages , even though for decades Americans have been living longer .
Today , so much of government spending is devoted to health and retirement programs that their growing costs tend to swamp gains we might achieve in holding down the ever - smaller portion of the budget devoted to discretionary spending .
Still other programs add to the problem , such as tax subsidies for employee benefits , the cost of which grows automatically without any new legislation .
In other words , the entire system of state and local government is now based on the same 8 % " permanent high growth " of the 1990s speculative market .
Funding increases are wired in , regardless of how much tax revenues fall .
That is a recipe for insolvency .
Now we get to the heart of the matter .
Which institution engineered and enabled the heady stock market bubble of the 1990s that created the illusion of " permanent high returns " and growth of tax receipts ?
The Federal Reserve .
The Greenspan - era Federal Reserve 's policy of low interest rates , abundant liquidity and lax oversight directly created the incentives and the wherewithal for malinvestment and speculation on a scale heretofore unknown .
Under the phony guise of " boosting productivity and home ownership " with essentially free money and splendid opportunities for embezzlement , fraud and gaming of the system , the Fed studiously avoided any policy which might have offered some modest restraint on the asset bubbles it inflated .
As the dot - com era market foamed into an unmistakable bubble , wiser heads implored Greenspan to increase the margin requirement for borrowing funds to play the market -- he steadfastly refused .
Whatever barriers remained to rampant speculation were dismantled under the false banner of deregulation in the service of free enterprise .
Thus the Glass - Steagall divide between commercial and investment banking was effectively dismantled in 1980 ( under President Carter ) the late 1990s ( under President Clinton ) .
( So much for the blame being placed solely on the evil Republican lackeys of the bankers -- the " liberal " Democrats were just as craven and slavish . )
Thanks to these long - standing Fed policies favoring exponential expansion of credit and low interest rates , pensions funds were forced into speculating in the stock market to " reach " for their required return on capital .
This certainly suited Wall Street and the deeply politicized leaders of the supposedly independent Federal Reserve , but it set in motion a set of policies , expectations and incentives which fatally undermined pension plans .
In a richly ironic playing out of unintended consequence , the Fed 's " zero interest rate policy " ( ZIRP ) and endless creation of credit for speculation in asset bubbles will in effect bankrupt all the states and local governments which foolishly based their pension plans on 8 % yield in a low - inflation environment .
But one last pernicious Fed - created self - destruct awaits pension managers scrambling for both safety and yield .
As they pour into long - term Treasuries based on low inflation and low interest rates as far as the eye can see , the pension fund managers will find their remaining capital decimated as interest rates rise later this decade .
The Fed 's policy of pushing zero interest rates and abundant credit has undermined not just pension plans and local government , but the entire U.S. economy .
Asset bubbles and incentives for embezzlement , fraud and gaming the system are not productive .
While Bernanke et al. issue ponderous promises that the " nascent recovery " is not just a house of cards flying apart in the rising wind of global volatility and malinvestment , high above his head the chickens are coming home to roost at the Fed .

Do n't Mess with Texas Highway Patrol
Texas : Top 5 State for Issuing Traffic Tickets
Many of us may have experienced that dreadful sight of a police officer waving you to the side of the road .
A police officer may pull you over for a traffic violation or other reasons .
The cost of the violation depends on the violation type and the municipality you are ticketed in .
Below are some interesting facts and figures about Texas traffic violations .
Major vs. Minor Violations
Traffic violations are the most common types of offense that people make .
They are typically divided into two types : major and minor .
Both types have consequences , depending on the severity of the violation .
The best way to get points removed from your record after committing a traffic violation is to take a Texas Defensive Driving course .
Examples of minor violations and their consequences :
Minor Violation Fines / Consequences
Disobeying railroad crossing signs $ 50 - $ 200 Failure to stop for school bus $ 200 - $ 1000 for 1st offense ; repeat offenses result in license suspension
Not wearing a seat belt $ 50 - $ 200 ( depends on age of unbelted passengers )
Parking in disabled space Up to $ 500 Speeding $ 150 ( depends on municipality )
Fact :
The fastest speeding ticket issued in Texas in May 2003 .
The car was going 242 mph in a 75 mph zone .
Tickets are usually issued for a minor offenses and the violator can either pay the fine , try to fight it in court , or attend traffic school to dismiss the ticket ( if the court allows it ) .
Examples of major violations and their consequences :
Major Violation Fines / Consequences Driving Without a License $ 200 Driving While Intoxicated ( DWI ) $ 2,000 for first offense , at least 90 days license suspension , and minimum of 3 days in jail Hit & Run Up to $ 5,000 and maximum of 5 years in jail Intoxication Manslaughter Up to $ 10,000 and 2 - 20 years in jail Reckless Driving Up to $ 200 and 30 days in jail
Fact :
The legal blood alcohol concentration limit in Texas is .08
The consequences are more severe for major offenses .
You can be arrested and imprisoned if you are found guilty .
Most Ticketed Vehicle
A yearlong study was conducted to determine which car is most likely to draw a ticket for their driver .
ISO Quality Planning , the San Francisco company who conducted the study , analyzed over 1.7 million driver records and came up with a list for the most ticketed and least ticketed vehicles .
Most Ticketed Vehicle * Rate Hummer H2/H3 463 % Scion tC 460 % Scion XB 403 % Mercedes Benz CLK63 AMG 397 % Toyota Solara Coupe 306 % Mercedes Benz CLS63 AMG 276 % Scion XA 275 % Subaru Outback 266 % Audi A4 264 % Toyota Matrix 264 %
Least Ticketed Vehicle * Rate Jaguar XJ sedan 11 % Chevrolet Suburban 16 % Chevrolet Tahoe 21 % Chevrolet C/K- 3500/2500 pickup 28 % Buick Park Avenue 32 % Mazda6 34 % Buick Rainier 37 % Oldsmobile Silhouette 37 % Buick Lucerne 40 % GMC Sierra C1500 pickup 40 %
* = Violations per 100,000 miles driven , expressed as percentage of average .
" The sense of power that Hummer drivers derive from their vehicle may be directly correlated with the number of violations they incur , " said Raj Bhat , the president of ISO Quality Planning .
" Or perhaps Hummer drivers , by virtue of their driving position , are less likely to notice road hazards , signs , pedestrians and other drivers . "
" Click It or Ticket " Texas
According to national statistics , about 63 % of people killed in a crash were not wearing a seat belt .
Seat belts are your best protection in a car crash .
They save approximately 13 , 000 lives in the United States each year and continue to be the most effective tool in reducing injuries during a car crash .
The law of inertia states that an object in motion will continue to stay in motion until something else stops it .
Imagine that you are driving at a steady 50 mph .
At this point , your speed and the car ’s speed are pretty much the same .
Now , imagine if the car were to crash into a tree .
The tree would stop the car ’s motion , but you would keep moving forward at the same speed .
If you are not wearing a seat belt during a car crash , you would have to either hit the steering wheel or go through the windshield at 50 mph before your motion would slow down .
This could instantly kill or severely injure you .
If you are wearing a seatbelt in a car crash , the seat belt will act as the stopping force and allow your body to slow down .
It prevents you from flying forward and being ejected from the vehicle .
Most states , including Texas , have enacted the Primary Seat Belt Law , which allows an officer to give you a ticket just for not wearing a seat belt .

Most Common Reasons for Issuing Traffic Tickets
A Texas law firm has listed some of the most common laws from the Texas Transportation Code that Texas police use to issue traffic tickets .
Sec. 545.351 - MAXIMUM SPEED REQUIREMENT
Sec. 545.352 - PRIMA FACIE SPEED LIMITS
Sec. 544.010 - STOP SIGNS AND YIELD SIGNS
Sec. 545.157 - PASSING AUTHORIZED EMERGENCY VEHICLE
Sec. 548.602 - FAILURE TO DISPLAY INSPECTION CERTIFICATE
Sec. 548.605 - DISMISSAL OF CHARGE ; ADMINISTRATIVE FEE
Sec. 601.051 - REQUIREMENT
OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Sec. 601.191 - OPERATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE IN VIOLATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIREMENT
( See law details )
Total Licensed Drivers
Below is a recent list of the top ten states with the most licensed drivers .
Texas is ranked second with almost 13.5 million licensed drivers .
State Amount California 22,657,288 Texas 13,498,071 Florida 12,905,813 New York 11,356,988 Pennsylvania 8,369,575 Illinois 8,054,232 Ohio 7,656,362 Michigan 7,065,438 North Carolina 6,014,782 Georgia 5,757,953

Revenue from Traffic Ticket Fines
An interesting fact about traffic tickets is that an average traffic cop generates an annual average revenue of $ 200,000 for the city - just from traffic ticket fines !
In Texas alone , the state 's top forty speed traps generated a total of $ 178,367,093 in speeding tickets from 2000 to 2008 .
Below are the top 10 states that are known for writing tickets :
Ohio Pennsylvania New York California Texas Georgia Virginia North Carolina Massachusetts Connecticut

During my recent trip to China I was fortunate enough to spend a few days in Shanghai .
Before I went to China , I promised Mikael Colville - Andersen that I would snap some photos of “ Cycle Chic ” action while biking around Shanghai .
Mikael popularized the term “ Cycle Chic ” in his blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic which he started 3 years ago .
The Cycle Chic movement has now spread across the globe – but unfortunately nobody has started a “ Shanghai Cycle Chic ” blog at the time of this writing ( The Urban Country is blocked within China , so the people of Shanghai wo n’t be able to view this post )
Cycle Chic means different things for different people .
To me , it ’s riding your bike in your regular clothes – be it your work clothes , your clubbing clothes , or your Sunday attire – whatever it is that you happen to be wearing .
It ’s about riding with style and without the requisite of any pretentious clothing or gear .
As evidenced in my recent article Utility Cycling in China , the bicycle is a tool in China that serves a useful purpose .
It gets people from A to B fast .
It ’s convenient to park , it ’s inexpensive and it ’s healthy .
The following photos illustrate how regular people in their regular attire use bicycles for transportation in Shanghai :
Happiness is in the air :
KumoFS , a database success story
blog.superfeedr.com:/oss/open-source/database/nosql/kumofs-a-database-success-story
Superfeedr is growing , and we want to add value for our clients .
Our newest feature requires us to store a lot of data , so we went out to look for appropriate solutions in the NoSQL ecosystem .
The first decision was Riak , featuring persistent storage on disk and a very tunable clustering layer .
The current use - case consists of simply pulling a feed from the database , extend it with the newest entries , and finally write it back for durability .
That ’s for about 30 feeds with 250 new 20 KB entries per second .
Unfortunately , Riak disappointed us .
The Basho guys approached us to offer help , but we were already fighting for days .
I was frustrated and slacked off to read tech news , which led me to discover the newly open - sourced KumoFS which advertises like this :
Extremely fast and scalable distributed key - value store .
Tokyo Cabinet backend and memcached protocol support .
The website looks promising and we decided to give it a shot .
Because our use - case is n’t complicated yet , and memcached client libraries exist plentifully , the whole switch was done in less than two hours .
And that ’s where the success story comes in : while Riak brought the whole machine to a grinding halt ( loadavg at 50 for hours ) , KumoFS chewed our data like a Kids Menu .
We were happy .
Well , you ca n’t have everything : when Riak thrashed the whole machine due to throughput , KumoFS fares much better , but the kumo - gateway and kumo - server processes were slowly growing their buffers .
Having these processes eating swap space before we can add machines to our cluster will be fatal for performance .
Our safety belt : ulimit -v .
Another itch were the missing concurrency controls .
KumoFS already uses vector clocks internally and supports the memcached binary protocol , so we filed a bug .
To our very pleasant surprise , it was quickly picked up the author , Furuhashi Sadayuki .
As of KumoFS 0.4.0 , we are now able use memcached ’s Compare & Swap mechanism .
When we read a key , we get its CAS value .
When we write to an existing key , we send that CAS value along .
If the key has been updated by another process , KumoFS responds with a conflict , and our code will retry the whole transaction .
No data is lost .
The concept is very common to NoSQL databases , it ’s called Optimistic Concurrency Control .
KumoFS still has few documentation , and we have n’t played much with clustering yet .
But so far , it is making us so happy that we are seriously beginning to consider it for replacement to some of our Redis servers which has high memory requirements ( at least for sorted sets ) , and client - side sharding becomes cumbersome when you have heterogeneous clients .

Chinese web users already have to register to enter internet cafes China is considering forcing its citizens to use their real names when they post comments on internet bulletin boards .
The suggestion came from Wang Chen , head of the government 's information office , at a meeting of senior Chinese leaders .
If introduced , the measure could strengthen the government 's control over what people say on the internet .
China already exerts a strong hold over how its citizens use the internet , control that it is seeking to extend .
The government has amended the state secrets law to force internet firms to help track down those suspected of criminal activity .
State secrets
Mr Wang made his comments at a meeting of the standing committee of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , China 's parliament .
" The government will further strengthen the basic administration of the internet and actively implement a real - name system , " he said .
In China ... if you surrender your anonymity you put yourself in political peril
Internet commentator Kaiser Kuo Mr Wang said government departments were looking at how new technology could be used to make this system work .
The Chinese government has long been keen to link internet comments to the people who are making them .
Some online chatrooms already require those posting comments to register with a name , although users often type in pseudonyms .
And internet cafes are required to record details from people 's identity cards before they are allowed to use a computer .
Mr Wang did not give a timetable for the implementation of the real - name system , but it is clear the government is interested in tightening its hold on the flow of information on the internet .
It recently amended the Law on Guarding State Secrets so that internet operators are now obliged to pass on information to the police about possible violations of the regulation .
" Once a leak has been discovered , records should be kept and discoverers should report it to public and state security departments in charge of confidentiality , " said an article on the amended law run by China 's state - run Xinhua news agency .
China 's voices of dissent China believes the amendments to the state secrets law will make the regulation more transparent , but not everyone agrees .
Sharon Hom , executive director of Human Rights in China ( HRIC ) , said the revised law had " strengthened the powerful and all - encompassing net around information flow " .
Mr Wang said the government wanted to introduce the real - name system in order to monitor the spread of " harmful information " .
But many suspect that the real aim is to place further limits on how China 's 400 million internet users communicate on the web .
The government already blocks its citizens from sensitive websites or certain information , and tries to manipulate online debate by employing teams of internet commentators .
Chinese blogger and journalist Michael Anti said : " This is nothing more than a political slogan from the government because it would be too expensive and complicated to introduce .
The government is just trying to terrorise people . "
' Political peril '
Other bloggers say using their real names will make little difference - but only because they already know they can be found and so self - censor .
Governments are born to be criticised
Blogger Cher En " Whatever you write online , there are ways the police can track you down , even without the real - name system , " said media commentator Jia Jia .
China is not the only country around the world where the anonymity on the internet has become an issue .
" There is a case to be made against it because people tend to hide behind anonymity , " said internet commentator Kaiser Kuo .
But in China , where the freedom to express opinions is severely curtailed , that could cause problems .
" In China this has a different dimension because if you surrender your anonymity you put yourself in political peril , " Mr Kuo added .
In the past , China has prosecuted activists for writing critical articles that appeared online .
Activist Hu Jia was sentenced to three - and - a - half years in prison in 2008 for subversion , in part because of comments that appeared online .
Many people are already wary about expressing their own views online .
Adding their real names would undoubtedly make many of them less likely to comment freely .
But not everybody said they would be cowed .
" Governments are born to be criticised , " said Chen Er , who blogs under the name Doubleaf .
" Many people are afraid of causing trouble , but I 'm not . "

CODEWEAVERS LAUNCHES CROSSOVER GAMES 9.0 AMID MASSIVE DISTRACTION OF " IRON MAN 2 " THEATRICAL RELEASE
CEO Forced to Emulate Whiplash 's Electric Whips to Ensure Release on Deadline ; Supports New Steam UI , Improves Functionality and Code Sharing
SAINT PAUL , Minn . ( May 12 , 2010 ) – Despite the massive distraction of this weekend 's theatrical release of Iron Man 2 , CodeWeavers , Inc. , a leading developer of software products that turn Mac OS X and Linux into Windows - compatible operating systems , today announces it has completed the development of CrossOver Games 9.0 for both Mac and Linux .
CrossOver Games allows Windows games to be used on Mac and Linux PCs without the need for a Windows operating system license .
Available beginning today for download at www.CodeWeavers.com , CrossOver Games 9.0 :
supports the new Steam UI ; and ,
StarCraft 2 ( beta ) and Star Trek Online ; and
enables users to install games from a single screen and a single click on CodeWeavers ' compatibility center .
Historically , CodeWeavers programmers complete a software upgrade with a straight 96 - hour burn fueled by Red Bull , Twizzlers and vending machine pretzels .
The release of CrossOver Games 9.0 marks the first time CodeWeavers launched a new version of its software amidst the release of a blockbuster summer film , which typically grinds production to a halt as CodeWeavers programmers camp outside the theater for three days to secure the best seats on opening night .
" It 's corporate policy that we schedule our software releases during weak spots in the movie calendar .
Early Fall .
Late Winter .
Like , when a Meryl Streep film comes out , " said Jeremy White , CodeWeavers chief executive officer .
" What can I say ?
I screwed up .
I got confused .
I forgot about Iron Man 2 .
" Hence the anomaly for this week 's release of CrossOver Games 9.0 , which also enables gamers to download installation ' recipes ' directly from the CodeWeavers online Compatibility Database , located at C4.codeweavers.com , " White added .
" If another CrossOver Games user figures out how to use CrossOver to install a Windows - compatible game , he can upload this installation recipe to our database .
For gamers using windows , that means they can switch to Mac or Linux without much worry .
" Our programmers were enraged at the scheduling conflict , though many snuck out late Friday afternoon to catch – spoiler alert here – Iron Man take down Whiplash , " White said .
To ensure programmers continued working Saturday and Sunday without break , White created a makeshift " electric whip " to emulate Mickey Rourke 's character 's weapon of choice .
" Essentially , it was 48 strands of 28 - inch stripped coax cables sewn into the fingers of an Ace Hardware work glove , " White said .
" I walked around cubes in our office screaming ' full Steam ahead , minions ! ' in a mediocre Russian accent while swinging the whip .
It worked , more or less . "
" At around 9 a .m .
Sunday morning while quietly writing code at my desk , White 's whip snagged me just below the groin on my left leg , " said Jon Parshall , chief operating officer at CodeWeavers .
" Ugh .
Fourteen stitches plus the pitiful sight of a grown man writhing on the floor in his own pool of blood , " White said .
" Hopefully sales of CrossOver Games 9.0 will help pay his medical bills . "
CrossOver Games 9.0 is download - only and can be purchased for $ 39.95 at www.CodeWeavers.com.

Just two more pages of Lookouts to go , and here is the first of them .
This is the fantasy equivalent of the bonus round , where all points are doubled , and the penalties for failure become progressively more grim .
After the release of Doom but before we understood exactly what had happened , what we know as “ first person shooters ” were generally called Doom Clones .
You hear the term “ DOTA Clone ” quite often these days , in reference to games like Demigod , but I think that ultimately we ’ll observe a similar arc : that DOTA ‘s weird gumbo constitues something unique .
It gets to ideas about “ genre ” that I do n’t have absolute answers to .
I ’m leaning toward the idea of malleability , the idea that a genre is something that can be shaped while still retaining its essential character .
Plus , I mean , metallurgy .
I ’m going to spend the rest of my post trying to work in the word “ alloy . ”
This is something I was thinking about when I asked to visit Uber Entertainment last week .
They ’re about twenty - one minutes away in good traffic , practically a stone ’s throw from Bungie , and I ’ve been obsessed with their debut title since I saw it at PAX .
More than half of this team worked on Demigod , which was itself called a DOTA clone , but the teeth of that aspersion are pretty worn down by this point .
You hear the term MOBA used to describe them sometimes - MOBA being a distillation of Multiplayer Online Battle Area , which is about as robust and descriptive as “ videogame ” - but I ’m not entirely certain the term will last .
Part of what complicates things is that DOTA is , itself , an alloy ( BAM ! ) - though “ mashup ” might be better .
And , in the way of the best mashups , its canny juxtapositions have a way of revealing their source material .
It ’s an Action RPG with fidgety RTS gameplay , where players are dropped smack - dab into a round of Tower Defense .
It really does n’t give a shit about your genres .
Just the same , its feel is distinct , and can be discerned .
When you see Monday Night Combat in operation , it ’s impossible not to understand what I mean .
It ’s a “ third person shooter , ” because you see your character and they shoot .
But coursing in magic rivers below that superstructure are the lanes , bases , and progression you ’d see in DOTA , HoN , or LoL .
I can run the executable for any of those three games and instinctively recognize that I am on holy ground , mechanically speaking .
But the deeper verbs of real - time strategy games have always evaded me .
I know the nouns .
I know what everything is , and I know how they relate to everything else .
But games of this type trade on extremely tight micro , a feat I ’ve never truly come to grips with .
The best I can do is appreciate them from behind glass while they whirl there in their mystery , singing in the manner of fine crystal .
What ’s happened with Monday Night Combat is that someone has finally married those manifest virtues to a genre I can actually play .

The recent arrests of 44 people on charges of organ trafficking have exposed a major criminal market in illegal organ transplants , where wealthy patients purchase organs from poor Third World residents through brokers residing in the United States .
"
In India , China , Africa and Latin America the poor are selling their kidneys to wealthy buyers through an underground set of networks , " said Steven Post of Stony Brook University .
" The donors make enough money to buy a house or put their kids through college and the doctors do the transplants overseas , in India for example , at perfectly legitimate hospitals , where nobody cares about the buying and selling of organs , " he said .
In other cases , transplants take place at U.S. hospitals -- as in the case of an organ smuggling network that flew poor Moldavian organ donors into the country on fake student or tourist visas and took them directly to hospitals for illegal transplants .
Among the people arrested in July was Levy Rosenbaum , who Nancy Schepper - Hughes described as " the man to go to in New York " for an illicit organ transplant .
Rosenbaum allegedly boasted to undercover law enforcement agents that he had been trafficking in organs for 10 years , making between $ 150,000 and $ 180,000 per kidney .
Organ donors in countries such as India are typically paid between $ 2,000 and $ 10,000 for a kidney .
In a transplant ring recently broken up in Gurgaon , India , four doctors and five nurses had transplanted more than 400 kidneys at three hospitals over the past nine years , paying donors only $ 1,000 per organ .
A shortage in organs for donation -- the U.S. waiting list for kidneys has more than 80,000 names on it -- has led to a huge demand for cheap black market organs .
The so - called " kidney mafia " includes doctors performing illegal transplants , organ hunters searching for donors , and middleman brokers such as Rosenbaum who match recipients with doctors and donors .

I ’m a little baffled by this angle with Anderson and Hardy .
Part of me thinks that this is all a ploy and Anderson is actually up to some big trick to lull Hardy in and then attack him later , but I ’m not certain .
It seems like now things are all okay between them , but we ’ll see what happens around Slammiversary .
Brother Ray and Jesse Neal ’s rivalry just went to the next level with the challenge for Slammiversary .
The story I ’m intrigued by is the relationship now between Ray and Devon .
How are they going to co-exist when Ray flies off the handle like he has been the last few shows ?
Could this be leading up to the end of Team 3D ?
AJ Styles and Kazarian are looking like they ’re fighting for the attention of Ric Flair .
I do n’t know how much this can do for the Flair camp , but I ’m hoping that it ends up with a great match between the two high fliers !
I ’m wondering when they ’re going to talk more about what ’s going on with Samoa Joe …
He was kidnapped about 3 months ago , and they ’ve never acknowledged where he was or what happened to him .
I ’m wondering if this has to do with the fact that either Matt Morgan was involved , or that TNA creative is totally incompetent and did n’t know where to go with it , so it ’s being dropped and forgotten about entirely ?
Gunmen have launched simultaneous raids on two mosques of the minority Ahmadi Islamic sect in Lahore , killing more than 80 people , Pakistani police say .
The attackers fired guns and threw grenades at worshippers during Friday prayers .
Three militants later blew themselves up with suicide vests .
Pakistani forces have secured both buildings , but are still searching for militants who fled the scene .
Lahore has been the scene of a string of brazen attacks .
It is unclear who carried out the attacks , but suspicion has fallen on the Pakistani Taliban , Ali Dayan Hassan of Human Rights Watch told the BBC .
Mr Hassan said the worshippers were " easy targets " for militant Sunni groups who consider the Ahmadis to be infidels .
Suicide vests
Police said several attackers held people hostage briefly inside the mosque in the heavily built - up Garhi Shahu area .
AT THE SCENE
The attackers shot anyone who moved , according to survivors like Syed Rashid Rahim , a lawyer we interviewed at the hospital .
He survived three hours trapped in the mosque , and three bullet wounds .
The hardest thing to bear , he said , was the brutal killing of a boy aged 13 or 14 , which happened in front of his eyes .
His father was behind him , sheltering behind a column .
He asked him for water and the son was offering him water .
While he was drinking , these two people came in and they shot him point blank .
" I can not forget that , " he said , fighting back tears .
" I thought they would spare him , but they did not . "
Some took up positions on top of the minarets , and fired assault rifles at police engaged in gunfights with militants below .
Three of the attackers blew themselves up with suicide vests packed with explosives when police tried to enter the mosque , officials said .
Police were searching for at least two militants who managed to flee the scene .
Police took control of the other mosque in the nearby Model Town area after a two - hour gunfight .
Gunmen opened fire indiscriminately at the mosque , before security forces managed to kill one militant and capture two others , eyewitnesses told the BBC .
They were said to be armed with AK - 47 rifles , shotguns and grenades .
Persecuted minority
Sectarian attacks have been carried out by various militant groups in Punjab province , and across Pakistan in the past .
While the Ahmadis consider themselves Muslim and follow all Islamic rituals , they were declared non-Muslim in Pakistan in 1973 , and in 1984 they were legally barred from proselytising or identifying themselves as Muslims .
WHO ARE THE AHMADIS ?
A minority Islamic sect founded in 1889 , Ahmadis believe their own founder , Mirza Ghulam Ahmad , who died in 1908 , was a prophet
This is anathema to most Muslims who believe the last prophet was Muhammad , who died in 632
Most Ahmadi followers live in the Indian subcontinent
Ahmadis have been the subject of sectarian attacks and persecution in Pakistan and elsewhere
In 1974 the Pakistani government declared the sect non-Muslim Who are the Ahmadis ?
In pictures : Lahore attacks Analysis : Soft target for militants Eyewitness : Mosque attack
Members of the community have often been mobbed , or gunned down in targeted attacks , says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad .
But this is the first time their places of worship have suffered daring and well co-ordinated attacks that bear the mark of Taliban militants , our correspondent adds .
The London - based Ahmadi association said the attacks were the culmination of years of " unpoliced persecution " against the Ahmadis .
" Today 's attack is the most cruel and barbaric , " the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community UK said in a statement .
The Chief Minister of Pakistan 's Punjab province , Shahbaz Sharif , expressed " heartfelt sorrow " over the killings .
" No condemnation , however strong , will be enough for these incidents , " he said .
US state department spokesman Philip Crowley said Washington also condemned the " brutal violence against innocent people " .

What do we learn from the New York Times in the article below ?
Some legal authorities are deeply uneasy about the U.S. Government ’s arbitrary assassination of Americans .
That is supposed to soothe us , I think .
We can rest assured that someone feels deeply uneasy about the government murdering its own citizens .
I do n’t know about you , but I feel better already .
* phew *
But read on , and what we find is that , actually , the drone atrocities are n’t so bad because only a “ few dozen nearby civilians ” were killed in attacks that killed “ hundreds ” of militants .
The source for these figures ?
“ Counterterrorism officials . ”
That ’s ok .
The sensible , Volvo driving Democrats who subscribe to the New York Times know that you ’ve gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet .
It is helpful to know that people feel uneasy about all of this anyway .
Deeply uneasy , I mean .
Maybe the “ counterterrorism officials ” meant that only dozens of civilians had been killed in about a day ’s worth of botched drone attacks ?
And since Barry cracks wise about it , so what :
On June 22 , the US struck at a house officials called a “ suspected militant hideout , ” burying a few locals inside .
When others rushed to the scene to rescue them , they launched another missile , killing 13 apparently innocent Pakistanis .
When they held a funeral procession on June 23 , the US hit that too , ostensibly on the belief that Baitullah Mehsud might be among the mourners .
He was n’t , but the attack killed at least 80 more people .
Next , we learn that communications intercepts on Americans are subject to legal restrictions .
Ah , that ’s nice .
Let ’s go to Starbucks and read the rest of the New York Times there .
Intercept programs that are publicly acknowledged have legal restrictions .
What about black world intercept programs ?
Perhaps the New York Times forgot about Mark Klein and the secret NSA rooms inside the telecom carriers ’ facilities .
What legal protections are in place for the millions of Americans who are targeted by MAIN CORE ?
“ The Gray Lady ” shrugs its shoulders and thinks , “ I do n’t deal with conspiracy theories . ”
Surely , all of the information on Americans that will be stored in the NSA ’s newly built data centers ( three million square feet worth ) will have been collected with court issued warrants .
Mmm hmm .
Oh well , at least the main point is there :
The outlaw U.S. regime arbitrarily murders Americans with terminator robots .
Here it is with sugar on top .
Via : New York Times :
The Obama administration ’s decision to authorize the killing by the Central Intelligence Agency of a terrorism suspect who is an American citizen has set off a debate over the legal and political limits of drone missile strikes , a mainstay of the campaign against terrorism .
The notion that the government can , in effect , execute one of its own citizens far from a combat zone , with no judicial process and based on secret intelligence , makes some legal authorities deeply uneasy .
To eavesdrop on the terrorism suspect who was added to the target list , the American - born radical cleric Anwar al - Awlaki , who is hiding in Yemen , intelligence agencies would have to get a court warrant .
But designating him for death , as C.I.A. officials did early this year with the National Security Council ’s approval , required no judicial review .
“ Congress has protected Awlaki ’s cellphone calls , ” said Vicki Divoll , a former C.I.A. lawyer who now teaches at the United States Naval Academy .
“ But it has not provided any protections for his life .
That makes no sense . ”
Administration officials take the view that no legal or constitutional rights can protect Mr. Awlaki , a charismatic preacher who has said it is a religious duty to attack the United States and who the C.I.A. believes is actively plotting violence .
The attempted bombing of Times Square on May 1 is the latest of more than a dozen terrorist plots in the West that investigators believe were inspired in part by Mr. Awlaki ’s rhetoric .
“ American citizenship does n’t give you carte blanche to wage war against your own country , ” said a counterterrorism official who discussed the classified program on condition of anonymity .
“ If you cast your lot with its enemies , you may well share their fate . ”
President Obama , who campaigned for the presidency against George W. Bush - era interrogation and detention practices , has implicitly invited moral and legal scrutiny of his own policies .
But like the debate over torture during the Bush administration , public discussion of what officials call targeted killing has been limited by the secrecy of the C.I.A. drone program .
Representative John F. Tierney , who on April 28 held the first Congressional hearing focused on the lawfulness of targeted killing , said he was determined to air the contentious questions publicly and possibly seek legislation to govern such operations .
The reported targeting of Mr. Awlaki “ certainly raises the question of what rights a citizen has and what steps must be taken before he ’s put on the list , ” said Mr. Tierney , Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of a House subcommittee on national security .
Counterterrorism officials , with the support of Democrats and Republicans in Congress , say the drone missile strikes have proved to be an extraordinarily successful weapon against militants in the tribal areas of Pakistan , the location of all the known C.I.A. strikes except one in Yemen in 2002 .
By their count , the missiles have killed more than 500 militants since 2008 , and a few dozen nearby civilians .
In the fullest administration statement to date , Harold Koh , the State Department ’s legal adviser , said in a March 24 speech the drone strikes against Al Qaeda and its allies were lawful as part of the military action authorized by Congress after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , as well as under the general principle of self - defense .
By those rules , he said , such targeted killing was not assassination , which is banned by executive order .
Give Up , Robot
What purpose does a flash game serve ?
Something to kill a few minutes while you decide if you should stay at work or go home early ?
Sounds about right .
Flash games rather than their full on , disc - based counter - parts are able to rely on only one or two types of gameplay gimmicks without getting too repetitive .
In indie game developer Matt Thorson ’s latest release , Give Up , Robot , these objectives are met and used to their fullest .
Give Up , Robot has quite the simple premise :
You are a robot with a grappling hook ala Bionic Commando and an all - encompassing desire to jump and swing your way to the next level .
Following you throughout the game is the antagonizing , disembodied voice of another robot that wishes you to fail .
While that may sound a bit disheartening , the voice is generally pretty funny and even when you start dying over and over again , is easy to tune out .
The level design of Give Up , Robot is smart and intuitive .
The gameplay consists of fast - paced , one - off levels that throw some new mechanic or small puzzle at you .
They start quite simple , but soon can be pretty frustrating .
Since each level is mainly one jump or one quick sequence though , and you have infinite lives , it ’s easy to keep trying without throwing the keyboard against the wall .
The look of each level , with bright flashing colors is like playing through a discotheque made out of Rubik ’s cubes .
Since the game is meant to be played in quick doses the heavy color saturation makes it punchy and fun .
Playing for extended periods though , can end up getting a little tiring to watch .
The music lends itself well to the concept of the game with fun , techno beats throughout .
Overall , an enjoyable experience , brain and eye candy operating near the highest levels of a flash game .

The FCC on Friday announced it would extend the time during which the public may comment on the proposed NBC - Comcast mega-merger so that the Philadelphia - based cable giant can submit additional materials .
Initially , the commission hoped to wrap up the initial public comment phase by May 3 , and it had explicitly turned down an earlier request by public interest groups to extend the deadline by 45 days .

However , the FCC had to renege on its tight timeframe Friday , after it learned Comcast would not be able to submit two crucial documents regarding the deal 's effects on consumers with enough time for interested persons and groups to respond .
The commission thus revised its deadline to " ensure that all parties will have sufficient time to review and comment on the applications , including these supplemental materials , " according to the order issued Friday .
The commission has not yet set a new , hard deadline , but it did say the date would occur 45 days after Comcast submits its reports .
Comcast , too , did not specify when it would turn its materials over to the FCC , though a spokesperson promised the company would work dilligently to complete the reports soon .
" We know they want to conduct a thorough and expeditious review of this transaction and we ’ll be submitting these reports as soon as possible , " Comcast noted in a statement .
" We understand and agree in this case with the Commission ’s desire to have a full comment period on key documents submitted by the applicants . ”
Friday 's order has the dual effect of satisfying interest groups -- including Free Press , Consumers Union and Public Knowledge - as well as a growing number of congressional lawmakers , who together asked for an extension so that they could study and respond to the mega - merger .
The debate over the deadline grew so intense last week that Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Calif . ) even introduced legislation that would have forced the FCC to extend its public comment deadline by 45 days .
But while it had the support of 49 other House members , mostly those in the Congressional Black Caucus , it probably would have taken the bill from now until May 3 to even reach the House floor .
The publication late last year of Buddhist Warfare , the book I coedited with sociologist and religious studies scholar Mark Juergensmeyer , was a bittersweet experience .
It marked the culmination of a journey that began with an exploration of the peaceful aspects of Buddhism — only to end up chronicling portions of its dark side .
The journey began in 2003 when my wife and I spent a year in Thailand .
I was there to research Buddhist social activism , which was going to be the topic of my dissertation .
Rather than look to archives , I decided to speak with Buddhist monks and nuns .
I interviewed monks protecting the forests from big business and villagers from dangerous pesticides .
I spoke with Thai Buddhist monastic intellectuals .
I met and began to chronicle the activities of the first fully ordained Thai Buddhist nun .
Then , in January 2004 , violent attacks broke out in the southern provinces of Thailand , some of them directed at Buddhist monks .
Since contemporary issues and my research seemed to be converging , I thought :
What better way to study Buddhist activism than to observe Buddhist monks engaged in peace­making ?
Unfortunately , I found very little of this .
During my visits between 2006 and 2008 , southern
Thai monks shared with me the challenges of living in fear - infested communities .
All but a few concentrated on survival .
- Advertisement -
Peacemaking was the last thing on their minds .
The constant fear and violence took a toll on them .
Monks talked about the guns they now kept at their bedsides .
Others spoke heatedly about the violent militant attacks on Buddhist civilians and monasteries .
Although the cause of the violence was and is multilayered — owing much to corruption , drug trade , and corporatization — many monks also felt Islam was to blame .
In their minds , the conflict was anchored to a larger discussion of religious violence : Muslims against Buddhists .
“ ‘ Metropolis ’ is the most iconic silent picture of its day , mainly because of the visual ambition and virtuosity of the film itself , ” said Noah Isenberg , editor of “ Weimar Cinema , ” a book about early German films , and a professor of film and literary studies at the New School .
“ But until now , we did n’t have the full story .
These additions are really essential to understanding the full arc of the narrative . ”
Image A scene from the newly recovered footage of Fritz Lang 's 1927 “ Metropolis . ” Credit ... Kino International
Made at a time of hyperinflation in Germany , “ Metropolis ” offered a grandiose version  of a father and son fighting for the soul of a futuristic city  that nearly bankrupted the studio that commissioned it , UFA .
After lukewarm reviews and initial box office results in Europe , Paramount Pictures , the American partner brought in toward the end of the shoot , took control of the film and made drastic excisions , arguing that Lang ’s cut was too complicated and unwieldy for American audiences to understand .
Mr. Peña discovered a full - length copy of “ Metropolis ” in 2008 in the archives of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires .
He had first heard stories 20 years earlier that a two - and - a - half - hour print had somehow found its way to Argentina and was wandering from one government institution to another , but his efforts to gain access to the film cans had always been frustrated by an indifferent bureaucracy .
Since the 1930s , the full - length version of “ Metropolis ” had been part of a large private archive assembled by a prominent Argentine film critic , Manuel Peña Rodríguez , who would lend titles to local film clubs .
At his death around 1970 , the collection was donated to the Argentine version of the National Endowment of the Arts , which handed it off to the Museo del Cine in 1992 .
Over the years , Mr. Peña had shared his frustrations at not being given access to the film with Paula Félix - Didier , another film archivist and , during the 1990s , his wife .
When she became head of the Museo del Cine in 2008 , she said , “ I called Fernando and said , ‘ Just come , let ’s do it . ’
So he came , we looked for the cans , and there they were , cataloged and up on a shelf . ”
If you are learning to meditate , this is a terrific “ short course ” in the basics of mindfulness .
If you ’re an experienced meditator , this dharma talk by Ajahn Chah is a great refresher .
( This is a revision of an earlier post called “ How Confident Are You About Your Meditation Practice ? ” )
This excerpt come from “ The Teachings of Ajahn Chah ” and is based on a talk on mindfulness of breathing given in 1979 at the Insight Meditation Center at Barre , MA .
This talk can also be found in Being Dharma : The Essence of The Buddha ’s Teaching .
I have been re-reading this book recently , and was once again struck by the simplicity and power of Ajahn Chah ’s dharma teaching .
In this talk in particular , I was especially helped by Ajahn Chah ’s emphasis on how sīla ( morality ) , samādhi ( concentration ) , and paññā ( wisdom ) are absolutely indispensable to our practice and actually combine as one in the Path to Awakening .
None is more important than the other ; rather , as Ajahn Chah explains , they mutually reinforce each other , developing a synergy that none alone can produce .
This talk is especially helpful to those beginning in meditation practice , because this master teacher takes us step - by - step through the stages of mindfulness , pointing out pitfalls and offering encouragement along the way .
May this skillful teaching lead you to Awakening and the happiness that is deathless !
Are You Confident About Your Meditation Practice ?
Talk by Ajahn Chah
“ I would like to ask you about your practice .
You have all been practising meditation here , but are you sure about the practice yet ?
Ask yourselves , are you confident about the practice yet ?
These days there are all sorts of meditation teachers around , both monks and lay teachers , and I ’m afraid it will cause you to be full of doubts and uncertainty about what you are doing .
This is why I am asking .
As far as Buddhist practice is concerned , there is really nothing greater or higher than these teachings of the Buddha which you have been practising with here .
If you have a clear understanding of them , it will give rise to an absolutely firm and unwavering peace in your heart and mind .
Making the mind peaceful is known as practising meditation , or practising samādhi ( concentration ) .
The mind is something which is extremely changeable and unreliable .
Observing from your practice so far , have you seen this yet ?
Some days you sit meditation and in no time at all the mind is calm , others , you sit and whatever you do there ’s no calm — the mind constantly struggling to get away , until it eventually does .
Some days it goes well , some days it ’s awful .
This is the way the mind displays these different conditions for you to see .
You must understand that the eight factors of the Noble Eight - fold Path ( ariya magga ) merge in sīla ( moral restraint ) , samādhi ( concentration ) , and paññā ( wisdom ) .
They do n’t come together anywhere else .
This means that when you bring the factors of your practice together , there must be sīla , there must be samādhi and there must be paññā present together in the mind .
It means that in practising meditation right here and now , you are creating the causes for the Path to Awakening arise in a very direct way .
Step One : Developing Concentration of the Breath
In sitting meditation you are usually taught to close your eyes , so that you do n’t spend your time looking at different things .
This is because the Buddha was teaching that you should know your own mind .
Observe the mind .
If you close your eyes , your attention will naturally be turned inwards towards the mind — the source of many different kinds of knowledge .
This is a way of training the mind to give rise to samādhi .
Once sitting with the eyes closed , establish awareness with the breath — make awareness of the breath more important than anything else .
This means you bring awareness to follow the breath , and by keeping with it , you will know that place which is the focal point of sati ( mindfulness ) , the focal point of the knowing and the focal point of the mind ’s awareness .
Whenever these factors of the path are working together , you will be able to watch and see your breath , feelings , mind and ārammana ( mind - objects ) , as they are in the present moment .
Ultimately , you will know that place which is both the focal point of samādhi and the unification point of the path factors .
When developing samādhi , fix attention on the breath and imagine that you are sitting alone with absolutely no other people and nothing else around to bother you .
Develop this perception in the mind , sustaining it until the mind completely lets go of the world outside and all that is left is simply the knowing of the breath entering and leaving .
The mind must set aside the external world .
Do n’t allow yourself to start thinking about this person who is sitting over here , or that person who is sitting over there .
Do n’t give space to any thoughts that will give rise to confusion or agitation in the mind — it ’s better to throw them out and be done with them .
There is no one else here , you are sitting all alone .
Develop this perception until all the other memories , perceptions and thoughts concerning other people and things subside , and you ’re no longer doubting or wandering about the other people or things around you .
Then you can fix your attention solely on the in - breaths and out - breaths .
Breathe normally .
Allow the in - breaths and the out - breaths to continue naturally , without forcing them to be longer or shorter , stronger or weaker than normal .
Allow the breath to continue in a state of normality and balance , and then sit and observe it entering and leaving the body .
Once the mind has let go of external mind - objects , it means you will no longer feel disturbed by the sound of traffic or other noises .
You wo n’t feel irritated with anything outside .
Whether it ’s forms , sounds or whatever , they wo n’t be a source of disturbance , because the mind wo n’t be paying attention to them – it will become centered upon the breath .
If the mind is agitated by different things and you can’t concentrate , try taking an extra - deep breath until the lungs are completely full , and then release all the air until there is none left inside .
Do this several times , then re-establish awareness and continue to develop concentration .
Having re-established mindfulness , it ’s normal that for a period the mind will be calm , then change and become agitated again .
When this happens , make the mind firm , take another deep breath and subsequently expel all the air from your lungs .
Fill the lungs to capacity again for a moment and then re-establish mindfulness on the breathing .
Fix sati ( mindfulness ) on the in - breaths and the out - breaths , and continue to maintain awareness in this way .
The practice tends to be this way , so it will have to take many sittings and much effort before you become proficient .
Once you are , the mind will let go of the external world and remain undisturbed .
Mind - objects from the outside will be unable to penetrate inside and disturb the mind itself .
Once they are unable to penetrate inside , you will see the mind .
You will see the mind as one object of awareness , the breath as another and mind - objects as another .
They will all be present within the field of awareness , centered at the tip of your nose .
Once sati ( mindfulness ) is firmly established with the in - breaths and out - breaths , you can continue to practise at your ease .
As the mind becomes calm , the breath , which was originally coarse , correspondingly becomes lighter and more refined .
The object of mind also becomes increasingly subtle and refined .
The body feels lighter and the mind itself feels progressively lighter and unburdened .
The mind lets go of external mind - objects and you continue to observe internally .
Step Two : Focusing Awareness Inward
From here onwards your awareness will be turned away from the world outside and is directed inwards to focus on the mind .
Once the mind has gathered together and become concentrated , maintain awareness at that point where the mind becomes focused .
As you breathe , you will see the breath clearly as it enters and leaves , sati ( mindfulness ) will be sharp and awareness of mind - objects and mental activity will be clearer .
At that point you will see the characteristics of sīla , samādhi and paññā and the way in which they merge together .
This is known as the unification of the Path factors .
Once this unification occurs , your mind will be free from all forms of agitation and confusion .
It will become one - pointed and this is what is known as samādhi .
When you focus attention in just one place , in this case the breath , you gain a clarity and awareness because of the uninterrupted presence of sati .
As you continue to see the breath clearly , sati will become stronger and the mind will become more sensitive in many different ways .
You will see the mind in the centre of that place ( the breath ) , one - pointed with awareness focused inwards , rather than turning towards the world outside .
The external world gradually disappears from your awareness and the mind will no longer be going to perform any work on the outside .
It ’s as if you ’ve come inside your “ house , ” where all your sense faculties have come together to form one compact unit .
You are at your ease and the mind is free from all external objects .
Awareness remains with the breath and over time it will penetrate deeper and deeper inside , becoming progressively more refined .
Ultimately , awareness of the breath becomes so refined that the sensation of the breath seems to disappear .
You could say either that awareness of the sensation of the breath has disappeared , or that the breath itself has disappeared .
Then there arises a new kind of awareness – awareness that the breath has disappeared .
In other words , awareness of the breath becomes so refined that it ’s difficult to define it .
So it might be that you are just sitting there and there ’s no breath .
Really , the breath is still there , but it has become so refined that it seems to have disappeared .
Why ?
Because the mind is at its most refined , with a special kind of knowing .
All that remains is the knowing .
Even though the breath has vanished , the mind is still concentrated with the knowledge that the breath is not there .
As you continue , what should you take up as the object of meditation ?
Take this very knowing as the meditation object — in other words the knowledge that there is no breath — and sustain this .
You could say that a specific kind of knowledge has been established in the mind .
Step Three : Developing Unshakable Concentration
At this point , you might begin to doubt , because it is here that the visionary meditation experiences called nimitta can arise .
These can be of many kinds , including both forms and sounds .
It is here that all sorts of unexpected things can arise in the course of the practice .
If nimitta do arise — some people have them , some do n’t — you must understand them for what they are , meaning impermanent phenomena .
Do n’t doubt or allow yourself to become alarmed .
At this stage , you should make the mind unshakable in its concentration and be especially mindful .
Some people become startled when they notice that the breath has disappeared , because they ’re used to having the breath there .
When it appears that the breath has gone , you might panic or become afraid that you are going to die .
Here you must establish the understanding that it is just the nature of the practice to progress in this way .
What will you observe as the object of meditation now ?
Observe this feeling that there is no breath and sustain it as the object of awareness as you continue to meditate .
The Buddha described this as the firmest , most unshakable form of samādhi .
There is just one firm and unwavering object of mind .
When your practice of samādhi reaches this point , there will be many unusual and refined changes and transformations taking place within the mind , which you can be aware of .
The sensation of the body will feel at its lightest or might even disappear altogether .
You might feel like you are floating in mid-air and seem to be completely weightless .
It might be like you are in the middle of space and wherever you direct your sense faculties they do n’t seem to register anything at all .
Even though you know the body is still sitting there , you experience complete emptiness .
This feeling of emptiness can be quite strange .
As you continue to practise , understand that there is nothing to worry about .
Establish this feeling of being relaxed and unworried , securely in the mind .
Once the mind is concentrated and one - pointed , no mind - object will be able to penetrate or disturb it , and you will be able to sit like this for as long as you want .
You will be able to sustain concentration without any feelings of pain and discomfort .
Having developed samādhi to this level , you will be able to enter or leave it at will .
When you do leave it , it ’s at your ease and convenience .
You withdraw at your ease , rather than because you are feeling lazy , unenergetic or tired .
You withdraw from samādhi because it is the appropriate time to withdraw , and you come out of it at your will .
This is samādhi : you are relaxed and at your ease .
You enter and leave it without any problems .
The mind and heart are at ease .
If you genuinely have samādhi like this , it means that sitting meditation and entering samādhi for just thirty minutes or an hour will enable you to remain cool and peaceful for many days afterwards .
Experiencing the effects of samādhi like this for several days has a purifying effect on the mind — whatever you experience will become an object for contemplation .
This is where the practice really begins .
It ’s the fruit which arises as it matures .
Samādhi performs the function of calming the mind .
Samādhi performs one function , sīla performs one function , and paññā performs another function .
These characteristics which you are focusing attention on and developing in the practice are linked , forming a circle .
This is the way they manifest in the mind .
Paññā , samādhi and sīla , arise and mature from the same place .
Once the mind is calm , it will become progressively more restrained and composed due to the presence of paññā and the power of samādhi .
As the mind becomes more composed and refined , this gives rise to an energy which acts to purify i.
Greater purity of sīla facilitates the development of stronger and more refined samādhi , and this in turn supports the maturing of i .
They assist each other in this way .
Each aspect of the practice acts as a supporting factor for each other one — in the end these terms becoming synonymous .
Step Four : The Arising of Insight
As these three factors continue to mature together , they form one complete circle , ultimately giving rise to Magga .
Magga is a synthesis of these three functions of the practice working smoothly and consistently together .
As you practise , you have to preserve this energy .
It is the energy which will give rise to vipassana ( insight ) or paññā .
Having reached this stage ( where paññā is already functioning in the mind , independent of whether the mind is peaceful or not ) paññā will provide a consistent and independent energy in the practice .
You see that whenever the mind is not peaceful , you should n’t attach , and even when it is peaceful , you should n’t attach .
Having let go of the burden of such concerns , the heart will accordingly feel much lighter .
Whether you experience pleasant mind - objects or unpleasant mind - objects , you will remain at ease .
The mind will remain peaceful in this way .
Another important thing is to see that when you stop doing the formal meditation practice , if there is no wisdom functioning in the mind , you will give up the practice altogether without any further contemplation , development of awareness or thought about the work which still has to be done .
In fact , when you withdraw from it , you know clearly in the mind that you have withdrawn .
Having withdrawn , continue to conduct yourself in a normal manner .
Maintain mindfulness and awareness at all times .
It is n’t that you only practise meditation in the sitting posture — samādhi means the mind which is firm and unwavering .
As you go about your daily life , make the mind firm and steady and maintain this sense of steadiness as the object of mind at all times .
You must be practising sati and sampajañña ( all round knowing ) continuously .
After you get up from the formal sitting practice and go about your business – walking , riding in cars and so on — whenever your eyes see a form or your ears hear a sound , maintain awareness .
As you experience mind - objects which give rise to liking and disliking , try to consistently maintain awareness of the fact that such mental states are impermanent and uncertain .
In this way the mind will remain calm and in a state of ‘ normality ’ .
As long as the mind is calm , use it to contemplate mind - objects .
Contemplate the whole of this form , the physical body .
You can do this at any time and in any posture : whether doing formal meditation practice , relaxing at home , out at work , or in whatever situation you find yourself .
Keep the meditation and the reflection going at all times .
Just going for a walk and seeing dead leaves on the ground under a tree can provide an opportunity to contemplate impermanence .
Both we and the leaves are the same : when we get old , we shrivel up and die .
Other people are all the same .
This is raising the mind to the level of vipassana , contemplating the truth of the way things are , the whole time .
Whether walking , standing , sitting or lying down , sati ( mindfulness ) is sustained evenly and consistently .
This is practising meditation correctly — you have to be following the mind closely , checking it at all times .
The Importance of Consistent Mindfulness
I ’ve often taught that if you do n’t practise consistently , it ’s like drops of water .
It ’s like drops of water because the practice is not a continuous , uninterrupted flow .
Sati ( mindfulness ) is not sustained evenly .
The important point is that the mind does the practice and nothing else .
The body does n’t do it .
The mind does the work , the mind does the practice .
If you understand this clearly , you will see that you do n’t necessarily have to do formal sitting meditation in order for the mind to know samādhi .
The mind is the one who does the practice .
You have to experience and understand this for yourself , in your own mind .
Once you do see this for yourself , you will be developing awareness in the mind at all times and in all postures .
If you are maintaining sati as an even and unbroken flow , it ’s as if the drops of water have joined to form a smooth and continuous flow of running water .
Sati is present in the mind from moment to moment and accordingly there will be awareness of mind - objects at all times .
If the mind is restrained and composed with uninterrupted sati , you will know mind - objects each time that wholesome and unwholesome mental states arise .
You will know the mind that is calm and the mind that is confused and agitated .
Wherever you go you will be practising like this .
If you train the mind in this way , it means your meditation will mature quickly and successfully .
Please do n’t misunderstand .
These days it ’s common for people to go on vipassana courses for three or seven days , where they do n’t have to speak or do anything but meditate .
Maybe you have gone on a silent meditation retreat for a week or two , afterwards returning to your normal daily life .
You might have left thinking that you ’ve “ done vipassana ” and , because you feel that you know what it ’s all about , you return to old habits of sensual indulgence .
When you do it like this , what happens ?
There wo n’t be any of the fruits of vipassana left by the end of it .
If you go and do all sorts of unskillful things , which disturb and upset the mind , wasting everything , then next year go back again and do another retreat for seven days or a few weeks , then come out and carry on partying and drinking , that is n’t true practice .
It is n’t patipadā or the path to progress .
Insight and Wisdom Wither Away When We Act in Unskillful Ways
So you need to contemplate until you see the harmful effects which come from such behaviour ; this is what is meant by renunciation .
See the harm in drinking and going out on the town .
Reflect and see the harm inherent in all the different kinds of unskillful behaviour which you indulge in , until it becomes fully apparent .
This would provide the impetus for you to take a step back and change your ways .
Then you would find some real peace .
To experience peace of mind you have to clearly see the disadvantages and danger in such forms of behaviour .
This is practising in the correct way .
If you do a silent retreat for seven days , where you do n’t have to speak to or get involved with anybody , and then go chatting , gossiping and overindulging for another seven months , how will you gain any real or lasting benefit from those seven days of meditation ?
I would encourage all the lay people here , who are practising to develop awareness and wisdom , to understand this point .
It is necessary to speak in this way , so that those aspects of the practice which are at fault will become clear to you and accordingly , you will be able to give them up .
You could say that the reason why you have come to practise is to learn how to avoid doing the wrong things in the future .
What happens when you do the wrong things ?
Doing wrong things leads you to agitation and suffering , when there ’s no goodness in the mind .
It ’s not the way to peace of mind .
This is the way it is .
If you practise on a retreat , not talking for seven days , and then go indulging for a few months , no matter how strictly you practised for those seven days , you wo n’t derive any lasting value from that practice .
Practising that way , you do n’t really get anywhere .
Many places where meditation is taught do n’t really get to grips with or get beyond this problem .
Really , you have to conduct your daily life in a consistently calm and restrained way .
This is a form of reminder to you all , so I will ask for your forgiveness .
Some people might feel uneasy and think that I ’m just scolding them .
Really , I ’m not just scolding you for its own sake , I ’m helping to point out where you are going wrong , so that you know .
Some people might just think , “ The old monk is just telling us off ! ” — but it ’s not like that .
It ’s just that you may need reminders , because in meditation you to be consistently turning your attention to the practice .
Please try to practice consistently .
See the disadvantages of practicing inconsistently and insincerely , and try to sustain a dedicated and continuous effort in the practice .
It can then become a realistic possibility that you might put an end to the mental afflictions . ”

I keep meaning to tell you about the awesome mural we painted on Ralph ’s bedroom wall .
I ’m so pleased with how it turned out .
The idea actually started as a wall - size poster of a movie still .
But when I priced out the poster , it was coming in around $ 500 .
More than I wanted to spend .
So I started thinking about other possibilities .
At some point , I recalled helping my mother decorate bulletin boards in my dad ’s classroom when I was a child .
We would project images with an overhead projector and then trace them .
I thought I could try the same technique with wall paint .
So I recruited my mom to do this project with me when she came to visit a few weeks ago .
Why Napoleon Dynamite ?
Well .
Ralph is deeply into all - things - film .
He likes making movies , writing scripts , editing footage , directing , watching movies , studying movies , etc .
But he ’s 12 .
And many of the movie images out there are highly sexualized or hyper- violent — not something we want on the wall of Ralph ’s room .
We wanted something fairly asexual , but still iconic and kid-approved .
Our first thought was the professor from Back to the Future , but then Ralph found this image of Napoleon Dynamite and we knew it was perfect .
The best thing is , there is absolutely no art skill involved in this project .
I mean it .
You could take virtually any photo ( What ?
You do n’t want a giant Jon Heder in your house ?
Weird . ) and paint it on your wall with this technique .
It ’s almost like paint by number .
For reals .
Want to give it a try ?
This is how it went down :
1 ) We found an image we liked :
2 ) We used Photoshop to reduce the image to flat shapes .
Basic steps in Photoshop : make the image grayscale , increase the contrast , then make the image bitmap , with a 50 % threshhold :
3 ) Use a projector to shine the image onto the wall .
Trace the image with a pencil :
4 ) Fill in the shapes you traced with wall paint .
We used a variety of paint brush sizes .
Cheap foam ones to fill in large fields and small , better quality brushes for the details :
And that ’s it .
Instead of $ 500 , the cost was under $ 20 .
Below are a few more pics of the finished room ( and there are even more pics here ) :
Notes :
- The bed we painted in metallic silver ( it used to look like this ) .
The paint was super - fume-y .
So my mother would n’t let my very pregnant self anywhere near it .
- Bedding is from Target .
- We covered the closet doors with chalkboard paint .
- The little metal cube to the left of the bed opens up .
It ’s a little cubby .
Ralph keeps his wallet and watch and ipod in there .
- The nightstand is a metal table with wheels .
It has expandable sides .
We ’ve had it for ages .
We freshened it up with a coat of green paint .
Ralph ’s iPod speaker is on the table .
- The lamp is from HomeGoods .
- Over the window we used Jenny ’s technique to build an inexpensive pelmet box .
What do you think ?
Did we hit the right balance between cool and kid friendly ?
Would your tween approve ?
( Ralph gives it two thumbs up . )
Would you ever try something like this ?
What image would you want on your wall ?

BP admitted it is capturing less oil than initially estimated from the broken well in the Gulf of Mexico yesterday , and the group is ramping up efforts to try yet another scheme to plug the leak .
The mile - long pipe siphoning oil and gas from the broken well for the past eight days is the first successful effort to contain the leak conservatively estimated to be pumping out 5,000 barrels of oil per day .
But since the so - called " riser insertion tube tool " ( RITT ) went into operation it has collected an average of just 1,885 barrels per day , according to the latest statistics – far from the 3,000 barrels estimated last week .
BP says that the amount of escaping hydrocarbons captured by the RITT and shipped to the surface has fluctuated from 1,120 to 3,000 barrels per day because of the erratic behaviour of the well .
Tomorrow BP will move on to its fifth attempt to stem the spill .
The " top kill " operation will pump heavy fluids into the broken well to push down the gas and oil , with a view to sealing the well permanently with a concrete cap ( see box , right ) .
So far the spill has cost BP $ 760 m ( £ 529 m ) , including the response , federal costs , " hardship claims " from businesses and individuals immediately affected and grants to Gulf states .
More than 1,100 vessels are involved in trying to control the spill , some 243,000 barrels of oily liquid have been skimmed from the surface , and nearly 2.5 million ft of floating boom have been deployed .
The fatal explosion on Trans - ocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April has turned a spotlight on safety standards in the US oil industry .
Washington has stressed repeatedly that BP will be financially liable for the full costs of sealing the well and cleaning up the slick , which has already polluted 65 miles of the Louisiana coast .
Ken Salazar , the US Secretary of the Interior , upped the pressure at the weekend , claiming he is " not completely " confident in BP and that the company has missed " deadline after deadline " .
" If we find out they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , " Mr Salazar said .
BP said it was part of a multi-agency team involving several other oil companies , all of whom were doing all they could to solve the problem .
It also yesterday announced a $ 500 m research programme to study the impact of the incident , and the response , on the environment .
Green groups are concerned that the massive use of dispersants to break up the slick may be causing as much damage as the oil .
Industry insiders yesterday dismissed Mr Salazar 's comments at politically motivated .
" BP is doing as well as anyone would have , and everybody is collaborating to help , " one source said .
But investors are increasingly spooked at the open - ended costs BP faces , and the enormous damage to its already fragile reputation in the US .
The group 's share price dropped by another 2.7 per cent yesterday to 493 p , adding up to a collapse of nearly 25 per cent in the month since the explosion , wiping around £ 30bn off the company 's market capitalisation .
This week 's operation will be crucial , says Malcolm Graham - Wood , at Westhouse Securities .
" The top kill is pivotal to what happens next , " he said .
" If it 's a success then the whole thing will become a clean - up operation with clear , albeit high , costs . "
Several City analysts have consistently held that the sell - off of BP 's stock has been overdone .
But if the top kill does not work , the uncertainties facing the company will become a genuine threat .
And with the hurricane season due to start in a couple of weeks , the dangers are multiplying .
" All the bull arguments about BP 's long - term position still stack up at the moment , " Mr Graham - Wood said .
" But a lot of people are starting to say there are other stocks they would rather be in , and if the top kill does n't work then the downside risks start to become more significant . "
Tried and testing : BP 's efforts so far
* Tomorrow , BP will attempt " top kill " , squirting " mud " – the slurry used to cool , lubricate and control the pressure of drilling operations – into the well to suppress the leak and allow it to be capped with concrete .
It may also attempt a " junk shot " – firing pelletised rubber into the well 's network of pipes to seal any small holes and ensure the mud pushes the oil and gas back down into the reservoir .
* The riser insertion tube tool ( RITT ) put in place last week was the first success .
A proportion of the spill is now being sucked up to a ship where the oil is stored and the gas flared off .
* BP is investigating whether the failed " coffer dam " – a large drum placed over the leak so it can be siphoned off – could be more successful now that some oil is being removed by the RITT .
Another possibility is to put a second blow - out preventer ( BOP ) on top of the failed one .
* Two new rigs are already in place and are drilling relief wells to divert the flow .
The plan is guaranteed to work , but such wells take 90 days to drill .
* The first attempt at the coffer dam failed because hydrates formed by the gas reacting with the cold sea water blocked the container before it was even fully lowered over the leak .
* A smaller " top hat " , less prone to blockage , is on the sea floor nearby but has not been used because of the subsequent success of the RITT .
The ancient reptile ( Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis ) that researchers suggest is not a dinosaur likely resembled this early archosaur called Trilophosaurus when alive .
A four - legged weed - whacker of sorts that lived some 230 million years ago just lost its dinosaur affiliation .
While past analyses of this once - dinosaur called Azendohsaurus madagaskarensis were based on its teeth and jaws , the new study relied on the entire skull of the extinct animal discovered in the late 1990s in southwestern Madagascar .
The result suggests A. madagaskarensis is a member of a very early branch on the reptile evolutionary tree .
" Even though this extraordinary ancient reptile looks similar to some plant - eating dinosaurs in some features of the skull and dentition , it is in fact only distantly related to dinosaurs , " said John J. Flynn , curator in the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
" With more complete material , we re-assessed features like the down - turned jaw and leaf - shaped teeth found in A. madagaskarensis as convergent with some herbivorous dinosaurs . "
Convergent evolution refers to the process in which similar adaptations evolve independently in different groups of organisms .
More than a decade ago , scientists published work in the journal Science suggesting this animal was an early dinosaur based on analyses of fossils of teeth and jaws found in 1972 near a village in Morocco 's Atlas Mountains .
The animal was , and still is , considered an archosauromorph , as dinosaurs are a subset of that group .
For example , Dinosauria ( the group to which dinosaurs belong ) is a member of the Archosauria , which is a member of Archosauriformes .
And Archosauriformes are members of the Archosauromorpha group .
Think nested Russian dolls as an analogy , Flynn said , with Archosauromorpha as the largest doll into which the others fit .
With the new evidence , however , the researchers now figure the animal is not a dinosaur but a member of a very early branch of the Archosauromorpha evolutionary tree , or the " ruling lizards . "
The ancient reptile stretched some 6.5 to 13 feet ( 2 to 4 meters ) in length and weighed somewhere between 44 and 110 pounds ( 20 to 50 kilograms ) .
And it was built for munching greens .
Teeth modified for slicing vegetation covered not only its jaws , but also the roof of its mouth .
Though early archosaurs were considered primarily carnivorous , this animal suggests traits linked to herbivory were more widespread across archosaurs , the researchers say .
" Now there are many more cases of herbivorous archosaurs , " said researcher André Wyss , professor at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
" We are rethinking the evolution of diet and feeding strategies , as well as the broader evolution of the group . "
The research , detailed in the journal Palaeontology , was funded by the National Geographic Society , The Field Museum , American Museum of Natural History , the University of California Santa Barbara , and Worldwide Fund for Nature , Madagascar .
Solid - state drives ( SSD ) have been among the hottest hardware products for more than two years , with a good deal of uptake within the consumer PC , notebook and netbook markets in response to a precipitous drop in pricing in 2007 and 2008 .
The fabricators of NAND flash chips , which are used to build SSDs , took a bath for more than a year beginning in 2007 , even losing money on the products they sold .
Pricing for NAND flash dropped as much as 60 % year over year in 2007 and 2008 .
" There was a definite oversupply of NAND .
The problem was no one was making money in NAND or the memory industry at that point , " says Steve Weinger , director of NAND flash marketing at Samsung , the industry 's largest producer of NAND flash chips .
After the first quarter of 2009 , however , SSD pricing leveled off and even increased as the economy forced NAND flash manufacturers to stop investing in new equipment and demand outstripped supply .
Research firm iSuppli Corp. says surging NAND flash prices last year hurt what was a booming SSD market .
The price of a flash memory chips rose to $ 4.10 in the second quarter of last year , representing a $ 1.80 , or 127 % , increase from the final quarter of 2008 .
Now , pricing is expected to flat - line until next year , when NAND flash chip fabricators will be able to reinvest their profits to ramp up production and begin selling higher - density products , industry experts say .
Where SSDs are used
SSDs were originally aimed at enterprise - class environments , with the highest quality single - level cell ( SLC ) NAND flash chips being used to ensure the highest performance and reliability .
However , today , multi - level cell ( MLC ) NAND flash , which stores more than 1 bit of data per cell and therefore offers higher capacities , is approaching the same performance and reliability as SLC through the use of special firmware in the drive 's controller .
The performance advantage for SSDs in the data center is tremendous .
A single SSD , for example , can produce up to 16,000 input / output operations per second ( IOPS ) .
In comparison , a high - end 15,000 - rpm Fibre Channel drive maxes out at 200 IOPS .
" You can replace 10 , 20 -- I 've even heard of 30 -- spinning disk drives , with a single SSD , " says Dean Klein , vice president of memory system development at Micron Corp. , a fabricator of NAND flash memory chips and SSDs .
But you pay a price for that performance .
The cost of enterprise - class SSDs can be as low as $ 350 , for a Micron realSSD C300 consumer drive that can be used in a server , or as high as $ 7,000 , for an storage array - class drive , Klein says .
It all depends on the features and performance you want .
For mainstream consumers , SSDs also vastly outpace hard disk drives when it comes to performance .
In many cases , they have more than twice the I / Os per second , dramatically reducing computer boot - up times and application load times .
And , because there are no moving parts -- no actuator arms or motors -- SSDs are more durable and therefore may be better choices for mobile devices .
But lately , with the increase and subsequent stabilization of SSD prices , the benefits of SSDs have largely been lost on consumers who are more attracted to a hard disk drive 's higher capacity and lower price .
" The problem today is prices are prohibitively high for the average consumer , " says Gartner analyst Joseph Unsworth .
" When you consider a hard drive , you can get a terabyte for about $ 90 .
If you look at an SSD -- the Intel one I had with 160GB was $ 400 .
The point here is SSDs will never , ever be able to match hard disk drives on price per gigabyte . "
Unsworth says that , for consumers , the decision to buy an SSD rather than a hard disk drive with greater capacity will come down to understanding and being able to justify the higher cost of an SSD .
In other words , they must be able to appreciate " the performance , the boot time , the application acceleration , the reliability aspects and the slightly better power efficiency " of a solid - state drive , he says .
Online retail sales represent 40 % of all SSD purchases today , Unsworth says .
The people who are buying SSDs online are mostly tech savvy gamers or professional IT workers who shop at sites like Newegg.com , Amazon.com and Pricegrabber.com .
The pricier drives give them superior performance for higher - end PCs and laptops .
The other market for SSDs is made up of equipment manufacturers ; laptop and netbook vendors such as Lenovo , Dell and Hewlett - Packard are purchasing them for use in their consumer products .
But sales of SSDs in that market are by no means booming .
" There have been 6.5 million consumer PC and notebook products sold with SSDs , " Unsworth says .
" That 's far from widespread . "
" The demand on the [ equipment manufacturer ] side is at present modest .
It 's behind everyone 's forecast , " Klein adds .
Last year , about 2.2 million SSDs sold in the netbook market , while 2.3 million were sold for use in notebooks and 316,000 were sold for servers , Gartner says .
This year , those numbers will double in some cases .
Gartner predicts that in 2010 , 3.6 million SSDs will be sold in the notebook market , 6.4 million in the desktop market and 819,000 in the server market .
Revenue is also expected to more than double for SSD vendors .
In 2009 , consumer and enterprise SSD sales reached $ 1.3 billion .
This year , sales are expected to hit $ 2.9 billion , Unsworth says .
" We expect revenue to double in the consumer space and triple in the enterprise space , " he says .
Gregory Wong , an analyst at Forward Insights , believes that for PC , notebook and netbook manufacturers , SSD prices will drop from about $ 1.90 per gigabyte today to about $ 1.70 .
Online shoppers should n't see any marked decrease in pricing and can expect to continue to pay $ 3.00 to $ 3.30 per gigabyte on sites like Newegg.com .
Compared with hard drives , which cost about 30 cents per gigabyte , SSDs are 10 times more expensive , says Wong .
But there 's a crossover point where the base cost of a hard drive -- about $ 40 -- would buy an SSD with about 16 GB of capacity .
The lower - capacity SSDs could be used to run a PC 's operating system and key applications , while files could be stored on a secondary internal or external hard disk drive .
A bright spot
The SSDs that are experiencing stronger sales today are low - capacity models that are purchased for use as " boot drives . "
Most such drives offer between 40 GB and 64GB of capacity and cost about $ 100 .
Last month , vendors such as Intel and OCZ began releasing lower - capacity SSDs , betting that enthusiasts would purchase them as boot drives .
Kingston sells a 30 GB SSD and Corsair and OCZ have 32 GB products .
" It 's really about performance , " Unsworth says .
" They add an external hard drive with half a terabyte , a terabyte or more that 's used for backup or as their video library , their multimedia library , etc . "
Driving prices down
For SSDs to become more affordable -- and for manufacturers to drop their prices -- NAND flash fabricators must cut their prices first .
" We 've come through the worst downturn this industry has every seen , " Klein says .
" It has n't really been until the last two quarters that we 've been showing a recovery .
People may object to the memory guys finally making some money , but frankly this is what allows us to build for their future .
This is what allows us to start ramping up our Singapore [ fabrication facility ] . "
Ultimately , only an increase in production will drive SSD prices down , and that is n't expected to begin until 2011 , say Klein and others .
Until that time , prices may dip somewhat as NAND flash manufacturers begin selling higher density flash chips based on lithography technologies that will drop below 30 nanometers in size .
Lithography is the process of creating cells and transistors in silicon , which are used to store bits of data .
The smaller they are , the more data can be fit on a single NAND flash chip .
At 25nm , the cells in silicon are 3,000 times thinner than a strand of human hair .
But at that level , inter -cell electrical interference becomes a tougher obstacle to tackle .
Today , most manufacturers are using lithography in the 30nm to 40nm range .
Micron , Intel and Samsung are using 34nm ; Toshiba is using 32nm .
By moving to 25nm technology , manufacturers can double the number of bits stored on a wafer .
Micron and Intel have both announced that they 'll be shipping 25nm products later this year .
South Korea 's Hynix Semiconductor plans to use 26nm manufacturing .
Samsung plans a 27nm chip and Toshiba is moving to a 24nm chip .
And , here 's the best news of all : Consumers will be the first to get the new SSD technology through the online retail channel , Unsworth says .
" If they 're going to use that finer process ... for PC manufacturers , that requires a qualification time , " Unsworth says .
" They need to test them and make sure the SSDs [ are durable ] , and make sure they do n't get those calls from consumers , because that 's who'll be calling [ the PC and notebook ] vendors . "

Ford Kills Mercury – An End of an Era
Image via Wikipedia
Ford CEO
Alan Mulally has convinced members of the Ford family to let him kill off one of the company ’s oldest brands , the 71 - year - old Mercury .
Mulally will soon seek official approval from Ford ’s board to pull the plug , sources tell the Wall Street Journal .
Mercury was created in 1939 by Edsel Ford , as a step between cheaper Ford models and pricey Lincolns , but it lost its identity over the years :
By the ’ 80s , Mercury models were little more than Fords outfitted with different grilles and tail lights .
With sales in a sharp tailspin — only 92,299 were sold last year , down from 359,143 in 2000 — Mulally decided to consign the brand , to the scrapheap .
Mercury , which currently has only two models , the Milan and the Mariner , “ is a brand that has lost its meaning in the American automotive marketplace , ” says Edmunds.com ‘s CEO , “ and it is n’t worth trying to change that . ”

London , England ( CNN ) --
A man charged with the murders of three women who worked as prostitutes in northern England called himself " the Crossbow Cannibal " when asked to give his name in court Friday , the court said .
Stephen Griffiths , 40 , appeared in Bradford Magistrates Court in Bradford , about 200 miles north of London .
He was arrested Monday on suspicion of the murder of Suzanne Blamires , 36 , who went missing on Friday , West Yorkshire police said .
Griffiths is now charged with her murder and those of Shelley Armitage , 31 , who went missing in April , and Susan Rushworth , 43 , missing since June 2009 , the court said .
Authorities have not given the official cause of death for the women .
The case kicked off this week after police found human remains in a river in Shipley , just north of Bradford .
Police later confirmed the remains were those of Blamires .
Griffiths is a student at the University of Bradford , where he was studying for a Ph.D. in local history , said Vice Chancellor Mark Cleary .
Britain's Press Association said there were stunned looks throughout the courtroom after Griffiths called himself " the Crossbow Cannibal , " and that someone in the public gallery gasped .
There were about 40 people in the packed courtroom , including eight family members of the alleged victims , the Press Association said .
Others included journalists and detectives .
CNN 's Bharati Naik and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report .
Militants struck back , hitting the military ’s headquarters in Rawalpindi , a mosque where military families prayed , and the offices of Pakistan ’s intelligence agencies in three cities .
The number of Pakistani civilians killed last year in Taliban attacks exceeded civilian deaths even in Afghanistan , helping shift public opinion against the militants .
“ I think it has become very dramatic that these people are out after them , ” the diplomat said .
The fighting — coupled with intense American drone strikes in the western tribal region — has splintered the militant groups , which are now a poisonous mix of Pashtun tribesmen , Arabs , Uzbeks and ethnic Punjabis , known for their brutality against Shiites and their close links to Al Qaeda .
The fracturing is so profound that one Pakistani government official in the tribal region said that the Pakistani Taliban now consisted of several parts operating independently , and that the groups “ do not necessarily take orders from Hakimullah Mehsud . ”
But the widening military campaign has also given them common cause .
Operations by the militants have become more fluid .
“ All these groups are helping each other out and selling their services to the highest bidder , ” the diplomat said .
Pakistani officials recognize that the evolving nature of the militants has made them more dangerous — and made the necessity of going after them in North Waziristan increasingly unavoidable .
“ Their nexus with the Punjabi Taliban have given them greater reach , ” a Pakistani law enforcement official said .
But even as there is a growing consensus that North Waziristan is now the source of the problem , there is a continuing debate in the military over when and how to tackle it .
Publicly the Pakistani military is saying that it is already fighting on several fronts , and that it does not have the resources to push into North Waziristan for at least several months .
Western officials say they believe that the Pakistani military is doing as much as it can under the circumstances .
There is also an understanding that opening a new front in North Waziristan — with its tangle of tribes , Qaeda militants , antistate groups and Haqqani supporters , thought to be in the thousands — will be a formidable task .
“ To go after Haqqani , it takes a very sizable military operation , ” the diplomat said .
But some officials say an operation could come sooner , not least because officers on the ground are calling for it .
More frequent attacks emanating from North Waziristan “ are likely to lead to a reaction sooner rather than later as field commanders feel the pressure to protect their troops , ” said Shuja Nawaz , director of the South Asia program at the Atlantic Council in Washington .
Take Portland - based Icon Rainbow ( @iconrainbow ) , a new project that analyzes iPhone app icon colors and tells you which colors are currently the most popular .
[ HTML1 ]
One of the things I love most about this whole Web thing is that if you take creative people and give them access to data ?
They ’ll come up with some pretty interesting ways to munge that data and represent it in really beautiful ways .
Take Portland - based Icon Rainbow ( @iconrainbow ) , a new project from Ryan Snyder ( @ryansnyder ) and Crystal Beasley ( @skinny ) that analyzes iPhone app icon colors and tells you which colors are currently the most popular .
The Icon Rainbow ( @iconrainbow ) is a color analyzer for iPhone app icons .
In the first iteration , we fetched a subset of iPhone app icons and grabbed the color for every single pixel in each of the images .
We then determined which colors were most prominent in each app ’s icon , in each app category , and also in the entire icon subset .
And what they ’ve found might surprise you .
Like the fact that blue is not the most popular color — at least in the initial subset they ’ve chosen .
Beige is , currently .
I hear taupe is very soothing .
But it ’s more than a list .
Not only does Icon Rainbow allow you to see the top colors overall , it allows you to slice and dice the list by application type .
Need more detail ?
Clicking on any color takes you on a deep dive to see a swath of the app icons that employ that color , all the types of applications that use it , and the color ’s popularity by app type .
More visually oriented ?
You ’re going to love Icon Rainbow ’s spectrum menu .
No .
I mean , really .
Just click on any of the colors running along the top of the site and you ’ll jump directly to the details on that particular color .
Or just randomly click along to get a smattering of interesting colors and apps .
But what about the converse ?
I mean , what if you want to know which colors appear in a particular icon ?
No worries .
They ’ve got you covered .
Simply click on any icon and you ’ll get a listing of all the colors in the icon , the name of the app , and the category in which it falls .
Then , of course , you can dive into each of those colors separately .
That ’s right .
Completely awesome time sink .
And not bad for two days of effort .
But so what ?
What ’s the utility ?
Well , there are several ways you could use it .
Especially if you ’re designing iPhone apps .
What if you want an icon that stands out from the majority ?
Well , you could look for some of the least used colors in Icon Rainbow and choose those for your icon .
What if you see an icon that really seems to work ?
You can use Icon Rainbow to determine the HEX values that the icon employs — and maybe emulate that palette yourself .
Or you could exercise your mouse finger by just sitting there clicking and clicking and clicking like me .
I like shiny objects .
So sue me .
Even if you could n’t care less about iPhone or iPad apps , Icon Rainbow is well worth some of your time — if only to see a beautiful representation of an incredibly interesting data set .
For more information or to try it yourself , visit Icon Rainbow .
But be forewarned , you ’re going to get sucked into it .
So go ahead .
Get your HEX on .

Reader Avner Ronen compares the Snakes on a Plane phenomenon with what happened to Serenity .
He notes :
I 'm looking forward to this movie as much as the next net.geek , but I do n't expect as much of a box - office surprise as many seem to be anticipating , because I 've seen it before .
What am I referring to ?
Serenity .
It would be hard to beat the online buzz Serenity was getting , and sometimes it seems like it 's difficult to find a blogger who is n't a fan of the prematurely cancelled series Firefly , but all of that buzz and a good deal of critical acclaim still could n't get people into the theaters .
He may well be right - it is very easy living at the hub of digital culture to imagine that all of the buzz we are hearing is generalizable across the population as a whole .
But let 's look for a moment at what happened with Firefly / Serenity and then , I will try to explain why I think Snakes on a Plane is in a somewhat different situation .
Praise Be the Whedon
Let 's be clear that I am a big fan of Firefly and of Joss Whedon 's other work in television and in comics .
I think he's one of the smartest and most creative people operating within the media industry today .
He has enormous respect for his fans and he has earned our respect in return .
He had constructed a television series he really believed in .
He was watching a very dedicated , very resourceful fan community form around a television series which either got canceled because a ) the ratings were low and it was not seen as having a broad general appeal or b) the ratings were low because the network had not successfully targeted its most likely audiences and given it a chance to develop the word of mouth needed to expand its core viewership .
We may never know which of these explanations is the correct one - I suspect some combination of the two .
Whedon still wanted to produce the content ; there was a group of people clammering for the content ; but the networks did n't think there 's a large enough audience to sustain a prime time broadcast series .
This is a situation we 've seen again and again in the history of broadcast media .
I think it 's about time we rewrote the rules .
Serenity and the Long Tail
We are now in the space which Chris Anderson has documented so well in his discussion of the Long Tail .
In Anderson 's account , media properties can succeed by appealing to niche rather than mass audiences if you can lower costs of production , publicity , and distribution , keep the content on the market long enough for consumer interest to grow , and count on the most passionate consumers to help spread the word about your brand .
By those criteria , Firefly should be as close to a natural for the Long Tail as anything produced for television so far and the brisk sales and rentals of the dvds of the original episodes illustrated that point pretty well .
But Whedon got greedy - or someone got greedy on his behalf - and Firefly moved the wrong direction up Anderson 's Long Tail - towards a blockbuster Hollywood movie which would have required even more viewers to be seen as successful than would have been required to keep the series on the air on a second tier network .
Yes , it was way cool to watch those characters up there on the big screen but Whedon set the bar much too high for the existing market for his property and we all paid a price for his hubris .
To make something that felt like a movie , he had to produce something that did n't feel like a television episode , creating a story that turned the world of the series upside down .
Along the way , he killed off some of the most beloved characters and lost some of the elements which many of us liked about Firefly in the first place .
At the same time , he compressed a season 's worth of plot developments into two hours or so of screentime with the result that he produced a work that was confusing to many first time viewers and that lacked the gradual character development that was the hallmark of Firefly .
I still liked a lot about the movie but what I did n't like was the fact that it would seem to have pretty much closed the door to further development in the Firefly franchise -- at least in the foreseeable future .
The Road Not Taken
Imagine , instead , that he had moved in the other direction down the tail , towards the production of television style episodes directly for dvd .
I 've discussed such a system in relation to Global Frequency ( a show that suffered an even more premature death than Firefly -- canceled before it even reached the air ) .
CMS graduate student Ivan Askwith has advocated the use of the video ipod as a distribution platform for essentially long tail television .
We have seen fan groups advocating such an approach for recently canceled series such as The West Wing and Arrested Development .
From the perspective of a producer like Whedon , who has a strong and existing fan base , this should be a very attractive proposition - make as many episodes as you want in whatever story structure you want with no risk that a network will stand between you and your audience , start making money as soon as the first product ships rather than waiting for syndication to turn a profit .
What would make it even more attractive would be to create a subscription based model so that readers paid in advance for episodes they wanted to see and they knew more or less what the core market was before production started .
This would be hard to arrange for a totally new property : easier for a canceled series or for a show by a brand - name creator like Whedon .
I 'd pay now to guarantee access to original content by Whedon , sight unseen , a year from now .
So would most of the other brown coats , I would bet .
And if he had gone that route , we would have been able to enjoy many more hours of quality science fiction / western action on television , where it belongs , instead of burning up the whole franchise in two hours of big screen excitement .
Yes , there are risks involved -- if for no other reason than because no television show has ever made this transition into direct to dvd production .
We can point to the example of a growing number of Disney animated features which have generated direct to DVD sequels with a fair amount of success with their core market .
But the risks involved would have been lower -- financially at least -- than trying to turn a failed television series into a Hollywood blockbuster .
Whedon could have done it if anyone could and if he had , a lot of other television producers would have followed his example .
What About Snakes ?
Serenity had one of the most committed fan bases in media history and they would have followed Whedon anywhere but they were n't enough on their own to make a success on the tall end of the Long Tail .
They needed to draw in lots of non-fans of the franchise .
We might imagine that non-fans were resistant to the film now for many of the same reasons that they were resistant to the original series and we can add one more factor : they were reluctant to jump onto a film they knew was based on a series that they had n't seen because they were afraid they were going to be lost .
Whedon worked hard to make the film accessible and we were told he was going to do so , but guess what , lots of folks did n't believe him .
So , if we follow the logic of the Long Tail , success on one end of the tail depends on deep commitments from a relatively narrow fan base ( that 's what Firefly had ) and on the other end , on superficial commitments from a broader range of viewers ( and that 's what Snakes on a Plane has . )
I doubt anyone really has the same level of passion for Snakes as they have for Firefly .
It 's a fun lark -- a one night stand , a vacation movie romance .
But it is n't a once in a lifetime passion .
But that 's okay .
What 's bad / good about the concept is something anyone can quickly grasp .
You hear the title and you chuckle .
You see the preview and you are hooked -- or not .
You do n't need to have seen another media product to consume this one .
There 's a star - Jackson - with some box office reputation - remember , Serenity had no stars except those who were in the television series .
It 's got some draw as a straight out peddle to the metal action film with a good leading actor and some appeal as the best example of camp and kitsch to hit the screen in some time .
Those are good reasons to think the film will have a broader appeal than Serenity - even if , especially if , it is nowhere near as good a movie .
Whedon bet that his fan followers could tell the public to turn out at the multiplex to see his movie .
The producers of Snakes have used the audience to tell them how to market this movie and then have applied the capacity of a major publicity campaign to amplify that approach towards the general audience .
